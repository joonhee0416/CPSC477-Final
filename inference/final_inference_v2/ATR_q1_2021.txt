 2021 Aptar Earnings Call Summary

Aptar, Inc. reported strong results for the first quarter of 2021, with adjusted EBITDA margin comparable to the prior year, despite a mix shift within the pharma segment and relative mix across the three segments. The company's food and beverage segment delivered a stellar performance, driven by strong demand for innovative food dispensing closures, while the beverage market showed modest growth. In the pharma segment, increased demand for injectable components, including those for COVID-19 vaccine distributions, offset declines in the prescription drug and consumer healthcare markets. Aptar's beauty and home segment experienced a 3% decrease in core sales, primarily due to continued localized lockdowns in Europe and global travel restrictions. The company's outlook for the second quarter of 2021 expects current underlying demand conditions in most of its markets to remain relatively stable, with easier comparisons in some markets, including beauty. Aptar's balance sheet remains strong, with a leverage ratio of 1.4 and a gross capital of approximately 37%. The company continues to invest in innovative growth projects and is confirming its forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million. Aptar's commitment to sustainability and innovation has allowed it to maintain its strong focus on research and development, and the new innovations that allow it to help its customers grow their own businesses.
