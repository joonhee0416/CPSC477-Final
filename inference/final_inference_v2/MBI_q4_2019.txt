During the 2019, the company was able to resolve and extinguish its COFINA exposure, which accounted for approximately half of its total insured Puerto Rico debt service.

# 2

The remaining Puerto Rico exposure is largely comprised of three Puerto Rico credits: the Commonwealth pre-2011 General Obligation PBA bonds; the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or PREPA; and the Puerto Rico Highways & Transportation Authority or HTA.

# 3

There is a restructuring support agreement for the PREPA bonds that has been approved by the Federal Oversight Management Board in over 90% of the PREPA creditors.

# 4

The court hearing for the related 9019 motion is scheduled for June.

# 5

Governor Vazquez and the Puerto Rico Legislature have stated publicly that they do not support the agreement.

# 6

There is also a planned support agreement between the Oversight Board and a group of Commonwealth bondholders, representing approximately 54% of the par amount.

# 7

The company and the other monolines do not support the proposed agreement and neither does the Commonwealth government.

# 8

As yet, there are no specific agreements related to the HTA debt.

# 9

The GO plan of adjustment does include some proposed payments to the credit, such as HTA, that have callback rights against the Commonwealth.

# 10

The company will pursue these rights through the court process.

# 11

The other credit in National's insurance portfolio continue to perform in line with our expectations, and the outstanding par of the insured portfolio continues to reduce each quarter.
