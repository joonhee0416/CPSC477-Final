 2020 Earnings Call Summary

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Greenhill reported revenue of $140.7 million, an operating margin of 57%, and net income of $2.71 per share. This was the firm's best quarterly performance ever and exceeded analyst consensus forecasts for the quarter and the next four quarters combined. The strong quarter was driven by multiple M&A completion fees, restructuring completion fees, and a long list of smaller fees. The company also benefited from accounting rules that require revenue from completion fees to be booked before the transaction triggering that fee is fully completed.

Looking ahead, Greenhill expects to see nearly all of the areas that were heavily impacted by the pandemic poised for significant improvement in 2021. The firm's private capital advisory business made a meaningful contribution in 2020, but it was considerably less so than in the prior year. Greenhill's strategy is to increase the scale, diversity, and consistency of its revenue sources while maintaining appropriate discipline on expenses. The company plans to recruit M&A bankers who bring incremental industry sector expertise or regional capabilities and expand its restructuring advisory team. Greenhill also aims to enhance its focus on advising financial sponsors on a wide variety of transactions.

In conclusion, Greenhill had a very strong finish to the year, resulting in very respectable pandemic year results on the top and bottom line. The firm's strong quarter was not simply a matter of transaction timing, and its profit in one quarter exceeded what was expected for five quarters. Greenhill expects to generate meaningful revenue growth in 2021, driven by increased deal activity, increased M&A revenue in most of its international offices, and increased restructuring activity. The company also expects to see significant opportunity to advise on various kinds of debt
