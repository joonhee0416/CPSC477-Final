 2020 Q4 Earnings Call Summary

Chemed, Inc. reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020. The company's two business segments, VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter, continued to operate safely during the pandemic, with VITAS showing incredible speed and flexibility to remain open. The federal government provided pragmatic flexibility in caring for patients, and certain portions of the healthcare continuum normalized. Despite this, VITAS' average daily census declined 2.8% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to disruption in senior housing, which includes nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Roto-Rooter forecasted 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 estimated to be 26%. Chemed's 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock option exercises, cost related to litigation and other discrete items is estimated to be in the range of $17 to $17.50.
