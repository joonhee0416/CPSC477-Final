 

Applied reported its second quarter earnings, which were characterized by cost discipline, margin control, and solid cash generation within a weak end market backdrop. The company's leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control, and automation put it in a unique position to capture greater share organically and through M&A. Applied's strategy is focused on accelerating its company-specific out growth potential and expanding the reach of its fluid power, flow control, consumables, and automation solutions across its embedded service center network customer base. The company entered the second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post its acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to its stated target of 2.5 times. Applied paid down $5 million of outstanding debt during the quarter.

Applied's guidance assumes end market weakness seen during December and January continues in coming months with seasonal Q3 sales step up at the lower end of historical trends. By segment, the company's guidance assumes mid-to low-single digit organic declines year-over-year in its service center segment during the second half and low-single digit organic declines in its Fluid Power and Flow Control segment. The company's guidance also assumes gross margins are flat to up 10 basis points for the full year, slightly below its prior guidance of up 10 basis points to 20 basis points. Applied reaffirms its free cash flow outlook of $200 million to $220 million, which represents a 30% increase of its fiscal 2019 at the midpoint.
