Jabil's cash flows and balance sheet also showed strength, with inventory days coming in at 66 days, a decline of five days sequentially. Looking ahead, Jabil has increased its core earnings per share forecast for the year to $6.55, up from its September outlook, and is committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million. The company's purpose-driven approach to business is highlighted by its focus on keeping people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and giving back to the community.
