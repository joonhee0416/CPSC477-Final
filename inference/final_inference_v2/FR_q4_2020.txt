 2020 Earnings Call Summary

The FR team executed the plan and performed admirably in 2020, generating outstanding results for shareholders despite the challenging operating environment. The portfolio performance was strong, with high occupancy levels, growth in cash rents, and collection of over 99% of build rents. The fourth quarter was particularly strong, with year-end occupancy of 95.7%, up 70 basis points from the guidance midpoint provided on the third quarter call. The positive fourth quarter leasing statistics nationally are consistent with the company's own experience, with CBRE's preliminary figure for net absorption being 104 million square feet, the highest quarterly result in the last four years. The company expects to capitalize on its current land holdings and new acquisitions in 2021 to generate more growth and value creation. The team is focused on making progress in realizing the three-year cash flow growth opportunity laid out at the Investor Day. The company has signed leases for approximately 54% of its 2021 rollovers and a cash rental rate increase of approximately 13%. The expirations for the balance of 2021 are fairly granular, with the largest remaining rollover now a 400,000 square footer where the tenant is expected to vacate in May. The company has signed leases for 100% of the three-building First Cypress Creek Commerce Center with a single e-commerce tenant and a total investment of $37.1 million. In the Inland Empire, the company signed and commenced leases for both the 358,000 and the 72,000 square foot facilities in the fourth quarter, and just this week, fully leased the remaining 44,000 square foot
