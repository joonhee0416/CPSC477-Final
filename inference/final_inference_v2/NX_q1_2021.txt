 

Quanex Corporation reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021, with revenue increasing by 17.1% compared to the same period last year. Net income increased by 55.4% to $24.3 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points. The company expects to achieve approximately 12% sales growth in its North American fenestration segment, approximately 5% sales growth in its North American cabinet components segment, and approximately 22% sales growth in its European fenestration segment. The company's European fenestration segment is expected to generate the strongest revenue growth and margin expansion in Q2, as its plants in the U.K. were shut down in March of last year and didn't come back online until much later. The company is focused on managing working capital and generating cash as the year progresses, and is opportunistic with respect to repurchasing its stock.
