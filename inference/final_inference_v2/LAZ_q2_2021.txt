 2021 Lazard Earnings Call Summary

Lazard reported record operating revenue for the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by strong results across the firm.

The Global Private Capital Advisory franchise had a strong quarter, serving financial sponsors with new fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions. Asset Management operating revenue reached an all-time high for the quarter and first half of the year, driven by management fees on a larger base of assets under management, as well as strong incentive fees, primarily from European equity strategies.
