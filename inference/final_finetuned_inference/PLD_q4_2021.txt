 2021 Recap and Outlook for 2022

Prologis had a record-setting year in 2021, with core FFO of $4.15 per share and net promote earnings of $0.06. The company's net effective rent change on rollover accelerated to 33%, up 510 basis points sequentially, and average occupancy was 97.4%. Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year.

Prologis' strategic capital business continues to drive tremendous growth in value. In Q4, the company completed the early wind-up of its UKLV venture, contributing $1.7 billion of operating assets to its PELF and PELP Ventures. For the year, the company raised $4.4 billion of third-party equity and had a record $4 billion of equity at year-end.

Development starts totaled $3.6 billion with margins of 32%, and stabilizations totaled $2.5 billion with estimated value creation of $1.3 billion and an average margin of 53%. Realized development gains were $817 million for the year, also an all-time high.

Looking ahead to 2022, Prologis expects cash same-store NOI growth to range between 6% and 7%, average occupancy to range between 96.5% to 97.5%, and rent growth in its markets to be 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally. The company forecasts strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $540 million and $560 million and net promote income of $0.55 per share for the year.

Prologis' strong organic growth and high-margin business generate very durable fee streams with asset management fees marked to fair values each quarter, requiring minimal capital. The company has a long development runway of $26 billion, much of which comes from its international opportunity set, positioning it for continued strong value creation well into the future.
