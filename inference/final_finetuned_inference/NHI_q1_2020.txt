NHI, a senior housing and skilled nursing operator, is deeply grateful to front-line heroes for their efforts in combating COVID-19. The company is committed to transparency with the investment community and has enhanced occupancy disclosure on Bickford, Holiday and Senior Living Communities. NHI has limited visibility to the financial impact of COVID-19 and has withdrawn its previously issued 2020 guidance.
