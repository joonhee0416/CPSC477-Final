 

Lazard reported record operating revenue for the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by strong results across the firm. Financial advisory revenue increased 61% from last year's period, reflecting broad-based activity across sectors, market cap, and regions. The Global Private Capital Advisory franchise had a strong quarter, serving financial sponsors with new fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions. Asset Management operating revenue reached an all-time high for the quarter and first half of the year, driven by management fees on a larger base of assets under management and strong incentive fees, primarily from European equity strategies. The firm continues to invest in people, technology, and its distribution effort, as well as the development of new and existing funds and the scaling up of its platforms. Lazard expects that its Financial Advisory revenue in the second half of 2021 will be higher than the first half, assuming current macroeconomic conditions.
