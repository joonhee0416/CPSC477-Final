"1 Q1 Earnings Call Summary

Jabil reported strong results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with $400 million of core operating income on $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The team was able to achieve these results despite the chaotic global supply chain environment. The strong quarter was driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and mobility. The procurement and supply chain team highlighted that demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, and that Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize its allocation and keep the factories in production to the best of its ability. The company expects continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated into its guidance similar to previous quarters. The company's revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter. GAAP operating income was $350 million, and its GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63.
