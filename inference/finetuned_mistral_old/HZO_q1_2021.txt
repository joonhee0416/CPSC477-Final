"n the first quarter of 2021, MarineMax reported record results that exceeded expectations, with strong growth in same-store sales and new unit growth. The company's gross margin expanded due to increased product margins, growth in storage and service businesses, and focused expense management. The acquisition of SkipperBud's and its affiliate Silver Seas Yacht added 20 locations and expanded the company's reach. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a current ratio of 1.74 and a total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio of 1.42.

Looking ahead, the company expects to achieve high single-digit same-store sales growth in 2021, driven by strong industry trends and the company's ability to outperform the industry. The company also expects to achieve modest operating leverage improvement above its previous guidance, with earnings per share guidance in the range of $4 to $4.20 for 2021. The company remains focused on building its strong team culture, executing on its growth strategy, and creating long-term shareholder value."
