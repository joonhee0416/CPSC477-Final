"0 Q2 Earnings Call Summary

In the second quarter of 2020, Applied continued to focus on cost discipline, margin control, and solid cash generation within a weak end market backdrop. The company's leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control, and automation provide a unique opportunity to capture greater share organically and through M&A. Applied is also focused on expanding the reach of its fluid power, flow control, consumables, and automation solutions across its embedded service center network customer base.

The company entered the second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post its acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to its stated target of 2.5 times. Applied has notable flexibility for additional deleveraging, acquisitions, and pursuing other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns in the back half of its fiscal year.

Regarding the broader end market backdrop, demand remains weak across Applied's top industry verticals, with organic sales trending down in the mid-single digits year-"
