 2020 Earnings Call Transcript Summary

The transcript highlights the impact of COVID-19 on the senior housing and skilled nursing industry. The operators have done a commendable job in limiting the spread of the virus, but it has resulted in a significant downturn in inquiries, tours, and move-ins, leading to a negative impact on occupancy. The cost side of the equation has also increased due to additional labor and PPE expenses, pressuring the operators' margins. The company has received 99.7% of its contractual rent in April and collected approximately 94% in May, in line with expectations. NHI is committed to transparency with the investment community and has enhanced occupancy disclosure on its websites. The company has limited visibility to the financial impact of COVID-19 and has withdrawn its previously issued 2020 guidance. The dividend policy is still being considered, and the Board is committed to it. The company's net income per diluted common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, was $1.37, and its three FFO performance metrics increased by 3.1%, 3.8%, and 5.7%, respectively. The company has had some challenges in the senior housing and skilled nursing portfolio, with a decline in occupancy in independent living, assisted living, and senior living communities.
