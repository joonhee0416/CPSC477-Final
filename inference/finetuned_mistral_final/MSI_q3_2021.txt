 2021 Q3 Earnings Call Summary

The company reported strong Q3 results, with revenue growth of 13%, earnings per share growth of 21%, and operating margins expansion of 150 basis points. All three technologies, LMR, video security and access control, and Command Center Software, saw strong growth. The company raised its full-year guidance for both sales and EPS based on the strong Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the year.

The Products and Systems segment saw record Q3 sales, operating earnings, and earnings per share, driven by LMR and video security demand. The supply chain constraints impacted the LMR business, particularly the PCR business, and the company expects this to continue in Q4. The software and services segment saw strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improved profitability. The company expects the operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment.

The company's strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides significant demand visibility. The company is expanding its relationships within its existing installed base to provide more software and services. The customer funding is as good as the company has seen it, and its NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for its fixed video solutions.

The company expects the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next
