 

Graham Corporation reported its fiscal 2021 second quarter results, with sales increasing to $28 million from $21.6 million in the same quarter last year. The company's defense market accounted for $9.4 million in revenue, with a quick turn material order making up approximately half of the revenue in the Navy market. The quarter's net income was $2.7 million, up from $1.2 million last year, due to stronger revenue and margins. The company's backlog improved to $114.9 million, and the conversion of a portion of the backlog provides the foundation for improved guidance for the fiscal year. The company expects revenue for the second half of the year to be between $48 million and $52 million, with a gross margin of between 21% and 23%.
