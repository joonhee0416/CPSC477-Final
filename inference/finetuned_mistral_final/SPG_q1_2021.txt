 2021 Taubman Center Earnings Call Summary

Taubman Center reported its first-quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2021. The company's operating capacity was reduced due to governmental orders and restrictions, resulting in a decline in occupancy and revenue. However, the company's profitability and cash flow improved significantly compared to the previous quarter, driven by strong sales and leasing momentum.

The company's mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 90.8%, down 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The average base rent was $56.07, up 60 basis points year over year. Leasing spreads declined for the 12-month period, primarily due to the mix of deals that have fallen out, resulting in an increase to the average closing rate by approximately $8 per square foot.

Taubman Center signed 1,100 leases for approximately 4.4 million square feet, and has significant leases in its pipeline. The improving domestic economic environment, shopper sentiment, and increased shopper foot traffic and sales across the portfolio have also contributed to the company's performance.

The company has also been able to add significant value to its global brands within SPARC and JCPenney investments.
