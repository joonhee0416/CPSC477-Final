 2020 Earnings Call Summary for Chemed Corporation

The transcript discusses the financial performance of Chemed Corporation's two business segments, VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter, during the COVID-19 pandemic. VITAS Healthcare, which provides hospice care, has been negatively impacted by disruptions in traditional referral sources, particularly senior housing. Senior housing occupancy has been severely reduced, leading to a decline in nursing home admissions and a corresponding reduction in VITAS's average daily census. Despite this, VITAS's hospital referrals have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Roto-Rooter, on the other hand, has shown resilience during the pandemic and is forecasted to achieve 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6%. Chemed Corporation's full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share is estimated to be in the range of $17 to $17.50, assuming an effective corporate tax rate and adjusted earnings of 24.7%.
