This was the best quarterly performance in the company's history and exceeded analyst consensus forecasts for the quarter and the next four quarters combined. The strong results were driven by multiple M&A completion fees, restructuring completion fees, and a long list of smaller fees. Greenhill's European M&A business and its U.S. restructuring business were particularly strong, and the company also benefited from an expanding array of financing advisory roles. The full-year revenue was $311.7 million, with an operating margin of 18% and net income of $1.36 per share. The compensation ratio for the year was 62%, moderately above the target level, but the non-compensation costs were down 18% from the prior year. Greenhill expects increased M&A revenue in most of its international offices and in certain sectors like industrials in 2021. The company also expects more debt restructuring activity for the many industries and companies adversely affected by the continuing pandemic. Greenhill has an active pipeline of good prospects for recruiting M&A bankers and wants to expand its restructuring advisory team even further. The company
