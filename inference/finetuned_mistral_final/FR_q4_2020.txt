 2020 Performance and 2021 Outlook

The company's portfolio performed well in 2020, with high occupancy levels, growth in cash rents, and strong leasing activity. The company delivered year-end occupancy of 95.7%, up 70 basis points from the guidance midpoint provided on the third quarter call. For the full year, the company grew cash rental rates by 13.5%, which is the second highest in the company's history. The positive fourth quarter leasing statistics nationally are consistent with the company's own experience, as CBRE's preliminary figure for net absorption is 104 million square feet, the highest quarterly result in the last four years and exceeding the 69 million square feet of 4Q completions.

In 2021, the company expects to capitalize on its current land holdings and new acquisitions to generate more growth and value creation. The company is focused on making progress in realizing the three-year cash flow growth opportunity it laid out at its Investor Day. As of the balance of 2021, the company's largest remaining rollover is a 400,000 square footer where the tenant is expected to vacate in May. The company has signed leases for approximately 54% of its 2021 rollovers
