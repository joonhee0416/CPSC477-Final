The company's focus on the well-being and safety of its team members and customers, as well as its ability to maintain operations and supply components to customers, has been a key driver of its success. West has also been able to leverage its global manufacturing network to meet the increased demand for its products. The company's full-year 2020 net sales guidance is in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, with an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates. West's gross profit margin improved by 130 basis points in the first quarter, and the company expects to achieve full-year 2020 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62. The company's sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 are in line with its long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
