AAR reported strong results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, with sales up 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share up 206% compared to the same period last year. The company's commercial sales increased 52%, while government and defense sales decreased 17%. The strong performance was driven by the robust demand for airframe MRO services and the parts businesses, which showed an encouraging indicator of returning demand. The operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter, up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter. AAR also generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and reduced the usage of its accounts receivable financing program. The company announced several new business wins, including an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation product, a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes, and an extension of its component support program with Volotea, a growing low cost Spanish carrier
