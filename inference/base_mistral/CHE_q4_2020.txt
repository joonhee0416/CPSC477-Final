2020 Earnings Call Summary

Chemed, the parent company of VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter, reported its 2020 financial results. The pandemic has had a significant impact on both businesses, but they have shown resilience and adaptability in remaining open and operating safely. VITAS Healthcare's admissions and census have improved in the second half of 2020, but nursing home admissions have declined due to disruptions in senior housing. Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6% in 2021, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26%. Chemed's 2020 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share were $18.08. The company anticipates continued weak occupancy and referrals from senior housing for the first half of 2021, but expects senior housing to begin to normalize to pre-pandemic occupancy starting in the second half of the calendar year 2021.
