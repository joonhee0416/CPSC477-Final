 

Jabil reported strong results for the first quarter of its fiscal year, with $400 million of core operating income on $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The team was able to deliver these results in spite of a chaotic global supply chain environment.

For the first quarter, Jabil's net revenue was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter, with GAAP operating income of $350 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.63. Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%.
