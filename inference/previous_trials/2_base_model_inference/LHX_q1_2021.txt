 2021 Earnings Call Summary

Harris L3Harris reported strong first quarter results, with organic revenue up approximately 2% and mid-single-digit growth in core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts in commercial businesses. The company's margins expanded by 140 basis points to 18.9%, resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets. Free cash flow was $630 million, supported by shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from the recently authorized $6 billion program and dividends following the 20% increase in March. The transition from CEO to Chris is planned to occur as planned on June 29, and the independent directors of the Board have endorsed the transition occurring in the merger agreement. The company's top line growth is expected to continue, driven by strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies, and international expansion, which stem from the company's R&D investment. The company has gained traction in its core government businesses, with international up double digits, driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and Tactical radios. The company has also received eight new awards, maintaining its healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million
