 2020 Earnings Call Summary

NHI's senior housing and skilled nursing organizations are being recognized as heroes during the COVID-19 pandemic for their tireless efforts to keep senior residents safe and smiling. Despite the challenges posed to the industry, NHI has limited the spread of COVID-19 among its residents to less than 1% of its total residents. However, this has resulted in a significant downturn in inquiries, tours, and move-ins, which is negatively impacting occupancy. Operators are spending more, particularly for labor and PPE suppliers, which is pressuring their margins. NHI has received 99.7% of its contractual rent in April and has collected approximately 94% in May, in line with expectations. The company is committed to transparency with the investment community and has enhanced occupancy disclosure on Bickford, Holiday, and Senior Living Communities. NHI has withdrawn its previously issued 2020 guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of COVID-19. The company's focus for the more immediate future is to continue funding existing commitments and provide extreme asset management to its operators. For the longer term, NHI expects to have conversations with existing and new operators and expects its pipeline to be ready to support significant external growth when some normalcy returns to the market.
