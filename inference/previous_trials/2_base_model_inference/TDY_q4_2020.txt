 2020 Results and Outlook

Teledyne reported record-breaking earnings and operating margin in 2020, despite facing challenges such as negative GDP in the second quarter and constant struggles faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's full-year margin and cash flow performance were also impressive, with a 39.1% increase in free cash flow to $547.5 million. Teledyne's revenue is expected to grow between 5% and 6% in 2021, with the strongest growth expected in the Digital Imaging segment. The company's outlook for the total company's organic growth is based on cautious and conservative assumptions, with the first quarter being the most challenging due to a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2020.

# FLIR Acquisition

Teledyne has been watching FLIR since it entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006. The company believes that its infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary, and that there is synergy in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning, and other related technologies across each of their organizations. The acquisition of FLIR is expected to further strengthen Teledyne's position in the market and provide significant growth opportunities.
