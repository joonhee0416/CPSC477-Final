 1000-word summary of Applied Materials' Q2 2020 earnings call

Applied Materials reported its Q2 2020 financial results, highlighting cost discipline, margin control, and solid cash generation within a persistent soft end market backdrop. The company's leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control, and automation puts it in a unique position to capture greater share organically as well as through M&A. The company also entered its second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post its acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to its stated target of 2.5 times.

In terms of the broader end market backdrop, demand remains weak across Applied Materials' top industry verticals, with organic sales trending down in the mid-single digits year-over-year, so far in January.

Applied Materials is narrowing its previous guidance ranges and now expects sales of down 2% to flat year-over-year or down 5% to down 3% on an organic day per day basis as well as earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $
