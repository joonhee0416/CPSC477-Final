 

Greenhill reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year, with revenue of $140.7 million and $311.7 million, respectively. The firm's operating margin was 57% and 18%, and net income was $2.71 per share and $1.36 per share, respectively. The firm's revenue was concentrated in a few busy areas, but nearly all of those areas are poised for significant improvement in 2021, given current market conditions and what the firm can see in its pipeline of assignments. The firm's compensation ratio for the year was 62%, moderately above its target level, and its non-compensation costs were down 18% from the prior year. The firm expects increased deal activity in 2021, driven by a positive economic outlook, high stock prices, low borrowing costs, and a variety of other factors. The firm also expects increased restructuring activity, particularly in the industries and companies adversely affected by the continuing pandemic. The firm expects to generate meaningful revenue growth in 2021 and to expand its margins and increase its earnings.
