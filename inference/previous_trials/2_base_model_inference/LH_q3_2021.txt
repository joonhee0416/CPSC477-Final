Labcorp reported strong results in the third quarter, with revenue totaling $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.82, and free cash flow of $650 million. The company's Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well, with 10% and 22% growth, respectively. COVID testing volumes were above the same period last year, with time to results averaging one to two days. The company has also launched new innovations, including an Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit and collaborations with AstraZeneca and Merck on COVID prevention and treatment trials.
