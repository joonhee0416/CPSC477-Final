 

Aptar, a company that serves patients and consumers across various end markets, reported strong results in the most recent period. The company's commitment to research and development has helped its customers grow their own businesses, and its focus on sustainability has been recognized by JUST Capital, which named Aptar among the Top 10 companies for reducing environmental impact. In the pharma segment, Aptar's increased demand for its injectable components, including those for COVID-19 vaccine distributions, offset declines in the prescription drug and consumer healthcare markets. In the beauty and home segment, sales to the personal care and home care markets increased, while sales to the beauty market declined due to ongoing pandemic-related lockdowns. Aptar's outlook for the second quarter is that current underlying demand conditions in most of its markets are not expected to change dramatically from what was experienced in the first quarter. The company expects a second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding restructuring and any change in the fair value of equity investments, to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.99 per share. Aptar's balance sheet remains strong, with a leverage ratio of 1.4 and a gross capital of approximately 37%. The company continues to invest in innovative growth projects and is confirming its forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million
