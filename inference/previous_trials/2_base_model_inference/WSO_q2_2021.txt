 

Watsco reported an incredible second quarter with new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. Sales grew 36% to $1.85 billion, and gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points. Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million, and operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. These results were achieved despite only a modest impact from COVID-related slowdowns in the second quarter of 2020. Watsco has two new companies in its family, TEC and Acme, which performed well and are now part of the company. Watsco is engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market and hopes to find more great companies to join its family. Greater scale in the industry provides more capital for the company to fund its growth priorities. Watsco's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, and the company believes they are helping it gain market share. Customers using the technology are growing faster, and attrition among customers using the technology is lower compared to nonusers. More customers are using the digital selling platforms, which have helped modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners.
