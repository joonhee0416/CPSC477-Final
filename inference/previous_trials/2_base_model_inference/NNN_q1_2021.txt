 10-Year-High Rent Collections and Strong Acquisition Guidance for 2021

The company announced an increase in its 2021 core FFO guidance from a range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share, citing better-than-expected rent collections and results from Q1. The portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform well, with occupancy at 98.3% at the end of the quarter, which is above the long-term average of 98%. The company also reported impressive collection results, collecting 97% of rents due for the first quarter and 98% of rents due for the month of April, which compares very favorably to other retail real estate companies. The majority of the remaining uncollected rent in the first quarter was simply deferred rent that will be collected when the tenant's repayment obligation kicks in later this year. The company also reported that it sold 11 properties, raising $17.6 million of proceeds to be reinvested into new acquisitions. The company's balance sheet remains rock solid, with $311 million of cash in the bank, a 0 balance on its $900 million line of credit,
