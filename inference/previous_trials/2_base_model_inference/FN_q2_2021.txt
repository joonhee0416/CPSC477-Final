 

The company reported a record Q2 with revenue of $453.8 million, representing year-over-year as well as sequential growth. The automotive program was the most significant driver of upside in the quarter, with revenue growing more than 30% from the first quarter and more than doubled from a year ago. The company expects automotive revenue to continue to grow in Q3. Industrial laser revenue was approximately flat and was slightly better than expected. The company expects industrial laser revenue to improve in the third quarter and is optimistic about the longer-term potential for increased outsourcing from this market. In optical communications, the company saw modest growth in revenue in the second quarter, with stronger telecom revenue offsetting continuing softness from datacom products. The company is optimistic that datacom revenue will show an improvement in the third quarter and that both datacom and telecom revenue should increase sequentially. The company is advancing its plans to expand its manufacturing footprint and recently broke ground on a new 1 million square foot building at its campus in Chonburi, Thailand. The company expects construction to take approximately 1.5 years, which means it could start to see revenue from this facility in approximately two years. The company is optimistic that Q3 will be another record-breaking quarter for the company and believes that growth from new products and programs will continue to demonstrate the success of its growth strategy as it looks ahead.
