 

MarineMax, a leading provider of boats and yachts, reported strong first quarter results that exceeded expectations, driven by increased same-store sales and new unit growth. The company's gross margin expanded due to recent acquisitions and focused expense management, resulting in considerable leverage and a record $1.1 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, MarineMax expects to continue growing its AUP on an annual basis, with guidance for high single-digit same-store sales growth and a modest operating leverage improvement. The company remains focused on building its strong team culture, executing on its growth strategy, and creating long-term shareholder value.
