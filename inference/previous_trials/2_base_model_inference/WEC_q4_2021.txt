 2021 Earnings Summary

We are pleased to announce that our 2021 earnings exceeded our most recent guidance, driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery, and our focus on operating efficiency. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, allowing us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. Our earnings are quality earnings with no adjustments, and we have set ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions across our generating fleet. We expect to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050, and we are exploring the use of hydrogen as a key player in the decarbonization of the economy. We are also driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, which includes investments in renewable capacity and focuses on efficiency, sustainability, and growth. We expect to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year, driving earnings growth, dividend growth, and improved environmental performance. We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021, despite the prolonged pandemic, with Wisconsin's unemployment rate down at 2.8%, and major economic development projects moving full steam ahead. We are also relocating our operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region, and we expect to see continued growth in the years ahead.
