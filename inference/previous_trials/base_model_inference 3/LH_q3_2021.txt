 2021 Earnings Call Summary: Labcorp

Labcorp reported strong results in the third quarter of 2021, with revenue totaling $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.82, and free cash flow of $650 million. The company's Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well, with 10% and 22% growth, respectively. The Diagnostics business saw consistent recovery across all businesses, including broad geographic recovery in its Base Business and across its testing portfolio. Drug Development continues to recover, with nearly 85% of sites now open and decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year. Labcorp has been actively involved in the COVID-19 pandemic response, with greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year. The company has also been bringing new innovations to market, including the recent receipt of Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit. Labcorp is raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow, with expectations for enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14%, Diagnostics revenue to grow 8% to 10%, and Drug Development revenue to grow 19.5% to 20.5%. The company expects to continue using its free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement its organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through its share repurchase programs.
