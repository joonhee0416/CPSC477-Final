 1. Quaker Houghton's Earnings Summary

Quaker Houghton reported its first quarter 2020 results, which were better than expected considering the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. The company's sales were impacted by about 4% due to the pandemic and the temporary halt of Boeing's 737 MAX production. However, the company took share in the marketplace as it estimated total organic volume growth due to net share gains was approximately 2% in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year. The combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker, but in the first quarter comparison, the difference is only 0.5 percentage point. This is indicative of the company's raw material savings from its integration starting to come through. The company's pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to integration savings, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition last quarter, and the additional cost control measures put in place to combat the global effect of COVID-19 on volumes. The company has increased its guidance on synergy achievement. For 2020, its new estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus its previous estimate of $35 million. And the total synergies that the company estimates will be achieved by 2022 have been raised from $60 million to $75 million.
