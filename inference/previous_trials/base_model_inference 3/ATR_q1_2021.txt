 

Aptar, a global packaging solutions provider, reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The company serves customers across a variety of end markets, including pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, beauty and home, and consumer healthcare. Aptar's revenue grew 2% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for its innovative food dispensing closures in the food and beverages segment, and price increases in the pharma segment. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin was comparable to the prior year, despite a mix shift within the pharma segment and a relative mix across its three segments. In the beauty and home segment, sales to the personal care and home care markets increased, while sales to the beauty market declined due to continued low levels of retail beauty activity related to the ongoing pandemic. Aptar's outlook for the second quarter is for underlying demand conditions in most of its markets to remain relatively stable, with easier comparisons to the prior year in some markets. The company expects a second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.99 per share, with an estimated tax rate range of 26% to 28%. Aptar's balance sheet remains strong, with a leverage ratio of 1.4 and a gross capital of approximately 37%. The company continues to invest in innovative growth projects and is confirming its forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million. Aptar's long-term view remains positive, with a focus on sustainability and a commitment to R&D and new innovative solutions.
