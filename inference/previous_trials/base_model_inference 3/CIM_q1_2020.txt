 

In this earnings call, Chimera's President and CEO, Matthew Lambiase, discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fixed income market and the company's response. The pandemic resulted in near catastrophic conditions for the fixed income market, with many investors selling their credit investments and reinvesting into safer risk-off assets. The Federal Reserve responded by implementing initiatives to combat the worsening economic conditions, including cutting the federal funds rate to 0% and implementing purchase plans for treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Fed's actions were largely helpful in bringing order to many areas of the fixed income market, including agency mortgage-backed securities. However, liquidity programs for residential credit securities were not offered by the Federal Reserve and continue to trade in a challenged fashion in the secondary markets. Chimera took balance sheet initiatives to protect its book value and meet margin calls from repo lenders, including selling its agency pass-through securities and terminating all its agency hedge positions. The company's portfolio activity significantly reduced its risk exposure as measured by recourse leverage, with a 35% reduction over the past three months. Chimera's GAAP book value at the end of the first quarter was $12.45 per share, and the company's GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $389 million or $2.08 per share. On a core basis, net income for the first quarter was $106 million or $0.57 per share. The company currently has approximately $650 million in cash and unencumbered assets, after paying both its preferred and common stock dividends totaling $111 million. Chimera will continue to monitor its liquidity and assess opportunities to increase liquidity and balance, supporting its current portfolio and finding new opportunities in the market.
