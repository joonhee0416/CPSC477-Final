 

Greif delivered strong third-quarter results, with record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93. The company's leverage ratio fell to 2.8 times, and its board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to its class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively. Greif's global industrial packaging business delivered outstanding results, with steel drum volume increasing by 8% per day and global rigid IBCs and large plastic drum volumes both rising by more than 25% per day. The company's net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 34% versus the prior-year quarter, and adjusted EBITDA was a record. Greif is increasing its adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance, reflecting its strong year-to-date results and positive outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. The company has executed an aggressive deleveraging plan and repaid $370 million in total debt since Q3 2020. Its compliance leverage ratio improved by nearly a full turn over that time period, and it anticipates reaching the high end of its targeted leverage ratio range by the fiscal year-end. The company is well positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends in its key end markets.
