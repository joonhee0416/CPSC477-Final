 2020 Earnings Summary for Chemed Corporation

Chemed Corporation, the parent company of VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter, reported its 2020 earnings results. VITAS Healthcare, which provides hospice care services, experienced a decline in its average daily census of 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an increase in hospital-generated admissions. This decline was primarily due to disruptions in senior housing occupancy, which continues to struggle even as hospitals and other key hospice referral sources have significantly recovered. Roto-Rooter, which provides plumbing and drainage services, forecasted 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26%. Chemed Corporation anticipates continued weak occupancy and corresponding weak referrals from senior housing for the first half of 2021, with senior housing expected to begin to normalize to pre-pandemic occupancy starting in the second half of the calendar year 2021. Based on these discussions, VITAS' 2021 revenue prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to decline approximately 4% when compared to the prior year, with VITAS' average daily census in 2021 estimated to decline approximately 5% and full-year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap estimated to be 19.4%.
