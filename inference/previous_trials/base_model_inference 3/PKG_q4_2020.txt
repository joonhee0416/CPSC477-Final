 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Report

Packaging Corporation of America reported a net income of $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, with a net income per share of $1.30. This was a decrease of $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was driven by lower prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower volumes in the Paper segment, and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs. The EBITDA for the Packaging segment in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $303 million, with a margin of 20%. The full-year EBITDA for the Packaging segment was $1.2 billion, with a margin of 21%. The company also reported strong demand for trucks due to low inventories, driver shortages, and rail rate increases, which drove higher freight expenses. Despite these challenges, the company's employees demonstrated resilience and adaptability, and the company continued to produce high-performance virgin linerboard on the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama. Looking ahead, the company expects demand in the Packaging segment to remain strong in the first quarter of 2021, with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter. The company also expects to realize the majority of its recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and anticipates higher prices for recycled fiber. However, higher freight costs, labor costs, and seasonal colder weather are also expected to impact the first quarter's results.
