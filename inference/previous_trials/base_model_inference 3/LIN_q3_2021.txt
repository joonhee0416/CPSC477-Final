 

Linde delivered another solid quarter with record operating cash flow and return on capital, despite challenging market conditions. The project backlog nearly doubled, providing a strong foundation for high-quality, long-term growth. The company has been committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions footprint since the merger and has been delivering on this commitment ever since. Linde has an operating culture that runs deep at the company, with people taking pride in demonstrating continuous improvement across key operating metrics. The company's focus is on profitable growth, optimizing the business, cash generation, and ROC. Linde will remain focused on being the best performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world. The company's project backlog has increased from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion, and underlying sales grew 11% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. The operating margin of 23.6% is 150 basis points above 2020, but 60 basis points below the high mark set in the second quarter. The company has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth, irrespective of the economic climate. Linde has a record level of $2.6 billion in operating cash progression in the third quarter, with the three main drivers being stronger earnings, timing benefits from the previous quarter, and engineering contract prepayments. The company has access to very attractive capital through the debt markets and has generated significant surplus cash. The fourth quarter earnings per share guidance range is $2.60 to $2.70, which is 13% to 17% above last year and 38% to 43% above 2019. The company believes it's important to distinguish true multiyear growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions.
