 

Greenhill reported strong results for the fourth quarter of 2020, with revenue of $140.7 million, an operating margin of 57%, and net income of $2.71 per share. The company's full-year revenue was $311.7 million, with an operating margin of 18% and net income of $1.36 per share. The strong quarter was driven by multiple M&A and restructuring completion fees, as well as revenue from completion fees that were booked before the transaction triggering that fee was fully completed. The company's compensation ratio for the year was 62%, moderately above the target level, but the compensation ratio for the quarter was unusually low. The company expects increased M&A activity in 2021, driven by a positive economic outlook, high stock prices, low borrowing costs, and a substantial amount of dry powder in private equity funds. The company also expects increased restructuring activity and advisory roles in debt and equity financings. The company aims to increase the scale, diversity, and consistency of its revenue sources while maintaining appropriate discipline on expenses. The company has an active pipeline of prospects for M&A bankers and plans to expand its restructuring advisory team further. The company has strong teams in Europe and Asia and is rebuilding in the U.S., with a focus on higher value-added transactions. The company is aiming to enhance its focus on advising financial sponsors on a wide variety of transactions. The company has opened a new headquarters in the newly renovated Rockefeller Center building on Sixth Avenue and has passed the 25-year mark in the life of the firm.
