 2019 Earnings Summary

During the 2019 year, MBIA Insurance Corporation was able to resolve and extinguish its Puerto Rico sales tax bond or COFINA exposure, which accounted for approximately half of its total insured Puerto Rico debt service. As a result, its total insured debt service on Puerto Rico bonds decreased from $7.9 billion at year-end 2018 to $3.3 billion at the end of 2019. The remaining Puerto Rico exposure is largely comprised of three Puerto Rico credits: the Commonwealth pre-2011 General Obligation PBA bonds; the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or PREPA; and the Puerto Rico Highways & Transportation Authority or HTA. At year-end 2019, the exposure to the General Obligation and PBA bonds was about $655 million of gross par or about $833 million of total debt service. The PREPA exposure was just under $1 billion of gross par or $1.3 billion of total debt service. The HTA exposure was about $600 million of gross par or $1 billion of total debt service. At this time, there is a restructuring support agreement for the PREPA bonds that has been approved by the Federal Oversight Management Board in over 90% of the PREPA creditors. However, Governor Vazquez and the Puerto Rico Legislature have stated publicly that they do not support the agreement. There is also a planned support agreement between the Oversight Board and a group of Commonwealth bondholders, representing approximately 54% of the par amount. MBIA Insurance Corporation and the other monolines do not support the proposed agreement and neither does the Commonwealth government. National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation's insured portfolio declined to $49 billion of gross par
