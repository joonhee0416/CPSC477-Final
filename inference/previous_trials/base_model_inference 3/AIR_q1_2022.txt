 

AAR reported strong first quarter fiscal year 2022 results, with sales up 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share up 206% compared to the prior year period. The company's sales to commercial customers increased 52%, while sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%. AAR's sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 was 4%, driven by strong demand for airframe MRO services and parts businesses. The company's operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter, up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter. AAR generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and reduced the usage of its accounts receivable financing program. The company also announced several new business wins, including an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company, and a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft. AAR also extended its component support program with Volotea, a growing low-cost Spanish carrier. The company's balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with net debt of $80.2 million and net leverage of only 0.6 times. Looking forward, AAR expects that demand for its MRO activities will remain strong, while part supply may be impacted by the Delta variant. The company also expects to see a near-term impact on its government business due to the exit from Afghanistan and programs nearing natural completion points. However, AAR's Department of Energy contract is an offsetting award that demonstrates the fundamental value proposition of its commercial best practices business model. The company believes that over time, it remains in an excellent position to grow its government business through additional program wins and expansions of its current positions.
