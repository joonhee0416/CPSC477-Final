 2020 Earnings Summary
Teledyne reported strong financial performance in 2020, with the best earnings, operating margin, and cash flow in the company's history. Fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%, operating margin increased 173 basis points, and free cash flow increased 50.7%. Full year GAAP operating margin increased slightly, and free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million. Despite challenges, including over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter, and ongoing challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Teledyne's performance was strong.

# 2021 Outlook
Teledyne expects continuing recovery in its commercial businesses as well as growth in its government businesses in 2021. The strongest growth is expected within the Digital Imaging segment. While the outlook is cautious due to ongoing challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Teledyne expects organic growth between 5% and 6% for 2021. The first quarter will be the most difficult due to a relatively flat comparison with the first quarter of 2020.

# FLIR Acquisition
Teledyne has been watching FLIR since it entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006. Teledyne believes that its infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary, and the companies have grown to be even more complementary over time. While their respective sensing technologies and market segments are different, the fundamental desire of their end customers is an image or even better, information. Teledyne is excited about the pending acquisition of FLIR and believes it will significantly enhance the company's growth prospects.
