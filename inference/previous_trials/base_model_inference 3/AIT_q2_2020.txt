 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, Applied focused on cost discipline, margin control, and solid cash generation in a soft end market. The company's leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control, and automation put it in a unique position to capture greater share organically and through M&A. The cross-selling opportunity remains in the early innings, with the goal of expanding the reach of fluid power, flow control, consumables, and automation solutions across Applied's embedded service center network customer base. The company entered the second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post the acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to the stated target of 2.5 times. Applied's guidance for sales is now down 2% to flat year-over-year or down 5% to down 3% on an organic day-per-day basis, with earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share. The company's free cash flow outlook is $200 million to $220 million, which represents a 30% increase from fiscal 2019 at the midpoint.
