 

SJI reported strong performance in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2021, with economic earnings increasing by 12% or approximately $12 million. The company's utilities, South Jersey Gas and Elizabethtown Gas, account for the bulk of its earnings. Utility margin growth remained strong, reflecting above-average customer growth, positive rate case outcomes, infrastructure modernization programs, and effective O&M management. The company's infrastructure modernization and energy efficiency investments, critical to assuring safe and reliable service to customers, are on track and have the added benefit of significantly reducing methane emissions. SJI's regulatory initiatives continue to advance, with the BPU approving South Jersey Gas' engineering and route proposal to construct needed system upgrades in support of a planned 2 Bcf liquefied natural gas facility. The company is reaffirming its expectation for 2021 economic earnings of $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share, with a long-term economic earnings-per-share growth target remaining 5% to 8%. The company is also affirming its five-year capital expenditures outlook through 2025 of approximately $3.5 billion, with a variety of utility and clean energy investments identified to take the place of PennEast capex in its five-year plan. SJI has a prescriptive hedging plan in place to minimize the impact of gas commodity price volatility on customer bills.
