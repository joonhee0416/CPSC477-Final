As a result, their total insured debt service on Puerto Rico bonds decreased from $7.9 billion at year-end 2018 to $3.3 billion at the end of 2019.

At year-end 2019, their exposure to the General Obligation and PBA bonds was about $655 million of gross par or about $833 million of total debt service.
