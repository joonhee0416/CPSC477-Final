 2020 Results and Outlook

Teledyne reported its 2020 financial results, which showed improvement in demand across the majority of its businesses. The company received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog. For the full year, Teledyne's GAAP operating margin increased significantly, and free cash flow increased significantly. Despite the challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Teledyne's full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter, and constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# FLIR Acquisition

Teledyne announced its plans to acquire FLIR, a company that specializes in thermal imaging and sensing technologies. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, and the companies believe that their infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary. The acquisition is expected to provide synergies in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning, and other related technologies across each of the organizations.
