 

Greif delivered strong third-quarter results, with record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93, driven by strong volumes and ongoing strategic pricing actions. The company's leverage ratio fell at 2.8 times, and its board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to its class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively. Greif is increasing its adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance, reflecting its strong year-to-date results and positive outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Ole Rosgaard, who will assume responsibility for Greif's next chief executive officer upon Matt Eichmann's retirement in February 2022, has extensive manufacturing and industrial packaging experience and a proven track record of driving and delivering operating and business results.
