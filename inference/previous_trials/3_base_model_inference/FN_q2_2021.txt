 

The company had another record quarter in Q2, with revenue and earnings per share exceeding guidance and expectations. Gross and operating margins were at their highest levels in over a year. Automotive revenue grew more than 30% and was the largest category, with LIDAR seeing strong growth. Industrial laser revenue was flat, but expected to improve in Q3. Optical communications revenue saw modest growth, driven by telecom strength and the transfer of the Cisco optical transport systems program. The company is expanding its manufacturing footprint, with construction of a new 1 million square foot building expected to take approximately 1.5 years. The company is optimistic about growth from new products and programs, and expects Q3 to be another record-breaking quarter.
