 2020 Q4 VITAS Healthcare Segment

During the Q4 2020, VITAS Healthcare faced several challenges due to the pandemic. Despite these challenges, VITAS was able to maintain its focus on providing care to its patients. The most complex issue facing VITAS was the disruption in traditional hospice referral sources, which impacted its patient census patterns. However, the portions of the healthcare continuum have normalized, and hospital referral admissions have significantly improved from low-admission rates experienced early in the pandemic. VITAS's hospital referrals are returning to pre-pandemic levels. The nursing home hospice patients represented 14.7% of the VITAS fourth quarter 2020 census, a decline of 310 basis points when compared to the prior year. VITAS anticipates continued weak occupancy and corresponding weak referrals from senior housing for the first half of 2021. Based upon the above discussion, VITAS' 2021 revenue prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to decline approximately 4% when compared to the prior year. VITAS
