 

Chemed Corporation reported its third quarter 2020 financial results, which showed significant improvement in admissions and revenue for both its hospice and plumbing services segments. The company's hospice segment operations were impacted by the pandemic, but the federal government's support allowed for the use of telehealth and flexible regulations. Roto-Rooter services demand showed strong improvement throughout the second and third quarters, with unit-for-unit commercial revenue increasing 26.8% sequentially in the third quarter. VITAS is forecasted to achieve full year 2020 revenue growth of 12.5% to 13%, and Chemed's full year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share is estimated to be in the range of $18 to $18.15, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits for stock options, costs related to litigation and other discrete items. The company's average daily census declined two-tenths of 1 percentage point in the quarter, but admissions to normalize when nursing homes and assisted-living facilities return to their pre-COVID occupancy
