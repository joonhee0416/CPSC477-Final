In the second quarter of 2020, Applied focused on cost discipline, margin control, and solid cash generation in a soft end market. The company's leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control, and automation put it in a unique position to capture greater share organically and through M&A. Applied also entered the second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post the acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to the stated target of 2.5 times. The company's outlook for the full year is narrowing, with sales expected to be down 2% to flat year-over-year or down 5% to down 3% on an organic day per day basis, and earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share. Applied's free cash flow outlook for the year is $200 million to $220 million, which represents a 30% increase from fiscal 2019 at the midpoint.
