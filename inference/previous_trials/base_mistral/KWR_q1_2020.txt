Quaker Houghton reported its first quarter 2020 earnings, with pro forma adjusted EBITDA growing 10% compared to the same period last year. The company's integration with Norman Hay has been successful, with cost savings and synergies being achieved. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's sales were only impacted by about 4%, with the automotive sector being particularly affected. The company has taken cost-saving measures to combat the global effect of COVID-19 on its volumes, including eliminating discretionary expenses and reducing planned capital expenditures. The company has also increased its guidance on synergy achievement, with a new estimate of $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus its previous estimate of $35 million. The company's non-operating items include a non-cash charge of $22.7 million for final settlement and termination of legacy Quaker's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and a non-cash impairment charge of $38 million for the writedown of its Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets.
