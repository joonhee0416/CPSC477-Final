2020 Results and Outlook

Teledyne reported strong financial results for 2020, with the best earnings, operating margin, and cash flow in the company's history. Fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%, and operating margin increased 173 basis points. Free cash flow increased 50.7%. For the full year, GAAP operating margin increased slightly, and free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million. Despite challenges such as record negative GDP in the second quarter and constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Teledyne entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of its businesses. Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14 times sales with a year-end backlog of $1.7 billion. The company expects continuing recovery in its commercial businesses as well as growth in its government businesses, with the strongest within its Digital Imaging segment. Teledyne's outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021.
