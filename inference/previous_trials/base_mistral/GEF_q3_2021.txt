Greif delivered strong third-quarter results, with record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93. The company's leverage ratio fell to 2.8 times, and its board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to its class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively. Greif's global industrial packaging business delivered outstanding results, with steel drum volume increasing by 8% per day and global rigid IBCs and large plastic drum volumes both rising by more than 25% per day. The company's third-quarter net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 34% versus the prior-year quarter due to stronger volumes and higher selling prices. Greif anticipates generating between $335 million and $365 million in adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2021, with a bias to the upside of that range. The company is well positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends in its key end markets, with an extensive global portfolio, differentiated service capability, and sharp focus on operational execution.
