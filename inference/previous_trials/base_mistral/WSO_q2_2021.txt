Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter. Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points. Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million. Operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. These results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns. Watsco's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, and the company believes they are helping them gain market share. Growth rates among active users of their technologies continue to outpace the growth rates of nonusers, and attrition among customers using their technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers.
