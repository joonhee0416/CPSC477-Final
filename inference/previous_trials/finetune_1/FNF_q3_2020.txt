 2020 Q3 Earnings Call Summary

The earnings call for the third quarter of 2020 was held by Fidelity National Information Services (FNIS) to discuss their financial performance and business updates. FNIS is a leading provider of technology solutions to the real estate and financial services industries.

The call began with an overview of FNIS's strategic goals and the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, FNIS was able to generate record adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million and a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin in the third quarter. This was due to a combination of factors, including the delayed spring selling season and sustained momentum in refinance.

Mike discussed FNIS's acquisition of FGL Holdings and their recent entrance into the bank and broker-dealer channel. FNIS's recent divestiture of FNIS Reinsurance was also discussed, as it was no longer available upon FNIS's acquisition of F&G. The sale of FNIS Reinsurance was a terrific outcome for FNIS, its clients, employees, and shareholders.

Chris discussed FNIS's third quarter results, which included strong sales results and the recent divestiture of FNIS Reinsurance. FNIS also entered into a mutually beneficial annuity flow reinsurance partnership.

Looking forward, FNIS plans to continue creating meaningful long-term value for its shareholders through its capital allocation strategy. This includes a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, a 9% increase from the previous quarter, and plans for $500 million in share repurchases over the next 12 months.

Overall, FNIS's sales engine is firing on all cylind
