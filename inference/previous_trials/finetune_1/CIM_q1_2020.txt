 

In summary, the transcript discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fixed income markets and how Chimera Financial Corporation navigated the market downturn. The pandemic resulted in near catastrophic conditions for the fixed income markets, with many investors selling their credit investments and reinvesting into safer risk-off assets. The Federal Reserve responded by announcing initiatives to combat the worsening economic conditions, including cutting the federal funds rate to 0% and implementing liquidity programs. Chimera took a number of balance sheet initiatives to protect its book value, meet margin calls from repo lenders, and pay dividends. The company sold its agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio to pay down debt and further deleverage its overall portfolio. As of the quarter end, Chimera ended at 2.2 times recourse leverage, a significant reduction from the previous quarter. The company remains cautiously optimistic and plans to continue to space out repo maturities and seek longer tenure for its credit repo.
