The company's sales were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a reduction in production and shutdowns in the automotive sector. The company's total organic volume growth due to net share gains was approximately 2% in the first quarter of 2020, despite the pandemic. The combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker, but in the first quarter comparison, the difference was only 0.5 percentage point. The company's pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to cost savings from integration, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition, and additional cost control measures. The company has increased its guidance on synergy achievement, with a new estimate of $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus its previous estimate of $35 million. The company has also taken actions to address the global crisis, including restructuring charges, non-cash impairment charges, and cost reduction measures. The company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, but sequentially it is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019. The company's reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 3.40 times from its year-end level of 3.47 times as a result of good cash flow and cost savings. The company expects to continue to be in compliance with its bank covenants and has strong liquidity to support these uncertain times.
