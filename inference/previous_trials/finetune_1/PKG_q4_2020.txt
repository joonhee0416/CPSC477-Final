 2020 Earnings Call Summary

Packaging Corporation of America reported a net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $163 million or $1.71 per share in the same period in 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower volumes in the Paper segment, and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs. The Packaging segment's EBITDA excluding special items was $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, with sales of $1.54 billion, resulting in a margin of 20%. The company's Packaging segment experienced strong demand, with sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and corrugated products plants setting all-time records. However, the company ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned due to much stronger-than-expected demand. The company began producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama, to help meet the continued strong demand from its box plant customers and build inventory prior to the year-end. The machine's capabilities met the company's expectations, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December. The company expects to realize the majority of its recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter of 2021, with higher freight costs and labor costs also expected to continue. The company also expects higher prices for recycled fiber. The company expects to begin producing containerboard at its Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for its paper customers. The company expects to produce 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020 in 2021,
