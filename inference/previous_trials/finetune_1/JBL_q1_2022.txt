 2022 Outlook

Jabil reported strong results for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, with $400 million of core operating income on $8.6 billion in revenue and a core operating margin of 4.7%. The team delivered exceptional results in key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and mobility, despite the chaotic global supply chain environment. The procurement and supply chain team highlighted that demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, but Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize its allocation and keep factories in production.

The company expects continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated into its guidance for the year. While demand is expected to remain ahead of supply for the next six months, Jabil anticipates some relief toward the back half of the fiscal year.
