Despite this, the company's direct-to-consumer channels of distribution performed well, particularly in the direct-to-consumer channels of distribution. The company's excellent results are attributed to the strength of its brand portfolio, how it communicates its aspirational upbeat brand messages through beautiful inventory, differentiated products, and exceptional customer experiences. The company is investing heavily in improving the customer experience, with enhancements to its mobile apps, search engine optimization, customer data and insights, customer service, and more. The boundaries between retail and e-commerce businesses are becoming increasingly blurry, and the company is focused on fulfilling customers' desire for a seamless omnichannel experience. The company's total e-commerce business is expected to be roughly a third of consolidated sales in 2021, compared to 23% in fiscal 2019. The company's outlook for the back half of the year reflects its expectation of strength in its full price direct-to-consumer business, with full price direct-to-consumer sales growth and consolidated gross margin expansion over 2019. The company expects sales from Lanier Apparel to be approximately $25 million lower than 2019's third quarter and $20 million lower than 2019's fourth quarter. The company's effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 23%, and it plans to invest in additional brick-and-mortar locations and technology-related digital marketing, customer service, mobile enhancements, and distribution. The company also plans to pay a dividend of $0.42 per share this quarter.
