The strong performance was driven by the parts businesses and robust demand for airframe MRO services.

AAR also generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and reduced the usage of its accounts receivable financing program. The company announced several new business wins, including an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company, and a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft. AAR also extended its component support program with Volotea. The company had over 150 people stationed in Afghanistan during the US withdrawal, and its WASS team transported approximately 2,000 U.S. embassy personnel to Kabul International Airport. AAR's sales in the quarter were up 14% or $54.3 million year-over-year, with sales in the Aviation Services segment up 19.8% and sales in the Expeditionary Services segment down $17.7 million. The gross profit margin in the quarter was 14.2%, up from 12.1% in the prior year quarter, and the adjusted gross profit margin was 16.1%, up from 13% in the prior year quarter.
