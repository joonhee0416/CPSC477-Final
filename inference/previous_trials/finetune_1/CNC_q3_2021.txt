 2021 Earnings Call Transcript Summary

Centene reported strong third quarter results with revenue of $32.4 billion, HBR of 88.1%, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26. The company's performance reflects a return to normal utilization while still covering reasonable amounts of COVID costs, which peaked in August.

The company expects to offer members who will no longer qualify for Medicaid the opportunity to enroll in its marketplace. The company plans to provide full details on its 2022 guidance and the potential impacts of several factors, including the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in the marketplace license, and the COVID landscape. Centene is committed to achieving an investment grade rating and a disciplined capital allocation framework that takes into consideration its priorities, including investing in its business, debt management, and share repurchases. The company is a leader on vaccine mandates, mandating vaccinations as an additional employment benefit and supporting its members in assessing the vaccine. Centene expects to need approximately $2.3 billion of unregulated cash to close the Magellan transaction in the fourth quarter.
