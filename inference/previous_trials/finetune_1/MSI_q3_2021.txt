The company's three technologies, LMR, video security and access control, and command center software, all experienced growth in Q3. The company is raising its full-year guidance for both sales and EPS based on its strong Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the year. The company's capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases, $120 million in cash dividends, and $61 million of capex. The company also made several acquisitions in Q3, including Openpath, Evolv, and Envysion. The company expects full-year sales to be up 10% to 10.25%, full-year EPS to be between $9 and $9.04 per share, and full-year opex to be $1.95 billion. The company's LMR business is experiencing supply chain constraints, particularly in its PCR business, but demand remains robust. The company's software and services segment is experiencing strong demand and expects operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year. The company's video security and access control software revenue growth is expected to be greater than 35% this year. The company is expanding its relationships within its existing installed base to provide more software and services. The company's customer funding is as good as it has ever been, and its NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for its fixed video solutions. The company expects the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year
