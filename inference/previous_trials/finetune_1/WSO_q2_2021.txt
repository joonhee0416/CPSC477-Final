 

Watsco has reported an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter. Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points. Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million, and operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. These results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns. Watsco has two new companies in its family, TEC and Acme, which performed very well, and the company hopes to find more great companies to join it. Greater scale in the $50 billion North American market provides more capital for Watsco to fund its growth priorities. The company's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, and it believes they are helping it gain market share. Growth rates among active users of its technologies continue to outpace the growth rates of nonusers, and attrition among customers using its technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers. The technology enables the company to create stickier customer relationships. The company's progress is very encouraging, but it believes it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of its technology investments. Watsco's balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt, and the company has plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow its company both organically and through acquisitions.
