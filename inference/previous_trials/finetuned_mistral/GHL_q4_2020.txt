The strong quarter was not simply a matter of transaction timing. The company's European M&A business and its U.S. restructuring business performed well, and the company benefited from an expanding array of financing advisory roles. The company's private capital advisory business also made a meaningful contribution. The company's revenue for the year was highly concentrated in a few busy areas, as many regions and sectors were heavily impacted by the pandemic. However, the company sees nearly all of those areas as poised for significant improvement in 2021.
