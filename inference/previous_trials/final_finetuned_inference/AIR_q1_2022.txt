 

AAR reported strong results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, with sales up 14% from the prior year period and adjusted diluted earnings per share up 206%. The company's sales to commercial customers increased 52%, while sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%. The strong performance was driven by robust demand for airframe MRO services and parts businesses. AAR's operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter on an adjusted basis, up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter. The company generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and reduced the usage of its accounts receivable financing program. AAR also announced several new business wins, including an exclusive agreement with Arkwin to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation product, a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes, and an extension of its component support program with Volotea. The company had over 150 people stationed in Afghanistan primarily in support of its WASS program, which transported approximately 2,000 U.S. embassy personnel to Kabul International Airport to support their evacuation from the country. AAR's sales in the quarter of $455.1 million were up 14% or $54.3 million year-over-year. The company expects overall Q2 performance to be similar to Q1, with a recovery in its commercial markets and continued demand for its MRO activities. AAR believes it is well positioned for growth and has an even stronger balance sheet, with a net debt of $80.2 million and net leverage of only 0.6 times.
