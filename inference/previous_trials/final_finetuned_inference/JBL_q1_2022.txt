 

Jabil reported strong results for its first fiscal quarter, with $400 million of core operating income on $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The team delivered strong results across key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and mobility. The procurement and supply chain team highlighted that demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, but Jabil has been able to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize its allocation and keep factories in production. The company expects continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated into its guidance for the year. The first quarter segment results showed that revenue for the DMS segment was $4.7 billion, an increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis, and revenue for the EMS segment was $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. The company also reported inventory days of 66 days, a decline of five days sequentially. Jabil has increased its core earnings per share guidance for the year to $6.55, up $0.20 from its September outlook. The company is committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million, while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year. The team at Jabil values its role as a responsible and reliable partner to those it serves and is focused on purpose, which includes keeping its people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and giving back to the communities where it lives.
