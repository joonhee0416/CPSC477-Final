 2021 Earnings Call Summary

SJI reported strong performance in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2021. The company's utilities, South Jersey Gas and Elizabethtown Gas, accounted for the bulk of its earnings, with utility margin growth remaining strong. SJI has also invested heavily in infrastructure modernization and energy efficiency, which have reduced methane emissions. The company is pursuing several regulatory initiatives, including a 2 Bcf liquefied natural gas facility and a $742 million Phase 3 infrastructure modernization investment at South Jersey Gas. SJI's nonutility operations, including its energy management and energy production segments, also delivered solid results. The company's capital expenditures and clean energy investments for the year-to-date were approximately $434 million, with more than 80% allocated for regulated utility investments. SJI's balance sheet, debt and credit metrics have improved over the past year and support its growth plans. The company is reaffirming its expectation for 2021 economic earnings of $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share and its long-term economic earnings-per-share growth target remains 5% to 8%. SJI has a prescriptive hedging plan in place to minimize the impact of gas commodity price volatility on customer bills.
