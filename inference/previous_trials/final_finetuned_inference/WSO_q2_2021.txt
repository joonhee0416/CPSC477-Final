 

Watsco reported an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter. Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points. Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million. Operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. These results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns. Watsco has two new companies in its family, TEC and Acme, which performed very well and have a rich and successful history. Watsco is engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market and hopes to find more great companies to join it. Greater scale in this industry provides more capital for Watsco to fund its growth priorities. Watsco's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, and it believes they are helping it gain market share. Growth rates among active users of its technologies continue to outpace the growth rates of nonusers, and customers using its technology are growing faster. Attrition among customers using its technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers, and the technology enables the company to create stickier customer relationships. More customers are using its digital selling platforms, which help modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners. The technology also benefits the sale of higher efficiency systems, which is important for the climate change discussion. Watsco's balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt. The company has plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow both organically and through acquisitions.
