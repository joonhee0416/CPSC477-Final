In the second quarter of 2020, Applied focused on cost control and margin management while generating solid cash in a soft end market. The company's technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control, and automation put it in a unique position to capture greater share organically and through M&A. Applied also entered the second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet and notable flexibility for additional deleveraging, acquisitions, and pursuing other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns.
