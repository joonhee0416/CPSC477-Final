 

Quanex Corporation reported strong first-quarter financial results for 2021. The company reported revenue of $230.1 million, a 17.1% increase from the same period last year. Net income for the quarter was $7.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $10,000 or $0.00 per diluted share in the same period last year. The increase in net income was somewhat offset by a $6.7 million increase in SG&A during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter increased by 55.4% to $24.3 million, compared to $15.7 million in the same period last year. The increase in EBITDA was largely due to operating leverage from higher volumes. The company's balance sheet is strong, with a liquidity position that is solid and a leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA that is unchanged at 0.6 times. The company expects to generate full-year 2021 revenue of $945 million to $965 million, with an adjusted EBITDA range of $112 million to $122 million. The company expects to have a tax rate of 26% to 27%, interest expense of $3 million to $4 million, capex of about $30 million, and free cash flow of approximately $60 million. The company expects to have an implied incremental adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-20% range. The company's European fenestration segment is expected to have the strongest revenue growth and margin expansion in Q2, with net sales expected to be up approximately 25% year over year. The company is focused on operational excellence, cash flow optimization, and improving return on invested capital throughout all segments of its business.
