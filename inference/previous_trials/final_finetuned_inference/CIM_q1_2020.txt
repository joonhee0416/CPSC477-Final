In the first quarter of 2020, Chimera Financial Corporation experienced a significant decline in fixed income markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's portfolio, which primarily consisted of agency mortgage-backed securities, was affected by the drop in interest rates and repo margin calls. In response, Chimera sold its agency pass-through securities and terminated its agency hedge positions, resulting in a significant reduction of recourse leverage. The company's GAAP net loss for the quarter was $389 million, but on a core basis, net income was $106 million.
