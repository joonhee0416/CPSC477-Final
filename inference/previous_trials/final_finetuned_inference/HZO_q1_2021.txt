In the first quarter, MarineMax outperformed last year's results, with strong growth in same-store sales and new unit growth. The company's record results continue to demonstrate its team's ability to evaluate customers' needs and act quickly. The marine industry is experiencing a significant acceleration in new customers, which should help support future growth as they migrate to larger or different types of products in the coming years.
