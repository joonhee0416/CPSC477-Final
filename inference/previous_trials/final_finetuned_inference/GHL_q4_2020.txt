 

In summary, Greenhill reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020, with revenue of $140.7 million and $311.7 million, respectively, and net income of $2.71 per share and $1.36 per share, respectively. The company's quarterly revenue was up 32% and earnings per share was up 158% from the same period last year. The strong performance was driven by multiple M&A completion fees, restructuring completion fees, and a long list of smaller fees. The company's European M&A business and U.S. restructuring business were particularly strong, and the firm also benefited from an expanding array of financing advisory roles. Looking ahead to 2021, the company expects to see nearly all of the areas that were heavily impacted by the pandemic poised for significant improvement. The compensation ratio for the year was 62%, moderately above the target level, but the non-compensation costs were down 18% from the prior year. The company expects increased M&A revenue in most of its international offices and in certain sectors like industrials in 2021, driven by a positive economic outlook, increased deal activity, and other factors. The company also expects to see significant opportunity to advise on various kinds of debt and equity financings.
