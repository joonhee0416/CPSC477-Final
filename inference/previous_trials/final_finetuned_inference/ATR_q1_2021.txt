 2021 Aptar Earnings Call Summary

Aptar, Inc. reported its first quarter 2021 financial results, with adjusted EBITDA margin comparable to the prior year despite a mix shift within the pharma segment and the relative mix across the three segments. The company's food and beverage segment delivered a stellar performance, driven by strong demand for innovative food dispensing closures, while the beauty and home segment experienced a decline in sales to the beauty market due to continued retail beauty activity related to the ongoing pandemic. Aptar's beauty and home segment also faced increased resin and other raw material costs, which were passed through where possible. The company's outlook for the second quarter is for underlying demand conditions in most of its markets to remain relatively stable, with easier comparisons to the prior year in some markets. Aptar expects a second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.99 per share, with an estimated tax rate range of 26% to 28%. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a leverage ratio of 1.4 on a gross basis and approximately 37% capital on a net basis. Aptar continues to invest in innovative growth projects and has confirmed its forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million.
