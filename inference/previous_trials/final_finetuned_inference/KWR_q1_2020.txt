 2020 Q1 Earnings Call Summary

Quaker Houghton reported its first quarter 2020 earnings, with pro forma adjusted EBITDA growing 10% compared to the same period last year. The company's first quarter results were better than expected due to cost savings from the integration, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition, and additional cost control measures. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the company's sales by about 4%, with total organic volume growth due to net share gains estimated at approximately 2% in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2019. The company has increased its guidance on synergy achievement, with an estimate of $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus its previous estimate of $35 million. The company has also accelerated other synergies where possible and has increased its synergy achievement estimate for 2020 to $75 million from $60 million. The company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, but is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019. The company has a very asset-light business model and expects a release of working capital at sales decline to generate good cash flow. The company's cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates, and it has strong liquidity to support uncertain times.
