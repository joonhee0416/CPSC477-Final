 1. Tanger Outlet Centers:
INSTead of summarizing the entire transcript, I will provide a summary of the key points discussed in the earnings call.

Tanger Outlet Centers reported first quarter 2021 financial results, with consolidated portfolio occupancy reaching 91.7% at the end of the quarter, up only 20 basis points from the end of 2020. Blended average rental rates decreased 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis for all renewals and retenanted leases that commenced during the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021. However, this reflects a 300 basis-point improvement on a cash basis and a 390 basis-point improvement on a straight-line basis compared to the reported Q4 2020 spreads. The company believes it will continue to see improvement longer-term as positive traffic and sales trends will support driving better rents.

In Canada, where Tanger Outlet Centers has two unconsolidated JV properties, stores had been closed under government mandate through mid-February and are again closed under mandate. The trailing 12 months, 280 leases commenced, totaling over 1.4 million square feet.

First quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.40 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Core FFO for the first quarter of 2021 excludes general and administrative expense of $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share for compensation costs related to a voluntary retirement plan and other executive severance costs.
