 2021 Q1 Earnings Call Summary

Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) reported $2.3 billion in sales for the quarter, a 1.2% increase from the same period in 2020. The company's diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $3.68, up from $2.43 in 2020. The pension-adjusted earnings per share were $3.56, an increase from $2.43 in 2020.

HII's Technical Solutions business saw a 18.3% decrease in revenues from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestiture of its oil and gas business and the San Diego shipyard. However, the company's operating income improved to $7 million from a loss in the first quarter of 2020.

Ingalls, HII's shipbuilding business, was awarded a life-cycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million. The team achieved a 25% complete milestone on the LHA eight Bougainville program and is focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of planned production milestones.

The company also announced the retirement of Brian Cuccias, who served as President of Ingalls since 2014. Kari Wilkinson succeeded him as President of Ingalls and will report to Chris.

Looking ahead, HII expects to finish the year with a strict building operating margin in the 7% to 8% range, with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted toward the end of the year. The company also expects shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of its annual guidance range.
