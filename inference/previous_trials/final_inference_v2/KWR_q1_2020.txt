 

The transcript is from a conference call of the Quaker Houghton company, which provides lubricants and chemicals to the automotive and industrial industries. The company's top priority is to protect the health and safety of its employees and customers while ensuring business continuity. The company has 34 plants around the world and is meeting customers' needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the company's sales by about 4% in the first quarter, and the temporary halt of Boeing 737 MAX production has impacted sales by approximately 1%. The company's first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to cost savings from integration, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition, and additional cost control measures. The company has increased its guidance on synergy achievement and expects to achieve $53 million of cost synergies in 2020, up from $35 million. The company has also taken fast action to save costs during the pandemic, including eliminating discretionary expenses and reviewing its integration synergy plans. The company expects to continue to be in compliance with its bank covenants and has strong liquidity to support these uncertain times.
