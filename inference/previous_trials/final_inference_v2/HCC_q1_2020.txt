 

The first quarter of 2020 was challenging for the company, with net income on a GAAP basis being $22 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $110 million or $2.14 per diluted share in the same period of 2019. The decline in net income was primarily due to a 31% decrease in average net selling prices and a 13% decrease in sales volumes. The adjusted EBITDA was $62 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $181 million in the same period of 2019. The quarterly decrease was driven by a decrease in average net selling prices and sales volumes. The average net selling price per short ton decreased approximately 31% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The company expects the full impact of COVID-19 on met coal demand erosion may not materialize until the second quarter of 2020 and possibly beyond. The company has delayed the $25 million budgeted for the development of the Blue Creek project until at least July 1, 2020, and has temporarily suspended its stock repurchase program. The company will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business for the remainder of the fiscal year and expects to provide further updates to its financial outlook and the development of the Blue Creek project during its second quarter earnings call.
