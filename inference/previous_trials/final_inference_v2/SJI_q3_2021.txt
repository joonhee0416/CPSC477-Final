 

SJI reported strong performance in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2021, with economic earnings increasing by 12% or approximately $12 million. The company's utilities, South Jersey Gas and Elizabethtown Gas, represent the bulk of its earnings, with utility margin growth remaining strong due to factors such as above-average customer growth, positive rate case outcomes, infrastructure modernization programs, and effective O&M management. The company is also investing in infrastructure modernization and energy efficiency initiatives, which have the added benefit of significantly reducing methane emissions. SJI's regulatory initiatives continue to advance, with the BPU approving South Jersey Gas' engineering and route proposal to construct needed system upgrades in support of a planned 2 Bcf liquefied natural gas facility. The company is also requesting $742 million in Phase 3 infrastructure modernization investments at South Jersey Gas, which supports the Murphy administration's safety and reliability, job creation, and environmental goals. SJI's nonutility operations also delivered solid quarterly and year-to-date results, with both its energy management and energy production segments contributing to strong performance. The company's capital expenditures and clean energy investments for the year-to-date were approximately $434 million, with more than 80% of this amount allocated for regulated utility investments in support of utility infrastructure upgrades, system maintenance, and customer growth. SJI's balance sheet, debt and credit metrics have all improved over the past year, supporting its growth plans. The company is reaffirming its expectation for 2021 economic earnings of $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share and its long-term economic earnings-per-share growth target remains 5% to 8%.
