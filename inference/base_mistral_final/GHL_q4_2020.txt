In the fourth quarter of 2020, Greenhill reported revenue of $140.7 million, an operating margin of 57%, and net income of $2.71 per share. For the year, the company had revenue of $311.7 million, an operating margin of 18%, and net income of $1.36 per share. The quarterly revenue was up 32%, and earnings per share was up 158% from the same period last year. The full-year revenue was up 4%, and earnings per share was up 202% from the prior year.

The revenue for the year was highly concentrated in a few busy areas, as many regions and sectors were heavily impacted by the pandemic and related constraints in economic activity and thus produced only modest revenue.
