 

Watsco has reported an outstanding second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. Sales grew 36% to a record $1.85 billion, with gross profits increasing 50% and operating margins expanding 220 basis points. The results were achieved despite only a modest impact from COVID-related slowdowns in the second quarter of last year. Watsco has recently acquired two new companies, TEC and Acme, which have performed well and are now part of the company. Watsco is engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market and hopes to find more companies to join. The company's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, with growth rates among active users of the technology outpacing nonusers and attrition among customers using the technology being lower than nonusers. The technology has enabled the creation of stickier customer relationships. Watsco's progress is encouraging, but the focus remains on the long term. The balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt, providing plenty of capacity and ambitions to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions.
