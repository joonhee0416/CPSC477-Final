 

Jabil reported strong results for the first fiscal quarter, with $400 million of core operating income on $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The team's success was driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and mobility. Jabil's procurement and supply chain team noted that demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, and that the team has been successful in leveraging best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize their allocation. For the first quarter, net revenue was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter, and GAAP operating income was $350 million. Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior-year quarter. Jabil's management team anticipates continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated into their guidance for the year. The company has increased its core earnings per share guidance for the year to $6.55, up $0.20 from its September outlook, and expects to deliver free cash flow in excess of $700
