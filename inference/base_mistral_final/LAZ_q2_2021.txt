 

Lazard reported record operating revenue for the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by strong results across the firm. Financial advisory revenue increased by 61% in the second quarter, reflecting broad-based activity across sectors, market cap, and regions. The global private capital advisory franchise had a strong quarter, serving financial sponsors with new fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions. Asset management operating revenue reached an all-time high for the quarter and first half of the year, with strong incentive fees, primarily from European equity strategies. The firm continues to invest in people, technology, and distribution effort, as well as the development of new and existing funds and the scaling up of its platforms. Lazard expects that its financial advisory revenue in the second half of 2021 will be higher than the first half, assuming current macroeconomic conditions. The firm's asset management business is seeing demand for global and international equities, as well as its quantitative and fixed income strategies. The firm continues to invest in growth across the firm and is maintaining its cost discipline. The global macroeconomic environment continues to strengthen, and market conditions remain excellent for both the financial advisory and asset management businesses. The forces driving global strategic activity remain in place, and the pandemic is driving structural changes in the real economy. The firm is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these trends.
