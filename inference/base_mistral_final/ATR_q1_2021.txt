Aptar, Inc. reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021, with an adjusted EBITDA margin comparable to the prior year. The company's food and beverage segment delivered a stellar performance, driven by strong demand for innovative food dispensing closures and price increases.

Aptar's pharma segment saw strong demand for injectable components and active material science solutions, including those for COVID-19 vaccine distributions and test kits. However, certain pharma customers drew down inventory levels of allergy and other respiratory treatment delivery devices due to fewer non-critical doctor visits and the lower incidence of cold and flu illnesses. In the beverage market, sales grew modestly on the resin price adjustments, though demand was below the prior year. In the beauty and home segment, sales to the personal care and home care markets increased, while sales to the beauty market declined due to continued low level of retail beauty activity related to the ongoing pandemic related lockdowns.
