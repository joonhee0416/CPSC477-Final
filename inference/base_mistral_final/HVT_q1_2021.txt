 2021 Q1 Earnings Call Summary

Havertys reported a 31.8% increase in delivered sales in Q1 2021 over the same period last year. The company's gross profit margin increased by 160 basis points, and income before income tax increased by $23.1 million. Havertys' balance sheet showed an increase in inventories and customer deposits, and the company ended the quarter with $210 million in cash and cash equivalents.
