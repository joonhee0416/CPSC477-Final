 

Chemed Corporation's VITAS Healthcare segment, which provides hospice care services, experienced a decline in nursing home admissions due to disruptions in the senior housing occupancy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in nursing home admissions led to a decrease in the average daily census of VITAS, despite an increase in hospital-generated admissions. The company anticipates that senior housing occupancy will begin to normalize in the second half of 2021, leading to an estimated 4% decline in VITAS' 2021 revenue prior to Medicare Cap, a decrease of approximately 5% in average daily census, and an estimated full-year adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.4%. Roto-Rooter, another business segment of Chemed Corporation, is forecasted to achieve 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6% with an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of 26%.
