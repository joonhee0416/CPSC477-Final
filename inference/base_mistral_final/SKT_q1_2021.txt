Tanger Outlets reported a strong first quarter with domestic traffic returning to 97% of 2019 levels, despite February being impacted by severe weather and operating at 20% fewer hours. The company's focus on rebuilding occupancy and driving leasing has led to a 300 basis-point improvement on a cash basis and a 390 basis-point improvement on a straight-line basis compared to reported Q4 2020 spreads. The company expects to see improvement in rents in the long term as positive traffic and sales trends support better rents. In the near term, the company anticipates pressure on retenanting spreads as it fills recaptured space that was at rental rates above the portfolio average.

The company believes a comparison to 2019 is more relevant as it started to feel the impacts of the pandemic during March of last year.
