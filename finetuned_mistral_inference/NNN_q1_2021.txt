"1 Earnings Call Summary

The company announced an increase in its 2021 core FFO guidance from a range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share. The increase was driven by better-than-expected rent collections and the results from the first quarter. The company's portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform well, with occupancy remaining above its long-term average of 98%. The company collected 97% of rents due for the first quarter and 98% of rents due for the month of April, with most of the remaining uncollected rent being deferred rent that will be collected later this year. The company only forgave 0.1% of its first quarter rents. The company's two largest bankruptcies were resolved in favorable fashion, with Chuck E. Cheese's and Ruby Tuesday affirming their leases in exchange for temporary base rent reductions. The company acquired 29 new properties in the quarter for just under $106 million"
