"atsco reported record-breaking financial results for the second quarter, with earnings per share jumping 64% and sales growing 36%. Gross profits increased by 50%, and operating margins expanded by 220 basis points. The company's two new acquisitions, TEC and Acme, performed well. Watsco is looking to expand in the $50 billion North American market and hopes to find more companies to join its family. The company's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, with growth rates among active users outpacing nonusers and attrition among customers using the technology being lower. The company's digital selling platforms, OnCall Air and CreditForComfort, have helped modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners and contributed to the sale of higher efficiency systems. The balance sheet remains in pristine condition, with only a small amount of debt. Watsco has plenty of capacity and ambitions to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions."
