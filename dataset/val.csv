CNS_q4_2021.txt,"Joining me are our chief executive officer, Bob Steers; our president, Joe Harvey; and our chief financial officer, Matt Stadler.
Further, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
My remarks will focus on our as-adjusted results.
Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $1.24 per share compared with $0.76 in the prior year's quarter and $1.06 sequentially.
The fourth quarter of 2021 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation-to-revenue ratio and effective tax rate, respectively.
Revenue was a record $159.7 million for the quarter compared with $116.6 million in the prior year's quarter and $154.3 million sequentially.
The increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management and open-end funds and higher performance fees from certain institutional accounts when compared with the third quarter.
Our implied effective fee rate was 58.1 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 57.5 basis points in the third quarter.
Excluding performance fees, our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points, and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57.3 basis points.
Operating income was a record $82.6 million in the quarter compared with $49.4 million in the prior year's quarter and $70.4 million sequentially.
Our operating margin increased to a record 51.7% from 45.6% last quarter, primarily due to the cumulative adjustment mentioned a moment ago, which reduced compensation and benefits to reflect actual amounts to be paid.
Expenses decreased 8.1% when compared with the third quarter as lower compensation and benefits was partially offset by higher G&A.
The compensation-to-revenue ratio, which included the cumulative adjustment was 26.16% for the quarter.
For the year, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 32.22%.
The increase in G&A was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment, increased hosted and sponsored conferences, and higher recruitment fees.
And the increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds.
Our effective tax rate, which was 25.36% for the quarter, included a cumulative adjustment to bring the rate to 26.15% for the year.
The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in a nondeductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre-tax base.
Our firm liquidity totaled $248.2 million at quarter-end, compared with $241 million last quarter.
Firm liquidity as of December 31 reflected the payment of a special cash dividend in December of $60.3 million or $1.25 per share.
Over the past 12 years, we have paid a total of $15.25 per share in special dividends, and we continue to be debt-free.
Assets under management totaled a record $106.6 billion at December 31, an increase of $9.4 billion or 10% from September 30.
The increase was due to net inflows of $1.8 billion and market appreciation of $9.1 billion, partially offset by distributions of $1.6 billion.
This marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we have recorded net inflows.
Bob Steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.
And now, I'd like to briefly discuss a few items as we begin the new year.
First, regarding our expected compensation-to-revenue ratio.
We intend to balance anticipated revenue growth from year-end assets under management that exceeded our full-year assets under management by about 13%.
With a disciplined approach toward adding human capital, in addition to the full-year impact from the new hires we made last year, we plan on making controlled investments in order to broaden our product offerings, expand our public and private distribution efforts, and most importantly, to maintain our industry-leading investment performance.
As a result, we expect that our compensation-to-revenue ratio will increase to 33.75% and from the 32.22% recorded in 2021.
Continuing with the theme of investing in our business, we expect G&A to increase 10% to 15% from the $47.2 million we recorded in 2021.
We intend to make incremental investments this year in technology, including the implementation of new systems that will add efficiencies and expand our capabilities, cloud migration, and upgrades to our infrastructure and security.
We will also make investments in global marketing, focused on hosting virtual and in-person conferences, as well as expanding our digital footprint.
And we expect that travel and entertainment costs will increase as global conditions begin to return to normal.
We expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 26.15% in 2022.
And finally, you will recall that a year ago, we noted that we were anticipating the redemption of $1 billion global real estate institutional account in 2021.
I am pleased to inform you that not only do we continue to manage this account, but the client has also added assets to it, and therefore, we no longer consider this account to be at risk.
Today, I will review our investment performance, and discuss the macro environment and its impacts on our asset classes.
Four weeks into January, the fourth quarter of last year seems far away, but it was very strong for equities.
2021 closed with momentum and expectations for post-pandemic economic recovery, earnings growth, stimulus, and appetite for risk-taking.
Our largest asset class, U.S. REITs, was the best performing sector in the S&P, returning over 16% in the quarter.
For the full year, our asset classes performed well, with U.S. REITs up 41%, global real estate up 26%, listed infrastructure up 15%, resource equities up 24%, and preferred is up nearly 3%.
With the new year, however, the market has finally focused on rising inflation, which, as we shared our views with you last year, will likely persist.
With the last reading at 7%, CPI is currently at the largest gap to the federal funds rate in our professional lifetimes.
Reversion of that gap will come by way of both monetary tightening, as well as from inflation normalizing at a lower rate.
We believe inflation could stabilize in the high 2% ZIP code or 100 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic trend line.
The interest rate and adjustment process will reshuffle the deck of winning and losing asset classes and sectors while exposing vulnerabilities from risk-seeking borrowers.
We believe that the U.S. economy will continue to enjoy above-trend growth, supported by a prolonged and oscillating recovery as the pandemic ebbs and flows.
Earnings sensitivity to inflation should be a key differentiator in performance to counteract the impending interest rate adjustment.
Looking at our performance scorecard.
In the fourth quarter, eight of nine core strategies outperformed or equaled their benchmarks.
For the last 12 months, nine of nine core strategies outperformed.
Measured by AUM, 99% of our portfolios are outperforming benchmarks on a one-year basis compared with 79% last quarter.
The improvement was attributable primarily to global real estate, which improved from 25% outperforming in the third quarter to 95% outperforming as of year-end.
For both three and five years, 100% of AUM are outperforming.
Credit goes to our investment leaders, John Cheigh, our CIO; and Chris Parliman, chief administrative officer, in guiding our teams to these outstanding results.
In light of the inflation situation, I'll kick off our asset class review by highlighting our multi-strategy real assets portfolio, the benchmark for which returned 21% in 2021.
This portfolio is designed to provide equity-like returns, inflation sensitivity, and diversification.
We outperformed the benchmark by 340 basis points for the year, which included outperformance in all five asset class sleeves, as well as asset allocation alpha by our portfolio manager, Vince Childers.
This portfolio is designed to perform best in environments of rising or unexpected inflation.
Commodities and resource equities provided the most inflation sensitivity while real estate is driven more by economic growth and infrastructure tends to be an all-weather performer.
Valuations of these listed real assets are as cheap as they've been to equities in 20 years.
Meantime, the beta to equities is just 0.6 times.
We recently published a white paper on this strategy and its constituent asset classes and is available on our website.
Our three core real estate strategies: U.S., global and international outperformed in both the quarter and year.
As mentioned, global real estate returned 26% with significant dispersion by region.
The U.S. returned 41%, Europe returned 9% and Asia returned 4%.
To address the inflation and interest rate question on prospective performance, earnings sensitivity and replacement cost dynamics should help listed real estate.
Globally, these companies' cash flows should accelerate to an average of 12% over the next few years compared with their long-term growth rate of 5%.
U.S. REIT returns have averaged 10.8% during periods of rising bond yields accompanied by rising growth, while in periods of rising yields with declining growth, returns have been flat.
Comparatively, private real estate unleveraged returns have averaged 10.7% in high-inflation environments versus 6.5% in low-inflation environments.
The asset class returned 15% in 2021, compared with 22% for global equities lagging for the second year.
We outperformed our benchmark for the quarter and year.
Sector dispersion was wide with over 40 percentage points best to worst.
While certain pandemic-challenged sectors, namely passenger rails, toll roads, and airports, restrained performance, the ongoing economic recovery should provide tailwinds for these sectors going forward.
Reflecting the income and stable cash flow growth profile of infrastructure, I'd characterize infrastructure generally as steady Eddie.
That is -- it provides solid returns in most market regimes, while not at the top of the charts nor at the bottom.
In part due to President Biden's now passed infrastructure spending legislation, we are seeing broadening allocations in institutional portfolios and increased flows in wealth.
Preferred securities portfolios had modest negative returns in the fourth quarter but performed well versus fixed income for the full year.
For the quarter and the year, we outperformed benchmarks in both our core and low-duration strategies.
This year, likely we'll test fixed-income performance generally based on our review for rising bond yields.
Our portfolios are positioned defensively against increases in interest rates with duration of 2.4 years in our low-duration strategy and 4.0 years in our core preferred strategy.
After high yield, preferreds offer the second-highest yields in fixed income and offer meaningful tax advantages for the taxable investor due to the high percentage of qualified dividend income that they produce.
In terms of our private real estate initiative, we have commenced our investment process and have closed on several property acquisitions for both our income strategy and our opportunistic or capital appreciation strategy.
This year, we will look to add a real estate investment strategist as part of our expansion of multi-strategy capabilities to help our teams and clients allocate between listed and private real estate and execute thematic and strategic research.
We look forward to sharing our progress on this initiative in the future.
In closing, we are very positive about the allocation trends we are seeing for our asset classes.
In the institutional channel, we see a greater need to allocate to real assets.
By example, in the private market, dry powder and private equity funds is at $390 billion for real estate and $300 billion for infrastructure.
Investors are becoming more comfortable with listed allocations to complement private, despite greater measured volatility.
Some investors want real assets with liquidity, particularly in the endowment and foundation and Healthcare segments where some plans liquidity has been challenged.
In our early stage pipeline, we have some sovereign wealth opportunities where the plan sponsors are making initial allocations to listed real estate and infrastructure.
We would expect those initial small allocations to grow meaningfully to make it worthwhile for those plan sponsors to research the asset classes and oversee additional managers.
In the wealth channel, we are seeing earlier-stage adoption of private real asset allocations.
As we've seen in other markets, this will help drive listed allocations over time.
We believe the inflation environment will help provide additional support for these trends.
Finally, manager consolidation and conversions from passive to active are trends also in our favor as our performance continues to be excellent.
2021 was a record-breaking year in myriad ways for Cohen & Steers.
It marked our 35th anniversary and 17 years as a public company.
For the quarter and year, we achieved a record number of records, driven by improving fundamentals, a rebounding economy, accompanied by the return of meaningful inflation.
And for the first time in over a decade, the prospect of sustained Fed tightening.
As Matt discussed, assets under management increased to a record $106 billion at year-end, driven by our 10th consecutive quarter of firmwide net inflows.
Both open-end fund and advisory channels ended the quarter with record assets under management.
For the full year, we also achieved record gross and net inflows.
Open-end fund and advisory gross sales increased 11% and 13% to $19.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.
Most notably, open-end fund net inflows rose 62% year over year to a record $8.8 billion, while the advisory channel also registered a record $1.9 billion of net inflows.
Firmwide organic growth was 12% for the year.
The seemingly sudden rise of inflation and the expectation from multiple rounds of Fed tightening have put into stark relief the importance and value of portfolio allocations to actively managed real asset strategies across client portfolios to enhance returns and provide diversification.
The wealth channel was by far our strongest business segment and achieved multiple milestones in the quarter.
Net inflows in that channel were a record $2.5 billion for a 22% organic growth rate and represented our 12th consecutive quarter of positive net flows.
Importantly, net flows in the quarter were not just strong but also diverse, with meaningful contributions from each of the wirehouse, regional brokerage, and RIA segments.
In addition, DCIO open-end fund net inflows were a record $476 million and marked the 14th consecutive quarter of net inflows.
DCIO assets in our open-end funds ended the year at a record $6 billion.
Our non-U.S. open-end funds registered net inflows of $45 million in the quarter and a record $202 million for the full year.
We will continue to invest to support growth in this important channel, and we expect that flows will continue on an upward trajectory.
For the year, the powerful combination of strong absolute and relative performance derived from our unique and diversifying asset classes resulted in 25% organic growth in wealth and industry-leading market share as well.
Our U.S. global real estate and preferred securities funds achieved market share records of 33%, 12%, and 46%, respectively, against other comparable actively managed funds.
2021 was a record year for the institutional advisory channel as well with $1.9 billion of net inflows.
However, 2021 was also a year in which we reorganized our sales leadership and converted to a regional approach to our institutional sales coverage.
We enter 2022 fully staffed and prepared to go higher and deeper into the global institutional marketplace.
In the quarter, the advisory channel had net outflows of $456 million.
These outflows were driven by a single and unexpected client termination of $400 million.
However, not included in the headline advisory flow results was $564 million of net new mandates from institutional clients, which were invested into our open-end funds.
Other full-year achievements for the advisory channel include positive net flows from each of the U.S., EMEA, and Asian markets.
Additionally, all of our core strategies, U.S. real estate, global real estate, global listed infrastructure, and preferred securities registered net inflows.
The pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandates has increased dramatically $900 million in September to $2.1 billion, another new record.
New awards in the quarter totaled $1.3 billion and included our first relationship in Africa, a $300 million global listed infrastructure mandate.
Sub-advisory flows in the quarter were subdued.
Net outflows in Japan were $242 million and distributions totaled $276 million.
Sub-advisory net outflows ex Japan in the quarter were a modest $56 million.
At the risk of sounding overly optimistic, we believe our current momentum and growth prospects have never been brighter, driven as always, by our industry-leading investment results.
It bears repeating that virtually 100% of our AUMs are outperforming their benchmarks for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year time periods, a truly remarkable accomplishment.
Looking ahead, the combination of industry-leading investment performance, rising demand for real asset strategies and our plans for new product introductions designed to meet this demand has us poised for continued organic growth.
In addition to our open-end fund organic growth, next month, we plan to market the first new listed real estate securities closed-end fund in over nine years, supported by an exceptionally strong and deep syndicate.
And as I've discussed, the institutional advisory channel entered this year with a record pipeline, fully staffed, and the reorganization behind them.
Also under new leadership, our EMEA wholesale business is also poised to deliver meaningful organic growth.
To capitalize on all of this momentum, this year, we plan to launch multiple new initiatives which will seek to position Cohen & Steers at the intersection of public and private real estate markets through the introduction of vehicles tailored to the unique requirements of both the institutional and wealth marketplaces.
These initiatives are designed to take us higher and deeper into real assets and position us for continued future growth.
","Cohen & Steers reported record earnings of $1.24 per share in Q4 2021, driven by higher revenue and operating margin. Revenue reached $159.7 million, primarily due to increased assets under management and performance fees. Assets under management reached a record $106.6 billion, driven by net inflows of $1.8 billion. The company expects its compensation-to-revenue ratio to increase to 33.75% in 2022 and G&A expenses to increase by 10-15%. Despite rising inflation, the company believes its real asset strategies are well-positioned to benefit from earnings sensitivity and replacement cost dynamics. Notably, the institutional channel saw a record $2.1 billion in awarded but unfunded mandates, while the wealth channel achieved a 22% organic growth rate. The company also plans to introduce new initiatives that will position it at the intersection of public and private real estate markets, including a new closed-end fund and vehicles tailored to institutional and wealth investors."
AIR_q2_2021.txt,"I appreciate you all joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2021 results.
In particular, more than two-thirds of our people are essential workers, and they have continued to come to work every day, enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers.
I'm very proud of our entire team.
Regarding the business, as we indicated last quarter, overall, we have seen our commercial volumes stabilize and continued strong performance out of our government business.
While we remain in a difficult and uncertain environment, we are encouraged by the stabilization, as well as the positive developments regarding the vaccines, which not only will protect our people, but should also ultimately lead to more travel and a recovery in our commercial markets.
With that, turning to the quarter, our sales decreased 28% year-over-year from $561 million to $404 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% from $0.64 per share to $0.31 per share.
Our sales to commercial customers decreased 48%, and our sales to government and defense customers increased 13%.
For the quarter, sales to government and defense customers were 52% of our total sales.
Our Aviation Services segment grew 6% sequentially from our first quarter.
This was a result of increased volume in our MRO business, which is seasonally higher in Q1 over -- Q2 over Q1, as well as the continued strength of our government business.
Our commercial parts volumes overall were relatively stable throughout the quarter and remained above the lows we saw in April and May.
That said, I am particularly encouraged by our margin improvement progress.
Over the last several quarters, we have reduced our footprint across the enterprise, decreased our indirect and overhead spending, exited or restructured several underperforming contracts and divested a loss-making non-core business.
You are now starting to see the results of these actions in our adjusted operating margins, which improved meaningfully from 2.5% to 4% sequentially on stable revenue.
With respect to cash, we generated $28 million from operating activities from continuing operations and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further improving our already strong balance sheet position and putting our net leverage below 1 times EBITDA.
We also continue to add significant new business that positions us for growth going forward.
Our CFM56 partnership with Fortress solidifies a source of supply to meet growing demand for used serviceable material on the -5B and the -7B engine variants.
We expect demand for USM to increase across the board as we emerge from the pandemic and to be particularly strong for these engine platforms.
Also, our follow-on contract from the Navy to support the C-40 aircraft recognizes our performance over the last five years and provides for an expanded statement of work over the next five years.
It's worth noting that this was the first time that this contract was awarded to an incumbent, which speaks to the high-quality of our service.
Additionally, our 10-year agreement with Honeywell to be its sole authorized service center for 737 MAX Electronic Bleed Air System components positions us to support MAX operators worldwide when that aircraft to return to service.
These new contracts, along with others we have announced over the last several months, such as the Unison expansion and extension, represent nearly $1.7 billion in total contract value captured so far this fiscal year.
This demonstrates the unique value of our Aviation Services offerings, and these business wins will help accelerate our recovery coming out of the downturn.
Our sales in the quarter of $403.6 million were down 28% or $157.3 million year-over-year, driven by the impacts of the pandemic on commercial passenger flying activity.
Sequentially, Aviation Services sales were up 5.9% or $21.4 million, while sales in Expeditionary Services were down 50% or $18.6 million.
The sequential decline in Expeditionary Services was driven by two factors.
First, the exit of the composites business was completed at the end of Q1, and this business generated $7 million of revenue in Q1 and zero in the current quarter.
Second, as previously discussed, mobility had a particularly strong Q1 due to elevated shipments of pallets.
Within Aviation Services, our government and defense business was up 19% or $30 million year-over-year, reflecting strong performance on existing contracts.
In the quarter, as well as in Q1, our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corps generated strong revenue due to elevated activity on the program.
Gross profit margin in the quarter increased to 17.2% from 15.3% in the prior year quarter, driven by the CARES Act payroll support.
On a sequential basis, gross profit margin was up 12 -- was up from 12.1% in our first quarter, reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and to exit underperforming contracts and product lines.
SG&A expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $38 million or 9.4% of sales, down $13 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure.
Of this improvement, approximately $3.2 million was the result of temporary reductions in compensation and benefits, which we restored beginning on December 1.
As an update on our previous disclosure, we have been in settlement discussions with the Department of Justice regarding an investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act.
During the quarter, we recorded $6 million of additional accrual and discontinued operation, which brings our total reserve for this matter to $8 million based on our latest settlement offer.
We generated $27.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations for the quarter.
This is net of a use of cash of $6.8 million as we continue to reduce the size of our accounts receivable financing program.
Excluding the accounts receivable financing program, cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $34.4 million.
Inventory decreased $12.7 million during the quarter.
Our net debt at quarter end was $112.1 million, down $37 million from $149.3 million at the end of Q1.
Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong with net leverage of 0.95 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $110 million and unused capacity under our revolver of approximately $390 million.
As such, we're well positioned to fund what we expect to be unique opportunities to grow our business over the coming quarters.
Overall, we are pleased with our results given the current environment and also pleased with the progress we have made in improving our operating efficiency.
As I mentioned, for many reasons, we are encouraged by the multiple vaccines coming to market and the plans for distribution.
As the vaccines are distributed and case numbers decline, we expect travel restrictions to be lifted and people to start flying again.
Until then, we expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment, and we will continue to focus on driving cash flow, as well as continued margin improvement.
We will also remain focused on capturing new business, I am confident that our strong balance sheet, combined with the airlines' increasing desire for our lower-cost value-added services, will lead to even more growth opportunities.
","Despite a 28% decline in sales to $404 million, the company witnessed stabilization in commercial volumes and strong government business performance. Aviation Services grew 6% sequentially, driven by increased MRO business and government strength. Adjusted operating margins improved to 4% due to cost-cutting measures and restructuring. Notably, the company secured significant new business contracts valued at $1.7 billion, positioning it for growth. The company's balance sheet remains strong with low net leverage and ample liquidity, enabling it to pursue more opportunities. As vaccines roll out, the company anticipates a recovery in travel and continued focus on cash flow, margin improvement, and new business acquisition."
AIR_q3_2021.txt,"I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 results.
I would like to begin the call by once again recognizing our employees.
Their unwavering commitment, professionalism and flexibility have allowed us to continue to support our customers without interruption over the past year.
Turning to the quarter.
Our sales decreased 26% year-over-year from $553 million to $410 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 45% from $0.57 per share to $0.37 per share.
Our sales to commercial customers decreased 42% and our sales to government and defense customers increased 4%.
For the quarter sales and government -- to government and defense customers were 49% of our total sales.
As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we expected relatively stable revenue which is what we saw in this quarter with sales up 2% sequentially.
In MRO we did see a sequential increase in hangar activity due to increased demand supporting anticipated leisure travel.
In our commercial parts activities revenue was relatively stable but we were encouraged to see orders across a broader range of customers during the quarter than what we saw in Q2.
Our government businesses, which have performed very well over the past year, continued their strong performance delivering another quarter of year-over-year growth.
Regarding profitability, our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 19% sequentially reflecting our continued margin improvement progress.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the benefit of the CARES Act, our gross margin improved sequentially from 13.9% to 16.1% and our operating margin improved from 4% to 5%.
We have now more than doubled our adjusted operating margin over the past two quarters while operating in a stable revenue environment.
We are also proud to have fully reinstated salaries and 401(k) benefits at the beginning of the third quarter which had been a priority for us as we look to attract and retain top talent.
Even with the compensation restoration, we were able to still deliver a full point of adjusted operating margin improvement.
That improvement reflects the operating leverage that we have created through cost reductions, efficiency gains and portfolio reshaping over the last year.
Turning to cash, once again, we were cash flow positive in the quarter even while making investments in new business wins.
We generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and remain in a strong balance sheet position with 1.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
Speaking of new business, we also continued to secure and execute new wins during the quarter.
We expanded our distribution relationship with GE subsidiary Unison on a five-year program from the US Air Force to provide and repair and overhaul of F-16 accessories and extended our support of the Navy's H-60 Seahawk platform for an additional seven years.
We also began operations on our previously announced Honeywell 737 MAX EBAS contract.
Our sales in the quarter of $410.3 million were down 25.8% or $142.8 million year-over-year driven by the reduction in commercial passenger flying activity due to COVID-19.
Sequentially sales were up 1.7% with commercial sales up 7% driven by MRO volumes and government and defense sales down 3.3% driven by the scheduled reduction in activity and our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the US Marine Corps.
Gross profit margin in the quarter increased to 21% from 11.8% in the prior-year quarter driven primarily by the CARES Act payroll support.
On an adjusted basis, excluding the CARES Act support and other items, gross profit margin was 16.1% consistent with the 16% in the year-ago quarter despite the significant decline in sales.
Sequentially adjusted gross profit was up meaningfully from 13.9% to 16.1% reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and drive efficiency.
Regarding Expeditionary Services specifically.
Gross profit margin increased to 17% from 0.4% in the prior-year quarter, driven by the divestiture of the composites business and improved performance at the mobility operation.
SG&A expenses were $44.9 million for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $42.8 million or 10.4% of sales down $9 million from the prior-year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure.
With respect to our accounting for the CARES Act payroll support, we have fully recognized our deferred credit in Q3 and we will no longer have income associated with the CARES Act support.
We have an $8.8 million promissory note associated with the CARES Act, which we expect to repay during the fourth quarter.
Also, we continue to have certain foreign subsidiaries that are eligible for stimulus provided by foreign governments.
Consistent with prior quarters, government subsidies, including the CARES Act are reflected in our GAAP income primarily as a reduction in our cost of sales.
However, we exclude these benefits from our adjusted results.
Other adjustments during the quarter included $4 million of loss provision and exit costs for commercial programs contracts, $1.5 million of which reduced sales.
In addition, there was a gain of $4.3 million related to a legal settlement, which we have excluded from our adjusted results.
Also during the quarter, we reached a tentative agreement with the Department of Justice to settle the investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act for approximately $11.5 million.
As such, we recognized a charge in the quarter of $4.2 million in discontinued operations.
As a reminder, we completed the exit of our airlift business in the fourth quarter of last year.
In the quarter, we generated $17.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations.
We reduced inventories by $21 million from our second quarter as we continued to focus on working capital management.
Our net debt at quarter-end was $108.4 million, down from $112.1 million at the end of Q2 and from $171.1 million at the end of Q3 of last year.
In addition, our accounts receivable financing program has decreased by $37.2 million over the last year from $85.6 million at the end of the year-ago quarter to $48.4 million.
Our overall leverage and liquidity remain strong with net debt of 1.1 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $99.2 million and unused capacity under our revolver of over $400 million.
Overall, we are encouraged by the widely reported recent increases in demand for domestic leisure travel and we remain optimistic about the broader commercial market recovery.
We expect modest sequential improvement in Q4 and continued improvement thereafter as the vaccine is distributed and current travel restrictions, which are impacting some of our larger international customers, are lifted.
As that occurs and our revenue recovers, we remain committed to leveraging our current cost structure to drive continued margin improvement.
In addition, our balance sheet puts us in a very strong position to be able to fund growth.
We expect to make investments in our USM and distribution activities as well as to continue to invest in our technology and digital initiatives.
These actions along with the continued strength of our government business and the early signs of a recovery in our commercial markets give us increasing confidence that we will emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger and more profitable company.
","In Q3, the company's sales declined 26% to $410 million, primarily driven by a 42% decrease in commercial sales due to the pandemic. However, government and defense sales increased 4% to 49% of total sales. Despite the sales decline, the company's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved 19% sequentially to $0.37. Excluding the benefit of the CARES Act, gross and operating margins increased sequentially due to cost reductions and efficiency gains. Adjusted gross margin improved to 16.1%, reflecting the company's progress in margin improvement. The company generated $18 million in cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with positive net debt and unused capacity under its credit facility. The company's government businesses continued to perform well, and it secured new business wins during the quarter, including an expanded distribution relationship with GE subsidiary Unison and continued support of the Navy's H-60 Seahawk platform. The company expects modest sequential improvement in Q4 as vaccine distribution progresses and travel restrictions are lifted."
RS_q3_2020.txt,"We are very pleased with our third quarter results, which once again demonstrates the strength of Reliance's resilient business model.
Our diverse product mix and end-market exposures, along with our decentralized operating structure, enabled us to quickly respond to varying fluid market conditions.
Our gross profit margin expanded 200 basis points from the prior quarter to a record 32.4%, significantly exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30% on net sales of $2.09 billion.
Our increased gross profit margin, combined with diligent expense control, increased our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $1.80, a 37.5% increase from the prior quarter, and generated strong cash flow from operations of $296.3 million.
Even more importantly, we would once again like to express our gratitude to all of our outstanding folks for their hard work and perseverance through one of the most challenging time in our company's history.
Our people are truly the key ingredient of the secret sauce of Reliance, and we would not be where we are today without their unwavering commitment and support.
Our managers maintain their focus on the employee health and safety, including adherence to strict procedures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and improve our safety performance on a year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2019.
We continue to support our employees and their families as well as our customers, suppliers and communities in a safe, positive, sustainable manner.
Getting back to our third quarter financial results.
Our shipments surpassed our expectations, increasing 5.9% over the prior quarter despite typical third quarter normal seasonal customer shutdowns and vacation schedules.
Improved demand in the major in the majority our end markets as the economy continued to slowly reopen following COVID-19-related shutdowns and project delays in the second quarter of 2020 drove this strength.
In addition, our toll processing volumes increased materially compared to the second quarter levels as automotive production continued to ramp up.
As a reminder, since we do not take ownership of the metal, our toll processing volumes are not reflected in our tons sold metric.
Metal pricing began to improve in the third quarter as mill price increases from many of the products we sell were implemented, with announcements for further price increases continuing into the fourth quarter.
Despite these mill price increases, our average selling price per ton sold in the third quarter was down 4.3% compared to the second quarter, primarily as a result of product mix changes that Karla will discuss in more detail.
The 200 basis points improvement in our gross profit margin to a record 32.4% was the major highlight of our third quarter financial performance, which drove a 40.6% increase in our non-GAAP pre-tax income over the prior quarter.
The primary contributor to our record gross profit margin was a significant rebound in our tolling businesses that service the automotive market, which generally operate at higher gross profit margins than our companywide average.
In addition, shifts in our diverse product mix, along with our ability to implement price increases at the time of mill announcements, collectively drove incremental increases in our third quarter gross profit margin.
While we expect that the impact of certain of these factors will be temporary, we believe our managers will continue to successfully leverage the significant investments we have made to expand our value-added processing capabilities to support a sustainable higher gross profit margin.
In regard to conditions in our key end markets.
Demand in nonresidential construction, the largest market we serve, continue to slowly increase during the third quarter due to healthy bidding activity for new projects and the restart of projects that had previously been put on hold.
Quoting activity remains strong for projects related to transmission towers and military, schools and municipalities as well as large warehouses, data processing centers and assisted living facilities.
We have also seen an increase in certain infrastructure projects, such as roads and highways and water treatment plants.
As such, we remain cautiously optimistic that demand for nonresidential construction activity will continue to improve through the end of the year based on healthy backlogs and positive customer sentiment.
Demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market rebounded significantly in the third quarter as automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills continued to ramp up production following COVID-19 shutdowns in the second quarter.
We simultaneously increased our processing volumes at our toll processing operations in both the U.S. and Mexico to support increased activities, and we were pleased to be able to recall the majority of our furloughed employees to our tolling operations.
We remain committed to expanding our presence in toll processing in response to ongoing solid demand trends.
Earlier this month, we commenced operations at a new facility in Kentucky.
We will also soon break ground on a new greenfield tolling facility in Texas.
These new facilities expand our carbon steel tolling capacity and will position us to better service our toll processing customers, primarily metals producers and their end users in the Ohio Valley and the Eastern United States as well as in the Southwestern U.S. and Mexico.
Needless to say, our outlook for our tolling operations remains positive.
Demand in heavy industry for both agriculture and construction equipment remained generally consistent with the second quarter.
Production schedules in some areas have begun to increase, and we remain cautiously optimistic our businesses servicing the large industrial market should improve from current levels through the remainder of the year.
Semiconductor demand steadily improved from the second quarter of 2020, and the market continues to be strong.
Leading indicators for semiconductor space currently points to a more positive development in the fourth quarter and early 2021, and we believe we are very well positioned to participate in any improvement.
I'd like to start by noting that our aerospace businesses service diverse segments.
Commercial aerospace represents about half of our aerospace exposure.
In the third quarter, commercial aerospace demand continued to decline as reductions in travel due to COVID-19 persisted.
In response to reduced commercial airline build rates that we expect to continue at low levels in the near term, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges related to facility closures, workforce reductions and a negative outlook at certain of our businesses servicing the commercial aerospace market.
Conversely, demand remains strong in the military, defense and space portions of our aerospace business, which represents the other half of our aerospace exposure.
We continue to see opportunities to expand our participation in defense, which will help offset some of the weakness on the commercial side.
We will continue to monitor and assess the health of each of our aerospace businesses and take appropriate cost-reduction actions, if and when needed, to ensure the continued long-term profitability of these businesses.
Finally, demand in the energy sector, which is mainly oil and natural gas, remains under significant pressure.
As I highlighted on our last call, we have taken proactive cost reduction measures throughout 2020, including the consolidation of certain facilities and head count reduction.
As a result, we believe we are well positioned to maintain our presence as a dominant player in the energy spaces and support any further recovery in that market.
One bright spot, in particular, is the renewable energy space in which we sell a significant amount of metal for solar and wind power projects.
Turning to capital allocation.
Our countercyclical cash flow generation enables us to remain flexible and opportunistic as we allocate capital for both growth and stockholder return opportunities in both good times and bad.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2020 is weighted toward growth activities that supports our customers through the addition of innovative equipment and advanced technology to further expand and strengthen our value-added processing capabilities.
We have increased our 2020 capital expenditure budget by $80 million to a total of $270 million in response to opportunities to better service our customers, including the toll processing expansion in Texas and to maintain and upgrade our equipment to provide our customers with the highest-quality products and services.
On the M&A front, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of prospective opportunities.
As always, we evaluate potential candidates using stringent criteria to ensure the best possible fit within our family of companies.
We continue to seek well-run profitable businesses that possess strong management teams and superior levels of customer service with a focus on safety.
Acquisitions must also complement our product and end-market diversification strategy and be immediately accretive to our earnings.
In regard to stockholder returns, we are pleased to maintain our payment of a regularly quarterly dividend, as we have for 61 consecutive years, without ever suspending payment or reducing our dividend rate.
We've increased our dividend 27 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 13.6% in the first quarter of 2020.
We also repurchased a small amount of our common stock during the third quarter of 2020.
Another key highlight during the quarter was our diligent inventory management.
We continue to rightsize our inventory to reflect current demand levels through reduced buying as well as cross-selling inventory within our expansive network of service centers.
And we are pleased to have achieved our companywide goal of 4.7 inventory turns during the third quarter.
In summary, we are very proud to have improved our financial results amid the unprecedented global uncertainty that continues to materially impact the economy.
Our decentralized structure afforded us the flexibility to immediately respond to rapidly changing demand trends and help preserve our long-term profitability.
It is through their efforts that the unique aspects of our business model were able to really shine through, enabling us to achieve significant gross profit margin expansion to a record 32.4%.
The consistent execution our -- of our resilient business model is a testament to, not only the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies, but also our commitment to: strong pricing discipline; diligent expense control, when needed; inventory management and leveraging our investments in organic growth and innovation.
We believe customers realize increased value in our model during challenging markets as they confidently rely on us to do more for them, often in smaller sizes or on a more frequent basis.
As Reliance continues to evolve as a leading diversified metal solution provider, we will leverage both the knowledge we have acquired while navigating the pandemic and our commitment to continuous improvement and innovation to provide enhanced solutions to our customers and drive stockholder value through increased efficiencies and profitability.
America is going to need Reliance to rebuild.
Our net sales of $2.09 billion for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 22.4% from the third quarter of 2019, with our tons sold down 13.1% and our average selling price down 11%.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, net sales increased 3.3%, with our tons sold up 5.9% and our average selling price per ton sold down 4.3%.
Our tons sold exceeded our expectations of flat to up 2% from the prior quarter as demand in many of our end markets improved, with the most notable strength in nonresidential construction.
Although not included in our tons sold metric, the significant rebound in our toll processing operations contributed meaningfully to our increased sales, with toll processing volumes up 81.5% from the lows experienced in the second quarter of 2020.
And our average selling price per ton sold declined 4.3% compared to the second quarter.
Our lower average selling price in the third quarter was mainly due to shifts in our product mix rather than overall metal pricing trends.
The most significant shift was a 14.9% decrease in our aerospace tons sold in the third quarter, the majority of which was heat-treated aluminum and titanium products, which represent some of the higher-priced products we sell.
Meanwhile, our shipments of flat-rolled carbon steel, which are among our lowest-priced products, increased as a percent of our total shipments, which also reduced our average selling price.
And lastly, our alloy sales now represent a lower portion of our total tons shipped due to the closure of certain of our energy businesses.
Our gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2020 was a record at 32.4% and well above our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%.
This ties our record gross profit margin set in the fourth quarter of 2019 when we recorded LIFO income of $81 million compared to LIFO income of $12.5 million in the current quarter.
On a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe is the best measure of our day-to-day operations, our gross profit margin of 31.8% increased 300 basis points from 28.8% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 160 basis points from 30.2% in the second quarter of 2020.
As Jim highlighted, this is a direct result of the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who, despite challenging circumstances, maintained pricing discipline by focusing on higher-margin orders and providing more value to our customers through our expanded value-added processing capabilities.
And these actions are the key drivers behind our ability to increase and sustain our strong gross profit margin.
During the third quarter, certain other factors contributed to our increased gross profit margin, the impacts of which we believe may be more temporary.
First, a significant rebound in our toll processing volumes drove a meaningful increase in our gross profit margin as our tolling businesses operate at higher margins than our companywide average.
Second, changes in our product mix contributed as our lower-margin contractual commercial aerospace sales declined, while shipments of lower-priced carbon flat-rolled products increased.
Given a lower average overall selling price, value-added charges are a larger component of our sales, which has a positive impact on our gross profit margin.
And third, we were able to enhance our gross profit margin for certain of our carbon steel products as mills announced price increases late in the third quarter.
We recorded LIFO income of $12.5 million or $0.15 of earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020 compared to LIFO income of $40 million or $0.44 of earnings per share in the third quarter of 2019 and LIFO income of $5 million or $0.06 of earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020.
And given our current estimate of $50 million of annual LIFO income in 2020, we expect to record $12.5 million of LIFO income in the fourth quarter of 2020.
As a reminder, we will true-up to our actual LIFO adjustment at December 31.
And our LIFO reserve was $100.1 million at September 30.
Our third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased $75.2 million or 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019 on a 13.1% reduction in shipments.
The decline in SG&A expense was mainly due to reduced variable expenses, such as plant supplies and freight costs, along with lower average head count, which was down 13.8%; as well as lower performance-based compensation.
When compared to the second quarter of 2020, our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased only 2.6% on a 5.9% increase in our tons shipped, demonstrating the efficiencies gained through our state-of-the-art processing equipment along with our continuous improvement and innovation initiative.
During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $14.6 million as we continued to close or merge a few of our smaller locations and wrote off certain intangibles due to our outlook for a more challenging environment in certain markets.
We recorded an additional $14.6 million in nonrecurring charges, comprised of settlement charges related to the termination of multiple small, frozen, defined benefit plans and settlement of an obligation in our SERP plan.
We also recorded $1.8 million in debt restructuring charges related to our financing activities in the quarter for total nonrecurring charges of $31 million in the third quarter of 2020.
We remain solidly profitable in the third quarter of 2020, with non-GAAP pre-tax income of $158 million and a non-GAAP pre-tax margin of 7.6%.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 22.6%, down from 25% in the third quarter of 2019 and up from 20.9% in the second quarter of 2020.
Our lower tax rate was driven by reduced income levels in 2020 attributable to the impacts of COVID-19.
And at this time, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full year of 2020 will be approximately 22.5%.
Non-GAAP net income attributable to Reliance for the third quarter of 2020 was $120.9 million, resulting non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.87, down from $2.39 in the third quarter of 2019 and mainly due to lower pricing, demand levels; and up from $1.36 in the second quarter of 2020 due to our strong gross profit margin and recovering demand.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $1.51 in the third quarter 2020.
Turning to our balance sheet cash flow.
We generated strong cash flow of -- from operations of $296.3 million during the third quarter and $942.8 million during the first nine months of 2020 due to our continued profitable operations and effective working capital management, including a continued focus on rightsizing our inventory levels, which resulted in achieving our inventory turn goal of 4.7 times.
During the quarter, we issued $400 million of 1.3% 5-year senior notes and $500 million of 2.15% 10-year senior notes through a public offering.
We used a portion of the proceeds to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan, and we'll utilize the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Additionally, in early September, we entered into an amended and restated $1.5 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our previous credit agreement and includes an increase option for up to an additional $1 billion.
The facility amendment, combined with the proceeds from the notes offering, have significantly enhanced our liquidity position and extended our debt maturity profile.
At September 30, 2020, our total debt outstanding was $1.66 billion, resulting in a net-debt-to-total-capital ratio of 17.3%.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple was 1.1 times.
And as of the end of the third quarter, no borrowings were outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
In regard to capital allocation, our increased 2020 capital expenditure budget of $270 million includes additional strategic investments to address our customers' needs and drive organic growth.
We will continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend and selectively execute attractive acquisition and share repurchase opportunities.
In the third quarter of 2020, we invested $38.2 million in capital expenditures and returned $41.2 million to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to our outlook.
While macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, based on current expectations and market conditions, we anticipate that overall demand will continue to slowly improve in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We expect shipping volumes will decline in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonal factors, including customer holiday-related shutdowns and fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
But we believe the impact of seasonal factors in the fourth quarter may be less significant than in prior years.
As a result, we estimate our tons sold will be down 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2020.
We anticipate metals pricing, primarily for carbon steel products, will improve due to mill price increases.
However, similar to the drivers behind our average selling price decline in the third quarter, we believe the impact of these price increases will be partially offset by our diverse product mix and declining sales in certain markets, such as aerospace, which typically involves higher-priced products.
As a result, we expect our average selling price in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be flat to up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Looking ahead, we will continue to execute our business model and remain focused on managing the elements of our business that are within our control.
In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results amid the broader macroeconomic uncertainty the pandemic has caused.
Our managers in the field delivered excellent execution as demand began to slowly recover throughout the quarter, maintaining their strategic focus on high levels of customer service and value-added processing.
This, combined with our emphasis on expense control and our ability to respond quickly to market conditions, resulted in yet another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow, enabling us to support our growth and stockholder return priorities.
We believe our people, along with our proven business model, are the keys to the strength and resiliency of our business.
We look forward to improved conditions in the quarters ahead as we work with our employees, customers, suppliers and communities to mitigate the ongoing impact of COVID-19.
","Reliance Steel & Aluminum's Q3 exceeded expectations, with a 37.5% increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $1.80, primarily driven by a record gross profit margin of 32.4%. Despite a 4.3% decline in average selling price per ton sold due to product mix changes, increased gross profit was a major factor. Notably, the company's toll processing volumes rebounded significantly, contributing to higher gross profit margins. Demand in nonresidential construction continued to improve, while aerospace remained weak. However, Reliance anticipates a continued slow improvement in overall demand in Q4 2020. Despite seasonal factors, tons sold are expected to decline by 4% to 6% in Q4, while average selling price is projected to be flat to up 2%. Based on these expectations, the company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per diluted share between $1.30 and $1.40 for Q4."
FN_q1_2020.txt,"With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, chief executive officer; and TS Ng, chief financial officer.
We delivered a strong performance in the first quarter with revenue and earnings that were above our guidance.
Demand trends appear to be stabilizing in most of the end markets we serve, and we're optimistic that we are positioned to deliver strong results in the second quarter.
Revenue in the first quarter was $399 million, a slight decrease from the record fourth quarter as expected with a 6% increase from a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share, exceeding the high end of guidance as gross margins improved to 12% in the quarter.
Looking at our business by end markets.
Optical communications revenue of $302 million was up about $2 million from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of total revenue.
Within optical communications, telecom revenue of $230 million increased 7% from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of optical revenue.
This growth is particularly notable considering we had expected telecom revenue to be flat at best.
Further, we expect this momentum to continue in Q2.
Datacom revenue was $73 million in the quarter, an expected decrease from Q4, of 15%.
Datacom represented 24% of optical communications revenue.
We believe this decline is primarily the result of broader industry trends and not due to execution or competitive issues.
In fact, based on anticipated near-term demand, we believe datacom trends could be nearing the bottom and we expect datacom revenue to be roughly flat in Q2.
By technology, silicon photonics based optical communications revenue decreased from the fourth quarter to $77 million and represented 25% of optical communications revenue.
Revenue from QSFP28 and QSFP56 transceivers was $45 million, down slightly from fourth quarter.
By data rate, 100-gig programs continued to represent nearly half of optical communications' revenue at $147 million.
And products rated at speeds of 400 gig and above were up strongly from the fourth quarter of $38 million or 13% of optical communications revenue.
Looking at our nonoptical communications business.
Revenue moderated sequentially as expected to $97 million from $105 million in Q4.
As anticipated, revenue from industrial lasers declined from the fourth quarter and was $41 million compared to $53 million in Q4.
These same demand trends seem to be persisting, so we anticipated industrial laser revenue to be roughly flat in Q2.
Longer term, we remain optimistic about our potential to further penetrate the industrial laser market as more manufacturers inevitably turn to outsourcing to better compete in this global market that is, in fact, larger than the optical communications market.
Automotive and sensor revenue were both stable at $24 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
Finally, revenue generated from other nonoptical applications grew 15% sequentially to $28 million, mainly from Fabrinet West.
Fabrinet West has been a great success for winning business for our offshore volume manufacturing sites.
We have seen numerous programs migrate from early prototyping in Fabrinet West to volume production in Thailand.
At the same time, Fabrinet West has been an enabler for us to win business in new markets and with new customers that might have otherwise gone to competitors.
As such, we have been focused on establishing a similar model to Fabrinet West in Israel.
We already have a number of customers there, and we believe we have the opportunity to grow our business with these customers as well as attract new ones.
We have signed a lease for a building in [Inaudible] which is a former semiconductor manufacturing facility.
It is already equipped with most of the infrastructure we need for a new product introduction center.
We are currently in the process of setting up SMT lines advance packaging and a failure analysis lab similar to what we have to support NPI in our Bangkok facilities.
We have hired a general manager for Fabrinet Israel and we are targeting to be up and running early next year.
In summary, we believe we are off to a good start to the fiscal year with revenue and earnings that meet our guidance ranges and return to gross margins that were within our target range.
We're optimistic that our telecom strength will continue and the datacom trends appear to be bottoming.
In addition, we're excited to have achieved important milestones toward establishing a second new product introduction facility at Fabrinet Israel.
Combined with our continued leadership as a contract manufacturer for the most complex products, we are very excited about our future.
I will provide you with more details on our performance by end market and our financial results for Q1 as well as our guidance for Q2 for fiscal year 2020.
Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $399.3 million and above the upper end of our guidance range.
Non-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share and was also above our guidance range even after a foreign exchange headwind of $1.9 million and the mark-to-market loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.7 million.
These losses accounted for approximately $0.09 per share.
Now turning to the details of our P&L.
We were pleased to see non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter improve to 12%, a 20-basis-point increase from the fourth quarter as efficiency more than offset the impact of merit increases.
Non-GAAP operating expense was $11.6 million in the first quarter.
As a result, non-GAAP operating income was $36.2 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.1%, flat with the fourth quarter.
Taxes in the quarter were $2.2 million, and our normalized effective tax rate was less than 5%.
We expect our effective tax rate to be 5% to 6% for the full year.
Non-GAAP net income was above our guidance range at $32.2 million in the first quarter or $0.86 per diluted share as I indicated earlier.
On a GAAP basis, which includes share-based compensation expenses and amortizations of debt issuing costs, net income for the first quarter was $25.9 million or $0.69 per diluted share, also above the high end of our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
At the end of the first quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $436.4 million compared to $444.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.6 million and with capex of $6.3 million, free cash flow was an outflow of $3.7 million in the first quarter.
During the quarter, our working capital increased to higher than normal level in support of major new program transfer.
This will begin to self-correct in the second quarter as we start to consume the transfer inventory and collect receivables.
We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter.
As such, $62.2 million remain in our share repurchase program and we will continue to evaluate market condition to opportunistically repurchase shares when possible.
I would now like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
As Seamus described, we expect a strong second quarter and anticipate that revenue will be between $408 million and $416 million.
From a margin perspective, we are optimistic that we will see efficiency continue to drive incremental improvements in non-GAAP gross margin within our target range of 12% to 12.5%.
From an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.94 and GAAP net income per share of $0.74 to $0.77 based on approximately $37.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
In conclusion, we are excited with our strong performance in the quarter.
We remain very positive about our long-term prospects for continued leadership in the marketplace.
","Fabrinet reported a solid Q1, exceeding guidance with revenue of $399.3 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, also above expectations. Optical communications revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $302 million, driven by a 7% increase in telecom revenue to $230 million. Datacom revenue declined 15% to $73 million, but the company anticipates a bottoming trend and expects revenue to stabilize in Q2. Nonoptical communications revenue moderated to $97 million, with industrial laser revenue declining to $41 million. The company is establishing a second Fabrinet site in Israel to support new product introductions. Q2 guidance projects revenue between $408 million and $416 million, with non-GAAP EPS expected to be $0.91-$0.94 and GAAP EPS of $0.74-$0.77. Management remains optimistic about the company's long-term growth prospects."

For information on how to access the replay, please visit our website at mdcholdings.com.
These and other factors that could impact the Company's actual performance are set forth in the Company's third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today.
It should also be noted that SEC Regulation G requires that certain information accompany the use of non-GAAP financial measures.
M.D.C. Holdings posted another quarter of strong operating results, highlighted by year-over-year home sales revenue growth of 33%, homebuilding operating margin expansion of 370 basis points and net income growth of 96%.
Net new order growth for the quarter increased 73% as compared to last year on a sales pace of 6.1 homes per community per month.
These results underscore the excellent homebuilding fundamentals we are currently experiencing across our markets and demonstrate our ability to grow our operations while continuing to improve our profit margins.
Homes increasingly serve as offices, classrooms and places of entertainment for the family, and as a result, people have gravitated to a living environment then can be accommodated in this new reality.
While this trend has been a positive development for the overall housing market, it has been particularly beneficial to the new home market for several reasons.
First, there is a limited existing inventory for consumers to choose from.
According to the National Association of Realtors, total housing inventory at the end of September totaled 1.4 million units, which was down 19% from a year ago and represents less than a three-month supply of homes.
Second, a newly constructed home gives consumers the peace of mind that they will be living in a home that no one else has lived in, which is a real selling point for many families during these uncertain times.
Supplementing the demand we've experienced as the pandemic, is the demographic shift toward home buying that we believe will serve as the tailwind for industry moving forward.
Millennials are increasingly aging into their prime home buying years, while baby boomers and empty nesters are looking to downsize into homes that fit their new lifestyles.
MDC is well positioned to take advantage of these demographic shifts due to our strategic focus on opening communities with affordable products.
Homebuyers of all ages are looking for value when it comes to buying a home, and we have found ways to accommodate the desires through more efficient floor plans, while the combination of lower rates and pandemic-related buying has spurred demand across all product types, we believe the more affordable segments of the market will be the most resilient over time.
We have been fortunate in having a deep bench at MDC.
And to that end, I am pleased that Rebecca Givens has agreed to step into Michael's role as Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
On the operations side, David Viger has moved into the important role as Chief Operating Officer of our homebuilding operations.
Anthony Berris has been promoted to President of our Financial Service operations.
And Dawn Huth has taken on additional responsibilities as Senior Vice President of National Finance.
All of these individuals have proven themselves to be highly capable leaders during their time at MDC, and I look forward to them contributing to our continued success in the future.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate David Mandarich, who has been elected as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
David has been associated with the Company since 1977, most recently as our President and Chief Operating Officer.
And he is widely regarded as one of the most skilled leaders within the homebuilding industry.
His move into the CEO role is a key step in the evolution of our Company.
And I look forward to continued collaboration with him on strategic directions of the Company.
David will be participating with me in our earning calls going forward.
We experienced strong topline growth for the quarter as home sale revenues increased by 33% year-over-year to $1 billion.
Homebuilding operating margin improved by 370 basis points from the prior year quarter, resulting in a 109% increase in pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations to $101.7 million.
In addition, our financial services pre-tax income increased $10.3 million, or 73%.
The increase was due to our mortgage business, which continued to benefit from a higher interest rate lock volume and increased capture rate and better net interest income on loans originated during the quarter.
As a result, net income increased 96% to $98.9 million, or $1.49 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020.
Our tax rate increased from 19.5% to 21.5% for the 2020 third quarter.
The increase in rate was primarily due to changes in the estimated amount of energy tax credits to be received during the respective quarters.
For the fourth quarter, we currently estimate a 25% tax rate, excluding any discrete items.
Homes delivered increased 25% year-over-year to 2,147, driven by an increase in the number of homes we had in backlog to start the quarter, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our backlog conversion rate.
The average selling price of homes delivered during the quarter increased 6% to about $466,000.
The increase was the result of price increases implemented across the majority of our communities over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in the mix of homes closed from Nevada to Southern California.
We are anticipating home deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2020 to reach between 2,400 and 2,600 units.
Backlog conversion for the fourth quarter will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the considerable year-over-year increase in orders during the 2020 third quarter, many of which are unlikely to deliver this year.
We expect the average selling price for 2020 fourth quarter unit deliveries to again exceed $460,000.
Gross margin from home sales improved by 170 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.
While we have seen an increase in certain building costs, most notably lumber, as a result of the pandemic and other factors, we have been successful to this point in recouping these increased costs through home price increases.
This has resulted in improved gross margins on both build-to-order and speculative home deliveries across each of our homebuilding segments.
Gross margin from home sales for the 2020 fourth quarter is expected to approach 21%, excluding impairments and warranty adjustments.
We continued to demonstrate solid operating leverage during the third quarter as our SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased 200 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%.
Our total dollar SG&A expense for the 2020 third quarter increased $10.9 million year-over-year, mostly due to variable commissions and marketing expenses that increased in line with our 33% increase in home sale revenues during the period.
Our general and administrative expense was down slightly when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation that was largely offset by an increase in salaries and other compensation-related expenses.
Our overall headcount has increased by 5% year-over-year as we work to support the Company's strong growth trajectory.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, we may see our general and administrative expense increase to between $50 million and $55 million due to the 5% year-over-year increase in headcount I just mentioned, additional bonus accruals in line with strong operating results, and a potential charitable contribution to our Foundation.
As I previously mentioned, as a result of the continued expansion of our gross margin and our improved operating leverage, our homebuilding operating margin, defined as gross margin from home sales minus our SG&A rate, grew by 370 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%.
On the strength of this improvement, our last 12 months pre-tax return on equity increased 560 basis points year-over-year to 21.8%, which is our highest level in 15 years.
Let's look at our net new home order information for the quarter on Slide 9.
The dollar value of our net orders increased 89% year-over-year to $1.65 billion, and unit net orders increased by 73%, driven by a 70% increase in our monthly absorption rate to 6.1.
The average selling price of our net orders increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in mix to California, which has our highest average price.
During the third quarter, our California markets had nearly as many net new orders as our Colorado markets.
I'd like to note that we ended the quarter with 194 active subdivisions, which is slightly higher than a year ago.
With the strong sales activity we've experienced during the third quarter, we have a number of subdivisions that are approaching closeout earlier than expected.
As a result, we anticipate roughly 185 active subdivisions at year-end.
Although this would be a decrease from the end of the third quarter, it would be unchanged from where we started the year.
On Slide 10, we provided further net new order detail by month since April.
You can see that sales activity ramped up significantly after the initial slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We saw order activity peak during the month of August, but September remained strong and well above the prior year, even after we increased prices in most of our subdivisions.
We also saw the rate of cancellations continue to decrease as the months progressed.
We expect some seasonality to kick in during the fourth quarter.
However, October has remained very strong relative to the prior year.
Based on the activity we've seen to date, we expect our October 2020 net orders to exceed our October 2019 orders by at least 50%.
As a result of our strong sales, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.1 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year.
The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 4% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives, and a shift in mix to California.
These factors were slightly offset by a shift in mix to lower-priced communities consistent with our ongoing strategy of offering more affordable home plans.
I will now turn to land activity on Slide 12.
The number of lots we acquired this quarter increased 63% year-over-year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on continuing to grow our business.
While the number of lots we approved earlier this year were down due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we approved over 3,800 lots for purchase during the third quarter of 2020.
In the end, in spite of immense volatility, the number of lots approved over the last 12 months has increased by 34% compared to the prior year period.
As a result, our total lot supply to end the quarter was 8% higher than at the same point in 2019, supporting our growth potential for future periods.
We expect to see strong lot approval and acquisition activity continue into the fourth quarter given the robust demand that we have seen in recent months and our conviction about growth prospects for housing in future years.
In summary, clearly, we are encouraged by the resilience the housing market has shown in the third quarter given the immense challenges our country has faced in 2020, and we believe that we have executed our operating strategy well in this volatile environment.
More importantly, we see an opportunity to sustain growth well into the future, supported by solid demographics and changing customer preferences.
Our current backlog, not only puts us in position for a strong end to 2020, but also provides us with the opportunity for significant year-over-year increases in home sale revenues and pre-tax income to start 2021.
With our strong balance sheet and current land pipeline, we are well positioned to grow community count significantly in 2021 and have a preliminary target of at least 10,000 home deliveries for the coming fiscal year.
We are mindful that there are many risks to achieving this target, especially with COVID-19 still impacting our daily lives.
These risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our Company and the safety of our employees, subcontractors and customers will remain top priority.
Following our strong third quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.33 to $0.40 per share.
This represents a 33% increase from the prior year and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their continued support.
","M.D.C. Holdings reported strong financial results for Q3 2020, with a 33% increase in home sale revenues to $1 billion and a remarkable 96% growth in net income to $98.9 million. This growth was driven by a 73% increase in net new orders and a 6% increase in average selling price of homes delivered. Despite increased costs, the company successfully recouped these through price increases, leading to a 370 basis point expansion in homebuilding operating margin and a 560 basis point increase in last 12-month pre-tax return on equity. The company estimates fourth-quarter home deliveries to range between 2,400 and 2,600 units, with average selling price exceeding $460,000. The Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in quarterly cash dividend to $0.40 per share, reflecting the company's commitment to shareholder rewards."
ROG_q1_2021.txt,"The slides for today's call can be found on the Investors section of our website, along with the news release that was issued today.
These uncertainties include economic conditions, market demands and competitive factors.
Also, the discussions during this conference call may include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the slide deck for today's call, which is posted on the Investors section of our website.
Turning to slide three.
Also joining us on the call is Ram Mayampurath, who was announced earlier today has been appointed Rogers' Chief Financial Officer, effective May 1.
Rogers delivered another strong financial performance in Q1 driven by growth in advanced mobility markets, a strengthening market recovery and continued operational excellence.
First quarter net sales increased 9% to $229 million and exceeded the top end of our guidance.
Gross margin improved to 39% as a result of our strong operational performance.
EPS also exceeded the high end of our guidance, and we reported earnings of $1.66 per share on a GAAP basis and record adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share.
The increase in Q1 sales was broad-based, and nearly all of our markets increased at double-digit rate.
The impressive growth was enabled by both our strategic focus on fast-growing markets and the ongoing economic recovery.
We continue to realize the benefits of our multiyear investments in innovative technologies to capitalize on the accelerating opportunities in advanced mobility markets.
EV/HEV and ADAS sales increased at double-digit rates sequentially and grew more than 30% compared to Q1 of 2020.
Sales of compression pads and related solutions for EV batteries were especially strong and more than doubled year-over-year.
Sales of our power semiconductor substrate solutions were also higher.
We anticipate further top line growth as these markets continue to accelerate.
As announced last quarter, we are investing aggressively in additional capacity for our advanced battery compression pad and ceramic substrate technologies to take advantage of this opportunity.
We are also investing in additional resources and capabilities to support this growth.
We are at a growth inflection point, and these investments will position Rogers to capitalize on the significant momentum in these markets and add to our strong market positions in the near term and longer term.
Sales in the defense market increased at an impressive rate in Q1, similar to the EV/HEV and ADAS markets.
Our focused strategy and new product introductions continue to drive design wins and growth.
We saw a resurgence in industrial demand in Q1 as sales grew sharply versus the prior quarter and returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Our sales in the industrial market are closely tied to levels of capital investment, which continues to improve.
Demand was strongest for applications used in semiconductor equipment.
Other markets, such as clean energy and wireless infrastructure, also showed strong improvements in Q1 with sales growing at double-digit rates.
In the portable electronics market, sales were seasonally lower in the first quarter and consistent with our expectations.
The impact to sales from the disruption to our UTIS facility was minimal as a result of selling our undamaged finished goods inventory.
We continue to work closely with our customers during this time, and we remain on track to resume production in the fourth quarter of this year.
Q1 sales were largely unaffected by global supply chain disruptions, but we began seeing more impacts as we exited the quarter.
In the second quarter, the lack of availability of certain raw materials, primarily due to weather interruptions along the U.S. Gulf Coast, will somewhat temper our sales growth and gross margin.
However, we expect this headwind to moderate by the end of Q2.
Higher commodity costs reduced Q1 gross margin, while our copper hedging strategy largely offset the impact to earnings per share.
In Q2, we are continuing to offset the impact of higher commodity costs through hedging activities and commercial actions.
In summary, we had an excellent quarter delivering strong sales growth, improved profitability and robust cash generation.
Continuing on to slide five, I'll discuss the latest market outlook.
As mentioned, we are seeing broad strength across our market portfolio.
This is driven by two major factors.
First, we are benefiting from our strategic positioning in markets with long secular tailwinds, such as advanced mobility.
We are also seeing exceptional growth in this area, primarily driven by the accelerating adoption of EVs and HEVs.
Second, the global economic recovery continues to gain momentum.
Our expectation is that near-term economic activity will continue to improve, aided by stimulus measures and vaccine rollouts.
This should continue to support strong demand, and we are maximizing output at existing manufacturing facilities in response.
Turning to the long-term outlook for advanced mobility, estimates continue to point to an extremely strong growth outlook for the EV/HEV market.
Recent analysis from industry experts points to an acceleration in EV/HEV adoption.
In their updated report, BCG now expects that by 2026, EVs and HEVs will account for more than half of global light vehicle sales, four years earlier than previously expected.
Underscoring this trend is the ongoing investments and commitments by global automakers.
Some examples in recent weeks include commitments from Volvo and Honda to phase out internal combustion engines and announcements of sizable investments in battery capacity from VW, GM and others.
It's important to note that full electric vehicles are expected to be the fastest-growing segment of this market with a CAGR of over 40%.
This is significant for Rogers because our content opportunity increases with higher degrees of electrification.
For example, our ceramic substrate content opportunity in a full EV ranges from around $25 to $40 compared to a content opportunity of approximately $5 in a 48-volt mild hybrid.
The same concept applies to our battery compression pad solutions used in plug-in HEVs and EVs.
Our content can be greater than $30 per vehicle and rises meaningfully as the battery size increases.
Other solutions, which are used across the entire EV/HEV market, include vibration dampening pads and battery pack sealing solutions.
Also, we have secured design wins with several promising entrants to the EV market with our power interconnect solutions.
We continue to see a very strong mid-teens growth potential over the next five years driven by increasing penetration rates and higher levels of vehicle autonomy.
Near-term auto production faces some challenges from the limited supply of certain semiconductors, but the long-term outlook remains robust.
We are encouraged by our progress in this market, and we continue to expand our customer base with new design wins.
In addition to the opportunities in advanced mobility, we also see attractive growth potential in other markets, such as renewable energy and defense.
The renewable energy market is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next five years, which we anticipate will continue to drive robust demand for our power semiconductor substrates.
Rogers has a very rich heritage of innovation and a proven track record of developing solutions that drive growth end markets with strong secular tailwinds.
We achieved these results by combining our deep expertise in material science with collaborative engineer-to-engineer customer relationships.
Our global innovation in R and D centers are key to maintaining a strong development pipeline.
They are staffed with world-class personnel who identify, develop and acquire the technology needed to enable the next-generation of products.
Through partnerships with universities and other research institutions, we can further expand our product development pipeline in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
The progress we've made in our EV/HEV business is a prime example of how innovation drives growth at Rogers.
For example, our advanced battery pad and battery pack sealing solutions and silicon nitride substrates were all developed through our innovation and R and D process in recent years.
These products form the core of our solutions for the EV/HEV market, which has now increased to more than 11% of total sales.
Our focus on innovation continues with a number of advanced solutions that are currently under development.
Some of these -- some of the products in our development pipeline include next-generation silicon nitride substrates with improved thermal performance, advanced battery compression pad solutions and high-performance antennas for next-generation auto radar.
Our ability to drive organic growth through innovation is a source of competitive advantage for Rogers and will continue to be a core element of our strategy.
Turning to slide seven.
I'll recap our key messages from today's call.
First, we delivered strong Q1 results driven by our strategic focus on advanced mobility markets and by continuing our market recovery.
We also continue to drive operational improvements and higher sustainable gross margins.
The growth opportunities in advanced mobility markets and especially the EV/HEV space continue to accelerate driven by powerful, long-term secular tailwinds.
This opportunity is extremely compelling, and we are investing aggressively to capitalize on this growth.
As a longtime Rogers employee and a seasoned senior finance leader, it gives me great confidence to have Ram step into the Chief Financial Officer role.
Ram has over 30 years of corporate finance experience and has held senior finance leadership positions at Rogers, where he has had responsibility for financial operations, financial planning and analysis, business transformation and treasury.
I have appreciated Mike's wise and insightful counsel, which has helped Rogers navigate through some difficult situations and has helped make Rogers a stronger and more resilient company.
Mike will remain with the company during the transition period to help facilitate a seamless transition with Ram.
Please join me in wishing Mike a long, healthy, happy retirement.
Your thoughts are truly appreciated.
I've enjoyed my time at Rogers immensely, and I'm appreciative of the opportunity to have made a positive impact on the results and culture of Rogers.
It's been my fortune to work with a tremendous senior management team, a supportive Board and a hard-working dedicated Rogers global community.
Let's jump back to the results.
On the slides ahead, I'll review our first quarter 2021 results.
Turning to slide nine.
As Bruce mentioned, Rogers delivered strong financial results in the first quarter.
Revenues increased sequentially in both our EMS and AES business segment.
As communicated in our Q4 earnings call, the AES business segment is comprised of the former ACS and PES business segments.
We delivered gross margin that was 70 basis points higher than Q4 through increased volumes and operating efficiency, despite a less favorable product mix and significantly higher commodity and freight costs.
In Q1, we delivered strong earnings through increased revenues, improved gross margins and increased other income.
In our GAAP results, we recognized $1.5 million in restructuring costs related to the footprint optimization activities communicated in our third quarter 2020 call and $1.3 million for the loss resulting from the fire at our UTIS facility, net of expected insurance proceeds.
Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 25.2%.
Turning to slide 10.
Our Q1 revenues of $229.3 million increased by $18.6 million compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting broad strength across our product markets.
AES revenues increased 10% to $131.9 million, while EMS revenues grew 6% to $91.8 million.
Currency exchange rates favorably impacted first quarter revenues by approximately 1.5% compared to Q4.
AES revenues grew sequentially due to strong demand in all three product lines: RF solutions, power semiconductor substrates and power interconnects.
Within RF Solutions, the Aerospace and Defense business accounted for 19% of the business segment revenues and grew 15% sequentially.
The ADAS business accounted for 18% of the revenues and grew 12%, and wireless infrastructure accounted for 17% of the revenues and grew 26%.
Defense applications continue to be a solid growth area for Rogers as customer programs continue to ramp.
Record ADAS revenues continue to benefit from the rebound in automotive manufacturing and, to date, have not been adversely impacted by the semiconductor chip shortage.
Wireless infrastructure revenues experienced a nice sequential increase due to 5G installations, both inside and outside of China.
Clean energy, which is comprised of the renewable energy revenues in both the power semiconductor and the power interconnect business as well as the variable frequency drive business in the power semiconductor business, accounted for 16% of the business and grew 15% sequentially.
The sequential increase in our variable frequency drive business was the first in several quarters and is reflective of the general economic recovery.
We believe the renewable energy demand will be uneven in the short term as this business is comprised of project opportunities but will have meaningful long-term momentum.
EV/HEV application revenues accounted for 12% of the segment revenues and increased 2% sequentially as order timing tempered the Q1 increase in ceramic substrate revenues.
EMS revenues grew sequentially primarily due to significant increases in nearly all applications, highlighted by a 41% increase in EV/HEV applications which accounted for 11% of the segment revenues and a 23% increase in general industrial applications, which accounted for 44% of the segment revenues.
The EV/HEV applications continue to gain momentum, consistent with the accelerated demands in the EV/HEV market.
And the increase in general industrial revenues continues a recovery trend that commenced in the fourth quarter and mirrors the general economic recovery.
As expected, revenues for the portable electronics, which accounted for 22% of the segment revenues, experienced a 31% sequential seasonal decline off a very strong second half of 2020.
Revenues from our UTIS factory were down just slightly compared to Q4 despite the fire that occurred in mid-February.
Turning to slide 11.
Our gross margin for the first quarter was $89.5 million or 39% of revenues, 70 basis points higher than Q4.
The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher volume and improved manufacturing execution, more than offsetting the unfavorable product mix and increased raw material and freight costs.
While both the AES and EMS businesses had to overcome the aforementioned headwinds, the AES business was able to produce increased gross margin in all three product lines.
The EMS gross margin declined sequentially, even though manufacturing execution improved.
Although our gross margin percentage increased by 70 basis points sequentially, the significant increase in copper cost meaningfully dampened our gross margin percentage in the quarter.
To mitigate the higher cost of copper on our profitability, we enter into copper hedging contracts.
The gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense below our operating profit results.
In addition to hedging our copper purchases, we have taken commercial actions to mitigate the increased cost of commodity and other raw materials.
Also on slide 11, we detail the changes to adjusted net income for Q1 of $36 million compared to adjusted net income for Q4 of $29.7 million.
The adjusted operating income for Q1 of $43.5 million and 19% of revenues was 60 basis points higher than Q4.
Adjusted operating expenses for Q1 of $46 million or 20.1% of revenues were 20 basis points higher than Q4 expenses.
The higher adjusted operating expenses were due to higher performance-based compensation costs as well as higher benefit costs.
Other income expense was $1.2 million favorable compared to Q4.
Included in other income expense in Q1 are the realized gains on our copper hedging contracts, which offset the impact of higher copper costs included in the gross margin in the first quarter.
As discussed earlier, Rogers' effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25.2%, higher than our forecasted rate of 22% to 23%.
We now expect our effective tax rate for 2021 will be 23% to 24% due to the geographic mix of pre-tax income.
Turning to slide 12.
The first -- in the first quarter, the company generated strong free cash flow of $33 million and ended the quarter with a cash position of $199.1 million.
In the quarter, we generated $36.5 million from operating activities, net of an increase of $10.8 million in working capital and repaid $21 million on our credit facility.
We ended the first quarter with an outstanding balance on our credit facility of $4 million and a net cash position of $195.1 million.
In Q1, the company spent $3.6 million on capital expenditures.
Despite the low level of expenditures in the first quarter, we continue to guide capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million in 2021, with over 50% of the expenditures to capture the accelerating advanced mobility market opportunities in both AES and EMS business segments.
The guided expenditures exclude the capital necessary to restore the UTIS operation, a significant portion which we expect to be reimbursed by insurance proceeds.
I've had the pleasure of working closely with Ram during my time at Rogers.
He is an excellent choice to continue driving the company's growth and profitability forward.
It is a privilege to be named as Chief Financial Officer at Rogers, and I'm extremely excited about the opportunity to serve in this capacity at such a pivotal time for the company.
Lastly, I look forward to becoming better acquainted with the members of our investment community.
Turning now to second quarter guidance on slide 13.
As Bruce discussed earlier, we see continued strength in many of our markets, particularly in advanced mobility, general industrial, defense and wireless infrastructure.
Based on the strong outlook, we are guiding our second quarter revenues to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million.
The effect of our UTIS factory being off-line and the lack of availability of certain raw materials will impact our second quarter growth.
Following several quarters of significant gross margin improvements, we expect Q2 to be flat sequentially before improving further in the second half of 2021.
To prepare for our strong second half, we will be stepping up our resources across the business in the second quarter.
Also in the quarter, we will continue to see challenges from mix, raw material cost increases and supply constraints related to the Gulf Coast interruptions mentioned earlier.
We have taken commercial actions to mitigate the increase in raw material costs.
These actions will have a positive impact on our gross margins in the second quarter, with full impacts benefiting the second half of 2021.
We expect to overcome the supply constraints by the end of the second quarter and see favorable impact from higher volume and better mix in the second half.
We guide our gross margins to be in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%, consistent with our first quarter.
The company will recognize higher operating expenses in the second quarter from timing of certain expenses, including performance-based compensation.
Costs incurred to support anticipated growth in the second half and to restore UTIS operations will also increase operating expenses in the quarter.
We are guiding GAAP Q2 earnings in the range of $1.58 to $1.73 per fully diluted share, and we guide fully diluted adjusted earnings in the range of $1.80 to $1.95 per share for the second quarter.
","Rogers Corporation reported a robust first quarter driven by advanced mobility markets and ongoing recovery. Net sales increased 9% to $229 million, surpassing expectations. The company's gross margin reached 39% due to operational efficiency, offsetting higher commodity costs and an unfavorable product mix. EPS exceeded guidance, reaching $1.66 on a GAAP basis and a record $1.92 on an adjusted basis. Advanced mobility markets, including EV/HEV and ADAS, witnessed double-digit growth, with EV/HEV sales more than doubling year-over-year. Defense and industrial demand also surged, returning to pre-pandemic levels. While the UTIS facility disruption had minimal impact on sales, global supply chain disruptions began affecting growth in late Q1, expected to moderate by the end of Q2. For Q2, Rogers forecasts continued market strength and revenue guidance of $230 million to $240 million, with gross margin remaining flat sequentially before improving in the latter half of 2021 due to commercial actions mitigating raw material costs and increased volume."
COO_q2_2021.txt,"I'm happy to report that CooperVision and CooperSurgical both posted all-time record quarterly revenues, which drove record quarterly earnings.
Our businesses have rebounded nicely from the COVID lows with silicone hydrogel lenses and myopia management leading CooperVision and fertility and PARAGARD driving CooperSurgical.
For the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant-currency basis, consolidated revenues were $720 million, with CooperVision at $523 million, up 25%; and CooperSurgical at $197 million, up 58%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.38.
For CooperVision, the Americas grew 38% with clariti, MyDay, and Biofinity leading the way.
was the strongest part of the region, and it allowed us to rebound quickly and strongly, offsetting challenges from markets such as Canada, which are still facing significant COVID restrictions.
We're still seeing nice momentum in the U.S., and we're looking forward to the back-to-school season.
EMEA grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in MyDay and Biofinity.
1 contact lens company in EMEA, so we're obviously over-indexed in this region and the impact from COVID did temper the market's performance.
But we're executing at a very high level and taking share, which is offsetting the challenges.
This is a region where we've been a leader for quite some time, and we're getting stronger due to success with key accounts, so we're really looking forward to a rebound in consumer activity as that will definitely benefit us.
Lastly, Asia Pac was up 19%, led by strength in clariti and MyDay.
Asia Pac is making progress rebounding from COVID, but it's slow in many countries, including Japan, where we have a strong presence.
Nevertheless, similar to EMEA, our teams are executing at a very high level and taking share, which is helping offset the market challenges.
Overall, given our geographic mix, I'm extremely happy with our performance and expect it to remain healthy as vaccines roll out around the world and consumer activity improves.
Moving to some details, silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% with MyDay and clariti both posting strong results.
MyDay, in particular, is taking share, led by improving availability, especially for MyDay Toric.
From a market perspective, there's still roughly $2.4 billion in annual global sales of older daily hydrogels that we expect to be traded up to silicones in the coming years.
This tailwind is a significant positive for us as we're under-indexed in dailies but are seeing great performance from clariti and MyDay.
Moving to our FRP portfolio, we saw solid growth around the world led by Biofinity.
In particular, Biofinity Energys, our unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time, and our market-leading Biofinity Toric Multifocal posted extremely strong results.
We also just announced that we've doubled the number of prescription options for Biofinity Toric and to provide context on how significant this is, Biofinity Toric is the most prescribed toric lens in the world and is now available at over 33,000 prescriptions.
That's more options than all other monthly silicone hydrogel toric lenses combined.
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active.
clariti and the MyDay second base curve sphere are being rolled out in Japan and MyDay Toric, Biofinity Toric Multifocal and our extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity continue rolling out around the world.
And I'm happy to now add MyDay Multifocal to this launch list.
We'll start seeding select countries in the coming months with a full launch planned for late this calendar year.
As part of our prelaunch activity, we completed product testing in eight countries with thousands of patients and I'm excited to say the responses have been absolutely fantastic.
That's not a huge surprise given the extremely strong clinical data and the success of MyDay Sphere and Toric, but it's still great to see.
The multifocal category is roughly 10% of the $8.5 billion global contact lens market and roughly half of that is in dailies.
Given we're currently under-indexed in the daily segment at roughly a 16% share, we believe the MyDay Multifocal will be very successful.
Moving to myopia management, our portfolio grew 122% this quarter to $14 million.
Within this, MiSight grew 152% to $4 million, and Ortho K grew 112% to $10 million.
As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; a broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses; and our innovative SightGlass Vision spectacles.
Given the strength we're seeing, we now expect this portfolio to reach $65 million in sales this year and exceed $100 million next year.
Regarding MiSight, we've made fantastic progress with our key accounts and have entered into multiple new pilot programs with retailers and buying groups around the world.
Our momentum has been accelerating, including in the U.S., where sales grew sequentially from 100,000 to 700,000, and we're about to launch in South Korea, which should be a great market.
The only thing holding us back from growing MiSight even faster is COVID restrictions in several important countries such as Canada, Spain, Taiwan, and Singapore.
Regardless, we're making tremendous progress and expect very strong growth moving forward.
From a fitting perspective, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11, compared to a regular new contact lens wearer of 17, showing this treatment is bringing kids into contact lenses at a much younger age.
Additionally, multiple professional associations are now recommending myopia management as standard of care, including the World Council of Optometry and more universities are adding educational training courses to their curriculum.
Regarding Ortho K, we had a great quarter driven by our broad product portfolio and from the halo effect we started seeing from MiSight.
As the myopia management market develops, we're seeing the value of offering multiple options to eye care professionals and this is helping our Ortho K franchise.
We also believe it will benefit our SightGlass myopia management spectacles, which are scheduled to be launched in multiple European markets prior to calendar year-end.
With respect to SightGlass, we just received two-year clinical data and are in the process of submitting it to the FDA for approval as a myopia management treatment.
It took three-year data to get MiSight approval, but we're hoping to receive approval faster for SightGlass given the strong data and that these are glasses rather than contact lenses.
In the meantime, we're finishing the legal and regulatory work to close our joint venture with Essilor Luxottica and remain very excited about the potential of that partnership.
To wrap up on myopia management, we're actively investing in sales and marketing, new launches, regulatory approvals, and R&D to keep driving success.
Our focus remains on leading with clinical data and providing the best and broadest portfolio on the market.
To conclude on vision, the rollout of vaccines is definitely benefiting us, given the consumer nature of our business.
On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
Given our robust portfolio, new product launches, momentum with myopia management, and strong new fit data, we're in great shape for long-term sustainable growth.
Moving to CooperSurgical, this was an outstanding quarter, with record revenues of $197 million in all three focus areas: fertility, PARAGARD, and office and surgical medical devices outperforming.
Starting with fertility, revenues grew 53% year over year to $84 million, easily becoming the best fertility quarter we've ever had.
Strength was seen around the world and throughout the product portfolio.
We're taking share, and we're well-positioned for future gains with improving traction in several markets.
Our key account strategy is creating opportunities, capitalizing on our market-leading portfolio of products and services, which cover this full spectrum of clinics needs outside of pharma offerings.
We're seeing strong growth from consumable products like media and RI Witness, our proprietary automated lab management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices.
And we're benefiting from increased utilization of our artificial intelligence-based genetic testing platform which increases the doctor's ability to select the best embryos for transfer and also from our capital equipment business with growth in products like incubators.
From a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow in many countries, but the combination of share gains and healthy patient flow in the U.S. and parts of Europe is driving our results.
Overall, increasing vaccination activity will continue supporting the recovery of the IVF industry as more patients are able to return to clinics.
And increasing maternal age and better access to IVF treatments are trends that will continue supporting strong growth for many years to come.
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 62%, with PARAGARD up 103% and office and surgical medical devices up 41%.
PARAGARD performed really well as positive health and wellness trends continue driving patient activity.
As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers fantastic, long-lasting birth control that addresses the needs and interests of women looking for a healthy alternative.
Within Medical Devices, several products performed well, including EndoSee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrium, and our portfolio of uterine manipulators.
To conclude our CooperSurgical, this was an excellent quarter.
Some of it was tied to reopening activity and capital equipment sales, which are tough to forecast, but you'll note in our guidance that we expect to continue delivering strong results.
Similar to Vision, we have powerful macro trends supporting our growth and our exposure to consumer activity is benefiting us as economies around the world reopen.
To finish, let me add that we'll be releasing our new ESG report in a few weeks.
For those of you like me who are passionate about environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance, you'll see a great summary of where we stand today and insights into our future efforts.
We're in an excellent ESG position, and I look forward to continuing advancements and providing additional updates in the future.
Our second-quarter consolidated revenues increased 37% year over year or 32% in constant currency to $720 million.
Consolidated gross margin increased year over year to 68.1%, up from 65.8%.
Improvement was driven by strength in our higher-margin CooperSurgical business led by PARAGARD and a nice improvement in our fertility margins where we're seeing the positive impact of transferring a significant amount of production to Costa Rica.
CooperVision also posted improving margins driven by currency and product mix.
Moving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins.
We've completed the largest parts of our capital expansion projects at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and expect to receive the benefits of this over time as capacity utilization increases.
Opex was up 17% year over year as expenses naturally increased with the rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management.
Having said that, expenses were kept under control, resulting in consolidated operating margins of 26.8%, up from 17.4% last year.
Interest expense was $6.1 million due to lower interest rates and lower average debt levels and the effective tax rate was 9.6%, driven by a 2.1% benefit from options exercises.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.38 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding.
Free cash flow was very solid at $143 million, comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow, offset by $50 million of capex.
Net debt decreased to $1.6 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.8 times, driven by lower debt and improving EBITDA.
Before moving to guidance, it's worth noting we acquired two businesses since we last reported earnings.
The first was No7 Contact Lens, a U.K.-based contact lens manufacturer primarily focused on specialty lenses, including Ortho K, that had annual revenue of roughly $4.4 million, which we purchased for roughly $12 million.
The second was OBP Medical, a U.S.-based medical device company that develops and markets a suite of differentiated women's health medical devices with integrated LED illumination.
OBP Medical had roughly $10 million in annual revenues, and we purchased them for $60 million.
Both deals are highly strategic and fit perfectly into CooperVision and CooperSurgical, respectively.
Moving to guidance, we continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration, and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results.
While we still view this as a risk factor, our visibility is sufficient to allow us to provide the following update to our fiscal 2021 guidance.
Consolidated revenues are expected to range from $2.855 billion to $2.885 billion, up 14% to 15% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.11 billion and $2.13 billion, up 11% to 12% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical revenues between $745 million and $755 million, up 25% to 27% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $13.20 to $13.40.
To provide color on this earnings per share range, our gross margin expectations are unchanged as we expect CooperVision's improved manufacturing efficiencies to be offset by moderate margin pressure from growing dailies and surgical continuing to post strong results.
We expect opex as a percent of revenues to track higher than the first half of the year, led by sales and marketing investments to support reopening activity and for the ongoing support of myopia management.
Given the lower tax rate in Q2, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be around 11%.
Lastly, FX has moved against us primarily due to the yen, but we expect the tax improvement to offset this negative impact.
And to wrap up on guidance, our business continues to strengthen, and we now expect free cash flow to exceed $500 million this year.
","In its recent earnings call, CooperVision and CooperSurgical reported record quarterly revenues, driven by silicone hydrogel lenses, myopia management, fertility, and PARAGARD. Consolidated revenues reached $720 million, up 32%. CooperVision saw a 25% increase in revenues, primarily due to growth in silicone hydrogel dailies and FRP products, including Biofinity. CooperSurgical posted a 58% revenue increase, driven by strength in fertility and office and surgical medical devices. Myopia management grew significantly at 122%, with MiSight growing 152% and Ortho K 112%. The company is expanding its myopia management portfolio and expects it to exceed $100 million in sales next year. PARAGARD, a hormone-free contraceptive, contributed significantly to CooperSurgical's growth. Despite COVID-19 challenges, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, supported by favorable market trends and the rollout of vaccines. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.38, with a guidance range of $13.20 to $13.40 for fiscal 2021."
USB_q3_2021.txt,"I'll begin on Slide 3.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.30 and generated total revenue of $5.9 billion.
Our linked quarter pre-tax pre-provision net revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by continued momentum across our fee businesses, growth in average loan balances, and continued focus on expense management resulting in positive operating leverage.
We released $310 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, supported by our outlook on the economy and better-than-expected credit quality metrics.
Our book value per share totaled $32.22 at September 30, which was 1.5% higher than June 30.
Our CET1 ratio was 10.2% at September 30.
Slide 4 provides key third quarter performance metrics, including a return on tangible common equity of over 20%.
Slide 5 highlights strong trends in digital engagement.
On Slide 6, we are providing an initial information about our Business Banking and payment relationships, which we plan to update every quarter.
Our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for us and provides a number of cyclical and secular growth opportunities.
Over the next few years, we believe there is a significant potential to expand and deepen relationships within this ecosystem.
Our starting point is that, we have about 1.1 million Business Banking relationships, which we define as businesses with under $25 million in revenue.
Currently, about half of our payments customers of this size have a Business Banking product and just under one-third of our Business Banking customers have a payments product.
The opportunity is to both increase the number of Business Banking relationships and to deepen these relationships by connecting our banking customers with our payments products and services, and connecting our payments customers with our banking products and services.
As we discussed previously, we believe we can grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.
Average loans increased 0.8% compared with the second quarter, driven by growth in other retail loans, primarily installment loans, as well as growth in credit card and residential mortgages.
This growth was partially offset by lower commercial loan balances which was impacted by lower levels of PPP loans.
At September 30, PPP loan balances totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion at June 30.
Excluding PPP loans, third quarter average loans grew by 1.8% on a linked quarter basis.
Turning to Slide 8, average deposits increased 0.5% compared with the second quarter and 6.4% compared with a year ago.
On both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we continued to benefit from favorable mix shift as average non-interest bearing deposits increased while higher cost time deposits declined.
Slide 9 shows credit quality trends.
Non-performing assets declined on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and our net charge-off ratio hit a record low of 20 basis points.
Our reserve release was $310 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics.
Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.3 billion, or 2.1% of loans.
The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the economic outlook and trajectory of credit quality within the portfolios.
Slide 10 provides an earnings summary.
In the third quarter of 2021, we earned $1.30 per diluted share.
These results include a reserve release of $310 million.
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased by 1% compared with the second quarter.
The growth was primarily driven by higher loan fees associated with the Paycheck Protection Program.
Excluding PPP-related fees, net interest income would have been stable, reflecting lower loan yields and the impact of change in loan mix, offset by the beneficial impact of core loan growth, lower premium amortization, and an additional day in the quarter.
Our net interest margin was stable compared with the second quarter.
Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income.
Compared with a year ago, non-interest income declined 0.7% as decreases in mortgage revenue and commercial products revenue more than offset strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, and treasury management fees.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income increased 2.8% reflecting higher-than-expected payments revenue and a 20% increase in mortgage revenue driven by growth in production volume and related gain on sale margins, as well as higher loan sales.
Slide 13 provides information on our payment services business.
Our payments business continues to benefit from improving economic conditions and spend activity.
In the third quarter, sales volumes for both our credit card and our merchant processing businesses exceeded the pandemic compared period in 2019, while CPS volume was about in line.
As expected, prepaid card volume declined in the third quarter as the impact of government-related stimulus continues to diminish.
The reduced prepaid volume resulted in a slight decline in credit and debit card revenue on a linked quarter basis.
However, corporate payment revenues increased by 13%, which was better-than-expected, driven by improving business spend activity.
Merchant processing revenue increased by 4.8% due to higher merchant and equipment fees, as well as higher sales volumes.
Turning to Slide 14, non-interest expense increased 1.2% compared to the second quarter.
This increase primarily reflected higher revenue-related compensation and performance-based incentives.
Slide 15 highlights our capital position.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 10.2%, which increased slightly compared to June 30.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire MUFG's Union Bank.
We expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second quarter of 2022.
After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9%.
As PPP winds down and we approach the end of the forgiveness period, we expect PPP fees to decline $60 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP fees, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.
We expect PPP to be immaterial to both net interest income and the net interest margin in 2022.
In the fourth quarter, we expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen, driven by improving sales volumes.
However, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower than the third quarter, which affects linked quarter comparisons.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in amortization of tax-advantaged investments of approximately $60 million, as well as some seasonal impacts in marketing and in business investments.
Credit quality remains strong.
Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal.
For the full-year of 2021, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
To summarize our third quarter results, we're positive on several fronts, highlighted by a solid growth in core loans, good fee revenue momentum, and strong credit quality.
We are finishing off the year in a strong position heading into 2022 and we're excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across the franchise, supported by our continued investment in people, digital, technology, and data analytics.
Our three payments businesses will continue to benefit from the improved spend activity, particularly as consumer and business travel recovers toward pre-pandemic levels.
More importantly, we believe our secular growth initiatives aimed at connecting payments with banking provide a meaningful potential for market share gains over the immediate and longer-term.
Our Business Banking initiatives are still in the early innings but we're gaining traction and our partnership with State Farm continues to evolve and grow.
We are encouraged by the results we're seeing.
Aside from our organic growth opportunities, our recently announced acquisition of Union Bank provides a platform to achieve cost synergies, expand our distribution network in demographically attractive West Coast markets, and leverage our broad product set in leading digital capabilities across a loyal but underpenetrated customer base.
All of this will enable us to accelerate revenue and earnings growth, and continue to deliver the industry-leading returns on equity that our shareholders have come to expect.
We'll now open up the call to Q&A.
","U.S. Bancorp reported Q3 earnings per share of $1.30 and total revenue of $5.9 billion, showcasing growth in core loans, fee revenue, and robust credit quality. The company released $310 million of loan loss reserves, reflecting an improved economic outlook and strong credit trends. Net interest income remained stable, driven by higher loan fees and core loan growth. Non-interest income rose by 2.8% due to strong growth in payments revenue and mortgage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased slightly, primarily due to higher revenue-related compensation. The bank's CET1 ratio strengthened to 10.2%, and it anticipates acquiring Union Bank to drive growth and synergies. The company expects net interest income to remain stable in Q4, while total payments revenue is projected to strengthen. Credit quality remains solid, with a low net charge-off ratio anticipated over the next few quarters. U.S. Bancorp remains optimistic about its organic growth opportunities and believes its secular growth initiatives, such as connecting payments with banking, will yield significant market share gains in the future."
DLB_q2_2021.txt,"In particular, the extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain at this time.
During today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
As for the content of today's call, Kevin will start with a discussion of the business, and Lewis will follow with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our third quarter and second half fiscal 2021 outlook.
With another strong performance in licensing revenues this quarter, we are off to a solid start to our fiscal year.
Our first half fiscal 2021 revenues have grown about 10% compared to the first half of fiscal 2020, and earnings have grown at an even higher rate.
Our financial results reflect the strength of Dolby's business model and the broad adoption of Dolby Technologies across the devices and services that consumers are seeking to enjoy their content.
Before Lewis takes you through the numbers, I wanted to highlight some of the areas of our progress and the recent examples of how Dolby is enabling a broader range of content.
With a growing number of content experiences becoming Dolby experiences, we add to our value proposition for deeper adoption in existing device categories, and we address the use cases for adoption in new device categories, which together drive our opportunities for growth.
With Dolby Atmos for music, we are enabling a significant step forward in how people can enjoy their favorite songs, which is creating new opportunities to expand the adoption of Dolby Atmos to a broader range of devices and services.
Lucid Motors announced that they will be bringing the first automobile to market that will include Dolby Atmos.
The Lucid Air will enable the Dolby Atmos for music experience for the car and is the first example of a significant opportunity to address the primary entertainment use case within automotive.
Lucid is just one example of how we are creating more ways for consumers to enjoy a growing library of music in Dolby Atmos.
We have strong engagement with top artists around the world as more songs and albums are being made available in Dolby Atmos, including many recent Grammy-nominated artists like Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Megan Thee Stallion.
This quarter, Hungama, a top music streaming service in India began supporting Dolby Atmos.
They joined TIDAL, Amazon Music and Anghami who are currently streaming music in Dolby Atmos.
As we continue to build on the momentum for Dolby Atmos for music, we see opportunities for more services to adopt Dolby Atmos, and to deepen our adoption across mobile, PCs, automotive and headphones.
Gaming is another area where we see much of the opportunity ahead of us, to bring Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to a growing number of experiences.
Microsoft Xbox will be the first gaming console to support the combined Dolby experience for games.
Xbox gamers will have more ways to enjoy the Dolby experience with new gaming headsets released this quarter from Microsoft and Bang and Olufsen that highlight support for Dolby Atmos.
Lenovo recently launched a new mobile phone designed to support gaming content, the Legion Phone Duel two that highlights support for Dolby Atmos.
We also saw the first eSports event in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos this quarter.
As part of Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzConline, we enabled an event that showcased Overwatch matches to be viewed in the combined Dolby experience through PCs and gaming consoles.
eSports gives us unique opportunities to engage gamers by bringing Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to the experiences that they are passionate about.
As we grow the number of Dolby experiences within games, we add to our existing value proposition and drive more reasons for adoption on gaming consoles, PCs and mobile phones.
By expanding our presence in music and gaming, we addressed two of the primary use cases on a mobile device.
At the same time, we see more ways for Dolby to enable the highest quality experiences across more of the content enjoyed on mobile devices.
Over the past few quarters, we've highlighted how we are enabling new experiences in mobile, like being able to record in Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12 or being able to enjoy live sports content in Dolby Atmos through a mobile app.
This quarter, Earshot, a leading podcast service in India became the first podcast app to support Dolby Atmos.
They will be making Dolby Atmos content available across different genres of podcasts and in multiple languages.
As we continue to expand the relevance of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across a broader range of content, we address more of the use cases for mobile devices, driving the reasons for deeper adoption with our partners.
This quarter, Xiaomi launched their first mobile phones that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
This adds to the growing number of partners that support the Dolby experience within mobile, which is highlighted by the Apple iPhone 12 lineup that features the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience.
In addition, Samsung, OPPO and Sony continue to highlight Dolby Atmos with the recent launch of their latest flagship models.
All of this progress adds to our strong position within movie and TV content, which continues to drive more device adoption within the living room.
This quarter, Samsung released their Q7 sound bar, highlighting support for Dolby Atmos.
Within TVs, our partners around the world, including Xiaomi, Changhong and Skyworth, released new models that support the combined experience.
In addition to supporting Dolby Atmos, TCL and Hisense also highlighted support for Dolby Vision IQ within their recent TV launches.
With this momentum, we still see a significant opportunity ahead to reach higher levels of adoption with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in the living room, similar to the broad presence of our core audio technologies.
The adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos on devices is driven by a consistent flow of new titles that are being enabled in the combined Dolby experience.
Our streaming partners, like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ and HBO Max, continue to make a broad range of titles available in Dolby, and the combined experience is consistently highlighted with the release of their latest tentpole titles.
Let me shift to cinema.
As consumers begin to return to the movies, they are seeking out premium experiences and Dolby Cinema is the best way to enjoy a movie.
We now have about 90% of our Dolby Cinemas opened globally to certain capacity restrictions.
Our engagement with exhibitor partners remain strong as we recently added a new Dolby Cinema partner in China, and we also had four new Dolby Cinema locations open during the quarter.
We also see initial signs of strong box office performance from titles like Godzilla vs.
Kong and successful local content in China, including Detective Chinatown three and Hi, Mom that were all available in Dolby Cinema.
We look ahead to anticipated titles later this year, including Top Gun: Maverick, A Quiet Place II and Black Widow that will all be available in Dolby Cinema.
During the last year, we have started to bring the Dolby magic that powers the best movie, TV and music experiences to a much broader range of content and interactions with Dolby.io, our developer platform.
Our focus is on deepening our engagement with the developer community, growing the number of developers on the platform and building their engagement with our APIs.
Just last week, we completed an integration with Box.com and Dolby.io.
Companies that use Box can now enable their users to easily improve the quality of their audio directly from where their files are stored within Box, powered by Dolby Media APIs.
We are excited to bring unique solutions to Box's broad range of customers and the opportunity to drive more people to engage with Dolby.io.
Our interactivity APIs are supporting a wide range of use cases, and we see new customers across multiple industries from online learning to enabling influencers to connect with fans, or even in one case, supporting an application that enables live streaming for medical teams.
As we look ahead, we also see opportunities where real-time interactions come together with recorded media and we can uniquely provide comprehensive solutions by embedding both our interactivity and media APIs.
With a growing number of new experiences being enabled by Dolby.io, we are learning from our engagement with developers and evolving our offerings to best support the use cases where we see significant opportunities to bring higher quality media and best-in-class real-time interactions.
So to wrap up, we have growing momentum in enabling Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences in more forms of content like music and gaming.
As we enable our technologies to address a broader range of content, we build upon our strong position within movies and TV and create more reasons for adoption across devices and services.
With Dolby.io, our technologies are beginning to address a much larger world of content experiences and interactions.
All of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future.
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Lewis to take us through the financials.
And of course, May the fourth be with you.
As Kevin said, our financial results were very solid this quarter.
Revenue and earnings both coming in higher than we previously guided.
So let me go through a few details for everyone.
Second quarter revenue of $320 million was above our guidance range of $280 million to $310 million, as the volumes that we had were higher-than-expected in several of our end markets.
And then we also benefited from a true-up of about $15 million in the quarter for Q1 shipments reported that were above our estimate.
On a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue was down from last year's $352 million due to lower recoveries and lower revenue from cinema-related business partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies and higher market volume in areas like PC and TV.
On a sequential basis, total revenue was down from Q1 due to lower recoveries and lower seasonality, and both of these were anticipated when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the quarter.
So the Q2 revenue was comprised of $304 million in licensing and $16 million in products and services.
So let's go through the trends in licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast.
Broadcast represented about 35% of total licensing in the second quarter.
Broadcast revenues decreased by about 19% year-over-year, and that was driven by lower recoveries offset partially by higher market volume along with higher adoption of Dolby.
On a sequential basis, broadcast decreased by about 25%, due primarily to lower seasonality along with lower recoveries.
Mobile represented approximately 22% of total licensing in Q2.
Mobile decreased by about 12% from last year, that was due to a shift in timing of certain contracts, and that was offset partially by higher adoption of our technologies.
On a sequential basis, mobile was down about 38%, due primarily to lower recoveries and timing of revenue under contracts.
PC represented about 17% of total licensing in the second quarter.
PC was higher than last year by about 12% due to higher market volume, along with increased adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
And that was offset partially by declining ASP because of mix of our disc versus non-disc units.
Sequentially, PC was up by about 56%, driven by timing of revenue under contracts, along with seasonally higher activity from patent programs.
Consumer electronics represented about 16% of total licensing in Q2.
On a year-over-year basis, consumer electronics was lower by about 2% due to a shift in timing of certain contracts offset partially by higher volume in devices like sound bars and DMAs, as well as higher adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
On a sequential basis, CE decreased by about 7% due mainly to lower seasonality and timing of revenue under contracts.
Other markets represented about 10% of total licensing in the second quarter.
They were up about 14% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue from gaming and automotive, and that was offset partially by lower Dolby cinema revenues.
On a sequential basis, other markets decreased by about 22%, driven by lower seasonality in gaming and lower admin fees from Via.
Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $16 million in Q2 compared to $16.9 million in Q1 and $23 million in last year's Q2.
And the year-over-year decrease was attributable to lower demand in the cinema industry because of the pandemic.
So now I'd like to discuss Q2 margins and operating expenses.
Total gross margin in the second quarter was 89.9% on a GAAP basis and 90.5% on a non-GAAP basis.
Products and services gross margin -- products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $345,000 in Q2 compared to minus $5.5 million in the first quarter.
Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was a positive $1.1 million in Q2 compared to a negative $3.9 million in the first quarter.
As I mentioned when I gave guidance, we took steps to reduce the cost structure in manufacturing, and that's helping our product gross margins return to positive territory.
Operating expenses in the second quarter on a GAAP basis were $204 million compared to $189.8 million in Q1.
The annual salary increases for our employee base went into effect at the beginning of Q2.
And also, Q1 operating expenses benefited from a gain on sale of our facility in Brisbane.
Operating expenses in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $178.4 million compared to $167.1 million in the first quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were pretty much in line with the guidance that we gave.
Operating income in the second quarter was $83.2 million on a GAAP basis or 26% of revenue compared to $105.9 million or 30.1% of revenue in Q2 of last year.
Operating income in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $110.9 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $129 million or 36.7% of revenue in Q2 of last year.
Income tax in Q2 was 10.6% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the second quarter was $76.2 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and that compares to $88.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share in last year's Q2.
And net income on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter was $94.8 million or $0.91 per diluted share, that compares to $106.6 million or $1.04 per diluted share in Q2 of last year.
For both GAAP and non-GAAP, net income in the second quarter was above the guidance that we gave and that was due to the revenue coming in higher than what we had expected.
During the second quarter, we generated about $83 million in cash from operations which compares to the $66 million generated in last year's second quarter, and we ended the second quarter this year with about $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
During the second quarter, we bought back about 760,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $76 million of stock repurchase authorization still available.
We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.
The dividend will be payable on May 25, 2021, to shareholders of record on May 17, 2021.
So now let's talk about the forward outlook.
three months ago, when I went through the outlook for Q2, I said then based on a variety of factors and assumptions, that we could see a scenario for second half revenues in the mid- to high 500s.
Now with Q2 behind us, our updated scenario is for second half revenue ranging from $560 million to $600 million.
And if I focus more specifically on Q3, we anticipate that third quarter total revenue could range from $260 million to $290 million.
Within that, licensing could range from $250 million to $275 million, while products and services revenue could range from $13 million to $18 million.
In terms of the assumptions we've made about market conditions, industry analyst reports indicate that PC TAMs in the second half could be higher on a year-over-year basis.
However, for TVs and other consumer devices, industry reports continue to indicate that TAMs could be down in the second half because of an uptick in demand that happened last year in the middle of the pandemic, but might not repeat this year.
At the same time, we are expecting organic growth in the second half, and that's on a year-over-year basis.
Driven by broader adoption of our Dolby technologies broadly across various markets.
And we also anticipate higher revenue from our cinema-related businesses in the second half as that industry starts to recover compared to where it was last year.
So let me move on to the rest of the P&L outlook for Q3.
Q3 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 88% to 89%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 89% to 90%.
Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from about breakeven to $1 million positive on a GAAP basis and from $1 million to $2 million positive on a non-GAAP basis.
Operating expenses in Q3 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $210 million to $220 million; and operating expenses in Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, are estimated to range from $185 million to $195 million.
Now the increase in operating expenses from Q2 to Q3 is being driven mainly by our marketing programs that from a timing standpoint, have more of their activities taking place in the second half this year, which also means that at this point, Q4 expenses could be at least as much as what we spend in Q3.
But I'd like to point out that for the year as a whole, the marketing expenses at the high end of our opex range would be similar to what they were last year, just timed differently.
We'll give you an update on this when we report our Q3 results.
So let's finish up the Q3 outlook.
Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the third quarter, and that's $1 million to $2 million for the third quarter.
And our effective tax rate for Q3 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
Based on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q3 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.15 to $0.30 on a GAAP basis and from $0.37 to $0.52 on a non-GAAP basis.
So with that, I'll kick it back over to Mr. Yeaman.
As I'm sure most of you or all of you saw, we also announced today that Lewis has made a decision to retire later this year.
Over the last nine years, Lewis has played an integral role in building our strong financial position, navigating new business models, and just overall supporting the expansion of Dolby experiences.
He's built a very strong team.
He's mentored countless employees, both within and beyond the finance organization.
And Lewis is going to be working closely with me to ensure a smooth transition as we work to identify our next Chief Financial Officer.
So we've still got Lewis.
We're going to enjoy that for now.
And then we'll be happy to -- that Lewis will have more time to focus on his family.
So Kevin, is it true that when I first told you, you said good riddance?
I think you might have misinterpreted that.
I can't believe now that they actually have books out there called Dad Jokes because I think all my jokes probably fit into that category, but it has definitely been a privilege to serve as the company's Chief Financial Officer and lot of great memories.
And since we're all about the experience, I can definitely say that I've had my own unique Dolby experience here.
So I look forward to a smooth transition as we move on to the next phase.
Company is in great shape.
Great shape, great promise ahead.
So I will happily watch from sidelines.
Well, Lewis, I haven't heard anyone disagree with you yet when you talk about the quality of your humor.
And we are going to make sure and get the most out of your remaining transition time.
And with that, I'm sure our audience is eager to get to questions.
We've covered a lot of ground.
","Dolby's second-quarter financial results reflected solid momentum across its business segments. Licensing revenues remained strong, with particular growth in gaming and automotive markets. The company also highlighted significant progress in expanding Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos into new content experiences, including music and gaming. Dolby's financial performance was driven by higher-than-expected volume in multiple end markets. Despite the impact of COVID-19, cinema-related business saw initial signs of recovery. The company's technology is also gaining traction in mobile, as evidenced by the adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in leading smartphones. The growth in streaming content has further solidified Dolby's position within entertainment. Looking ahead, the company anticipates further adoption of its technologies, particularly in the second half of the year. Dolby expects revenue ranging from $560 million to $600 million, with Q3 revenue projected at $260 million to $290 million."
MAN_q3_2021.txt,"I will start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter, then Jack will go through the third quarter results and guidance for the fourth quarter.
And I'll then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session.
But before we start, Jack will now cover the Safe Harbor language.
These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs.
Following our announcement and special investor call in late August, we were very pleased to recently announce the successful and timely completion of the ettain group acquisition.
ettain was one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services provider in North America and, since October 1st, is now operating as part of our Experis business.
In addition to expanding our IT services in the financial and healthcare sectors, this acquisition also improves our geographic diversification in the U.S. and increases our strength in the digital workspace and business transformation practice areas.
Turning to our financial results.
In the third quarter, revenue was $5.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year in constant currency.
Our operating profit for the quarter was $151 million.
Excluding Mexico restructuring and ettain acquisition transaction costs, operating profit was $162 million.
Operating profit was up significantly year-over-year as the pandemic had a significant financial impact in the prior year.
Reported operating margin was 2.9%, and after excluding Mexico restructuring and acquisition costs, operating profit margin was 3.2%.
Reported earnings per diluted share was $1.77 and $1.93 after excluding Mexico restructuring and acquisition costs and both were significantly above the prior year.
The global economic recovery continued in the third quarter.
As vaccine rollouts progress in many countries, and pandemic-related restrictions ease, we continue to see very strong hiring demand.
This strong demand is again evident in our Q4 ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey of more than 40,000 employers in 43 countries.
All countries are reporting improved hiring intentions year-on-year and in 14 of the 43 countries, employers are reporting hiring intentions at the highest levels in more than 10 years.
That said, during the third quarter, we have also seen some levelling off in the rate of recovery in some markets.
Concerns about the Delta variant contribute to parts of the workforce not coming back into the labor market and exacerbating worker shortages in many industries and markets, making it more difficult to meet the strong demand for workers.
The impact related to supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic have also become a more visible factor impacting many manufacturers in various industries.
As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we view supply chain challenges and the impact of the Delta variant as transitory factors, and we remain optimistic and confident in the demand outlook once the effects of the pandemic normalize.
Companies all over the world need access to skilled human capital to meet their business objectives and fully participated in the economic global recovery.
With our operational and strategic workforce solutions and services, we help them meet the strong demand for their goods and services today and into the future.
Revenues in the third quarter came in just below our constant currency guidance range, driven by a slowdown in the rate of improvement in France, due to supply chain disruptions, notably in the automotive sector, and Delta variant disruptions.
Gross profit margin came in well above our guidance range.
As-adjusted operating profit was $162 million, representing a significant increase from the prior year period which was heavily impacted by the pandemic.
As-adjusted operating profit margin was 3.2%, which was at the top end of our guidance.
Breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 1%, our constant currency revenue increased 11%.
Due to the impact of net dispositions and slightly fewer billing days, the organic days-adjusted revenue increase was 12%.
Comparing to pre-pandemic levels, our third quarter revenues were below 2019 levels by 5% on an organic days-adjusted constant currency basis, which is slightly lower than the second quarter trend on this same basis due to the impact of new regulations in Mexico and the exiting of a low-margin arrangement in Australia.
Turning to the earnings per share bridge on Slide 4, earnings per share was $1.77, which included $0.07 related to Mexico restructuring costs and $0.09 related to acquisition transaction costs.
Excluding these costs, adjusted earnings per share was $1.93 which exceeded the mid-point of our guidance range.
Walking from our guidance mid-point, our results included: improved operational performance of $0.02; slightly lower than expected foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact of $0.03; a slightly better than expected effective tax rate that added $0.02; and favorable other expenses which added $0.02.
Looking at our gross profit margin in detail, our gross margin came in at 16.6%.
Underlying staffing margin contributed 20 basis point increase.
Permanent recruitment contributed an 80 basis point GP margin improvement as hiring activity was strong across our largest markets.
A lower mix of Right Management career transition business this year drove 30 basis points of GP margin reduction.
Other and accrual adjustments included a 10 basis point margin improvement from our Experis managed services business in Europe and a 10 basis point improvement from consulting and MSP services, partially offset by a 10 basis point reduction from lower direct cost adjustments in the current year as favorable direct cost adjustments in Latin America were less than the prior year favorable adjustments in France.
Next, let's review our gross profit by business line.
During the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 63% of gross profit.
Our Experis professional business comprised 22%, and Talent Solutions comprised 15%.
During the quarter, our Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit year-over-year growth of 15%.
Compared to pre-pandemic levels, this represented a decrease of 4% from the third quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.
Gross profit in our Experis brand increased 24% on an organic constant currency basis year-over-year during the quarter.
This represented a flat trend from the third quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.
Talent Solutions includes our global market leading RPO, MSP and Right Management offerings.
Organic gross profit increased 16% in constant currency year-over-year.
This represented an increase of 14% from the third quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.
Our RPO business posted high double-digit GP growth during the quarter on significant hiring activity.
Our MSP business, which has grown through the entire pandemic, continued to experience double-digit growth in gross profit in the quarter.
As the recovery strengthens, our Right Management business continues to see significant run-off in outplacement activity, primarily in the U.S., and experienced a reduction in gross profit of 42% year-over-year.
Our SG&A expense in the quarter was $703 million and represented a 6% increase on a reported basis from the prior year.
Excluding Mexico restructuring charges and acquisition costs in the current year and restructuring charges and a loss from dispositions in the prior year, SG&A was 13% higher on a constant currency basis.
This compares to an increase in gross profit of 17% in constant currency and reflects investment in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity, as well as ongoing technology initiatives.
The underlying increases consisted of operational costs of $78 million and currency changes of $6 million.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue, after excluding restructuring and acquisition costs, represented 13.4% in the third quarter.
The Americas segment comprised 19% of consolidated revenue.
Revenue in the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency.
OUP was $41 million.
Excluding Mexico restructuring costs and ettain acquisition costs, OUP was $52 million and OUP margin was 5.2%.
The U.S. is the largest country in the Americas segment, comprising 65% of segment revenues.
Revenue in the U.S. was $645 million, representing an 11% increase compared to the prior year.
Excluding ettain acquisition costs in the current year and restructuring charges in the prior year, OUP for our U.S. business is flat year-over-year at $34 million in the quarter as decreases from Right Management's career placement run-off was offset by improvements across all other businesses.
Excluding the acquisition costs, OUP margin was 5.3%.
Within the U.S., the Manpower brand comprised 33% of gross profit during the quarter.
Revenue for the Manpower brand in the U.S. increased 9% during the quarter.
While the U.S. Manpower business continues to recover, the labor shortage experienced in the second quarter continued into the third quarter through the summer months.
The Experis brand in the U.S. comprised 33% of gross profit in the quarter.
Within Experis in the U.S., IT skills comprise approximately 80% of revenues.
Experis U.S. revenues grew 17% during the quarter and we anticipate continued strong double-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter.
We are encouraged by the current trends in our U.S. Experis business and the recent acquisition of ettain which significantly increases our presence in the convenience market for IT professional services.
Talent Solutions in the U.S. contributed 34% of gross profit and experienced revenue growth of 9% in the quarter.
This was driven by RPO which experienced record revenue levels as hiring programs continued to strengthen.
MSP business continued to perform well and experienced double-digit revenue growth in the quarter.
In the fourth quarter, on an organic basis, we expect ongoing underlying improvement and revenue growth for the U.S. in the range of 1% to 5% year-over-year.
This represents a 1% decline compared to 2019 levels using the midpoint of our guidance.
Separately, we estimate ettain revenues within a range of $175 million to $185 million in the fourth quarter.
Our Mexico operation experienced a revenue decline of 46% in constant currency in the quarter.
The decline was driven by the new labor legislation which prohibits certain types of temporary staffing not considered specialized services.
The actual reduction in demand from our clients from the regulation was more severe than originally anticipated.
The restructuring actions we have taken in the third quarter have quickly right-sized this business for the impact of new regulations.
Although this will result in significant revenue reductions over the next few quarters, we believe the mix shift toward more specialized staffing will improve the margin profile of our Mexican business over time.
We also believe there may be additional revenue opportunities over time as clients adjust their workforce strategies.
We estimate that fourth quarter revenues in Mexico will decrease by approximately 55% to 60% year-over-year.
Mexico represented 2.8% of our 2020 revenues.
Revenue in Canada increased 15% in constant currency during the quarter.
Southern Europe revenue comprised 46% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.
Revenue in Southern Europe came in at $2.4 billion, growing 12% in constant currency.
OUP equaled $111 million and OUP margin was 4.6%.
France revenue comprised 55% of the Southern Europe segment in the quarter and increased 8% in constant currency.
Compared to the same period in 2019, France revenues were down 10%.
Automotive supply chain constraints and the Delta variant slowed the rate of recovery in the third quarter for our French business.
OUP was $62 million in the quarter and OUP margin was 4.7%.
As we begin the fourth quarter, we are estimating a year-over-year constant currency increase in revenues for France in the range of 2% to 6%.
Comparing estimated fourth quarter revenues to pre-crisis levels in constant currency, this represents an 8% decline compared to 2019 levels in the fourth quarter using the midpoint of our guidance.
Revenue in Italy equaled $456 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 28% in days-adjusted constant currency.
Through the third quarter, revenues in Italy continued to exceed 2019 levels.
OUP equaled $31 million and OUP margin was 6.7%.
We estimate that Italy will continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter with year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in the range of 7% to 11%.
Revenue in Spain increased 1% in days-adjusted constant currency from the prior year and revenue in Switzerland increased 21% in days-adjusted constant currency.
Our Northern Europe segment comprised 23% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.
Revenue increased 19% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, driven by all major markets.
OUP represented $17 million and OUP margin was 1.4%.
Our largest market in Northern Europe segment is the U.K., which represented 37% of segment revenues in the quarter.
During the quarter, U.K. revenues grew 26% in constant currency.
We expect continued growth in the 4% to 8% constant currency range year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
In Germany, revenues increased 13% in days-adjusted constant currency in the third quarter.
We expect to see ongoing revenue improvement in Germany in the fourth quarter.
In the Nordics, revenues grew 19% in constant currency.
Revenue in the Netherlands increased 5% in constant currency.
Belgium experienced days-adjusted revenue growth of 10% in constant currency during the quarter.
The Asia Pacific Middle East segment comprises 12% of total company revenue.
In the quarter, revenue grew 4% in constant currency to $611 million.
OUP was $23 million and OUP margin was 3.7%.
Revenue in Japan grew 13% in constant currency which represents an improvement from the 10% growth rate in the second quarter.
Our Japan business continues to lead the market in revenue growth, and we expect ongoing high single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
Revenues in Australia were down 29% in constant currency, reflecting the exit of a low-margin client arrangement during the second quarter.
I'll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet.
During the first nine months of the year, free cash flow equaled $343 million compared to $685 million in the prior year reflecting significant accounts receivable declines in the prior year period.
Our third quarter free cash flow of $172 million exceeded the prior year free cash flow of $108 million, representing strong current period cash collections.
At quarter end, days sales outstanding was flat year-over-year at 58 days.
Capital expenditures represented $40 million for the nine-month period and $15 million during the third quarter.
During the third quarter we did not have any share repurchases.
Our year-to-date purchases stand at 1.5 million shares of stock for $150 million.
As of September 30th, we have 1.9 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 2019 share program and 4 million shares remaining under the share program approved in August of 2021.
Our balance sheet was strong at quarter-end with cash of $1.61 billion and total debt of $1.07 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $547 million.
On October 1st, we utilized $800 million of cash to fund the acquisition of ettain.
Our debt ratios at quarter-end reflect total gross debt to trailing 12-months Adjusted EBITDA of 1.63 and total debt to total capitalization at 30%.
Our debt and credit facilities did not change in the quarter.
Although our revolving credit facility for $600 million remained unused at September 30th, we did draw $150 million on October 1st in conjunction with the funding of the ettain acquisition.
As we previously indicated, we intend to pay this down over the next 12 months.
Next, I'll review our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021.
Our guidance continues to assume no material additional COVID-19-related difficulties beyond those that exists today, including incremental supply chain disruptions, additional variants and the emergence of adverse trends impacting our clients in any of our largest markets.
On that basis, we are forecasting earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.99 to $2.07, which includes an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $0.04 per share and a positive $0.13 impact from ettain.
This does not include the impact of acquisition transaction costs of approximately $9 million or integration costs of $4 million to $6 million which will be broken out separately from ongoing operations.
Our constant currency revenue guidance growth range is between 5% and 9% and, after adjusting for ettain, our organic constant currency growth range is estimated between 2% and 6%.
The midpoint of our constant currency guidance is 7%.
A minor decrease in billing days in the fourth quarter and the impact of net acquisitions, driven by ettain, impact the growth rate, resulting in an outlook for organic days-adjusted revenue growth of 4% at the midpoint.
This would represent a fourth quarter organic constant currency decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% compared to 2019 revenues, representing an improvement from our third quarter trend.
Although final purchase accounting for the ettain acquisition will be finalized in the months ahead, we currently estimate that intangible asset amortization will be approximately $24 million annually.
Since amortization will be more significant going forward, we are also disclosing operating profit before amortization, or EBITA, to help assess underlying financial performance.
We estimate that EBITA margin during the fourth quarter will be up 30 basis points at the midpoint compared to the prior year with ettain contributing 20 basis points of the improvement.
We expect our operating profit margin during the fourth quarter to be up 20 basis points at the midpoint compared to the prior year with ettain contributing 10 basis points of the improvement.
We estimate that the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter will be 32%.
As usual, our guidance does not incorporate restructuring charges or additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 55.3 million.
The acceleration of digitization and investment in technology by companies during the pandemic means organizations are requiring new skills and capabilities for the future.
While hiring intentions are at some of the highest levels we have seen in years, it is unlikely employers will be able to fulfill all these intentions as a result of the labor market shortages for many skills.
Our most recent global Talent Shortage survey found that shortages are at a 15-year high for the second consecutive quarter, with 69% of employers stating they cannot find the talent they need.
In response, organizations are looking ahead, focusing on strengthening workforce and reskilling, upskilling and building the capabilities to ensure their existing and future workforce has the skills to remain competitive.
We believe this is an opportunity for us and through our diversification strategy, we are sourcing the talent they are looking for through the offerings in our Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions brands.
We are also investing in innovation to create the talent pools with skills and capabilities at scale.
Our successful Manpower MyPath program has impacted over 129,000 lives to date and is a great example of this.
Through MyPath, we are building the talent pool of the future and providing clients access to our high potential associates.
Another recent example of innovation is our Experis Career Accelerator launched at the global Viva Tech conference in Paris earlier this year and now active in six markets.
Experis Career Accelerator is our AI-driven platform, developed in partnership with FutureFit AI.
Using machine learning and dynamic data to scan the market, it can match our Experis consultants to IT learning pathways and in-demand roles.
We are attracting, developing, upskilling our consultants by providing curated learning and technical training content from the world's leading tech clients and accredited learning partners, and preparing our people with the skills tech employers need most.
Machine learning is also helping us grow our own people's expertise so they are even better at assessing and predicting performance to provide a better job match than either humans or machines could do on their own.
That's an example of how we continue to innovate in our brands to invest in our capability to both find and create the best talent pipeline in the market for the benefit of the organizations we work with and for the benefit of the individuals for whom we provide sustainable and meaningful careers and employment.
This investment in our people's skills is also reflected in our recent internal Annual People Survey where we are pleased to see higher employee engagement levels year-over-year, despite the challenges experienced by many of them during the pandemic.
We are proud and very grateful for the strong culture of our organization and we see this as a competitive advantage with opportunities for even further improvement, positioning us very well for future growth.
I'd now like to open the call for Q&A.
","ManpowerGroup's third-quarter revenue reached $5.1 billion, increasing 11% year-over-year in constant currency. The company's earnings per share (EPS) were $1.93, excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, exceeding market expectations. While supply chain disruptions and the Delta variant slowed growth in some markets, hiring demand remains strong globally. The acquisition of ettain, a leading IT staffing firm, has strengthened ManpowerGroup's IT services and geographic diversification. In Q4, the company projects revenue growth between 5% and 9% in constant currency, with EBITA margin improving by 30 basis points at the midpoint. Despite labor shortages, ManpowerGroup remains optimistic, investing in digital workforce solutions, upskilling, and reskilling programs to meet future demand for skilled talent."
FTV_q3_2020.txt,"Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.
fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information.
We completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and accordingly have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for historical periods.
All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.
We are pleased with our third quarter results as strong execution across the portfolio delivered a top line performance that was significantly better than our initial guidance as well as a return to year-over-year growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.
For the quarter, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.94, an 8% increase year-over-year.
While the operating environment remained challenging in Q3, we continued to successfully navigate the near-term headwinds by leveraging the Fortive Business System.
We increased core operating margins by 160 basis points and generated another quarter of strong free cash flow while prioritizing growth investments across our portfolio to drive continued share gains.
On October 9, we completed the successful spin-off of Vontier Corporation, a global industrial technology company focused on mobility infrastructure.
I'm extremely proud of the effort and the focus shown by our team throughout the year leading up to the separation, and I am very excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead for both companies.
The ability to maintain our readiness and execute this complex transaction despite the obvious challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of our people and the power of FBS.
As separate companies, Fortive and Vontier are both well positioned to execute against their strategic priorities to generate increasing value for all our stakeholders.
With the spin-off of Vontier complete, Fortive is well positioned as a provider of essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end markets.
We have strong established positions with leading brands that benefit from long-term secular growth drivers and have opportunities to increase recurring revenue.
We have a long track record of disciplined capital allocation, significant balance sheet capacity and free cash flow and substantial opportunities for both organic investment and strategic M&A across the portfolio.
Most importantly, we have the Fortive Business System, the cornerstone of our culture, and an enduring source of competitive advantage that underpins our commitment to continuous improvement.
Since Vontier was part of Fortive throughout the third quarter, the financial results that we will discuss today include the Vontier businesses.
Also, the guidance that we provide today will be for Fortive's continuing operations only.
With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter.
Adjusted net earnings were $338.5 million, up 8.8% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.94.
Total sales increased 2.3% to $1.9 billion, with core revenue essentially flat, reflecting significant sequential improvement from the prior quarter.
Acquisitions contributed 220 basis points of growth, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased growth by 20 basis points.
Adjusted gross margins were 51.8% in the third quarter, increasing 50 basis points year-over-year.
Gross margins benefited from 50 basis points of price, the growing contribution of our higher-margin software businesses and disciplined supply chain execution.
We also generated 160 basis points of core operating margin expansion, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.7% for the quarter.
Our ability to drive strong core OMX, despite the significant ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic reflected the solid execution of our teams and the disciplined application of FBS.
We continue to effectively manage the business through this uncertain environment, flexing cost actions as needed while also investing in our strategic product development and innovation priorities to position us well for the future.
During the third quarter, we generated $455 million of free cash flow, representing conversion of 134% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 31% year-over-year.
This performance took our year-to-date free cash flow up to approximately $1.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 48%.
Despite a challenging environment over the past few quarters, our operating companies continue to use FBS to manage their working capital effectively in the short term, increasing inventory turns and limiting the headwinds from the sequentially improving top line.
Turning to our segments.
Professional Instrumentation posted a total revenue increase of 0.9% despite a 3.5% decline in core revenue.
Acquisitions contributed 370 basis points, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 70 basis points.
Core operating margin increased 90 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 22.8%.
Industrial Technologies performed well in Q3 driven in particular by the North American businesses of both Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Matco.
Total revenue increased 4.5%, including a 5.5% increase in core revenue.
Core operating margin increased 290 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 25.9%.
Note that the growth rates shown on the slide reflect consolidated Fortive Q3 growth, which includes the results of the Vontier businesses.
That said, we will focus our operating company color primarily on the businesses that remain with Fortive.
In Asia, core revenue declined low single digits despite mid-single-digit growth in China.
Strength in China was broad based, highlighted by mid-teens year-over-year growth at Fluke, double-digit growth at Advanced Sterilization Products and greater than 20% growth in Sensing.
Western Europe core revenue declined mid-single digits in Q3, highlighted by low double-digit growth at ASP.
ASP has reported year-over-year growth in each quarter of 2020 thus far, driven by solid sales execution.
Accruent also delivered a strong quarter in Western Europe led by Meridian, its engineering information management solution, reflecting the momentum the company has built in the region.
While point-of-sale remained negative for both Fluke and Tektronix, the point-of-sale trend improved throughout the quarter, and revenue at these businesses increased mid-teens versus the prior quarter.
North America core revenue grew low single digits in Q3, showing broad-based sequential improvement versus Q2.
Growth in North America was led by a strong quarter for the Vontier businesses.
At new Fortive, a number of the software businesses continue to perform well with growth across Intelex, eMaint and Censis; Industrial Scientific's iNet business; and Qualitrol also performed well.
As in Western Europe, Fluke and Tektronix saw improving point-of-sale trends, though still negative as we turn the corner into Q4.
In recent quarters, we have laid out a framework for analyzing our portfolio with businesses organized into groups based on the relative sensitivity to pandemic-driven disruption and resulting deterioration in end market demand.
As shown on Slide 11, the relative performance of these groups largely played out as expected in the quarter.
Group I, which represented approximately 20% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, continued to show significant resilience, posting low single-digit growth.
The group's performance again reflected a solid contribution from the software businesses, highlighted by high single-digit growth at Intelex, which is seeing continued robust growth in North America and is benefiting from the successful execution of the company's expansion into Western Europe.
Elsewhere, Censis posted low-single-digit growth, underpinned by the momentum of its SaaS offerings.
Accruent also benefited from the resilience of its SaaS business, which increased slightly in the quarter with continued growth in annual recurring revenue based on improving churn and increased net retention.
Fluke Industrial Imaging had another strong quarter, although its growth moderated as some of the initial COVID-related demand began to level off.
Gordian saw slowing in project work among state and local governments and higher education customers, leading to a low single-digit decline for the quarter.
Meanwhile, despite continued strong order flow, EMC registered a mid-teens decline due to certain COVID-related supply chain issues and some customer delays.
Group II, which represented approximately 32% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, recorded a low single-digit decline.
ISC's iNet subscription business posted a high single-digit growth, while Fluke Health Solutions showed mid-single-digit growth driven by ventilator tester tailwinds and support from Landauer's high recurring revenue business model.
ASP reported a mid-single-digit decline due to a mid-single-digit decline in North America and pressure in Japan, which saw a resurgence of COVID cases and an associated reduction in elective procedures.
However, we are very pleased to see this partially offset by strong growth in both China and Western Europe in the quarter.
We now estimate that elective procedures in the U.S. are back to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels and are back to approximately 95% in both China and Europe.
Group III, which represented approximately 12% of new Fortive in Q3, saw a high single-digit decline in the quarter.
While the Sensing portfolio declined by mid-single digits, this represented sequential improvement versus the second quarter.
Semiconductors and electronics continue to be a bright spot for Sensing, which also benefited from COVID-related tailwinds in medical end markets.
Elsewhere in Group III, Accruent's professional services and licenses business lines saw an ongoing negative impact from continued delays in accessing customer sites.
Group IV, which represented approximately 36% of new Fortive Q3 revenue, declined by high single digits in the quarter but saw a meaningful sequential improvement and performed ahead of our forecast.
Both Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business saw broad-based sequential improvement.
Fluke Industrial decreased by low single digits, paced by Fluke Calibration, which registered mid-single-digit growth.
The performance of the Tek Instruments business was highlighted by Keithley, which recorded mid-single-digit year-over-year growth.
The business also saw improved order activity as the quarter progressed, including initial orders for the new six and eight-channel versions of the six Series oscilloscope.
While we are encouraged by what we saw at both Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business in the third quarter, we remain watchful of key macro trends as we continue to work our way toward a return to year-over-year growth in both businesses.
Since the end of the second quarter, we have continued to reduce our net debt with our strong free cash flow and the proceeds received from the Vontier separation.
Including the recent proceeds from Vontier, our net debt is now approximately $2.8 billion, down from over $5.1 billion at the end of 2019.
As we look ahead, we expect to continue to generate solid free cash flow, which will enable us to reduce our net debt further.
We also expect to monetize our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier in a tax-efficient manner, with timing subject to market conditions.
While Q3 saw a continuation of the better operating performance that started as the economic lockdowns lifted back in the spring, we remain watchful of macro conditions in light of the continued fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Q4, we expect the total revenue will increase zero to 3% on a year-over-year basis.
We also expect to deliver incremental margins of approximately 35%.
Finally, we are planning to execute approximately $30 million of strategic productivity initiatives before the end of the year, in line with our prior expectation that some of the temporary actions we executed early in the year would be made permanent as we turn the corner into 2021.
The resegmentation highlights the strong position we have assembled to provide essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end markets.
This view also helps to frame how we think about our portfolio from the perspective of both organic and inorganic opportunities.
Details on the segments are as follows.
The Intelligent Operating Solutions segment includes Fluke, Industrial Scientific, Intelex, Accruent and Gordian and represents approximately 40% of new Fortive total revenue.
This segment provides solutions to accelerate field and facility safety, reliability and productivity as well as operating intelligence to a range of end users and addresses a total available market of greater than $15 billion.
Precision Technologies segment includes Tektronix, Pacific Scientific EMC and the Sensing businesses, which will now also include Qualitrol and represent approximately 35% of new Fortive total revenue.
This segment provides mission-critical technologies that enable our customers to accelerate the development of innovative products and solutions and addresses a total available market of greater than $10 billion.
The Advanced Health Care Solutions segment includes Advanced Sterilization Products, Fluke Health Solutions, Censis and Invetech and represents approximately 25% of new Fortive total revenue.
This segment provides solutions that enhance patient safety, prevent hospital infections, deliver operating efficiencies and accelerate healthcare system innovation and addresses a total available market of greater than $5 billion.
Importantly, we will report on this basis from the fourth quarter onward and plan to issue supplemental financial information in the coming weeks that aligns with this resegmented view of the portfolio so that you can rebase your models.
Before we wrap up, I want to quickly express my appreciation to the Fortive and Vontier teams for their continued effort and strong execution in 2020.
This has undoubtedly been an extremely difficult year, but our performance in the third quarter highlighted once again how our continued -- our team continues to rise and meet the challenge.
With the strong support of FBS, we managed to complete our final preparations for the spin-off of Vontier while also navigating the challenging macro environment to deliver improved top line performance and another quarter of strong free cash flow.
While we face an uncertain environment in the near term, we will continue to benefit from the increasingly resilient portfolio that we have established through our efforts to continue to transform the portfolio over the last four years.
With our consistent free cash flow, strong M&A pipeline and an expanding set of organic innovation capabilities, we are well positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead of us.
That concludes our formal comments.
","Fortive experienced robust Q3 results, with strong execution across its portfolio leading to a 2.3% increase in total sales to $1.9 billion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share grew 8% to $0.94. Acquisitions and favorable exchange rates contributed to growth, and gross margins expanded by 50 basis points to 51.8%. Operating margins improved 160 basis points, resulting in a 22.7% adjusted operating profit margin. Operating companies effectively managed headwinds and invested in strategic initiatives. Free cash flow surged 31% to $455 million, representing 134% of adjusted net earnings. Despite challenges, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies both posted revenue gains. Fluke and Tektronix saw improving point-of-sale trends, while Sensing experienced sequential improvement. The company remains watchful of macro trends and expects Q4 revenue to increase 0-3% with incremental margins of approximately 35%. Fortive has implemented a new segmentation that highlights its focus on essential technologies for connected workflow solutions in various end markets."
UPS_q3_2021.txt,"These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC.
For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP results included after-tax transformation and other charges of $54 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges.
In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver.
But through it all, UPSers leverage the flexibility of our integrated network and the technology that powers it to deliver what matters.
A little over one year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework under a customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy.
Inside that strategic framework is a focus on three main areas.
First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume.
Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost takeout initiatives.
And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers, and higher returns on the capital we deploy.
While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results.
Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated.
Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion, driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all three of our operating segments.
Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion, driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control.
Each of our segments delivered year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit operating margins.
And for the first nine months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history.
Brian will share the details of our performance shortly.
As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMBs.
These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network.
Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities.
This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week.
We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial pickups and deliveries.
In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery.
The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital.
And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis.
As we look at our third-quarter results, we see that SMBs value the new capabilities we are providing.
In the U.S., SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9% year over year.
In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past six quarters.
volume, up 380 basis points from one year ago.
And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%.
We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our Digital Access Program, to customers outside of the U.S. Let me also touch on SMBs and healthcare.
When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology, and expertise.
Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB healthcare customers and significantly driving profit growth in this sector.
And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year with 99.9% on-time delivery.
We are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress.
While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights.
In the U.S. we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH, or pieces per hour, increased by 2.5%.
Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Day, through our ongoing efforts to optimize loads in our trailers, cube utilization in the third quarter was up 520 basis points versus last year.
This helped us eliminate more than 10% of daily trailer loads year over year.
And as we've discussed previously, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs.
So to reduce turnover and improve productivity, we are converting around 1,000 part-time supervisor positions in our operations into nearly 400 full-time positions at no additional cost to our company.
Turning to what we refer to as Transformation 2.0 or plans to optimize our nonoperating expense.
We are on track to eliminate $500 million in nonoperating costs this year, with about $500 million of additional opportunity in 2022.
Finally, our third area of focus is disciplined capital allocation.
Since we began executing our strategy, we've seen marked improvement in our employee satisfaction and competitive Net Promoter Scores, due in part to how we've allocated capital to enhance the employee and customer experience.
In October, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform that also provides delivery services for packages that don't lend themselves to our small package network.
We continue to be disciplined in our capital spending practices.
This discipline, plus record earnings, yield a significant amount of cash.
So far this year, we've generated a record $9.3 billion in free cash flow.
And we expect full-year 2021 return on invested capital to be around 29%, which is a 730-basis-point improvement from what we reported at the end of last year.
Turning to the fourth quarter.
The global supply chain market is challenging.
There are capacity, congestion, and cost concerns.
But for UPS, our outlook is positive as, once we get a package, we get it delivered.
Outside of the U.S., where we peak, we are ready, and tight capacity benefits our freight forwarding business.
In the U.S., we project a robust peak season, and through our planning efforts, we believe we are well on our way to deliver a peak that will be a win for UPS shippers, recipients, and share owners.
Let me share a few details.
To begin with, the calendar is helpful as we have one more peak operating day than last year.
Further, we've expanded weekend delivery and added additional sorting capacity.
Nonetheless, we expect consumer demand will outpace capacity in the market.
We began collaborating with our largest customer several months ago, and we'll stay in close contact with them during the holiday shipping season.
Our technology allows us to match daily capacity with customer demand.
And where we need to, we will again control the amount of volume that enters our network.
These actions will minimize chaos costs and enable high service levels.
On the labor front, we've digitized and simplified our job application process.
enabling qualified applicants to receive a job offer within 30 minutes of applying.
In parts of the country, labor costs are higher than they were last year, but we are effectively managing through that cost pressure.
When you add it up, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate record consolidated operating profit and expand operating margin year over year.
While we are laser-focused on peak, our business doesn't end on December 31st.
Later this week, we will release our U.S. general rate increase.
The 2022 increase will be 5.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation pressures.
The details will be posted to ups.com.
As we move ahead, we will continue to execute by leveraging our global Smart Logistics Network, our amazing UPSers, and a strategy that's driving strong financial results today and positions us well for the future.
In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with a macro overview, then our third-quarter results.
Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns.
And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the full year.
Let's start with the macro.
In the third quarter, the global economy continued its strong growth despite the dampening effects of COVID-19 and inflation, along with shortages in inventory and labor.
Within this backdrop, demand for our services remained high and the pricing environment in the industry was firm.
We expect similar dynamics in the fourth quarter, and as we demonstrated in the third, we will continue to execute our strategy and capture profitable growth opportunities in the market.
IHS is forecasting fourth-quarter global GDP will grow 3.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 4.9%, which remain above historic GDP growth rates.
Moving to our third-quarter consolidated performance.
The progress we've made to improve revenue quality enhance productivity and allocate capital is driving strong top and bottom line results.
Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $23.2 billion.
Consolidated operating profit totaled $3 billion, 23.4% higher than last year.
All three segments generated record third-quarter operating profit and achieved double-digit operating margins in the quarter.
Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.8%, which was 150 basis points above last year, and diluted earnings per share was $2.71, and up 18.9% from the same period last year.
Now let's take a look at the segments.
Our results in U.S. domestic were better than we anticipated principally due to higher than planned for improvements in revenue per piece and productivity gains.
As we expected, average daily volume in the U.S. was down 540,000 pieces or 2.7% due to a decline in SurePost of 576,000 packages per day.
This decline was partially offset by growth in ground commercial volume.
Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to win in the most attractive parts of the market.
In fact, customer mix continued to be positive as higher-yielding SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9%.
And in the third quarter, SMBs made up 27.4% of U.S. domestic volume, compared to 23.6% last year.
Regarding our delivery mix, our commercial business continued to recover and grew 6.8%, representing 42% of our volume in the third quarter, compared to 39% in the third quarter of last year.
Nearly all industry sectors grew B2B average daily volume, including retail and high tech.
For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, up 7.4%, driven by a 12% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 270 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate.
Total expense grew 5.8% and with fuel driving 180 basis points of the year-over-year expense growth rate.
Through our focus on productivity, overall improvements, led by our inside sort operations and on-road activities, helped offset the market rate adjustments we implemented in certain geographies, as well as the cost of expanding Saturday delivery.
And as Carol mentioned, a key measure of UPS productivity is pieces per hour.
And in the third quarter, we made improvements in nearly every area of our operations, led by preload, which improved by 6.5%.
Combined, these improvements contributed to a decrease in direct labor hours per day of 5.1%.
In summary, revenue growth was above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage.
The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of $281 million or 24.8% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 140 basis points.
The segment continues to generate strong profit growth, driven by the execution of our strategy.
Due to tough year-over-year comparisons and some supply chain disruptions, growth in average daily volume moderated in the third quarter and was up 1.9%.
B2B average daily volume grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and offset a decline in B2C volume, which was down 2.3%.
On a two-year stack, total average daily volume was up 14%.
Total export average daily volume was up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis.
Export growth in Europe and the Americas offset a 4.8% decrease in export average daily volume out of Asia.
The decline in Asia was due to difficult comps from a year ago and the implementation of network contingency plans in response to COVID-19 protocols at select airports.
Relative to our plan, we had 137 fewer flights out of Asia than we anticipated.
For the quarter, international revenue was up 15.5% to $4.7 billion with strong growth across all regions.
Revenue per piece was up 14%, including a 500 basis point benefit from fuel.
Revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis as we continue to utilize surcharges to match demand with available capacity.
In the third quarter, international delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of profits over $1 billion.
Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14%, and operating margin was 23.5%.
Now looking at supply chain solutions.
The segment delivered record third quarter top and bottom line results as the team executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment.
Revenue increased 8.4% to $4.3 billion with all major business categories contributing to profit growth.
Market demand remained elevated with a couple of key profit drivers.
In forwarding, capacity constraints, and consumer demand in the market drove volume growth in air freight forwarding and strong yields in our ocean freight product, which drove top and bottom line results.
And in logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our healthcare portfolio.
In the third quarter, supply chain solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million, and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%.
As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS freight results, given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30th of this year.
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense.
Other pension income was $285 million.
And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items.
Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet.
We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income.
So far, in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash from operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow.
And in the first nine months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends.
In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan.
with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter.
We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years.
Now I'll make a few comments regarding the full-year outlook.
We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and inventory and labor shortages.
Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter.
Due to our third-quarter outperformance, combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives, and our increased fourth-quarter plan, we are raising our full-year guidance.
On a consolidated basis, we expect full-year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year over year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS freight.
Additionally, consolidated operating margin should be around 13%.
In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume.
We anticipate the full-year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%.
As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter.
First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year.
And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives.
As a result, we expect the sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Moving to the international segment.
We expect full-year revenue growth of around 20.7%, with an operating margin of about 23.9%.
And in the supply chain solutions segment, we anticipate full-year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%.
Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion, and return on invested capital will be around 29%.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion.
And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%.
As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June.
We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework, and delivering on our commitments despite a very dynamic environment.
We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers and our people and the financial performance of our company.
And operator, please open the lines.
","UPS reported better-than-expected Q3 results, with consolidated revenue rising 9.2% to $23.2 billion. The company experienced double-digit operating margin growth in all three segments and saw a 23.4% increase to $3 billion in consolidated operating profit. UPS's strategic focus on enhancing revenue quality and implementing cost-cutting measures led to this strong performance. Notably, SMB volume growth remained robust in the U.S. and internationally, contributing to improved revenue per piece. Productivity initiatives and the elimination of daily trailer loads also significantly reduced UPS's cost to serve. To maintain this momentum, UPS implemented expanded weekend delivery services, which increased coverage to 90% of the U.S. population and unlocked additional network capacity without capital expenditure. Looking ahead, the company anticipates a strong peak season, supported by increased capacity, collaboration with major customers, and a 5.9% general rate increase in the U.S. UPS's positive outlook and progress in implementing its strategy position it well to achieve its long-term financial targets and drive profitable growth in the future."
RGR_q3_2021.txt,"Then Tom Dineen, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the third quarter 2021 financial results, and then I will discuss our operations and the state of the market.
Copy of these documents may be obtained by contacting the company or the SEC or on the company website at ruger.com/corporate or, of course, the SEC website at sec.gov.
We do reference non-GAAP EBITDA.
Now Tom will discuss the company's third quarter 2021 results.
For the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $178.2 million and diluted earnings were $1.98 per share.
For the comparable prior year period, net sales were $145.7 million and diluted earnings were $1.39 per share.
For the first nine months of 2021, net sales were $562.7 million and diluted earnings were $6.64 per share.
For the corresponding period in 2020, net sales were $399.6 million and diluted earnings were $3.31 per share.
The substantial increase in profitability for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses.
Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profitability declined principally due to three factors: First, all of our firearms facilities took a very well-deserved shutdown week in July, which reduced the number of workdays in the quarter to 59 compared to 64 workdays in Q2.
This decrease in production reduced sales and resulted in some unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs.
Second, after a relatively quiet second quarter, COVID positive cases in our plants were then tripled in the third quarter.
This resulted in significant increases in lost production.
And third, following six quarters of exceptional demand, excess resales decreased from the second quarter, adversely impacting our overall profitability.
Our strong financial results yielded significant cash generation.
During the first nine months of 2021, we generated $117 million of cash from operations.
We reinvested $15.6 million of that back into the company in the form of capital expenditures.
We estimate that 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $20 million, predominantly related to new product development.
Our ability to shift manufacturing equipment between cells and between facilities improves our overall utilization and allows for reduced capital investment.
Our balance sheet at October 2, 2021, remain strong.
Our cash and short-term investments, which are invested in U.S. T-bills totaled $192.7 million.
Our current ratio was 3.8:1, and we had no debt.
Our stockholders' equity was $338.1 million, which equates to a book value of $19.21 per share, of which $10.95 per share was cash and short-term investments.
In the first nine months of 2021, we returned $45.2 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends.
Our Board of Directors declared a $0.79 per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of November 15, 2021, payable on November 30, 2021.
Upon receiving this $0.79 quarterly dividend, shareholders will have received $3.36 of dividends per share in 2021.
As a reminder, our quarterly dividend is approximately 40% of net income, and therefore, it varies quarter-to-quarter.
That's the financial update for the quarter.
Demand for our products has remained strong.
Despite a moderation of overall industry demand, as reflected in the last two quarters of adjusted NICS, we shipped all of the firearms that we built this quarter without the need to aggressively promote or discount any of our products.
We've just begun to replenish the distributor and retail inventories that were largely depleted over the past 18 months, putting us in a great position as we head into the fourth quarter, which has traditionally been a period of strong demand.
The estimated unit sell-through of the company's products from the independent distributors to retailers increased 9% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the prior-year period.
For the same period, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, background checks, as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, commonly referred to as NICS checks, decreased 11%.
The increase in the sell-through of the company's products compared favorably to the decrease in adjusted NICS background checks, and may be attributable to strong consumer demand for Ruger products, increased production in 2021 and the introduction of new products that have been met with strong demand.
New product development continues to drive results.
The MAX-9 pistol and the Ruger LCP MAX pistol, which were both launched in 2021 remain in strong demand.
In the first nine months of 2021, new product sales represented $116 million or 22% of firearm sales compared to $88 million or 24% of firearm sales in the first nine months of 2020.
As a reminder, we include only major products introduced in the past eight quarters in our new product sales metric.
Derivatives, product line extensions of mature product families and models introduced more than two years ago are not included.
We are hard at work on some exciting new product initiatives, including the return of Marlin lever action rifles, which we begin -- plan to begin shipping later in the fourth quarter.
Since March of 2020, our workforce has been strengthened by 370 folks, an increase of just over 20%, and our quarterly unit production has increased by more than 160,000 units or 45% during that period.
A 20% increase in personnel yielding a 45% increase in production.
That is a tremendous accomplishment by our operations teams at all of our manufacturing plants.
Despite the growth in production at the end of third quarter 2021, our finished goods inventories remained near historic lows and distributor inventories of Ruger products were 150,000 units lower than they were at the end of 2019, the last time inventories were at what we would consider normal or expected pre-COVID-19 levels.
As Tom mentioned earlier, after an unprecedented 16-month run of seemingly insatiable product demand and continual monthly production increases, we took a one week shutdown during the first week of July.
This is our first shutdown in two years, which gave our workforce a very well-deserved break and allowed us to perform some routine maintenance and reconfigure some of our manufacturing operations.
The shutdown reduced our third quarter production sales and earnings, but that was a small price to pay.
It was the right thing to do, and I'm glad we did it.
Our dedicated and hard-working folks deserved and needed a break.
And after the shutdown, we are better prepared as we head into what we expect will be a busy fourth quarter and 2022.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we have remained proactive in maintaining the health and safety of our employees and mitigating its impact on our business.
We provide all hourly employees with additional paid time off and offer incentives to any employee who becomes vaccinated.
If practical, we allow employees to work remotely.
And we continue to follow robust cleaning, sanitizing and social distancing protocols to maintain a cleaner and safer workplace.
With the United States once again seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases in positivity rates, we remain vigilant and are proactively adjusting our plan accordingly to keep our associates healthy and safe and to minimize any disruption to our business.
Our financial strength, evidenced by our debt-free balance sheet provides financial security and flexibility as we manage through the challenges like COVID-19 and remain focused on our long-term goals and the creation of shareholder value.
In the third quarter, we added a 225,000 square foot facility in Mayodan, North Carolina, about 1.5 miles down the road from our original Mayodan building that we purchased in 2013.
This new facility doubles the size of our footprint in Mayodan and provide some room for expansion.
We moved our finished goods inventory, our ShopRuger operations and our customer service call center into the new facility.
This freed up some manufacturing space in our original building in addition to the overall -- excuse me, to the available space in the new facility.
Those are the highlights of the third quarter of 2021.
Operator, may we have the first question?
","For Q3 2021, the company reported net sales of $178.2 million and diluted earnings of $1.98 per share, marking significant increases from the previous year's $145.7 million and $1.39 per share. This surge in profitability was largely attributed to increased sales and production, leading to favorable cost leveraging. However, profitability declined compared to Q2 2021 due to a company-wide shutdown, increased COVID cases, and a decrease in excess resales. Despite these factors, the company generated $117 million in cash from operations during the first nine months of 2021, and reinvested $15.6 million into capital expenditures primarily related to new product development. Demand for products remained strong, with an increase in unit sell-through of 9% compared to a decrease of 11% in adjusted NICS background checks. New product development contributed $116 million to firearm sales, with products like the MAX-9 and LCP MAX pistols experiencing strong demand. Additionally, the company's workforce has grown by 20% since March 2020, leading to a 45% increase in quarterly unit production. Despite production growth, finished goods inventories remain near historic lows. The company's financial strength, characterized by a debt-free balance sheet and cash and short-term investments of $192.7 million, provides flexibility and security in managing challenges."
MPC_q2_2021.txt,"Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.
We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.
Actual results may differ.
Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business.
During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and the removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels.
That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year.
Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels, with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down.
Diesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019.
Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer-haul international flights and business travel.
Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels.
The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants.
As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful but cautious in the recovery and so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control.
Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter.
First, on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven.
In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases.
As part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we were able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares.
Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio.
Dickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter.
At approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States.
At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility.
Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the time line we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022, with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity.
Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of '23.
Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive.
We have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress.
In the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion.
Importantly, I want to note that in June, we published our two annual ESG-related reports.
Our sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI.
Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA.
On Slide 5, I would like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy.
From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future.
That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders.
We currently have three companywide targets many of our investors know well.
First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030.
Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025.
And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030.
The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation.
We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects.
In late '20, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, second largest of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility.
Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric.
We recently introduced a diversity, equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year.
Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations.
In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019.
Our personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors.
Slide 6 provides a summary of our second-quarter financial results.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter.
This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations.
Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter.
And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distributions.
Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases.
The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio.
So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7.
We received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion.
Based on our tax basis, our cash taxes, current and deferred, will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate.
We have accrued for this on the balance sheet.
In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million.
Therefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion.
To be clear, this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate.
On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds.
Since the close of the transaction, we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock.
In the post-tender period, we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints: first, a post-tender cooling off-period; and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead up to the release of our earnings information.
That said, not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months.
Consistent with that commitment, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital.
Specifically, we are entering into an open-market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls.
Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made, lowering our cost structure.
Since the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion.
While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021.
We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate costs as well.
There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter to quarter.
We believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million, and we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses.
As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery.
These costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter.
While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.
As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities, and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations.
Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first-quarter 2021 to second-quarter 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter over quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing.
As we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale.
Here, you can see the $11.7 billion pre-tax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairment and transaction-related costs.
The $3.7 billion financial tax -- excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact.
The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income.
Slide 18 in our appendix walk through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the three financial statements.
Moving to our segment slide results.
Slide 11 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment.
The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million.
This was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021.
The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter.
Also contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter.
It's important to recall that we idled two high-cost refineries in 2020.
If adjusted to include that capacity idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of '21 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of '21.
Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost.
Slide 12 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021.
Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.
Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization.
By the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural cost by $300 million.
Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter.
It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations.
We have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close.
Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter.
Changes in working capital were flat this quarter.
Increasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds.
During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion.
Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter.
With respect to capital return, MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds.
At the end of the quarter, NPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits.
On Slide 14, we provide our third-quarter outlook.
We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day.
Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter.
The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region.
As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.
Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well.
And so you are seeing the impact in our guided cost trends for the third quarter.
Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter.
Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter.
Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion -- $100 million, excuse me, in cost that have been removed on an annual basis.
We will be prompt for additional questions.
We will now open the call to questions.
","During the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum Corporation experienced a gradual increase in demand for its products. Despite a 2-5% decrease in gasoline demand compared to 2019 levels and a 30% decline in jet fuel demand, diesel demand remained stable. The company is cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year and will focus on factors within its control. Strategic priorities included the sale of the Speedway business, progressing the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, and maintaining cost discipline. Financially, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.194 billion, driven by higher refining margins and increased utilization. The company generated $1.535 billion in cash from continuing operations and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. To further strengthen its competitive position, Marathon Petroleum Corporation will initiate an open-market repurchase program to complete the remaining $9 billion capital return over the next 12 to 16 months. The company remains committed to cost reductions, with its refining operating cost averaging $5 per barrel in 2021. Furthermore, Marathon Petroleum Corporation is making strides in sustainability, including a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 20% reduction in fresh water withdrawal by 2030. The company is also investing in renewable fuels, allocating 40% of its growth capital to develop renewable diesel projects."
SJW_q1_2021.txt,"I will be presenting today with Eric Thornburg, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Gere, President and Chief Operating Officer of San Jose Water Company.
For those who would like to follow along, slides accompanying our remarks are available on our website at www.
These statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by the company in light of its experience, historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors that the company believes are appropriate under the circumstances.
I will now turn over the call to Eric.
I am Eric Thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of SJW Group.
We're now more than 13 months into the COVID-19 pandemic.
There is a sense of cautious optimism that the worst is behind us, and we have begun planning for the safe return to our offices and work centers.
Over the past year, we've learned much about our teams, our culture, how we can adapt and what we can achieve through remote work.
Despite the challenges, our people have personified our mission, trusted professionals passionate about delivering life-sustaining, high-quality water and exceptional service to families and communities while protecting the environment and providing a fair return to shareholders.
Looking ahead, we are preparing for a phased return to our offices and work sites, building on our established risk-based process that has served us well during the past year.
We will adhere to the safety guidelines provided by our national, state and local health authorities.
Our goal remains the same as it has been throughout the pandemic to deliver on our public health mission as a water service provider and protect our employees, customers and communities.
I and the rest of our executive leadership team are looking forward to the day when we can express our appreciation to all employees in-person and meet the new employees, who have joined our team over the past year without having set foot in our offices.
We are committed to a safe return that seizes the benefits of remote work while providing a safe physical environment to nurture collaboration and our culture.
The extreme cold and winter weather experienced in Texas last February proved the benefits of a pure-play water and wastewater utility with national scale, geographic diversity and locally focused operations.
SJW Group was able to draw on resources from our operations on the East and West Coast to assist our Texas operation during the event.
Our communications teams from both coasts assisted with customer notifications as well as website, social media and news media updates, while our operations and safety teams provided valuable incident support.
The direct experience of the Connecticut and Maine teams dealing with cold weather events added to our response.
In California, the rainfall season is largely behind us.
We have experienced lower-than-normal precipitation for the second consecutive year, and that is impacting available surface water supplies produced from our watershed.
A very low precipitation that we have experienced in the Santa Cruz Mountains this winter has had a significant impact on our local surface water operations, both in terms of storm runoff collected at the creek intakes for immediate treatment as well as the volume of water that we've been able to impound in our Lake Elsman reservoir for release later in the year.
For the first time in my 25 years at San Jose Water, we are temporarily taking our Montevina Water Treatment Plant offline due to low supply.
We will bring the plant back into service when hydrologic conditions allow.
To provide some perspective, the chart on Slide 10 shows the historic surface water production in blue compared with the associated rainfall at Lake Elsman in red over the same period.
As you can see, there's been just one other year, 2014, where we saw such low levels of rainfall and surface water production.
Fortunately, the regional water supply picture is somewhat better, and despite the low rainfall and snowpack this winter, the total groundwater storage at the end of the first quarter remained at Stage one or normal of Valley Water's water shortage contingency plan.
Based on available recharge and the current rate of withdrawal.
Valley Water reports that it is forecasting to remain in the normal range through year-end by supplementing normal supplies with additional imported water.
That bodes well for the upcoming summer months when demands are typically highest, and we anticipate adequate supplies to serve our customers.
As a result of the water supply situation in California, we anticipate increases in our operating costs through the reliance on purchase water from our wholesaler to meet our customers' needs in 2021.
Currently, every billion gallons of purchased water has an incremental cost to the company of $4.2 million more than using our own supply sources.
As a direct result of the water supply outlook and in full transparency, we are announcing guidance of $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share in 2021.
This assumes no additional company produced surface water in California for the remainder of 2021.
We are in the process of updating our strategic water supply plan to evaluate current and future supply reliability and resiliency.
Our current California general rate case proceeding will address the impact of surface water availability.
The prudent management of our business and financial resources continues to be fundamental to our growth and our ability to return capital to shareholders.
We are proud to have continuously paid a dividend for over 77 years and to have increased the annual dividend in each of the last 53 years, delivering value to our shareholders.
After Jim's remarks, I will address regulatory and other business matters.
Our first quarter operating results reflect new revenues authorized by our 2019 California general rate case.
Water infrastructure conservation adjustment and water infrastructure surcharges authorized in Connecticut and Maine and customer growth in Texas.
These increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage, the impact of a February ice storm in Texas and a decrease in available low-cost surface water due to the dry weather conditions in California that Eric and Andy just discussed.
First quarter revenue was $114.8 million, a 1% increase over the first quarter of 2020.
Net income for the quarter was $2.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share, an 8% increase over net income of $2.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share reported in the first quarter of 2020.
The increase in diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily attributable to cumulative rate increases of $0.08 per share, cumulative cost savings of $0.04 per share, a tax benefit of $0.04 per share and an increase in nonregulated income of $0.03 per share.
The diluted per share increase was partially offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.08 per share.
Customer credits in Texas totaling $0.02 per share issued in connection with the February Ice storm, a decrease in the availability of surface water of $0.02 per share and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.06 per share.
Our revenue decrease was a result of $2.8 million in decreased customer usage.
In addition, customer credits in Texas reduced revenue by $700,000 and net changes in certain balancing and memorandum accounts reduced revenue by $600,000.
These decreases were partially offset by $2.8 million in cumulative rate increases and $500,000 in revenue from new customers.
Total 2021 first quarter water production costs were slightly lower when compared to the first quarter of 2020.
The minor reduction was primarily due to $800,000 in lower average per unit cost for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges and lower usage, partially offset by a $700,000 increase due to the purchase of additional water supplies to supplement the lower level of surface water production we experienced during the quarter.
Other operating expenses increased $1.6 million or 2% for the quarter, primarily due to $2.1 million in higher depreciation related to utility plant additions, and $200,000 in higher maintenance expenses, partially offset by $400,000 in lower general and administrative expenses.
In addition, in the first quarter of 2020 we incurred $400,000 in merger-related expenses.
No similar expenses were incurred in 2021.
The effective consolidated income tax rates were approximately negative 52% and 15% for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, was primarily due to excess tax benefits relating to share-based payment awards, state tax credits and other discrete tax items.
Turning to our capital expenditure program.
We added $46.7 million in company-funded utility plant during the first quarter of 2021.
This represents 20% of our total 2021 planned capital expenditures.
From a financing perspective, first quarter 2021 cash flows from operations increased 321% over the first quarter of 2020.
This change was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable collections of $2.2 million and a $1.5 million increase in net income adjusted for noncash items.
In addition, in 2020, we made an upfront payment of $5 million to the city of Cupertino in connection with our service concession agreement and refunded $8.4 million to California rate payers that were accumulated in our 2017 Tax Act Memorandum Account.
No similar payments were made in 2021.
In March 2021, SJW Group issued approximately $1.2 million -- I'm sorry, 1.2 million of new shares in an offering that raised net proceeds of approximately $66.9 million.
Proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding balances on the company's credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.
In addition, in April 2021, the company's California subsidiary entered into a $140 million credit agreement, and the company's Texas subsidiary entered into a $5 million credit agreement, both with JPMorgan Chase Bank.
The new credit agreement replaced the existing JPMorgan Chase credit agreements, which have been paid off and were set to mature and expire on June 1, 2021.
At the end of the first quarter, we had $138 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities.
The average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during the quarter was 1.42%.
SJW Group continues to execute on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities and earning a fair return on those investments.
As Jim just mentioned, we have already invested approximately 20% of our planned 2021 capital spending through the end of the first quarter.
We have high-quality water systems throughout our service areas and are investing to sustain them for the benefit of customers, communities and shareholders.
Other regulatory developments in the first quarter include the filing of general rate cases for both San Jose Water and Connecticut Water in January.
San Jose Water's GRC application proposes a $435 million capital program for the years 2021 through 2023, supported by our award-winning enterprise asset management system.
New rates are expected to be effective in the first quarter of 2022.
California employs a future test year, and thus, the level of capital spend is authorized during each general rate case cycle.
Connecticut, Texas and Maine, employ a historical test year, where capital investments not otherwise recoverable through surcharge mechanisms and expenses are recovered in subsequent general rate case filings after they have been incurred.
Connecticut Water's general rate case is the first since their last decision in 2010.
A primary driver of the case is the $266 million in infrastructure investments that have been completed and are providing a benefit to customers, but are not yet covered in rates.
The Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, is expected to issue a decision in the third quarter.
Connecticut Water rate case also includes tiered rates for residential customers that promote water conservation.
In Connecticut, PURA-regulated water utilities are able to collect their authorized revenues regardless of usage through the water revenue adjustment mechanism, which mitigates risk of such a rate design and support state policy goals for conservation.
A 1.1% increase in the Water Infrastructure and Conservation Adjustment surcharge, or WICA, was authorized by PURA earlier this year and went into effect on April 1.
This covers $8.7 million in qualified infrastructure investments that have been completed and will provide incremental annual revenue of about $1 million.
The current cumulative WICA surcharge will be rolled into base rates, and the surcharge will be reset to 0 as part of the general rate case.
Maine Water filed a general rate case application for its Biddeford Saco rate division, requesting a $6.7 million increase in annual revenues with the Maine Public Utilities Commission, or PUC, in March.
The application is driven by a $60 million replacement of the 1,884 vintage drinking water treatment plant.
Maine Water's application includes an innovative proposal that would spread the increase over three years in roughly equal amounts.
A decision on the rate smoothing mechanism to authorize a customer surcharge, starting in the third quarter of 2021 is expected in the second quarter and a decision on the requested revenue increase is expected in the second quarter of 2022, in alignment with the completion of the new water treatment facility.
These various state regulatory filings include capital investments that over the long term benefit customers, communities and shareholders as they enhance our ability to deliver safe, high-quality and reliable water service while increasing rate base, the earnings engine for the company.
We are mindful of the economic impact that COVID has had on some of our customers over the past year.
Connecticut Water is proposing a 15% discount on water bills for income-eligible customers that is similar to a program offered by San Jose Water since late 2005.
Meanwhile, San Jose Water anticipates proposing a debt forgiveness plan for its Water Rate Assistance Plan, or WRAP, or low-income -- for low-income customers.
The proposal includes tracking the forgiven amount in San Jose Water's WRAP balancing account for potential future recovery.
On April 9, SJWTX, our Texas Water and Wastewater Utility, executed the closing agreement to acquire the Clear Water Estates Water System.
This is the first acquisition completed by a regulated water utility under the state's new fair value -- fair market value regulation.
The acquisition added 230 new customers, gained additional water supplies to serve current and future customers and added rate base that reflects market value for future rate making purposes.
More importantly, the acquisition demonstrated that the fair market value process worked as envisioned.
This was the 13th acquisition completed by SJWTX, which has tripled its customer base since 2006.
The company serves two of the top four fastest-growing counties in the United States.
With a diverse portfolio of letter supplies and continued additions to customer base through organic growth and acquisitions.
We remain optimistic about the prospects for SJWTX and its increased contributions to consolidated earnings.
We are committed to investing in our culture, diversity and the environment.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion council has honestly and authentically guided our commitment to further build on our diverse and inclusive culture.
We have goals to expand our supplier diversity programs so we can extend our efforts into the broader community.
At the Board level, SJW Group is just one of 154 companies in the Russell 3000 to achieve a gender balanced board rating in 2020.
According to the 50/50 Women on Boards Gender Diversity Index.
We've set the foundation for creating a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory across all of our operations, understanding where we are now will allow us to set meaningful reduction goals for the future and develop prudent plans that will serve as a road map to achieve those goals.
Bob has served as a Director of the company since 2006 and as Lead Independent Director since 2015.
Bob's knowledge of the water industry is second to none and his contributions to our company and stockholders are too long to list.
Moreover, you won't find a person in business with more integrity, character and a genuine commitment to serve our company, customers, employees and communities than Bob.
On behalf of the Board and all of our employees, we wish him the very best.
","SJW Group reported a first-quarter net income of $2.6 million, a slight increase from the same period last year. Despite facing challenges due to reduced customer usage and water supply constraints in California, the company's revenue grew by 1% to $114.8 million. This growth was driven by rate increases, cost savings, and non-regulated income. However, the company anticipates increased operating costs in 2021 due to reliance on purchased water due to California's low rainfall and snowpack. Consequently, SJW Group adjusted its earnings guidance to $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share for the year, assuming no additional company-produced surface water in California. The company invested $46.7 million in capital expenditures and is committed to investing in water systems to provide safe and reliable water service. Additionally, SJW Group has executed a credit agreement and issued new shares to repay outstanding balances and support general corporate purposes. The company also saw successful developments in its Texas operations, acquiring the Clear Water Estates Water System. SJW Group remains optimistic about its future prospects and is committed to its diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental initiatives."
MSI_q1_2021.txt,"Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.
I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through results and our outlook.
First, Q1 was an excellent quarter.
We achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings and cash flow.
We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion, up 8% versus last year.
Additionally, demand remains strong, resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history.
Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion.
Sales for the quarter were up 15%, driven by growth across our LMR, video security and command center software technologies.
And the segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year.
And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year.
Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.8 billion, up 7%, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency.
GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million, up $64 million or 18%, and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.2% of sales, up from 21%, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter.
The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage and lower legal fees, partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
opex in Q1 was $455 million, up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend.
Turning to cash flow.
Our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year.
The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
Capital allocation for Q1 included $170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $175.53, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of capex.
During the quarter, we entered into a new five year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility.
And subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program.
Moving to our segment results.
Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio, partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million.
Operating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales, up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage.
Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1.
$72 million of video sales with government customers, up 32% from last year.
A $37 million P25 upgrade for a government agency in Canada.
A $33 million TETRA upgrade for a large customer in Europe.
And a $12 million P25 order with a large U.S. federal customer.
Moving to the Software and Services segment.
Q1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million.
Operating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage.
Some notable Q1 wins in the segment include, over $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee.
A $35 million push-to-talk over broadband multiyear contract with a large U.S. customer, a $22 million P25 and push-to-talk over broadband contract from a large middle eastern customer.
The $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple U.K. customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to date.
A $5 million contract with St. Lucie, Florida.
Additionally, we announced a new product integration between our V300 body-worn camera and our APX P25 radio platform.
Looking at our regional results.
North America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software.
International Q1 revenue of $588 million, was up 9%, with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America.
The growth was driven by video security and LMR. Moving to backlog.
Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year, driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally.
Sequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset with international growth in LMR products.
Software and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multiyear LMR services and command center software contracts in North America, and $58 million of international software growth.
The favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.
Sequentially, backlog was down $269 million, also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.
Products and SI backlog was $318 million compared -- up $318 million compared to last year.
Primarily driven by LMR growth in both regions.
Sequentially, backlog was up $139 million, driven by international LMR growth.
Turning to our outlook.
We expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 and $1.95 per share.
This assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%.
And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8%.
And we expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $8.70 and $8.80 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.50 to $8.62 per share.
This increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates.
A weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%.
And now I'd like to end with a few thoughts on the business.
First, our results for the quarter were outstanding.
We achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings and cash flow.
Expanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth.
Additionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the supply challenges that we have.
We also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program.
The second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong.
And we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus, up from the high teens we referenced on our last call.
In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue, our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market.
And in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions, and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by one vendor.
During the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Additionally, during the quarter, we announced two new offerings, the integration of our V300 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market-leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the U.S. with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite.
And finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand into command center software, video security and LMR services.
Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher growth areas, up from 20% five years ago, and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time.
And while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin and cash flow for the company.
[Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?
","The company had an exceptional Q1 with record sales, operating earnings, and cash flow. Sales increased by 7% to $1.8 billion, with all segments contributing to growth, particularly Software and Services, which grew by 15%. Non-GAAP operating margins also improved significantly, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Due to increased demand and a strong backlog of $11.3 billion, the company raised its full-year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. Additionally, video security experienced strong demand, leading the company to raise its full-year growth expectations to 20% plus. The company also continues to leverage its LMR installed base to expand into command center software and LMR services, which now account for almost half of its revenue."
RS_q4_2020.txt,"Despite the extraordinary challenges 2020 presented on a global scale, we are extremely pleased with the strong execution of our team -- that our team has shown, not only in the field, but by all of the employees within the family of companies, who demonstrated the true resiliency of the Reliance business model.
I applaud each and every one of you for your tremendous efforts to quickly and nimbly adapt to the changing environments, ensure our customers were always taken care of, and most importantly, maintain your unwavering commitment to health and safety, our most important core value.
Since 2017, our SMART Safety program has been focused on embedding our culture of safety across our entire family of companies.
Working together as one company, we focused on this initiative in 2020 like never before in response to the new and unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to developing new policies and procedures to prevent the spread of the virus, we improved our safety performance in 2020 with an approximately 23% reduction in our incident rate compared to 2019.
While this is a significant milestone, as I've stated in the past, we will not be satisfied until this rate reaches 0.
I'd like to take a moment to congratulate both Karla Lewis and Arthur Ajemyan for the recently announced well-deserved promotions.
Consistent with our Board's strategic executive leadership succession plan, Karla was promoted from CFO to President and was simultaneously appointed to our Board of Directors effective January 15.
Karla has demonstrated excellent judgment and leadership in each role she has held since joining Reliance in 1992, and her unique abilities and talents have earned the respect of our employees and shareholders.
Karla's promotion recognizes her significant contributions to Reliance.
It will allow her to broaden her knowledge of Reliance's field operations and increase the diversity of her experience.
In addition, Arthur Ajemyan was promoted to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 15.
Arthur has held various positions in Reliance's finance and accounting department for over 15 years and has done a phenomenal job.
I congratulate both Karla and Arthur on their promotions and look forward to continuing to work closely with them in their new roles.
Now let's turn to our 2020 results.
We delivered a solid financial performance in 2020, driven by consistently strong operational execution despite considerable turbulence in the market.
Our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our people and unique business model as well as our ability to execute through both good times and bad given the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies.
Our decentralized structure allowed us to respond rapidly to fluid market conditions and demand trends.
These factors, combined with pricing discipline and continuous improvements to our value-added processing capabilities, enabled us to achieve our second consecutive year of record annual gross profit margins at 31.5%, up 120 basis points from 2019 and exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%.
We also maintained healthy profitability levels despite the extraordinarily volatile and challenging market conditions.
For the full year, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.71 as a result of the combination of strong margin discipline and effective expense control, which helped mitigate our decline in profitability.
On the heels of a record year in 2019, we maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion in 2020 driven by our profitability and focus on working capital management.
Fueled by our ongoing focus on rightsizing our inventory to reflect current demand levels and our differentiating advantage of cross-selling inventory among our family of companies, we achieved our companywide inventory turn goal of 4.7 times based on tons for 2020.
In line with historical trends and the cornerstone of our business model, a significant portion of our metal we purchase is from domestic suppliers.
And it is paramount that we continue to support our mill partners who, in turn, have consistently been there for Reliance during challenging times.
Our countercyclical cash flow generation allows us to remain flexible and opportunistic in executing our growth initiatives while concurrently returning value to our stockholders.
We invested $172 million in our business through capital expenditures in 2020, including many growth opportunities such as our recent toll processing expansion in Texas and Kentucky.
Today, we are introducing our 2021 capital expenditure budget of $245 million that includes new buildings and other projects to expand, upgrade and maintain many of our operating facilities.
We are installing energy-efficient lighting and solar panels in certain of our facilities.
Our 2021 budget also includes innovative new processing equipment to provide our customers with the highest-quality products and services.
Although COVID-19 has slowed the pace of acquisitions activity in general, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential candidates as we've begun to broaden our view on the universe of prospective growth opportunities.
As always, we evaluate opportunities based on a strict set of criteria to ensure a strong fit within the family of companies.
Now turning to stockholder returns.
In 2020, we repurchased $337.3 million worth of our common stock at an average cost of $91.80 per share and paid $164.1 million in dividends to our shareholders.
We've maintained our payment of regularly quarterly dividends for 61 consecutive years without ever suspending payment or reducing our dividend rate.
In addition, we've increased our dividend 28 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 10% for the first quarter of 2021.
Looking forward into the remainder of 2021.
Reliance will continue to execute and improve upon our tried-and-true model that has led us to industry-leading results for many decades.
Over the past year, we've adapted to operate more efficiently than ever before without sacrificing our competitive edge and the critical elements of our business that make Reliance a trusted and reliable business partner.
We will maintain our focus on opportunities to enhance our products, end markets and geographical diversification, along with our ongoing commitment to strong pricing discipline, diligent expense control, when-needed inventory management, organic growth and innovation.
As was evident throughout the past year, our customers rely on Reliance to continue to support them through trying times, often in greater capacity and on a more frequent basis.
As I continue to say, and I will say again, America is going to need Reliance to rebuild.
As an essential business, we were able to continue operating throughout the pandemic, with our 2020 tons sold decreasing only 10.8% compared to 2019.
Our average selling price was down 9.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declining mill prices for most of the products we sell during the first nine months of the year.
Despite these negative trends, we achieved record gross profit margin in 2020.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, healthy demand conditions in the majority of our end markets resulted in our tons sold declining only 1.3% compared to the prior quarter.
This was the lowest Q4 seasonal decline we've experienced in the last 10 years and exceeded our guidance by a significant margin.
Despite customer holiday-related closures and less shipping days typical of the fourth quarter, we experienced solid demand trends throughout the fourth quarter as the economy continued to regain momentum.
Supported by solid demand and rising input costs, metal pricing improved as mill price increases for many of the products we sell accelerated throughout the fourth quarter with prices for certain carbon steel products almost doubling, which led to our average selling price increasing 4.6% compared to the third quarter of 2020, again, exceeding our expectations.
The favorable demand and pricing conditions in the fourth quarter contributed to our record gross profit margin of 33%, a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2020.
And on a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe is the best measure of our day-to-day operating performance, our gross profit margin of 33.6% increased 180 basis points from 31.8% in the third quarter of 2020.
Our record gross profit margin reflects the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who effectively implemented price increases at the time of mill announcement prior to receiving the higher-cost metal into inventory, pushing our gross profit margin above already strong levels, resulting from our focus on higher-margin orders.
While we are very pleased with our record Q4 and full year gross profit margin, we continue to believe our estimated sustainable gross profit margin range of 28% to 30% is appropriate as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and operate through this uncertain environment.
That said, maintaining our strong gross profit margin remains a cornerstone of our business model.
We believe our managers will continue to successfully leverage the significant investments we have made to expand and improve our value-added processing capabilities.
In fact, one of the key factors contributing to our record gross profit margin for the full year was our value-added processing capabilities, which have increased in recent years as a result of our significant investments in state-of-the-art equipment.
While the percentage of orders with value-added processing declined to approximately 49% from 51% in 2019 due to changes in product mix caused by the pandemic, process orders continue to serve as a stabilizer to our margins in challenging markets with declining demand and pricing trends.
I'll now turn to a high-level overview of the conditions in our key end markets.
Demand in nonresidential construction, the largest market we serve, remained relatively steady during the fourth quarter due to ongoing healthy bidding activity for new projects and the restart of projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year.
We've been seeing quoting activity in the areas you might expect such as infrastructure projects, schools, utilities, water and power, strip malls and data and distribution centers.
Demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market was strong, with activity back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter as automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills continued to ramp production as a result of reopenings following COVID-19 shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020.
We commenced operations at our new facility in Kentucky in late November and also recently broke ground on a new greenfield tolling facility in Texas, with both focused on carbon steel tolling to support increased capacity of our toll processing customers, who are primarily metal producers and their end users.
Demand in heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment rebounded to solid levels in the fourth quarter as production schedules continued to ramp following customer reopenings from COVID-19-related shutdowns and to meet equipment dealer restocking needs.
Semiconductor demand steadily improved from the third quarter of 2020, and the market continues to be one of our strongest.
Demand in commercial aerospace further declined in the fourth quarter as a direct result of reduced air travel due to COVID-19, which has reduced airplane build rates.
We believe the fourth quarter represented the trough.
That said, demand in the military, defense and space portions of our aerospace business remained stable at solid levels throughout the fourth quarter.
Finally, demand in the energy sector, which is mainly oil and natural gas, remained under pressure in the fourth quarter of 2020.
And throughout 2020, we took prudent cost-reduction measures, including the closure of certain facilities, which helped strengthen our overall efficiency and position us to support a recovery in this market.
We are optimistic on both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2021 as we have experienced strength in both so far in the first quarter.
And Arthur will now review our financial results.
I'll start with our sales discussion.
Fourth quarter 2020 sales were down 12.8% from the prior year period as our markets continued to recover following the reopening of the economy.
Approximately half of the decline in our sales can be attributed to our businesses supporting the commercial aerospace and energy end markets, as evidenced by the disproportionately higher declines in our sales of aluminum and alloy products.
For the full year of 2020, sales were down 19.7% from 2019.
Approximately half of the decline in sales was due to lower shipping volumes across all major end markets we sell to, and the remaining half was due to lower average selling prices.
However, both recovering demand and pricing from the reopening of the economy in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 helped to mitigate the annual decline in our sales.
As Jim and Karla highlighted, we generated a record quarterly gross profit margin of 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 60 basis points from both Q3 2020 and Q4 2019 and a record gross profit margin of 31.5% for the full year of 2020, up 120 basis points from our previous annual record of 30.3% in 2019.
Our non-GAAP FIFO gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 450 basis points from Q4 2019, and for the full year of 2020 was up to 280 basis points from 2019.
We incurred LIFO expense of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to rapidly increasing mill costs for most of our products.
However, for the full year of 2020, we still recognized LIFO income of $22 million as our cost of inventory on hand at the end of the year was still below the levels at the beginning of the year.
This compares to LIFO income in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 of $81 million and $156 million, respectively.
We ended 2020 with a LIFO reserve of $115.6 million on our balance sheet.
Based on current market conditions, we expect to incur an annual LIFO expense of $340 million in 2021.
Consistent with our accounting policy, we allocate our annual estimate on a pro rata basis in each quarter.
As such, our current projected Q1 2021 LIFO expense is $85 million.
As in prior years, we will update our expectations each quarter based upon our inventory cost and metal pricing trends.
Our fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased $51 million or 9.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on a 7.9% reduction in shipments.
For the full year, same-store SG&A expenses declined $241 million or 11.5% on a 10.8% reduction in shipments.
The decline in SG&A expenses was due to reduced spend across every major expense category.
As you've heard us say before, approximately 60% to 65% of our SG&A expenses are people related.
When looking at the 11.5% year-over-year decline in same-store SG&A expenses, approximately half of the decrease was people-related as our headcount declined 14% compared to the prior year.
In addition, lower incentive pay due to lower gross profit and pre-tax income levels also contributed to the decline in our compensation costs.
Although we are entering the first quarter of 2021 with a more efficient expense structure because of strong volume and pricing trends, we expect our expenses will increase in the first quarter of 2021 from the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with seasonal trends.
I will address our Q1 2021 outlook for demand and pricing shortly.
For the full year of 2020, our effective income tax rate declined to 22.1% from 24% in 2019 mainly due to our lower pre-tax income level in 2020.
We currently anticipate our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be 24%.
Our strong gross profit margin and effective expense management resulted in $2.01 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020, well above our outlook of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share but down 17.6% from $2.44 in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to reduced demand levels related to the pandemic, with commercial aerospace and energy end market sales being significant contributors to the decline in our sales.
In comparison to the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 was up 7.5% from $1.87 due to improved pricing, strong gross profit margin and recovering demand in most end markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $230.2 million during the fourth quarter due to our profitable operations and effective working capital management, including our focus on rightsizing our inventory levels.
At the end of the year, our total debt outstanding was $1.66 billion, resulting in net debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 1.1 times.
Also at the end of the year, no borrowings were outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
As mentioned last quarter, we significantly strengthened our liquidity position through the successful completion of both our $900 million senior notes offering and amended/restated $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility.
The facility amendment, combined with the proceeds from the notes offering, provides us with ample liquidity and an improved debt maturity profile.
I'll now turn to our outlook.
While macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, favorable market conditions have persisted so far into the first quarter of 2021, with improving demand and additional mill price increases on many carbon and stainless steel products.
This environment allows us to maintain higher gross profit margin levels as we increase our selling price prior to receiving the higher-cost metal in our inventory.
We expect these favorable conditions to continue for the remainder of the first quarter.
As a result of these favorable conditions and the normal seasonal improvement, we estimate our tons sold will be up 10% to 12% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2021 will be up 12% to 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for the first quarter of 2021.
In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter 2020 financial and operational results.
Outstanding execution by all of our employees greatly contributed to our success in 2020.
Their efforts, coupled with our resilient business model and disciplined execution of our strategy, resulted in yet another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow, enabling us to continue supporting our growth and stockholder return priorities.
","Reliance Steel & Aluminum achieved solid financial performance in 2020 amidst market volatility, driven by strong operational execution and margin discipline. Their 2020 gross profit margin reached a record 31.5%, exceeding their sustainable range of 28-30%. They also generated healthy profitability, with full-year non-GAAP earnings per share reaching $7.71. Furthermore, they maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion, supported by efficient working capital management. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Reliance experienced improved demand across most end markets, resulting in a 1.3% decline in tons sold compared to Q3, the lowest seasonal decline in the past decade. The company saw a 4.6% increase in average selling price due to rising input costs and mill price increases. This contributed to a record gross profit margin of 33% in Q4, supported by effective price management. Looking ahead, Reliance anticipates continued favorable market conditions in Q1 2021, with an expected 10-12% increase in tons sold and a 12-14% increase in average selling price. The company forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for Q1, reflecting their optimism about the upcoming quarter."
TXT_q4_2020.txt,"Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year.
During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax.
We also recognized a one-time favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share.
Excluding special charges and the one-time favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago.
Adjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million, as compared to $642 million last year.
Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial, and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points, as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume.
We delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November.
This continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours.
Looking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours.
Army leadership and Congress have been very supportive of Future Vertical Lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration.
In December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment.
The Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.
At Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume at the TRU Simulation + Training business.
In November, Systems announced sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE.
This transaction closed in January.
In the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight, fighter jet training services program.
This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next five years.
Also in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft.
The Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally.
Revenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles.
Kautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior-year levels.
Moving to Textron Aviation.
Revenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume.
We delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with eight units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260.
Cessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with three aircraft flying in the certification program.
The flight test -- test program has completed over 400 flight hours and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021.
In summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations and I'm proud of the way our teams responded.
Through our focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year.
At our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results.
On the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth-quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021.
With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance.
At Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased fleet utilization.
At Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems.
At Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues while continuing to invest in Future Vertical Lift.
At Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels.
At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops.
We are projecting adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million.
Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume.
Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume.
Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation and training.
Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles.
Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million.
We recorded pre -- pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 120 -- 129 million of shares.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops, as well as, higher aftermarket revenues.
Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries.
We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 rev -- revenues of about $1.4 billion.
Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles.
Segment margin is expected to be about 6%.
At finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.
Turning to Slide 10.
We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year.
Our 2021 pension, reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period.
Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75-basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.
Turning to Slide 11.
R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020.
We're estimating capex will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense, and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.
Our full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash toward share repurchases in 2021.
","Textron reported mixed fourth-quarter results, with revenues declining $368 million to $3.7 billion. Excluding one-time charges and benefits, adjusted earnings per share remained stable at $1.06. The company experienced margin improvements in Systems, Industrial, and Bell, leading to an overall manufacturing margin of 8.8% despite lower revenues. Bell's commercial helicopter deliveries declined, but the military V-22 program continued to grow. Textron Aviation delivered fewer jets and reported lower aftermarket volume, but new product launches are anticipated. For 2021, Textron projects revenue growth in all segments and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.70 to $2.90."
WST_q2_2020.txt,"On Slide 2 is our safe harbor statement.
These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts.
During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS.
I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much-needed components and solutions to our customers under tough circumstances.
Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued resolve of our talented team members, the strength of our company and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times.
We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today.
Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
Moving to Slide 4.
The pandemic remains our priority.
Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in vaccine development.
As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic.
The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines, is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered.
We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components.
We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates.
As we stated during our first-quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of our fluoropolymer coated stoppers made by both West and our partner, Daikyo.
These are the industry standard for packaging-sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety.
As our customers' vaccine development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain we can supply the demand for our high-value products, as well as any immediate surge in request for therapeutics.
The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and when vaccines are approved for human use.
All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to drive commercial and operational excellence along with globalizing West manufacturing operations has put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand.
We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components.
These investments were in our five-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021.
From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging.
However, whether it's hundreds of millions or billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes.
Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter.
Our financial position remains strong.
I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued in the second quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive.
We had 14% organic sales growth in the second quarter driven, again, by robust high-value product sales.
And with HVP sales growth, we have experienced strong gross and operating profit margin expansion.
This resulted in a strong adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter.
To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics.
As for guidance, we believe we are well-positioned for the second half of the year.
That said, because of the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.
I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time.
So let's review the numbers in more detail.
We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and earnings per share growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing.
I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter, as well as some balance sheet takeaways.
And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.
GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17.
We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic sales growth of 14.3%.
COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million in the quarter.
These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers, affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures.
We continue to see improvement in gross profit.
We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, $37.2 million or 23.6% above Q2 of last year.
And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340-basis-point expansion from the same period last year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded this quarter, compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270-basis-point increase from the same period last year.
Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40% for Q2.
Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, earnings per share grew by approximately 38%.
Moving to Slide 7.
Our proprietary product sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter.
High-value products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2.
Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth.
We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings.
The generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film-coated products sales.
Our Pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components.
And contract manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led, once again, by sales of diagnostic and healthcare-related injection devices.
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit?
On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter.
Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth, including approximately $19 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand.
Sales price increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of 2 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance.
Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020, up from 33.6% in Q2 2019.
Proprietary products' second-quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% was 330 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019.
The key drivers for the continued improvement in proprietary products' gross profit margin were: favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs.
Contract manufacturing second-quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019.
Improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization.
There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin, primarily due to a onetime engineering project work.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% with a 270-basis-point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion.
One point to note, we took a onetime charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment.
This is included in other operating expenses.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business.
On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $205.2 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $52.5 million, compared to the same period last year, a 34% increase.
Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, $12.1 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020, was $18.3 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory, mainly as a result of increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity.
Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter.
Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was $6.8 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results.
Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remained strong.
Slide 11 provides a high-level summary.
Full-year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion.
This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of $60 million.
There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%.
This compares to prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%.
We do expect growth in contract manufacturing to be less in H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps.
We expect our full-year 2020 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25, compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62.
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand.
Capex guidance has raised to $170 million to $180 million.
This compares to previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance.
Estimated FX headwind on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates.
The revised guidance also includes $0.16 earnings per share impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top-line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow.
Our long-term construct remains at approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued earnings per share expansion.
We have a rich history of leading in times of great challenge.
Our customers expect this of us, and this is what we're committed and prepared to do.
I want to emphasize that across West, we are leveraging our global manufacturing capabilities, size and scale to innovate, lead and operate with a sense of urgency to make a positive impact in healthcare and society.
Our performance continue to reaffirm that our market-led strategy is delivering unique value propositions to our customers.
Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products with market-leading service and quality.
And we're continuing to invest in our business with digital technology and automation across our operations to feel an even brighter future.
We remain committed to deliver value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis, as well as to maintain and build upon the values that make up our One West team.
On behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you good health in the days ahead.
Josh, we're ready to take questions.
","In Q2, West Pharmaceutical Services reported strong performance, with 14% organic sales growth driven by robust high-value product sales, leading to a 40% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. The company's focus on vaccine development during the pandemic resulted in significant demand for its high-quality components. Despite COVID-19 impacts on certain customer segments, the company's financial position remained strong. For the full year, West raised its guidance to a sales range of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion, with 12.5% organic sales growth estimated. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance was also raised to $4.15 to $4.25, incorporating an estimated COVID-19 impact of $60 million in net revenues. The company is accelerating capacity expansion for high-value products to meet anticipated vaccine demand in 2021 and has increased its capex guidance to $170 million to $180 million."
COO_q1_2022.txt,"Before I turn to our business, let me say the escalation of the devastating crisis in Ukraine is top of mind.
The event caused great concern for everyone in that region, including our employees, partners and their families.
Our thoughts are with everyone who is being affected, and we certainly hope peace prevails soon.
Moving to our business.
I'm pleased to report a strong start to the fiscal year, led by a fantastic quarter at CooperVision and another solid quarter at CooperSurgical.
Within vision, our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios continued posting strong results, leading to share gains around the world.
Within surgical, our fertility business posted great numbers and the integration of Generate Life Sciences is going really well with that business off to a fast start as part of Cooper.
We also recently announced the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business, which will be a great addition to our surgical franchise.
Regarding first quarter financial results, consolidated revenues were $787 million, with CooperVision at $561 million, up 11%, and CooperSurgical reaching a new all-time high of $226 million, up 30%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.24.
Moving to the details and reporting all percentages on an organic basis.
Our CooperVision growth of 14% was strong and diversified.
We grew nicely in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals, and all three regions posted great results, with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 17% and Asia Pac up 19%.
This resulted in nice share gains, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the reopening of economies around the world as COVID subsides.
All of this is driven by our multifaceted commercial strategy that we began deploying years ago, which has proven to be extremely successful.
This includes a consistent cadence of launching new products and product extensions around the world, providing customers with market-leading flexibility through our customized solutions, executing on key account relationships and delivering fantastic customer service.
We're continuing these efforts while also enhancing our business through sales force expansions and targeted marketing and infrastructure investments.
Regarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay, and clariti, posted strong results, growing 25%.
Daily silicones continue to lead the market, and we offer the broadest portfolio of products to meet customers' needs.
This includes MyDay, our premium offering, which is available in a sphere, toric and, most recently, a multifocal.
And speaking of the multifocal, the launch is going incredibly well.
The feedback from eye care practitioners regarding use of our breakthrough binocular progressive fitting system that simplifies the fit process while providing optimal visual acuity at all levels has been fantastic.
And we're continuing to receive feedback from patients that MyDay provides the best multifocal they've ever worn for exceptional near, intermediate and distant vision.
This success is having a nice halo effect on our already successful MyDay torics and spheres, so we remain very optimistic about this brand.
The other brand in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio is clariti.
This lens is also available as a sphere, toric and multifocal and is sold as more of a mass market product.
We've seen nice growth with this brand, especially in our Asia Pac region, where we just posted an extremely strong quarter.
For our FRPs, we reported another solid quarter of 10% growth for Avaira and Biofinity, our silicone hydrogel two-week and monthly lenses.
This was led by improved product availability and our unique offerings such as Biofinity toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space.
To finish on products, we're continuing to see nice strength in torics and multifocals as we expand parameter ranges and increase availability around the world.
When you combine this with the success we're having in key accounts, it's resulting in nice share gains, and we expect that to continue.
Moving to myopia management.
We posted revenues of $20 million.
And within this, MiSight grew 172%.
This growth rate was an acceleration from Q4, which is impressive, given the general market challenges around new fits.
Overall, as a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product, a broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses, and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses.
For MiSight, we're continuing to make progress around the world, including in China, where we're preparing for a broader launch with our partner, Essilor.
Our team in China is strong, and our advisory board of key opinion leaders that are affiliated with hospitals representing over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China has us positioned for success in a market where childhood myopia rates are estimated to be over 80%, and we're reducing myopia as a priority for the government.
Lastly, on MiSight, our industry-leading seven-year clinical data has been getting a lot of exposure as it highlights that MiSight works for nearly all myopic children.
It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average.
It works at any age a child starts treatment.
It works for as long as the child wears it.
And there's no rebound if treatment is stopped.
Moving to SightGlass myopia management glasses.
Following our co-launch in the Netherlands with Essilor in November, we started early launches in additional markets, including the U.K. and Canada.
Within Canada, we've launched the product under the MiSight name, which is an exciting step in combining our myopia management glasses and contact lenses under one brand name.
We've also accelerated activity in China and plan to launch the product later this fiscal year.
To conclude on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting roughly $100 million in sales for this fiscal year.
To wrap up on CooperVision, for calendar Q4, we estimate the global contact lens market grew 10%, with CooperVision growing 16%.
Within this, COVID-related challenges did negatively impact optometry offices around the world and combining this with heightened patient demand as myopia rates continue to rise is resulting in many eye care offices having full calendars of appointments.
This demand is great, but it's still impacting fit activities such as in the U.S. where new fits are still roughly 8% below pre-COVID levels.
Having said that, progress is being made, and we expect to continue seeing positive trends as COVID subsides and economies around the world reopen with people returning to the office and becoming more active in social settings.
Meanwhile, long-term macro growth trends remain intact with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
For CooperVision, we have a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business and our fit data remains strong.
So we remain very bullish on our business.
We're extremely busy integrating Generate, which we just closed in mid-December.
In the meantime, we had another strong quarter with organic growth of 9%.
Before getting into the details, let's cover Generate.
We recognized roughly $34 million of revenues in the quarter as this was a stub period with only roughly one and a half months of revenue.
Of this, $23 million was in stem cell storage and $11 million in fertility.
It's tough to get exact growth rates for a stub period, but growth for the business for the full equivalent fiscal quarter was 10%.
Moving to our fertility business.
We posted sales of $97 million, up a very healthy 27% when excluding Generate and the small acquisition of Embryo Options from last January.
Strength was seen on a global basis and throughout our product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genomics.
Within our office and surgical unit, we posted sales of $129 million, up 24% as reported, but down 3% when excluding Generate and other acquisitions.
This was due to the negative impact of COVID on sales of PARAGARD, as well as certain surgical products.
Having said that, we did see growth in many areas such as our laparoscopic surgery closure products, and our acquired businesses grew nicely, especially Fetal Pillow in our labor and delivery area, which grew 160%.
Based on current trends, we expect office and surgical sales to improve and show organic growth in Q2.
To wrap up on CooperSurgical, let me touch on some market information.
For fertility, we're largely back to pre-COVID levels.
are stronger, while others outside the U.S. are still dealing with COVID-related challenges.
But net-net, the market is in a good place.
This industry continues to grow nicely, and we estimate our addressable market is approaching $2 billion with 5% to 10% long-term annual growth.
It's estimated that one in eight couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors such as increasing maternal age and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility.
Given the improving access to treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and increasing global disposable income, we expect this industry to grow nicely for many years to come.
Within office and surgical, as mentioned earlier, we expect growth to return in Q2 as the market fundamentals are improving.
To summarize, this was a really strong start to our fiscal year.
CooperVision posted a great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue delivering success with the best team in the industry and the broadest product portfolio in the market.
Our fertility business is growing nicely and taking share, and the Generate business is integrating really well with some exciting potential as we incorporate stem cell storage into our labor and delivery product portfolio.
Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis.
First quarter consolidated revenues were $787 million, up 16% and up 13% organically.
Consolidated gross margin decreased year over year by 90 basis points to 66.9%, driven primarily by currency, but also lower sales of PARAGARD, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.
Operating expenses grew 19% to 42.3% of revenues with the addition of Generate and higher investment activity.
Consolidated operating margins were 24.6%, down from 26.9% last year due to the negative impact of FX and higher investing.
In addition, we did see higher freight, secondary handling and distribution costs within cost of goods and opex and expect this to continue, although price increases are helping to offset the impact.
Interest expense was $6.6 million on higher average debt, partially offset by lower interest rates.
The effective tax rate was 13.3%, higher primarily due to the Generate acquisition.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.24 with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding.
FX negatively impacted us by $0.37 in the quarter, which was $0.02 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call.
Free cash flow was solid at $109 million, comprised of $166 million of operating cash flow, offset by $57 million of capex.
Net debt decreased by $1.6 billion to $3 billion, driven by the acquisition of Generate.
And our adjusted leverage ratio increased to 2.71 times.
During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 191,200 shares of the company's common stock for $78.5 million at an average purchase price of $410.41 per share, that's $410.41.
Roughly $256 million remains authorized for repurchase under our program.
We've updated our numbers to reflect our outperformance in Q1, the addition of Generate, new currency rates and the assumption of a 25-basis-point rate increase by the Fed next week.
Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this would have meant the midpoint for earnings per share would have been roughly $14.35, but currency has moved significantly against us over the past week.
We're increasing prices to offset the negative impact, and hopefully, the currency moves are temporary, but we're taking a conservative approach and fully incorporating negative currency into our guidance, noting that the scope, degree and duration of the crisis on the global economy is an evolving risk.
With this, the new consolidated revenue range is $3.261 billion to $3.329 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% organically.
Within this, CooperVision revenue guidance is $2.221 billion to $2.264 billion, up 7% to 9% organically.
CooperSurgical revenues are expected to be between $1.04 billion and $1.065 billion, up 35% to 38% as reported or 5% to 7% organically.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $13.70 to $14.20.
We estimate interest expense around $42 million, which assumes a 25-basis-point rate increase, remembering that $1 billion of our debt is fixed -- is at fixed rates.
We estimate the full year tax rate to be around 14%.
Regarding currency, on a year-over-year basis, the negative FX headwind is now roughly 3.5% to revenues and roughly 10% negative impact to EPS.
Note this guidance does not include our pending Cook Medical reproductive health acquisition as the transaction has not yet closed.
Regarding Cook, we announced this acquisition on February 7 for $875 million.
This is a really nice strategic fit as they manufacture and sell minimally invasive medical devices focused on their fertility and gynecology markets.
With this acquisition, we'll be improving our international fertility footprint, especially within the Asia Pac region and will be adding highly synergistic and respected labor and delivery medical devices.
From a financial perspective, this business had roughly $158 million in sales in calendar 2021, and we expect long-term growth in the range of 5% to 9%.
Additionally, we expect year one non-GAAP earnings per share accretion of roughly $0.60.
In summary, we're pleased with this quarter's performance and believe our momentum will continue, driven by strategic investments in both businesses that will support share gains and durable long-term revenue and earnings growth.
","CooperVision posted strong Q1 results, driven by daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios. MiSight myopia control revenue soared 172%, and the launch of MyDay multifocal has been well-received. CooperSurgical saw 30% growth in revenue, with fertility and Generate Life Sciences contributing significantly. The integration of Generate is proceeding smoothly, with revenue recognition of $34 million. Overall, consolidated revenues reached $787 million, a 16% increase, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.24. Despite the impact of currency headwinds and increased expenses, the company expects fiscal 2022 non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $13.70 to $14.20. Cooper is also set to acquire Cook Medical's reproductive health business, expected to contribute to future growth. With a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, and momentum in myopia management, Cooper remains optimistic about its prospects."
CTS_q3_2020.txt,"I'll begin by sharing a few thoughts on our business performance and our operations.
As mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected sales to improve in the third quarter.
Sales were $113.8 million in the quarter, down 2% in the third quarter of 2019 and up 35% sequentially.
Third quarter gross margin was 32.4% compared to 32% in the same period in 2019, up 40 basis points and up 80 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of this year.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.34, up 17% from $0.29 in the third quarter of last year and up from $0.18 in the second quarter of 2020.
We delivered an EBITDA -- an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%, up 230 basis points from 16.7% in the second quarter of 2020.
New business wins were $127 million in the third quarter, and we added seven new customers.
We ended the quarter with $132 million in cash and $106 million in debt.
Operationally, all our plants are running.
We continue to experience challenges at our Mexico locations.
Since last quarter, those facilities have improved from approximately 60% capacity to more in the range of 90%.
We are monitoring local changes to COVID-19 restrictions at one of those facilities and at our Ostrava facility in Czech Republic.
Ashish Agrawal is with me for today's call and will take us through the safe harbor statement.
To the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investors section of the CTS website.
I will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO, Kieran O'Sullivan.
As we navigate to COVID-19, our employees are supporting and helping the less fortunate in our local communities, something we're very proud of.
Our employees also continue to demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness throughout our operations to support all customers.
Our first focus continues to be the safety of our employees and compliance with state and local regulations.
We are adapting our business and processes to focus on our priorities, driving profitable growth, strengthening our go-to-market, enhancing our operational capabilities and advancing our leadership talent and culture.
The restructuring plan we announced on the last earnings call is progressing to plan and is expected to deliver an annualized earnings per share improvement of $0.22 to $0.26 by the second half of 2022.
More importantly, we are focused on returning to growth, targeting 10%, in line with our strategic plan, 5% organic and 5% through strategic acquisitions.
We remain focused on our strategic growth investments as part of our planning for 2025.
Growing our business and expanding our range of products that sense, connect and move is the priority.
New business awards were $127 million for the quarter, the best quarterly performance this year.
We added seven new customers in the quarter, four in industrial and one each in defense, medical and telecom.
In transportation, we were awarded a large passive safety sensor award for an electric vehicle application in the China market.
We also secured multiple OEM accelerated awards with customers in Asia, Europe and a global platform win with a North American OEM.
These recent wins are leveraging our inductive technology, which is a key enabler for growth to meet mid- and high-end product requirements.
We secured an additional ride height sensing award with the same customer.
Cumulative, EV and hybrid wins this year are approximately $75 million, and we expect further gains.
Last quarter, we reported our first win with current sensing.
We aim to expand this application in other regions.
In defense, we were awarded contracts with several Tier one customers for sonar applications.
More recently, we developed and secured a new sample order for an ordinance application.
In Europe, we seek to gain share by building relationships with new customers.
We are leveraging our footprint and capabilities in Denmark and the Czech Republic, where we recently received sample orders with two new defense Tier one customers.
With temperature sensing, we secured a small initial order for an application in electric vehicles.
The sensor is part of the charging circuit for the battery management system.
In the precision frequency product line, we were selected for a design win in a 5G small cell application for systems in multiple countries, and also secured the distribution order.
We secured a multiyear design award for a low-power crystal product in a defense application.
We continue to advance product innovations.
Our focus in the transportation market, as we have stated previously, is to develop sensor solutions that are agnostic to the underlying propulsion technology, strengthening our growth in the next decade as hybrid and electric vehicle penetration grows.
EVs are expected to be less expensive than internal combustion engines in the 2025 time frame as battery costs decline.
15 countries and two U.S. states have announced phase outs of internal combustion engines in the 2030 to 2040 time period, with Norway aiming for 2025.
We expect EV penetration to reach 9% by 2025 and 22% by 2030.
Our innovations are in the areas of electronic braking, new accelerator interfaces and high-performance temperature applications.
We continue to research new material formulations as we target growth in defense, industrial and medical markets.
In defense, our primary focus is on the solar market for forward and towed arrays.
In industrial, we target in-jet printing, flow and position as well as nondestructive testing.
In medical, the primary focus is medical ultrasound, intravascular medical ultrasound, ultrasonic therapy and scalpel applications.
We continue to advance our traditional position sensing for industrial applications and new encoder product for medical equipment.
The developments for ultra-low life high frequency TCXOs and OCXOs for millimeter wave and sub-6 gigahertz systems are progressing as we continue to gain design awards through a major telecom OEM.
While the M&A environment has become a little more challenging due to COVID and associated travel restrictions, we are adapting and continue to strengthen our pipeline of opportunities.
We seek to expand our range of technologies, products, customers and geographic reach.
We continue to make progress on our foundry operations and expect to have completed the improvements this year.
The team is making steady progress on process controls into subsequent efficiencies.
The Focus 2025 initiative has an important emphasis on building stronger customer relationships.
As part of this initiative, we are improving our go-to-market capabilities, skills and sales incentive plans to place a stronger focus on profitable growth.
We are working to improve the quality of the sales funnel, optimize our end market approach, target new accounts and align our functional areas to be more responsive and solution-oriented in line with our core values.
As part of our realignment on profitable growth, we are evaluating the product portfolio for longer-term growth and margin expansion.
We have moved from a period of sharp decline in the second quarter to a time of uncertainty as the inventory levels are rebalanced and the market responds to high unemployment and other economic challenges.
In the U.S., the seasonally adjusted growth rate for 2020 is closer to 13 million units, down 21% for last year.
We expect next year to be in the 14 million unit range.
On-hand days of supply are now at 55 days, down from 65 days of supply in the third quarter of 2019.
European sales are forecasted to decline 24% from last year, and we expect 18.7 million unit levels in 2021.
The China market continues to be more robust, with volumes predicted to be down 9%, in the 21 million to 22 million range for this year and up to 24 million units next year.
There are signs, the commercial vehicle market may be on an improving trend as freight fundamentals continue to improve.
It's a little early to say how sustainable this improvement will be.
We continue to see stronger growth in industrial and defense markets.
We remain cautious on market conditions in the next several quarters.
We expect to resume annual guidance for fiscal year 2021 in February.
Our liquidity remains solid.
We view this challenging time period as an opportunity to strengthen our capabilities.
Now Ashish will walk us through our financial performance in more detail.
Third quarter sales were $113.8 million, down 2% compared to last year.
Sequentially, sales rebounded strongly, up 35% from the second quarter.
Sales to transportation customers decreased by 9% year-over-year.
However, sequentially, we grew by 71%.
Sales to other end markets increased by 10% versus Q3 of 2019 and 5%, sequentially.
Our temperature sensing acquisition had solid growth and added $6.6 million.
Organic sales to non-transportation customers were up 4% versus last year.
We experienced double-digit growth in sales to both the defense and industrial end markets.
As expected, the medical end market was soft.
Our gross margin was 32.4% for the third quarter, up 80 basis points compared to last quarter and up 40 basis points compared to last year.
Conditions remain uncertain due to the impact of COVID.
And we are maintaining a focus on cost efficiency and capability to ramp production up or down.
As a result of improved revenue and careful cost management, adjusted operating earnings were 13%, up 170 basis points from last year and up 450 basis points sequentially.
As Kieran mentioned, we are making progress on the restructuring plan we initiated a few months ago.
We will update you on the improvements as we complete various parts of the plan in the coming quarters.
Our year-to-date tax rate was approximately 24%, and we expect the full year rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, excluding discrete items.
Third quarter 2020 earnings were $0.34 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were also $0.34 compared to $0.16 last quarter and $0.29 in the third quarter of 2019.
Focusing on the balance sheet.
Our working capital -- our controllable working capital as a percentage of sales was 15.6% at the end of the third quarter.
This represents a significant improvement from 21.2% last quarter, and the team recognizes that we still have much work ahead of us to further improve our working capital performance.
We generated $25.6 million in operating cash flow in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we have generated $49 million in operating cash flow, up 21% compared to 2019.
The strong cash performance in the third quarter enabled us to reduce debt by $35 million.
capex was $3.2 million.
For the full year, we are expecting capital expenditures to be below 4% of sales.
On liquidity, our net cash position was $25 million, an improvement of approximately $20 million from the second quarter.
We have access to an additional $192 million through our revolving credit facility.
And at this time, we expect to remain well within our debt covenants.
We are continuing to implement SAP.
As we communicated earlier, more than 80% of our revenues come from sites that are running on SAP.
We are expecting to complete the implementation around the middle of 2021.
However, COVID-related travel limitations could cause some delays.
This concludes our prepared comments.
","Despite a 2% year-over-year decline in sales to $113.8 million, CTS Corporation experienced a strong sequential rebound of 35%. Third-quarter gross margin improved by 40 basis points, driven by cost efficiency and increased revenue. Adjusted earnings per share rose by 17% from last year to $0.34, surpassing estimates of $0.29. New business wins reached $127 million, with the addition of seven customers. The company remains focused on returning to growth, targeting 10% through organic and strategic acquisitions. Despite challenges in Mexico, most plants are operational at 90% capacity. The company secured future growth with approximately $75 million in EV and hybrid wins. Innovations in defense, medical, and industrial markets aim to expand applications. Management emphasizes strengthening customer relationships and improving sales capabilities. With solid liquidity and debt reduction, CTS remains cautious in the near term but sees opportunities for strengthening capabilities."
NSC_q3_2021.txt,"Along those lines, recall that in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $99 million related to an equity method investment.
So we will speak to the quarterly results excluding that charge.
A full transcript and download will be posted after the call.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.
Our third quarter results reflect a strong performance from the team as we delivered third quarter records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations and earnings per share.
While volume held steady with last year, revenue grew an impressive 14% and our 60.2% operating ratio reflects a 230-point improvement on a year-over-year adjusted basis, our second-best OR performance ever, outpaced only by last quarter's 58.3% mark.
In the midst of significant supply chain disruptions and labor shortages across the country, we're delivering upon our commitments.
And we could not have achieved those milestones without the tireless work of our employees who day in and day out, keep our customers' goods moving safely and efficiently.
Now let's turn to Cindy to go through our operations.
In the quarter, we continued to successfully drive productivity improvement throughout the network.
We worked to be as efficient as possible as we adjusted to accommodate demand shifts in many of our markets.
This quarter shows continued progress as we attack our cost structure while positioning ourselves for further improvement in both cost and service levels.
The quarterly operating metrics on slide six clearly show that, once again, we generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and GTMs that were up 5%.
While we are proactively hiring train crews, efficiency in all areas of our operations, including engineering, mechanical and communications and signals, enabled us to run the network with 7% fewer people in the quarter compared to a year ago.
Because assets drive activity, reducing the number of active locomotives was an important lever in managing the size of the workforce.
Both train weight and train length continue to improve, driven by a focus on improving the productivity in our bulk network.
Coal, grain and other single commodity unit trains offer real opportunity for gains through collaborating with our customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by doubling up existing trains over portions of their route.
I expect we will show continued progress in the fourth quarter as we see the fruits of our efforts.
While strong coal traffic helped drive train weight more than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record.
After seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we saw a modest deterioration this quarter despite the increase in train size as our horsepower leverage was challenged at times due to volatile traffic flows and we had modestly fewer of the very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains.
I am pushing the team to respond more quickly in the face of change, and we are committed to closing the gap with our peers over time and are redoubling our efforts in this critical area.
As you can see on slide seven, train speed and terminal dwell were generally flat versus second quarter and do not reflect performance at desired levels.
While there were some effects from Hurricane Ida, those impacts were localized, and I'm extremely proud of how the team, especially engineering and our signal forces, helped us return our routes in Louisiana to operation and reopen the New Orleans Gateway very quickly.
As I mentioned last quarter, we are experiencing hiring and retention conditions that are increasingly challenging, especially in some of our more critical locations, and it is having an impact on our network.
Despite hiring all year long, attrition has been accelerating in each of the last two quarters in several of those critical areas.
In many of these locations, we've been able to absorb the impact by executing upon productivity initiatives, and this will be very much a part of the equation going forward as we grow capacity, which I'll talk about more in a moment.
Some of the things we are doing to create relief: we've more than tripled our conductor trainee rank since the first quarter so that we can effectively backfill in critical areas; we've implemented tools such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses and signing incentives to improve the stickiness of our current and future workforce; and we continue to leverage the valuable Go Teams to quickly respond to business opportunities where needed.
People are the backbone of the railroad, and we need to make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market.
We are committed to having the right amount of resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality.
As our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more significant area of focus as highlighted on slide eight.
Some shippers are looking to take advantage of unexpected market opportunities by shipping extra volume.
Others are looking for us to help them adjust to volatility coming from other parts of their supply chains, and of course, all place a high value and service predictability.
We're adjusting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers are looking for.
For example, increases in both train sizes give shippers extra lift without further demands on our crew base.
Train size increases often require connecting railroads, customers and Norfolk Southern to change processes, and we have found those process changes are worth the effort because they improve asset turns and capacity.
We also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether helping to drive dwell at our biggest hump yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or tactically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that have the capacity to unload quickly.
Moving to slide nine.
I want to show how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity.
We've had great success over the past two years driving train size and, in doing so, have addressed a handful of infrastructure bottlenecks.
We're fast-tracking a set of siding improvements, the first of which went into service at the end of the third quarter so we can keep making progress.
Bigger trains unlocked by siding extensions helped drive locomotive utilization because it allows us to fully match train size to available pulling power.
And because locomotives are at their most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key lever to our fuel efficiency improvement.
While I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on our crew productivity: more cars per crew, asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also helps our customers with improved train and car performance.
On slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that makes our crews more efficient and our assets more productive.
Virtually all of our routine signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app, a process that used to be measured in minutes can now be accomplished in seconds.
It is inherently more efficient than the radio process of the past, and most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors.
In the words of our chief engineer, the app has been a game changer for the productivity of his forces.
We're doing the same with our mobile train reporting app, which enables our train crews to quickly report completed work and to receive updated customer work requests while in route.
This takes a lot of hands out of the process, including significant retyping and delay and enables our crews to be more productive.
We're still early in the deployment of this application with rollout to the local trains that do the preponderance of pickups and setoffs just beginning.
The use cases for this technology in the field are numerous, and driving adoption and innovation around this platform is a focal point that will allow us to capture additional benefit.
The common use thread in these apps is that better information allows people to plan.
Our track supervisors can better plan their schedule knowing the availability of track time, and our customers can better plan their plant operations and product pipeline with up-to-date shipment information.
In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, yielding double-digit revenue gains in each of our three markets, further demonstrating our ability to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.
Beginning on slide 12, I will highlight our results for the third quarter.
We achieved total revenue of $2.9 billion, representing a 14% increase from the same period last year despite flat volumes.
Our revenue performance this quarter was driven by significant gains in revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel, both reaching record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth.
This reflects the success of our ongoing efforts to yield up and improve revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as conditions improve.
Revenue in our merchandise segment improved 10% year-over-year, while volume increased to 5%.
Growth was led by our Chemicals franchise that benefited from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
Also contributing to merchandise growth was sustained strength in steel markets due to record-high commodity prices and growth in manufacturing activity.
Steel shipments were up an impressive 34% from the same period a year ago.
Partially offsetting these gains were declines in shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage.
This limited automotive production activity and further depleted finished vehicle inventories to new lows.
Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases.
Our intermodal franchise experienced several headwinds related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume in our domestic and international business lines.
In both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending outpaced available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem.
The combination of drayage shortages, warehouse productivity, equipment availability, labor force participation and rail network fluidity pressured intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline.
Overcoming these headwinds, we delivered revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue and price strength.
Coal revenue increased 32% in the third quarter as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic and drive demand for electric power.
Export coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record high seaborne prices increased opportunities for US.
Utility volumes declined in the third quarter as coal supply was limited and some crossover tons moved into the higher-rated export market.
The mix shift from utility to export, coupled with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit less fuel for coal in the third quarter, a new record for the franchise.
Moving to our outlook on slide 13.
We expect the third quarter environment to continue through the end of the year.
Strong consumer demand will continue, while pressures from material shortages and labor issues remain challenging global supply chains.
Inventory levels remain at historic lows despite the continued push to replenish stock, providing a boost to transportation demand.
We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year.
We expect merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in the fourth quarter of last year have been much less impactful in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We anticipate our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids and waste to experience higher volume as a result.
Ongoing demand for steel will also be a growth driver, with forecast for industrial production up more than 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and steel prices currently above $1,900 a ton.
A projected 4% year-over-year fourth quarter decline in US.
light vehicle production will remain a headwind as the industry remains challenged by the chip shortage.
Within intermodal, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck sector.
These favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability.
We are working closely with our customers and our channel partners to mitigate these challenges.
However, we do not see meaningful improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year.
Coal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions, although coal supply will be the governor on year-over-year growth.
Natural gas prices continue to climb, and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are the current focus of utility customers.
Seaborne prices are at decades-long highs in the export market, creating demand beyond capacity and supply abilities.
Overall, we are optimistic about the opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in our ability to execute our plan to generate value and grow our business.
Turning to slide 14.
There are several factors impacting the supply chain in which we participate.
This includes external factors, such as the chip shortage and intensifying congestion in the intermodal supply chain.
Coal supply availability continues to be a constraint to meet the higher demand in every market as both thermal and met production remain tight.
NS has taken action to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position us for revenue growth.
As drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we provided an alternative storage solution to our customers.
We're working diligently to add chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain.
Last quarter, we outlined our plan to repair a portion of our chassis fleet that was impacted by a manufacturing defect.
I appreciate the quick action and effort from our team, and I'm pleased to report that this issue is effectively behind us as we have repaired and returned approximately 95% of the recall chassis back to service.
We are also in the process of taking delivery of leased chassis to augment our fleet.
We've added terminal capacity to support growth driven by e-commerce and a recovering economy as well as reduced terminal congestion and improved network fluidity.
We remain focused on growth opportunities across our network.
We are continuously innovating to compete in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market, as shown by our Thoroughbred Freight Transfer or TFT service launched earlier this year.
TFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities for highway conversions to rail.
This service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets and the last mile flexibility of trucks to provide an innovative door-to-door service.
We're also leveraging our sustainability advantage to propel long-term growth.
The choice of transportation mode is one of the most powerful levers any shipper has to reduce the size of its carbon footprint, and we are working closely with our customers to deliver additional value through sustainability.
We have proven our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by providing innovative solutions that our customers value and position us for future market demands.
On slide 16, as Alan just detailed, revenues were up 14% on flat volumes.
With operating expenses up 10%, we delivered strong incremental margins leading to 230 basis points of operating ratio improvement, driving us to a Q3 record of 60.2%.
The improvement Alan detailed in RPU, coupled with strong productivity, led to record Q3 operating income, with growth of 21% or nearly $200 million.
And our free cash flow is also at record levels, a 33% increase during these nine months compared to last year.
Moving to slide 17, let's drill down into the change in operating expenses.
While operating expenses grew $149 million or 10%, it's up only 4% or $67 million, apart from fuel cost increases.
The fuel cost increase of $82 million is driven mainly by price, but the 5% increase in GTMs also drove more consumption.
You'll see purchase services up $35 million, with the majority of the year-over-year increase in areas.
We have an increase in technology spend, which is consistent with our technology strategy, and you've heard a couple of project examples in Cindy's remarks.
There are also headwinds from Conrail operating expenses.
And there are increases in intermodal costs.
More specifically, we had trucking costs associated with shuttling longer dwell containers to satellite parking lots in order to reduce congestion at our terminals and keep the freight moving.
Lift expenses were actually up in the quarter despite fewer lifts, and that is primarily because of inflation we absorbed on lift rates associated with contractor labor availability.
This is an area we do expect to see continued inflationary pressure going forward.
And we also absorbed costs in the quarter related to our chassis repairs.
Moving on to compensation and benefits.
It is up 5%, but you'll note the $40 million in savings from 7% lower headcount that more than offset increases in pay rates and over time.
Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $43 million, similar to what we reported in the second quarter, reflecting our strong 2021 financial outlook compared to lower accrual rates last year.
Materials, claims and other expenses were all down year-over-year.
Turning now to slide 18 and looking at the rest of the P&L below operating income.
You'll see that other income of $14 million is $25 million unfavorable year-over-year, and that is due almost entirely to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, close to our federal and state statutory rates, but unlike Q3 last year where the rate was 21.9% and benefited from tax advantages related to both COLI investment gains and higher stock-based compensation.
Net income increased by 17% and while earnings per share grew by 22%, supported by 3.6 million shares we repurchased in the quarter.
Wrapping up with our free cash flow on slide 19.
As I have mentioned, free cash flow is a record through nine months of 2021 at $2.3 billion, buoyed by very strong operating cash generation, and that translates into a 102% free cash flow conversion.
While property additions are trending a bit lower than run rate for our $1.6 billion guidance number, capital spend is never linear, and we expect fourth quarter property additions will get us close to the $1.6 billion.
We first demonstrated our commitment to sustainability with our visionary appointment of a Chief Sustainability Officer back in 2007, the first in the industry.
And our efforts to support a low-carbon supply chain have greatly accelerated since then.
Building upon the momentum earlier this year with the approval of our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and our launch of $500 million in green bonds in the second quarter, we're excited to report another set of milestones on our sustainability journey.
In August, we released our 2021 ESG report, our 14th annual report on corporate responsibility, highlighting the transformational role sustainability is having on our business as we further integrate sustainable practices into daily operations.
We celebrated our 500th modernized locomotive unit in partnership with Wabtec in August and announced our collaboration with Progress Rail in September on a first of its kind Tier four locomotive prototype for yard and terminal operations.
And just earlier this month, we announced our decision to purchase 100% renewable energy to power company operations in Altoona in Reading, Pennsylvania.
Our commercial and sustainability teams work hand in hand to provide demonstrable low-carbon solutions to a wide variety of current and prospective customers, providing a compelling value proposition as we convert more freight from truck to rail, simultaneously benefiting our customers, our communities and our shareholders.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to provide an update to our outlook based on the current economic environment.
As shared previously, we expect to achieve an operating ratio improvement above 400 basis points for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 result.
And there's likely upside to the 12% year-over-year revenue growth, as strength in our consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets drive the majority of the growth.
Near-term upside in coal markets provides a boost for the balance of the year as well, though coal remains challenged in the long term.
We are delivering on our financial commitments and remain focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our customers and shareholders.
","Norfolk Southern achieved record-breaking third-quarter results with a 14% increase in revenue to $2.9 billion despite flat volumes. Strong revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel drove growth. The operating ratio improved by 230 basis points to 60.2%, the second-best performance in company history. Key operational metrics included increased train weight, train length, and reduced workforce. Productivity improvements and technology investments, such as mobile track authority and train reporting apps, enhanced efficiency. The company anticipates continued revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by recovering economic activity, strong consumer demand, and high coal demand. However, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages remain challenges. Norfolk Southern remains optimistic about opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in its ability to generate value through innovative solutions and its sustainability advantage."
MYE_q3_2021.txt,"I'm Monica Vinay, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Myers Industries.
If you've not yet received a copy of the release, you can access it on our website at www.
myersindustries.com, it's under the Investor Relations tab.
These comments are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks uncertainties and other factors, which may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.
Further information concerning these risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth in the company's periodic SEC filings and may be found in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
We continued our growth trajectory during the quarter, and we made further progress on our long-term strategy despite a difficult macro environment that's impacting many businesses around the world.
During the quarter, we saw continued strong demand from our material handling and distribution customers.
This demand, combined with meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, drove the company to $200 million in net sales and more than 50% revenue growth for a second consecutive quarter.
The company's top line was the strongest it has been in many years.
On organic basis, sales grew 20% compared to the prior year period which marks three consecutive quarters of 20% or more organic growth.
We are beginning to see the benefit of our investments in our sales force and sales training and an improved commercial focus across the company.
While our top line performance was strong, we did see macroeconomic headwinds again this quarter, which impacted our margins.
Input costs climbed higher due to increasing raw material costs, and tightness in the labor market impacted labor costs, both of these drove margin compression during the period.
The negative impacts of labor were due to overtime pay, higher wages and in some cases, the lack of labor, which inhibited us from making or shipping certain orders.
While we believe inflationary labor and supply chain headwinds will likely persist for the next several quarters, we are taking numerous actions to mitigate possible impacts on our business.
These proactive steps include improvements in our sales and operations planning process, a reinvigorated sales force and the addition of a pricing excellence leader and team.
We're also working hard to debottleneck and automate our plants, while we continue to secure the raw materials necessary to ensure that we meet the volume needs of our customers.
We remain confident in our ability to manage price, volume and cost.
And as such, we are reaffirming our previous 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $1.05 per share.
Myers demonstrated growth is meaningful.
Our company is becoming a growth story.
A new Myers is here.
We're pleased with the growth to date, and we expect this new growth mindset to be a sustained theme and focus at Myers Industries.
In the short term, however, we continue to see an inflationary environment that is compounded by labor shortages and supply chain issues.
To manage through it, we made a few near-term supply oriented decisions that consume cash in the third quarter.
These decisions were made to ensure we continue our high service level to our customers, and we expect cash flow trends to normalize in the fourth quarter.
Let's begin with a review of our third quarter financial results on Slide four.
Net sales were up $68 million, an increase of 51%.
Excluding the impact of the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisitions, organic net sales increased 20% driven by price, which contributed 13%.
Higher volume mix contributed 7%.
Sales increased in all key end markets in both Materials Handling and Distribution segments.
Adjusted gross profit increased $7.2 million, while gross margin decreased from 35.6% in the prior year to 27.2% in the third quarter.
Gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and higher labor costs which were not fully offset by pricing actions, has led to an unfavorable price-to-cost relationship.
Included in cost of sales was a $1.6 million increase related to the LIFO inventory reserve.
Adjusted operating income decreased $3.1 million to $12.5 million due to increased SG&A, driven by the addition of Elkhart and Trilogy along with higher compensation cost and higher professional fees.
Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 20.9% in the third quarter compared to 23.8% in the prior year as we are experiencing the benefits of our overall larger scale on our infrastructure.
We're pleased with the investments we are making in support of our One Myers work strategy are yielding positive results.
Adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%.
And lastly, adjusted earnings per share was $0.23, a decrease of $0.07 or 23% compared to the prior year.
Turning now to Slide five for an overview of segment performance for the quarter.
Beginning with Material Handling, net sales increased $63 million or 73%, including the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition.
On an organic basis, Material Handling net sales increased 26%, driven by favorable price of 18%.
Strong volume mix contributed another 7% and FX, 1%.
Organic net sales increased in the vehicle, industrial and food and beverage end markets.
You may recall that our consumer end market was up significantly last year, driven by increased storm activity, which led to higher demand for our fuel containers.
Material Handling adjusted operating income decreased $1.3 million or 8% to $15.2 million.
The decrease was driven by an unfavorable price-to-cost relationship resulting from escalating raw materials and labor costs, which were not fully offset by pricing actions.
Additionally, SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition, higher compensation costs, travel costs and professional fees.
In the Distribution segment, sales increased $5 million or 11%.
Volume mix contributed 6%, resulting from increases across both equipment and supplies and price contributed 5%.
Distribution's adjusted operating income decreased $700,000 to $4.4 million due to an increase in SG&A expenses, which were more than offset higher volume mix and favorable price-to-cost relationship.
Turning to Slide six.
Working capital timing negatively impacted our cash flow for the quarter.
Free cash flow was negative $13.8 million compared with positive free cash flow of $16.2 million for the third quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations decreased in the quarter due to increases in working capital, driven by a $14 million and an $8 million increase in accounts receivable and inventory, respectively, combined with a $3 million decrease in trade accounts payable.
Additionally, capital expenditures were $6 million in the quarter.
Sales were more weighted in the back half of the quarter, contributing to the elevated accounts receivable balance.
In addition to higher raw material costs, our focus on meeting our customers' needs also contributed to higher inventory levels.
Year-to-date free cash flow was essentially flat, down $700,000.
Cash on hand at quarter end was $15 million.
We expect working capital to turn favorable in the fourth quarter.
Overall, our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility needed to execute on our long-term growth strategy.
As a reminder, on July 30, we utilized our revolving credit facility to finance the Trilogy Plastics acquisition.
We ended the third quarter with leverage at 1.8 times.
On Slide seven, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2021.
We anticipate net sales to increase in the mid- to high 40% range attributed to both organic growth and acquisitions.
Our previous sales guidance was in the mid-40% range.
A little more than half of the growth for the year is expected to come from the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition.
Elkhart's annual net sales at the time of acquisition were approximately $100 million and Trilogy's annual net sales were roughly $35 million.
While rising input costs and labor pressures continue to impact our profit growth and margins during the third quarter, we are seeing signs of resin cost easing and are cautiously optimistic it will begin to decline as we move through the fourth quarter.
This, combined with additional pricing actions affected in the fourth quarter should result in a favorable price-to-cost relationship for the quarter.
Taking these considerations into account, we are reaffirming our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 to $1.05 per share.
Our guidance reflects a weighted average share count of 36.5 million shares and the addition of the newly acquired Trilogy business.
As a reminder, Trilogy is expected to be only slightly accretive to earnings per share in the current fiscal year.
Our key modeling assumptions include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $22 million and capex of approximately $16 million to $19 million, up slightly from our previous capex guidance of $15 million to $18 million.
capex is expected to trend higher than past years with our renewed focus of investing in our facilities and improving our capacity along with the addition of Elkhart and Trilogy.
The effective tax rate is forecast to approximate 26%.
In closing, while the short term continues to be impacted by macroeconomic factors, our fundamentals remain intact.
We are extremely pleased with the demand for our portfolio of products along with our ability to pass along the value proposition they bring through pricing actions.
We are making solid progress on our One Myers initiative, which Mike will share with you momentarily.
Starting on Slide eight.
It's been a little more than a year since I first introduced our long-term road map and broader One Myers strategy.
I'm very proud of the considerable progress we've made to date.
I have a lot of passion for this company, our company, I see the upside and the opportunity every day.
We're currently well into the middle innings on Horizon one of our transformation.
As a company, we are aligned and centered on our true north, our mission, which is to transform our Material Handling segment into a high-growth business as the true innovator of engineered plastic solutions while we also continue to grow and optimize our Distribution segment.
As I outlined in the past, Horizon one is built on driving self-help initiatives to improve profitability and then using these proceeds to fund organic growth through sales and commercial excellence and bolt-on programmatic M&A.
We've made meaningful progress across each of these areas.
As we continue to execute the remainder of Horizon 1, we'll have the necessary foundation, knowledge and track record to move into Horizon two.
We will continue with the self-help and organic growth efforts, but will use the enterprise level M&A to create shareholder value.
After the completion of Horizon two, we will transition into Horizon three, where we approach M&A on more of a global scale.
Our One Myers vision and the associated transformation of our business is rooted in our ultimate goal of maximizing long-term value creation for our shareholders, we believe, will be achieved as we execute on this plan.
Slide nine covers the four strategic pillars that support our One Myers vision.
My approach is to be consistent, almost broadly consistent on the pillars and on the levers and the areas of focus we're using to drive our transformation.
Because they are the bedrock, the foundation of our transformation, we must maintain consistency in our approach in order to provide direction to our people and ensure execution success.
These pillars and work tracks are straightforward and not terribly complicated.
Our success comes from our relentless and dogged pursuit of their execution.
Since I've covered these pillars extensively in the past, I'll move on to Slide 10 to update you on the progress we've made across each of these as it relates to our first horizon.
We've displayed an outstanding growth -- organic growth trajectory over the last several quarters and believe we are taking the right action to help sustain this momentum.
We are building a world-class commercial organization at Myers through the continued addition of strong talent at the middle level and the new and rejuvenated marketing, product management and sales structure we put in place.
We've also invested in sales training and improving our sales processes to drive organic growth, customer intimacy and pricing to value not to cost.
Additionally, our investments in e-commerce continue to take flight.
E-commerce is showing encouraging results with year-to-date sales up approximately 30%.
We've learned to use e-commerce as a flywheel for volume and have found that it is an excellent channel.
We're able to accept or decline business that helps us best optimize our assets capabilities.
This flywheel approach will become more impactful as we get better at S&OP and improve how we balance our growing demand across our facilities.
Moving on to M&A.
Growth via acquisition is and will continue to be an integral part of our One Myers strategy.
We closed on our acquisition of Trilogy Plastics earlier this quarter and are very excited about its prospects.
Trilogy enhances our ability to manufacture highly engineered and tight tolerance specialty products.
We're already taking some of the learnings and best practices from Trilogy into our plants that were legacy Ameri-Kart or Elkhart Plastics.
So far, three months in, the integration of Trilogy is going well and is right in line with our expectations.
As a reminder, the integration of Elkhart has also gone well, helping us better serve our customers and capture growth synergies and $4 million to $6 million of cost synergies, both of which exceed expectations.
From a big picture perspective, through our two acquisitions over the last year, we are making progress on developing an effective framework for selecting high-quality companies that complement our businesses.
And as equally important, we're on our way to developing a strong, repeatable playbook and processes to ensure a successful integration of these acquired companies.
We have lost connection with our speakers.
We will be with you in just a second.
We now have the team back on the line.
I will hand back over to Mike McGaugh.
Sorry about that, folks.
And I'm not exactly sure where it dropped, but I'll pick up around e-commerce.
So that's a great place, a great thing.
So additionally, our investments in e-commerce continue to take flight.
E-commerce is showing encouraging results with year-to-date sales up approximately 30%.
We've learned to use e-commerce as a flywheel for volume and found that it's an excellent channel.
We're able to accept to define business that helps us best optimize our asset capabilities.
This flywheel approach will become more impactful as we get better at S&OP and improve how we balance our growing demand across our facilities.
Moving on to M&A.
Growth via acquisition is and will continue to be an integral part of our One Myers strategy.
We closed on our acquisition of Trilogy Plastics earlier this quarter and are very excited about its prospects.
Trilogy enhances our ability to manufacture highly engineered and tight tolerance specialty products.
We're already taking some of the learnings and best practices from Trilogy into our plants that were legacy Ameri-Kart or Elkhart Plastics.

From a big picture perspective, through our two acquisitions over the last year, we're making progress on developing an effective framework for selecting high-quality companies.
They complement our business and is equally important, we are on our way to developing a strong repeatable playbook and processes to ensure integration -- successful integration of these acquired companies.
The plastics molding industry is quite fragmented, and we believe that acquiring specific technologies, niches and best practices is a highly effective way to create value for all of our stakeholder groups.
We focus on acquiring founder-owned companies with similar cultures and values to Myers and we worked with the management teams to invest and grow these businesses through improved processes, additional capital investment, retaining and incentivizing key people and collaborating and optimizing across all of our facilities.
Paying a fair price, not overpaying, for these acquisitions is also an important part of the equation.
Our M&A strategy has proven to be successful so far, and we will continue to fine-tune it as we believe it will serve us well through the remainder of Horizon one as we pursue large acquisitions in Horizon two and three.
Moving on to operational excellence.
This is an area that's been crucial during the last few quarters where we were faced with multiple supply chain headaches.
Our purchasing and supply chain teams have done a great job in securing raw materials and managing our supply chain so that we are able to consistently deliver for our customers during the quarter.
On a relative basis to our competitors, our service levels remain high.
This creates value for our customers.
We believe this focus on partnering with our customers on service delivery and on a fair approach to pricing will pay dividends over the medium and long term.
I'd like to speak about our ability to manufacture and get product out the door.
As I mentioned earlier, we've pursued new approaches to staffing and providing labor to our plants and are encouraged by our results.
We are providing a safe and well-paying environment for our workers and have been able to source some workers from agriculture markets and second chance work programs.
This strategy was key to enabling our third quarter growth.
In addition to getting more creative with our approach to labor, we're also investing in automating select operations within our facilities.
We have several engineering teams driving automation across Myers, sharing best practices, and we're investing capex in the space and continue to do so, likely at an accelerated pace as we not see the issue of labor or lack of it going away.
An important part of operational excellence is pricing excellence.
And we've hired and installed a small but effective team that has led the space at other chemical and plastics companies and instituting this capability at Myers.
The team is accelerating our focus on value capture through pricing.
We announced additional price increases in September and October and have begun implementing value-based pricing rather than cost-plus pricing.
This is a change in approach, and it will take some time to implement, but it's an important lever to deliver value for our stakeholder groups.
Now I'll turn to our fourth pillar before giving my closing remarks.
Our high-performance culture is a key enabler of our long-term success.
Having a true north, having alignment on our values and our mission is critical for Myers to be successful.
We are well on our way on this journey.
We're seeing meaningful traction with our recently launched learning management system, which allows employees to take online classes to help develop their capabilities and skills within the company.
Our desire is to develop our employees and promote from within.
Doing this inspires loyalty, improves our company's performance, improves our stability and continuity of our employee base, and it also decreases cost.
We continue to invest in and build this tool, and we believe it will help us in the for talent.
An important part of our culture and value is based on servant leadership.
I believe on this approach, and I'm committed to instilling it at Myers.
The deployment of our certain leadership training is underway and 50 of our leaders have already completed this training and are applying it in their work lives.
We have an additional 50 going through the program in early 2022.
One final point is our mindset on inclusion.
At our senior manager levels and above, we've increased our hiring and promotion of female minority candidates as a percent of total hirings by more than 100% versus past years.
While we're not done yet, we're making progress.
I'd like to close by letting you know that last week, our management and our Board of Directors held a multi-day retreat to review our strategy in our short-, medium- and long-term goals and objectives.
The alignment and collaboration are remarkable and helpful.
We're putting the people and the processes in place to drive the company's transformation.
We have people in the right roles who know what to do, have done it many times before and are willing to work hard and get their hands dirty to deliver results.
We have a clear and straightforward road map to create meaningful shareholder value, and we have the team and the processes to deliver.
We'll navigate the short-term inflationary and supply chain bumps while we remain calm, disciplined and focused on the longer term.
I'm excited for our future, and I appreciate your interest in our company.
","Myers Industries reported strong growth in the third quarter, continuing a recent trend. Net sales increased by 20% organically, driven by price (13%) and volume mix (7%). The company completed two acquisitions (Elkhart and Trilogy) during the quarter, contributing to a 51% increase in overall net sales. However, inflationary pressures and labor shortages impacted margins, resulting in lower adjusted gross profit and operating income. Despite these headwinds, Myers reaffirmed its 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $1.05, supported by additional pricing actions, improved sales force, and strategic initiatives aimed at mitigating external challenges. The company remains confident in its long-term growth strategy and recently held a management retreat to align on strategic goals and objectives."
MMC_q3_2021.txt,"I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman.
Marsh McLennan had another outstanding quarter.
Our third quarter results reflect strong momentum across all of our businesses.
Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm.
Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macro economic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions.
Even as COVID-19 continues to pose risks in many parts of the world, vaccine rollouts are having a positive impact.
We are taking advantage of opportunities to add to our deep venture world-class talent.
At the core of our business is a focus on our colleagues and we are dedicated to Marsh McLennan being an exciting and dynamic place to work for outstanding people.
And we continue to innovate and leverage the collective strengths of our organization to help clients address their most pressing concerns, including climate, diversity and inclusion, the future of work, cyber and digital strategies.
As we have discussed, 2021 represents Marsh McLennan's 150th year, and success over such a long period of time requires constant innovation and investment to deliver sustained growth and profitability.
I'd like to discuss just a few recent examples of how we are innovating to develop new unique client solutions.
Nick Studer leads our firmwide climate initiative.
We view climate as a significant opportunity, and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue.
In October, Oliver Wyman launched a Climate Action Navigator, drawing on insights from across the company.
This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions.
We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low carbon climate resilient investment in the corporate sector.
Mercer recently launched Skills-Edge, an innovative platform allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire, and retain them.
Skills-Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills and supports both employees and organizations in rapidly reskilling for the future of work.
And just last week under the leadership of John Doyle, we launched our Cyber Risk Analytics Center.
This brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats, existing and future controls, and the potential economic impact.
We are one enterprise, and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together a leverage, knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns.
We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record.
Growth doesn't just happen.
It takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment and execution.
Since closing our acquisition of JLT, we've grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted earnings per share by 34% and our colleague base by 22%.
Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business.
We always strive to balance delivering results in the short-term while investing for the long-term.
In 2021, we generated year-to-date adjusted earnings per share growth that is higher than any annual period in over three decades while at the same time investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring.
We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5,000 or around 7%, mostly organic adds with an emphasis on client-facing roles.
We expect this influx of talent will drive growth, add to our capabilities and enhance our ability to serve clients.
Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions.
Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue, suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near-term.
The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year consistent with second quarter.
This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace.
Looking at pricing by line.
The Marsh market index showed global property insurance was up 9%.
Global, financial and professional lines were up 32% driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates, and global casualty rates were up high single-digits on average.
As a reminder, our index skews to large account business.
However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well.
although less than for large complex accounts.
Measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year, reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real and social inflation, and a continuation of large individual risk lawsuits.
2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses.
Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and Northeast.
This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world.
Marsh McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter.
Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance.
We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which is up 32% versus a year ago, driven by strong top-line growth and continued low levels of T&E.
Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis, the second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over two decades.
Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in Consulting.
Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth.
Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter continuing its string of excellent results.
Mercer underlying revenue grew 7% in the quarter, the highest in over a decade.
Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%.
Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.
Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for a terrific year.
We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth in over two decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year.
Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned, and this is evident in our excellent results.
Our results were outstanding with record third quarter revenue, second consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth, margin expansion, and significant earnings growth.
Highlights from our third quarter performance included a second straight quarter of 13% underlying growth in RIS, with 13% in Marsh and 15% in Guy Carpenter, and a second consecutive quarter of 12% underlying growth in Consulting, with 7% of Mercer and 25% at Oliver Wyman.
Growth in adjusted earnings per share exceeded 30% for the second quarter in a row.
Consolidated revenue increased 16% in third quarter, $4.6 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 13%.
Operating income in the quarter was $740 million, an increase of 37%.
Adjusted operating income increased 19% to $759 million and our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.5%.
GAAP earnings per share was $1.05 in the quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.08.
For the first nine months of 2021, underlying revenue growth was 10%.
Our adjusted operating income grew 21% to $3.4 billion.
Our adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points and our adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $4.82.
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services.
Third quarter revenue was $2.7 billion up 17% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis.
Operating income increased 21% to $403 million.
Adjusted operating income also increased 21% to $469 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.4%.
For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $9 billion with underlying growth of 11%.
Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 20% to $2.5 billion with a margin of 30.3%, up 80 basis points from the same period a year ago.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion of 17% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis.
Growth in the quarter was broad-based driven by nearly 40% new business growth and solid retention.
U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 16% and international underlying growth was 9%, Latin America grew 12%, its best growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, Asia-Pacific was up 9% and EMEA was up 8%.
For the first nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $7.3 billion with underlying growth of 12%.
U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 14% and international was up 9%.
Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was $314 million, up 15% compared with a year ago on both a GAAP and underlying basis.
Growth was broad-based across geographies and specialties.
Guy Carpenter has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last nine quarters.
For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.7 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth.
In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 13% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis.
Operating income increased 45% to $404 million.
Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $350 million.
The adjusted operating margin was 18.9% in line with the margin in the third quarter of 2020.
Consulting generated revenue of $5.7 billion for the first nine months of 2021, representing underlying growth of 9%.
Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 25% to $1.1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 19.6%.
Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 7% on an underlying basis, the highest result in over a decade.
Career grew 13% on an underlying basis, reflecting the continuing rebound in the global economy and business confidence.
Wealth increased 6% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management and modest growth in defined benefit.
Our assets under delegated management grew to nearly $400 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 24% year-over-year benefiting from net new inflows and market gains.
Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $610 million, an increase of 25% on an underlying basis.
This represents the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth as demand remains strong across most geographies and practices.
For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.8 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis.
Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the third quarter.
Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on earnings in Q3.
Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the fourth quarter.
Our other net benefit credit was $69 million in the quarter and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter.
Investment income was $13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and $12 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio.
Interest expense in the third quarter was $107 million compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period.
Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year.
Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter, down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020 which was impacted by some unusual item.
Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year.
Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021 excluding discrete items.
Given our year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year.
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, keep in mind the comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also continue to build for the long-term by investing in hiring.
While we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short-term.
That said, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so.
Turning to capital management or balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt.
Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when $500 million of senior notes mature.
We continue to expect to deploy at least $3.5 billion of capital in 2021, of which at least $3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.
The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion.
Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $665 million and included $272 million for dividends, $93 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases.
For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $2.6 billion and included $750 million for dividends, $566 million for acquisition, $734 million for share repurchases and $500 million for debt repayment.
We had a remarkable third quarter positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021.
And operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
","Marsh McLennan reported a strong third quarter, fueled by ""solid demand"" for its differentiated advice and solutions in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. All businesses experienced growth, with highlights including 13% underlying revenue growth in Risk and Insurance Services, which includes Marsh and Guy Carpenter, and 12% growth in Consulting, which includes Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Notably, Mercer achieved its highest underlying revenue growth in over a decade, driven by demand for its Career and Wealth services, while Oliver Wyman delivered a second consecutive quarter of over 20% growth. Overall, consolidated revenue increased 16% to $4.6 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19%, and adjusted earnings per share surged 32% to $1.08. Despite challenges, insurance market conditions remain favorable, with consistent rate increases across lines, particularly in cyber and financial and professional lines. Investment income remains a modest contributor, while taxes continue to impact profitability."
NWN_q4_2020.txt,"They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur.
In addition, some of our comments today reference non-GAAP adjusted measures.
We expect to file our 10-K later today.
As mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call.
Please note these calls are designed for the financial community.
Well, years come and go but 2020, as we all know, was unforgettable.
The pandemic affected many aspects of our daily lives, and I'm proud of the way our employees pulled together to provide our customers with superior service.
We successfully navigated a number of challenges while still achieving our key financial and operational goals.
We reported net income from continuing operations of $2.30 per share for 2020.
That's driven by solid performance at the gas utility and a strong contribution from our new platform of water utilities.
On the gas operations front, our field crews successfully handled everything from wildfires to restoring service in several towns over Christmas to navigating COVID, social unrest, etc.
Just a few weeks ago, our employees in the natural gas system once again rose to the occasion and provided a reliable service through an extreme weather event.
Our storage facilities and overall hedge positions worked to mitigate the amount of gas purchased on the spot market and helped to minimize the impact to our customers' bills.
This was incredibly important as prices, as everybody knows, spiked across the country from the widespread cold snap.
Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.
In 2020, we also executed on one of the largest capital programs in the Company's history aimed at supporting reliability.
We continue to operate one of the most modern and tightest systems in the nation, a system that has no cast iron and no bare steel.
In 2020, we invested over $270 million in our natural gas infrastructure.
From an economic perspective, 2020 was truly unprecedented.
Prior to the pandemic, we had a very fundamentally sound sustainable growing economy with record low unemployment both nationally and in our service territories.
We continue to see economic recovery and steady growth in several important areas.
Portland's unemployment right now is 6.1% in December, actually, essentially matching the national rate that's down from a 14.9% high in April.
Single-family housing activity remains strong.
In the Portland metro region, home sales were at 8.3% from 2019, with price growth of about 12%.
And new single-family permits issued last year were up 4% compared to 2019 levels.
At Northwest Natural, we continue to see good customer growth.
New construction plus conversions translated in connecting over 13,000 meters during the last 12 months ended December 31.
Our overall customer growth rate as a result was 1.5% for the same period, based on this strong single-family home construction, partially offset by the loss of some commercial customers due to the pandemic.
The rollout of vaccines is expected to ease pandemic related restrictions and allow businesses to reopen.
Still, we know these are difficult times for some customers and we've worked very closely with commissions, staff and stakeholders to determine the best way to return to normal business practices.
We've agreed to timelines for resuming collection processes and continue to evaluate the parties what makes sense for customers given the economic conditions, while also providing financial assistance and payment plans to vulnerable customers.
Enhancing the system includes a bill forgiveness program and working with the Oregon Legislature to provide additional funding for bill relief.
Through a variety of programs and agencies, we've provided over $4 million to over 10,000 households to pay their bills and stay warm during the last heating season.
We also donated about $1 million to nonprofits in our communities and initiated a special COVID-19 employee giving campaign.
For Oregon, previously approved new rates took effect on November 1 last year.
Gas bills continue to remain low.
Our customers are paying about 40% less today for their bills than they did 15 years ago.
In addition, in June, we passed back a record $17 million in storage bill credits to Oregon gas customers.
Safety, reliability and affordability make natural gas a preferred fuel source.
Eight out of 10 homeowners in our service territory prefer natural gas according to a study conducted in December 2020.
There's a strong recognition that natural gas is affordable, efficient and preferable to electricity for heating and cooking.
In fact, over 80% of respondents said they would pay $50,000 more for a home that has gas amenities over an all-electric home.
Customers also showed their appreciation by ranking Northwest Natural second in the West among large utilities in the 2020 JD Power's residential customer satisfaction survey.
And then finally, our Board approved the dividend increase in the fourth quarter back in 2020, the 65th consecutive year of annual dividend increases.
We are proud to provide the return to shareholders and be one of only three companies on the NYSE with that long record.
I will begin by discussing the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the highlights of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and then conclude with guidance for 2021.
In 2020, our utility commissions approved COVID deferrals and term sheets that outlined the types of revenues and costs that may be recovered.
These include PPE, bad debt expense, financing costs associated with additional liquidity and certain loss revenues.
Direct expense reductions such as lower travel and meals and entertainment are to be netted against the deferral.
Prudency review and recovery of the deferral accounts will be determined in future proceedings.
While our business model is resilient, we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic.
Through December 31, we incurred an estimated $10 million pre-tax of incremental costs and lower revenues due to the effects of COVID-19.
Of this, $4.8 million were deferred to regulatory accounts.
In addition, $1.3 million of late fee revenue that has not been charged to customers since the suspension of normal collection processes will be recognized in a future period when we begin to recover the foregone fees through rates.
The remaining $3.8 million that cannot be recovered through rates are primarily due to lower natural gas utility margin from customers that stopped service and slightly lower usage from customers that are not decoupled.
In order to further mitigate the financial effects of the pandemic, we initiated temporary cost savings measures which provided approximately $3.5 million of savings in 2020.
In summary, the total P&L impact of COVID in 2020 was $1.6 million.
Turning to our detailed financial results.
Note, I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%.
Also note that year-to-date earnings per share comparisons reflect the successful issuance of 1.4 million shares in June 2019 as we raised equity to fund investment in our gas and water utilities.
As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season.
For the quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $45.8 million or $1.50 per share compared to $38.3 million or $1.26 per share for the same period in 2019.
The gas utility posted an increase of $0.19 per share related to new rates in Oregon beginning November 1, 2020, offset in part by higher depreciation and general tax expense and the impacts of COVID-19.
Contribution from our other businesses increased $0.05 per share from the water assets we acquired in Washington and Texas and lower expenses at the holding company.
Utility margin in the gas distribution segment increased $11.5 million from the benefit of new rates in Oregon and customer growth, partly offset by the effects of COVID-19.
Utility O&M decreased $500,000 in the quarter, reflecting cost savings efforts.
I am proud of our employees whose hard work and commitment allowed us to accomplish this while still providing exceptional service.
Depreciation expense and general taxes increased $2.9 million related to the ongoing investment in our system.
For the full year 2020, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million or $2.30 per share compared to net income of $65.3 million or $2.19 per share for 2019.
2019 results included a regulatory disallowance of $0.22 per share related to an Oregon Commission order on tax reform and pension expense.
Excluding that disallowance on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.41 for 2019.
The $0.11 per share decline is largely due to year-over-year growth in expenses, the effects of COVID and the positive effects of weather and pipeline constraints on 2019 results.
In the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased $11.3 million.
Higher customer rates in Oregon and Washington, customer growth and revenues from the Northwest expansion project contributed an additional $21.5 million.
This was offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to pipeline constraints in 2019 and warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.5 million.
Utility margin also declined $1 million due to lower revenues from late fees as we suspended normal collection processes.
The remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the 2019 Oregon order.
With the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes, as I'll describe in a moment.
Utility O&M and other expenses declined $5.4 million.
This decrease is associated with the Oregon order which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed previously.
This was offset by a $6 million increase in underlying O&M related to higher compensation costs, contractor and professional service expenses as well as moving costs.
This was partially offset by the management driven cost savings measures I described earlier.
Pension expenses, included in other expense, increased $2.8 million.
However, this expense is now recovered in rates.
Over the last several years, we have invested in our gas system at historically high levels.
As a result, depreciation expense and general taxes increased $10.2 million.
Finally, utility segment tax expense in 2019 included a $5.9 million benefit related to the implementation of the Oregon order, with no significant resulting effect on net income.
Net income from our other businesses increased $2.2 million from higher earnings from the wastewater, water and wastewater utilities and lower expenses at our holding companies, partially offset by lower asset management revenues.
A note on capex.
We invested $294 million into the business, with $273 million of gas utility capital expenditures and $38 million for water acquisitions.
Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.
With regards to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, approximately 97% of our commercial and industrial customers are current with their bills.
Nonetheless, we have seen some commercial customers go out of business and shut off their meters as they have been negatively impacted.
We will continue to monitor -- closely monitor usage levels and commercial customer losses.
We will also continue to be disciplined regarding cost management in an effort to mitigate these circumstances.
Moving on to 2021 financial guidance.
Gas utility capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the $280 million to $320 million range, including significant projects related to system reinforcement, resource center renovations across our service territory and technology upgrades.
The Company initiated 2021 earnings guidance today in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
Guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations.
While the past year held challenges, our focus remains the same: providing superior customer service, maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated natural gas utility and diversifying our business by investing in the water sector.
We made progress on that last front with the sale of two investments that were no longer central to our strategy.
In August, we sold our interest in the Trail West pipeline project, and in December we completed the sale of the Gill Ranch storage facility in California.
Proceeds from the sales are expected to be reinvested in our gas and water businesses.
This past year reinforced our decision to build a water and wastewater utility platform and highlighted the value we bring and can create in this sector.
Our water and wastewater utilities experienced organic customer growth of almost 3%, 2.8% to be exact, over the 12 months ended December 31, 2020.
We also completed infrastructure improvements and filed our first water utility general rate case.
Although COVID temporary slowed acquisition -- temporarily closed acquisition activity -- slowed -- excuse me, temporarily slowed acquisition activity, we were still able to add a water and wastewater utility in Washington to our portfolio and made our first acquisition in Texas.
And we continued to make smaller acquisitions within our existing footprint while pursuing new expansion opportunities.
I remain -- I continue to remain very excited about the investment potential in this business.
Another key pillar of our strategy is aggressively pursuing a renewable future and working to decarbonize our gas utility system.
Before I take you through our approach, it's important to remember our starting point.
Northwest Natural serves about 74% of the residential square footage in our service territory and meets 90% of our space and water heat customers' energy needs on our coldest days, yet the emissions associated with that use accounts for only 6% of Oregon's total greenhouse gas emissions.
In the Northwest, the gas and electric system have concurrent peaks in the winter.
The gas system delivers about twice as much energy during the peak than the electric system, with even more capacity available.
This advantage positions us well to help drive decarbonization in the region in a way that ensures reliability and affordability.
And, as we have seen in recent weeks, one can never underestimate how important reliability is during the winter.
Let me walk you through three components of our vision of carbon neutrality by 2050.
First, we intend to continue to pursue aggressive energy efficiency to lower energy usage.
In the past 40 years, the number of residential natural gas customers in the US has grown by almost 90%, but demand has remained flat, which is a testament to the industry and how well they foster continued efficiency.
Our residential customers today use half of the amount of natural gas that they used in 1970 despite consistent growth in the average size of homes and more clients as per home.
Second, we're striving to integrate renewable natural gas from a variety of waste streams into our system.
The technical potential of RNG supply in Oregon alone is estimated to be nearly 50 billion cubic feet, about the same amount as all of the residential gas throughput in our state.
Nationally, early estimates show about 14 trillion cubic feet of technical potential or about 88% of all throughput.
Clearly, there's vast technical potential.
Now we need to collectively focus on getting as much as we can to market economically.
We also see the potential for hydrogen being added to the pipeline.
We believe there are three applications for -- of hydrogen from the power to gas process, blended, methanated and dedicated hydrogen systems.
We also envision the possibility of blue hydrogen, made from natural gas and paired with carbon capture, utilization and storage as playing a role in the US gas system.
And we're watching Europe, Canada and Australia efforts -- Australia's efforts in this area.
In 2019, Northwest Natural sent a technical team to Europe to meet with government agencies, think tanks and gas companies.
And we learned a lot about new technologies, projects and policy.
It was clear Europe was many years ahead of the US and they're thinking about the gas networks system and the role of green molecules in the energy transition that we're all going to go through.
Once [Phonetic] they realize gas infrastructure, which is already in place, is a huge advantage, and one great example of this is storage.
The natural gas infrastructure is built to provide long duration energy storage that doesn't degrade.
It can store RNG and methanated renewable hydrogen today in existing facilities.
And when we think about decarbonization strategies across the energy sector, the fact that the infrastructure already exists and has significant cost advantages is incredibly important in my opinion.
For example, Northwest Natural has 20 billion cubic feet of underground storage today.
That's equivalent to storing about 6 million megawatt hours of renewables.
In today's cost, that would be about a $2 trillion lithium battery.
And this is where policy is key to helping us leverage our existing infrastructure in new ways and accelerate our region's decarbonization efforts.
In Oregon, we have Senate Bill 98, the first of its kind renewable natural gas legislation that sets 30-year targets for gas utilities to procure R&D and renewable hydrogen for customers.
We just announced our first RNG investment under the bill and are actively working on more.
Northwest Natural has started hydrogen blending testing in our training facility, and we're working with Eugene Water And Electric Board in Oregon to propose a project that would include methanated hydrogen for our system.
We're excited about these early steps and are committed to pushing for solutions that include system resilience as part of the energy transition.
Now, more than ever, it's clear to us how critical our gas infrastructure is to furthering our collective climate goals, while also ensuring energy system diversification and reliability for the communities we serve.
","Northwest Natural's 2020 results included net income of $2.30 per share, driven by solid gas utility performance and contributions from water utility acquisitions. Economic recovery and growth are evident, with Portland's unemployment rate comparable to the national average. Despite pandemic-related challenges, customer growth remained strong. The company's commitment to affordability and customer satisfaction was recognized in a JD Power survey. Financial impacts of COVID-19 were minimal, with a total P&L impact of $1.6 million in 2020. The gas distribution segment saw increased utility margin from new rates and customer growth, partly offset by COVID-19 effects. Net income from other businesses contributed to overall earnings. The company invested $294 million in capital expenditures, including significant gas utility projects. For 2021, guidance estimates earnings in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and gas utility capital expenditures between $280 million and $320 million. Northwest Natural emphasized its strategy of providing superior customer service, maximizing returns from its gas utility, and diversifying into the water sector through acquisitions and infrastructure improvements. The company's commitment to decarbonization includes energy efficiency measures, integration of renewable natural gas, exploration of hydrogen, and leveraging existing infrastructure for energy storage."
SSD_q4_2020.txt,"Such statements are based on certain estimates and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
We encourage you to read the risks described in the company's public filings and reports, which are available on the SEC's or the company's corporate website.
Now I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.
I'll begin with a summary of our full-year 2020 results before turning to a discussion on our key fourth quarter performance drivers and initiatives.
Brian will then walk you through our financials and fiscal 2021 business outlook in greater detail.
I am extremely proud of our strong financial and operational performance in 2020 which we delivered in a highly challenging operating environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our net sales improved 11.6% over 2019 to $1.28 billion, the highest in the company's history, driven by strong sales volume.
As a result, we generated record earnings of $4.27 per diluted share, up 43.3% over 2019.
These results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all our Simpson employees.
Their diligence including strict adherence to protocols to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 has enabled us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions from the pandemic.
On behalf of the entire Simpson management team, we applaud them for their tremendous efforts.
The health, safety and well-being of all our employees remains our Number 1 priority and we will strive for continuous improvement to ensure Simpson remains a safe and rewarding place to work.
Our record 2020 results were further supported by our commitment to position Simpson for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth.
In October of 2017, we unveiled a three-year 2020 plan with aggressive targets to maximize our operating efficiencies and drive long-term shareholder value.
Since then, we've made significant progress against our goal, some of which we updated in July of 2019 to reflect changes in the macroeconomic landscape.
While we elected to withdraw these financial targets in April 2020 due to the significant level of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we continued to execute based on the same underlying principles, focusing on operating efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the same time, we did experience certain tailwinds in our business as a result of the COVID-19 related macroeconomic conditions, namely we had favorable steel prices, temporary reduction in travel and related operating expenses, and an increase in repair and remodel activity.
Due to the culmination of these factors, we were able to meet or exceed nearly all of our ambitious 2020 plan objectives.
We are very proud of these accomplishments and I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing those with you.
Our first 2020 plan objective was a continued focus on organic growth.
Our goal was to achieve a compounded annual growth rate in net sales of approximately 8% from 2016 to 2020.
As of the year end of 2020, we had well exceeded this target, achieving a compounded annual growth rate over 10% relative to our 2016 baseline.
Milestones that helped support this goal included price increase for the majority of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, the signing of one of our largest US homebuilding companies onto our builder program resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now engaged on our program, strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of Lowe's as the home center customer in mid-2020.
Our second objective involved rationalizing our cost structure to improve companywide profitability.
We aimed to reduce our total operating expense as a percent of net sales from 31.3% in 2016 to a range of 26% to 27% by the end of 2020.
We tackled this through a combination of zero based budgeting, lowering our indirect procurement costs and other cost reduction measures we took in both Europe and in our concrete business.
In addition, specifically in 2020, we experienced solid cost savings from our expense management practices as well as one-time benefits from the reduced travel and trade show costs as a result of the COVID-19 restriction.
These factors combined with strong topline growth enabled us to exceed our operating expense target.
For the full year of 2020, we recorded operating expenses as a percent of net sales of 25.6%, representing 570 [Phonetic] basis points of improvement compared to 2016.
Our next plan was to improve our operating income margin to a range of 16% to 17% by the end of 2020.
We exceeded this target as our gross margin significantly benefit from lower material costs and limited spending on operating expenses due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
We reported an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020, a 350 basis point improvement compared to 16.4% in 2016.
At the consolidated level, our gross margin improvement was supported by enhanced gross margins in our concrete business, another 2020 plan goal.
Following the unveiling of the 2020 plan, we implemented a new concrete strategy in late 2017 by narrowing our concentration to six distinct product categories.
By focusing on these higher margin products to increase profitability, we exceeded our goal of improving our global concrete gross margin from 34.7% in 2016 42% in 2020.
Our final profitability goal was to improve our operating income margin in Europe.
We've made substantial progress in Europe over the past few years, including rolling out our fastener lines in the Nordic region and in France, the consolidation of our European management team to create efficiencies as well as significant cost cutting initiatives.
As a result, we achieved an operating income margin of 7% excluding our SAP costs of approximately $2.5 million in 2020.
While this is lower than our original target range of 8% to 9%, we are pleased with the results, which reflect approximately 350 basis points of improvement versus the 2016 numbers.
Our third objective focused on improving our working capital management and overall balance sheet discipline.
Since the onset of the 2020 plan, we've made headway on this front, primarily through inventory reductions and the implementation of lean principles throughout our operation.
We've completed a three-phase SKU reduction program, eliminating upwards of 12,000 non-moving or slow-moving items and converted our customers over to replacement products.
In addition, we carried out rapid improvement events at many of our US production facilities, resulting in efficiency enhancements as well as improved management of inventory and purchasing practices.
As we move forward, we remain committed to driving continuous cost management and improved efficiencies through our lean initiatives.
However, consistent with our strategy, it is critical that we balance our inventory purchases with our liquidity needs in order to maintain our commitment to product availability standards and an exceptional customer service experience.
The final element of our 2020 plan was focused on maximizing shareholder value with the goal of improving our return on invested capital from 10.5% in 2016 to a range of 15% to 16% by the end of 2020.
Through our solid operational execution, combined with the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered our effective income tax rate beginning in 2018, we surpassed this target, ending 2020 with the return on invested capital of 20%.
Beyond this, we continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
In 2020, we returned $116.2 million to our stockholders through the payments of $40 million in dividends and $76.2 million in share repurchases.
Since the onset of the 2020 plan, we have returned over 83% of our cash generated by operations to our shareholders, far exceeding our target of 50% I'm extremely proud of all that we've accomplished in these past three years and by executing on the 2020 plan, we achieved solid organic growth, we've rationalized our cost structure to improve companywide profitability and we've improved our working capital management and balance sheet position, in turn creating value for all key Simpson stakeholders.
Now let's turn to a brief information on our fourth quarter results and operating initiatives.
Our fourth quarter consolidated net sales grew 12% year-over-year to $293.9 million on significantly higher volume.
Gross margin increased to 42.1% from 41.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily related to strength in Europe, where we experienced lower material and warehouse costs.
Our solid gross margin combined with effective expense management and reduced costs from travel and other restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 drove a 7.8% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $39.5 million and earnings of $0.68 per diluted share.
The increase in sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter was primarily related to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel, which includes both our home centers and co-op customers.
We are continuing to experience a shift in consumer behavior toward home renovations as a result of the pandemic.
Sales from home center distribution channels where we see much of our repair and remodel business improved over the prior year period.
Growth was supported by our product rollout of our connectors, mechanical anchors and fastener product solutions into all 1737 Lowe stores, which we completed during the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, Lowe's returned to Simpson as a home center customer beginning in the second quarter of 2020.
Our sales were further supported by solid US housing starts, as we generally experience a multiple month lag in the demand from the time of the start, in the fourth quarter, we benefited from strong third quarter 2020 housing starts which grew over 11% year-over-year.
In addition, while we typically see lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter related to holiday closures and winter conditions, in 2020, the fourth quarter, we experienced a very mild winter.
This enabled construction activity to continue late into the year, further bolstering our net sales.
Turning now to Europe.
Sales continued to recover nicely following government-ordered shutdowns to our operations in the United Kingdom and France due to COVID-19 in late March.
Sales were assisted by strong demand trends and our ability to meet our customer needs through our solid inventory management practices.
We believe our sales benefited in Europe during the fourth quarter as many of our competitors experienced supply chain issues.
During this time, we were able to offer customers the important products they required to keep up with demand and to maintain job site on schedule.
I'd also like to note that while the United Kingdom has reimplemented shutdowns due to the most recent COVID-19 surge, we have been deemed an essential business and all of our major production and distribution facilities have remained open and operational with remote work being promoted where possible, such as in our corporate offices.
In regards to, [Indecipherable] implementation, the rollout continued to progress despite travel limitations related to COVID-19.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the SAP rollout at our UK branch and Gallatin, Tennessee locations, both of which are now live.
Most recently, we successfully transitioned all of our Canadian-based sales organization over to SAP, thus completing the full SAP rollout in North America, a very important milestone.
This year we will continue working on the SAP transition in our European locations and the rest of the world and we currently anticipate a companywide completion in 2022 and we will continue to monitor and update our timeline should circumstances change.
Now I'd like to briefly touch on our capital allocation structure.
We are very grateful to be able to operate as a supplier to other essential businesses with only minimal disruptions due to the pandemic.
As our business continues to generate strong cash flow, we remain focused on appropriately balancing our growth and stockholder return priorities.
We are also very pleased to be in a position to pay off our line of credit borrowing in pool, as well as declare our quarterly dividend as we have done consistently since 2004.
While the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact our broader economy, exiting 2020 we feel confident in the bright future that we believe lies ahead for Simpson.
With another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in housing starts, which were up over 11% in the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe housing will continue to be a key element of the economic recovery in the coming years ahead and we are well positioned to capitalize on this environment.
At the same time, we continue to pursue our strategy of diversification, positioning our business to be less vulnerable to US housing market through key investments and adjacent products in markets and we also remain focused on growth, including M&A opportunities that would complement our existing product offering, manufacturing footprint or strengthening our software capabilities.
Our success in achieving the 2020 plan target has created a very strong foundation for Simpson, successfully positioning our company for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth.
But now we are ready for our next chapter.
Today, I'm pleased to announce that on Tuesday, March 23, we plan to host a Virtual Analyst and Investor Day to provide more insight and details surrounding the elements of our business strategy in 2021 and beyond.
Additional information about this event will be released in the coming days.
I'm pleased to discuss our fourth quarter financial results with you today.
Now turning to our results.
As Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales were strong, increasing 12% to $293.9 million.
Within North America segment, net sales increased 9.8% to $249.1 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in our home center distribution channel, which includes our home center and co-op customers.
Sales volumes were supported by the return of Lowe's along with increased repair and remodel activity.
Our net sales further benefited from other distribution channels, which experienced increased demand from new housing starts and repair and remodel activity.
In Europe, net sales increased 24.9% to $41.8 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in local currencies.
Wood construction products represented 85% of total sales compared to 83% and concrete construction products represented 15% of total sales compared to 17% last year.
Consolidated gross profit increased by 12.4% to $123.7 million, which resulted in a stronger Q4 gross margin of 42.1% compared to last year.
Gross margin increased by 20 basis points, primarily due to lower material and warehouse costs, which were partially offset by higher labor costs.
On a segment basis, our gross margin in North America declined to 43.2% compared to 43.9%, while in Europe, gross margin increased to 25.3% compared to 29.9%.
From a product perspective, our fourth quarter gross margin on wood products was 41.8% compared to 40.8% in the prior year quarter and was 39.6% for concrete products compared to 43.7% in the prior year quarter.
Now turning to our fourth quarter costs and operating expenses.
Research and development and engineering expenses increased 10% to $12.9 million primarily due to personnel costs, stock-based compensation, product testing and cash profit sharing expenses.
Selling expenses decreased 1.2% to $27.8 million due to lower travel and entertainment and advertising and trade show expenses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, cash profit sharing, sales commissions and stock-based compensation expense.
On a segment basis, selling expenses in North America were down 2.1% and in Europe, they were mostly flat.
General and administrative expenses increased 10.9% to $43.6 million primarily due to increases in cash profit sharing, stock-based compensation and software subscriptions and licenses.
Total operating expenses were $84.3 million dollars, an increase of $5.1 million or approximately 6.5%.
As a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses were 28.7%, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 30.2%.
Our solid topline performance combined with our stronger Q4 gross margin and diligent management of costs and operating expenses helped drive a 7.8% increase in consolidated income from operations to $39.5 million compared to $36.6 million.
In North America, income from operations decreased 1.8% to $36.1 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2019 North America income from operations included a $5.6 million gain on the sale of a selling and distribution facility.
In Europe, income from operations increased 145.8% to $1.3 million primarily due to increased gross profit.
On a consolidated basis, our operating income margin of 13.4% decreased by approximately 50 basis points.
Our effective tax rate increased to 25.6% from 22.3% due to the release of foreign valuation allowances in 2019.
Accordingly, net income totaled $29.6 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share compared to $28.1 million or $0.63 per fully diluted share.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our balance sheet remained healthy with ample liquidity to operate our day-to-day operations.
At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $274.6 million, an increase of $44.4 million compared to December 31, 2019 after paying down the remaining $75 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter.
As of December 31, 2020, the full $300 million on our primary line of credit was available for borrowing.
Our inventory position of $283.7 million at December 31 increased by $23.6 million from our balance at September 30 as we continue to see higher levels of construction activity along with the unprecedented demand we've experienced through the pandemic.
We continue to be highly selective in regard to inventory purchases through careful management and purchasing practices along with maintaining our high level -- high levels of customer service and on-time delivery standards As a result of our improved profitability and effective working capital management, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $77.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $21.1 million or 37.4%.
For the full year of 2020, we generated $207.1 million of cash flow from operations, which increased nearly $1.5 million.
During the fourth quarter, we used approximately $17 million for capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $37.9 million, in line with our reduced expectations as a result of our focus on cash preservation in mid-2020 due to COVID-19.
We were also pleased to have paid $40.4 million in dividends in fiscal 2020 including $10.2 million in the fourth quarter.
In addition, we repurchased approximately 1.05 million shares of our common stock in 2020 at an average price of $72.33 per share for a total of $76.2 million.
This includes approximately 151,000 shares of our common stock that we repurchased during the fourth quarter at an average price of $89.49 per share for a total of $13.5 million.
As our authorization for repurchases of common stock expired at year-end, on December 16, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock, which went into effect on January 1, 2021 and runs through December 31, 2021.
In addition, on January 22, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share, which will be payable on April 22, 2021 to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2021.
Based on business trends and conditions as of today, February 8, we are initiating guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2021 as follows.
Operating margin is estimated to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%.
The effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 25% to 26% including both federal and state income taxes and capital expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million including approximately $10 million to $13 million, which will be used for maintenance capex.
As of today, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on general economic conditions remains uncertain.
It's important to note that the potential economic impact related to COVID-19 on our operations, raw material costs, consumers, suppliers and vendors may have a material adverse impact on our 2021 financial outlook should conditions materially change from the current environment.
We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, which were not significantly impacted in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In summary, despite the COVID-19 related challenges in the marketplace and ongoing uncertainty, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results and operating performance.
Our industry-leading position, geographic reach and diverse product offerings combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position gives us confidence in our ability to maintain operational excellence and support current and future demand trends.
As Karen mentioned, we look forward to updating you on our go-forward business strategy in 2021 and beyond during our Virtual Analyst and Investor Day on March 23.
","Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Simpson Strong-Tie exceeded its 2020 plan objectives by achieving strong organic growth, rationalizing its cost structure for increased profitability, and improving working capital management. Notably, net sales rose by 11.6% to a record $1.28 billion, leading to record earnings of $4.27 per diluted share, marking a 43.3% increase. This robust financial performance was supported by factors such as favorable steel prices, reduced travel expenses, and a surge in repair and remodel activity. Moreover, the company's gross margin improved significantly, driven by lower material costs and limited expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020. Furthermore, Simpson Strong-Tie surpassed its return on invested capital target with an impressive 20% return and returned $116.2 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales grew by 12% year-over-year to $293.9 million, with increased sales volume due to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel and solid US housing starts. Despite the economic challenges, Simpson Strong-Tie remains optimistic about its future prospects, emphasizing its strong liquidity position and commitment to growth and diversification. The company is also initiating guidance for the full year 2021, with an estimated operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18.5% and capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million."
NSP_q3_2020.txt,"We appreciate you joining us.
First, I'm going to discuss the details behind our third quarter 2020 financial results.
Paul will then comment on the key drivers behind our Q3 results, our outlook for the remainder of 2020 and some general comments on 2021.
I will return to provide our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and an update to the full year 2020 guidance.
We'll then end the call with a question-and-answer session.
In addition, some of our discussion may include non-GAAP financial measures.
Now, let's discuss our third quarter results in which we achieved $0.91 in adjusted earnings per share, a 21% increase over Q3 of 2019 and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase.
These results reflect outperformance in worksite employee growth and pricing relative to our expectations in this uncertain and challenging business environment and upside in our direct cost programs brought about by the dynamics of the pandemic and the structure and ongoing management of these programs.
As for our growth metric, the average number of paid worksite employees in Q3 of 2020 increased by 1.7% sequentially over the Q2 period to 231,750, which was above the high-end of our expected range.
Now you may recall that employee layoffs in our client base drove a 6% reduction in paid worksite employees from the outset of the pandemic in March through the low point in May of this year.
Since then, worksite employees have grown sequentially as employees returning to work and being hired by our clients have outpaced any further layoffs.
Additionally, client retention for both Q2 and Q3 has remained at our historical level of 99% and worksite employees continue to be added from new client sales.
Given these recent positive trends, we now expect paid worksite employees to return to near pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year.
Now let's move on to gross profit, which increased by 8% over Q3 of 2019.
Worksite employee volume and pricing above target levels, combined with upside in our benefit and workers' compensation programs, resulted in significantly higher-than-expected gross profit.
This quarter's benefit costs included some favorable development from Q2, a period of highly unusual claim activity due to the impact of the shutdown orders.
In addition, healthcare utilization began trending toward more normalized levels in the third quarter, although not to the degree of our expectations.
Going forward, we expect further normalization along with the resumption of some deferred care in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, the extent and timing of which is still uncertain.
Our workers' compensation program continues to perform well due to ongoing management of safety practices and claims.
Recent favorable claims development has been associated primarily with periods prior to the pandemic.
And any favorable impact from the reduction in severity of workers' compensation claims associated with the work-from-home status of many of our clients' employees would likely favorably impact our costs in future periods as this claim experience develops over time.
As for our pricing, we charge our clients a comprehensive service fee, inclusive of our HR services and direct cost programs.
We entered 2020 with certain pricing targets set prior to the offset of the pandemic.
And we continued to manage toward these budgeted targets.
As you may recall, certain savings resulting from the disruption caused by the pandemic were negotiated with our vendors and were passed along to our clients in the form of a comprehensive service fee credit as reflected in our Q2 financials.
Now turning to operating expenses, Q3 operating expenses included continued investment in our growth, including costs associated with a 10% increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors.
Other corporate employee head count has remained level over the past three quarters due to the effort and effectiveness of our staff in the face of increased HR service demands from within our client base.
Cost savings have been realized in other areas of the business, including travel, training and other G&A costs, as we manage through the current business environment.
The Q3 year-over-year increase in total operating expenses of 15% was impacted by increased stock-based compensation costs.
Now this increase was driven by a few items: first, our outperformance in the level of paid worksite employees and earnings during the pandemic; second, the shift in the weighting to performance stock awards from the performance cash awards for 2020 to further align our employees' interest with shareholders during these challenging times; third, the acceleration of expense for employees meeting retirement eligibility requirements under recent modifications to our plan; and fourth, a comparison to prior year's quarter in which earnings and related performance-based compensation were adversely impacted by large healthcare claim activity.
Now operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization increased just 4.6% over Q3 of 2019.
Now, as far as our financial position and liquidity, it remains strong as we manage through the pandemic conditions, continue investments in our growth and provide returns to our shareholders.
Adjusted cash has increased from $108 million at December 31, 2019 to $213 million at September 30th, while repurchasing 1.3 million shares of stock at a cost of $91 million, paying now $47 million in cash dividends and investing $69 million in capital expenditures to-date during 2020.
Borrowings increased by $100 million over the nine months and $130 million remains available under our credit facility.
Today, I'll provide comments on three topics, starting with some thoughts on our significant outperformance in the recent quarter.
I will then discuss how the primary drivers to our business model reacted to the pandemic, resulting in the opportunity implied by the guidance we are providing today to attain double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA this year.
I'll finish with some comments on our view of these factors going forward, which will ultimately drive our outlook for 2021.
We are certainly pleased with our execution in the third quarter, which resulted in a variety of factors contributing to better-than-expected results.
The resiliency of our client base supported by our dedicated service providers combined with solid sales and retention to drive a nice rebound in sequential growth in our key metric paid worksite employees.
Net gain in worksite employees from within our client base exceeded our expectation as client hiring of furloughed and new employees occurred sooner and at a faster pace.
As Doug mentioned, client retention continued at historical levels of 99%, despite the economic pressure on small businesses in the current environment.
In addition, our booked sales since the pandemic have been approximately 70% of our pre-pandemic sales budget, which we believe is solid performance in a virtual selling environment.
In the third quarter, paid worksite employees from previously booked sales was 92% compared to the same period last year, demonstrating continued demand for our services and strong execution in enrolling new clients.
Another highlight of the quarter was our strong pricing of both new and renewing accounts in service fees and allocations for direct costs, including our benefit programs.
The matching of price and direct cost is critical to our model and exceeding our targets in this area is important as direct cost affected by the pandemic normalize.
We've also been able to continue to grow and develop our BPA team through this quarter.
During this period, we virtually trained over 350 BPAs in our Level 1, 2 and 3 and our certified Business Performance Advisor programs.
Our trained BPA count increased 10% over the same period last year, positioning us well for our fall selling season.
This quarter, we were also able to divert some operating expense savings to develop client testimonial videos and increase advertising to support our fall selling season and our retention campaign.
These videos captured the emotion we were hoping for demonstrating the value of a sophisticated HR function in a crisis.
We were also able to continue important technology development beyond responding to the many compliance needs that emerged earlier this year.
We are extending our People Analytics platform, which has been very well-received by our mid-market and enterprise clients to our emerging growth segment just in time for our critical renewal period.
We are continuing to make strides improving in Insperity Premier, our proprietary human capital management system, rolling out a new time and attendance user interface and using new behavioral analytics tool to guide road maps making premier easier and more efficient for clients.
The bottom line for the third quarter was that we experienced the ideal combination of higher volume and pricing and lower direct and operating costs.
Each of these elements contributed to our strong outperformance in the quarter.
So we have responded quickly and effectively to the unusual events we've experienced in 2020 meeting client needs and achieving better-than-expected growth and profitability.
We've also kept our eye on the long-term making progress on many important initiatives.
Now that we have three quarters under our belt and our estimate for Q4, we can evaluate how our business model has reacted during the pandemic.
When the pandemic hit, we did not expect our business model would have the potential to generate double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA that we have within the guidance we're providing today.
The effects for the pandemic on our business model ran the full gamut from obvious expected negatives to completely unexpected positives.
It's worth taking a moment to summarize these factors that drive the model since, as we all know too well, this pandemic is not over and it appears the effects will carry into 2021.
For example, one would think the pandemic a health issue would increase health costs.
However, what we've seen is that rising COVID cases created the need to protect hospital capacity and limit elective procedures, which combined with people's behavioral tendency to avoid hospitals as much as possible, healthcare expenses have actually declined significantly in the short-term.
Longer-term healthcare costs may be elevated due to the deferral of [Phonetic]care or cost associated with treatment of COVID or vaccines.
To this point, we have not seen these cost increases to actually increase the overall trend as other offsets like telemedicine and some level of deferral of care [Phonetic] continues.
In addition, many experts, including the CDC, are anticipating that the precautions currently being taken to reduce the spread of COVID could substantially reduce the incidence of flu this year.
An obvious negative factor we experienced from the pandemic related to lockdowns was the economic effect on small and medium-sized businesses, which affects us in the form of layoffs in our client base.
We saw a drop in paid worksite employees of approximately 6% in two months, followed by a steady rebound over the following four months, supported by fiscal stimulus and easing restrictions.
In retrospect, the CARES Act and specifically the Paycheck Protection Program was effective in mitigating some level of layoffs.
Further, we believe our quick and effective support of our clients to take advantage of these programs played a role in fewer layoffs occurring and a faster rebound.
The effects of the shutdown also highlighted one specific advantage in our business model, which is our client selection strategy.
Due to our risk-based client selection process, we have a very small percentage of our client base in industries most affected by the pandemic and shutdowns such as entertainment, hospitality, travel and restaurants.
Another surprise somewhat due to our client selection strategy has been the nominal business closings we have experienced in our client base.
Although we expected to see an increase, our strategy of targeting the best small and mid-sized businesses across a wide range of industries proved to provide some insulation from this factor as we saw no significant increase in business failures.
Another dramatic effect we experienced was the increased workload as many issues arising from the pandemic landed in the HR department.
As I mentioned last quarter, client interactions increased 300% and the average length of time of these interactions doubled.
This five-fold increase in workload has diminished somewhat, but remains elevated.
On the flip side, lockdowns led to working from home.
In our case, this resulted in improved productivity and our dedicated staff performed heroically in response to the increased demand for our services.
Our experience leads us to believe working from home is effective for ongoing routine activities.
However, innovation and collaboration may suffer in the longer-term.
A hybrid scenario of working from home and coming into the office may provide optimal productivity, efficiency and innovation going forward.
Another upside in our model from the lockdowns and work-from-home environment across our client base is a substantial decrease in the incident rate of workers' compensation claims.
This impact is yet to be reflected in our cost, but -- and should benefit future periods to some degree.
However, these lower costs may be offset by COVID-related claims that may be covered by workers' compensation in some states.
An additional upside surprise to me has been our effectiveness, continuing to sell in a virtual environment with a service offering as comprehensive and complex as ours.
We now know the range of sales efficiency under these conditions.
And as we integrate face-to-face meetings back into the mix, we could see a longer-term efficiency gain.
One final observation is the success we've had during the pandemic in retaining clients even as financial considerations prevailed on our client base.
Our services simply were invaluable and clients have continued our premium services despite the need to tighten their belts.
So now that we have a better understanding of the factors driving our business model during a pandemic, what does that mean as we look ahead to 2021?
Well, first, it means planning will be dependent on these factors and drivers that are likely to ebb and flow based upon the state of the pandemic.
We will be monitoring these new inputs very closely and we'll finalize a budget later than usual to include the most recent information.
Making estimates at an early stage makes little sense in view of the number and range of possibilities, especially when considering the timing and degree of severity of the pandemic or the actions that may occur to mitigate its effects.
For example, COVID cases are on the rise now, but one or more vaccines may be available by 2021 or an anticipated economic downturn from additional lockdowns may occur.
Additionally, small businesses may be bolstered by additional fiscal stimulus.
What we have learned is there are many moving parts and offsets in our business model in this environment.
If the pandemic intensifies, our direct costs may be below our historical trends as we experienced this year, but growth may suffer.
Conversely, if the pandemic is mitigated or under control, direct costs may be elevated, but growth may accelerate as an offset.
What I do know with the degree of certainty today is, we have an amazing organization with the necessary curiosity and brainpower to provide the agility and capability to manage through a crisis and come out with impressive results for shareholders clients and other stakeholders.
This year we have demonstrated the depth and breadth of our competence and level of care for our clients to execute on matters within our control, along with inspiring ingenuity and resourcefulness to respond to unexpected events.
We are certainly pleased with our 2020 results today and our outlook for the balance of the year and we look ahead with confidence in the future whatever we face next year.
At this time, I'd like to pass the call back to Doug.
Now let me provide our guidance for the fourth quarter and an update for the full year of 2020.
As you're aware, there continues to be uncertainty as to duration and the conditions of the pandemic and the trajectory of the economy.
The current political environment and the timing and details of any further government stimulus add to this uncertainty.
We have taken this into account when providing our financial guidance over the remainder of 2020 and we will be considering these factors in our budgeting process for the upcoming year.
We typically do not provide formal guidance for the upcoming year at this time and, therefore, we'll consider any further developments in these areas and the outcome of our year-end selling and renewal season [Phonetic] when providing 2021 guidance in our next earnings call.
Now based upon the details that Paul just shared, we continue to expect sequential worksite employee growth over the remainder of 2020.
For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting average paid worksite employees in a range of 236,500 to 238,500, a sequential increase of 2% to 3% over Q3 of 2020.
This equates to an expected decrease in average paid worksite employees of only 1% for the full year 2020 in the face of significant challenges for the small business community caused by the pandemic and its impact on the economy.
With an improved outlook for Q4 worksite employee growth, our current pricing strength and a range around expectations in our direct cost programs, particularly our benefits program, we're now forecasting Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $30 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.38.
When combined with our Q3 outperformance, we're raising our full year 2020 earnings guidance and now forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $271 million to $281 million, an increase of 8% to 12% when compared to 2019.
As for full year 2020 adjusted EPS, we are now forecasting a range of $4.35 to $4.53, up from our previous guidance of $3.67 to $4.04.
","In Q3 2020, the company achieved an adjusted EPS of $0.91, a 21% increase over Q3 2019, and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase. Growth in worksite employee volume and pricing, along with lower-than-expected direct costs, contributed to the outperformance. As the pandemic eased, businesses began rehiring, resulting in a rebound in paid worksite employees. Client retention remained high at 99%, despite economic pressures. The company's financial position remains strong, with increased adjusted cash and a $130 million remaining credit facility availability. The company continues to invest in its sales force, develop new products, and respond to the changing needs of clients. For Q4, the company forecasts an adjusted EBITDA of $21-$30 million and adjusted EPS of $0.20-$0.38, driven by continued worksite employee growth, strong pricing, and manageable direct costs. The full-year 2020 guidance is now adjusted EBITDA of $271 million-$281 million (an increase of 8%-12%) and adjusted EPS of $4.35-$4.53."
WOR_q1_2022.txt,"On our call today, we have Andy Rose, Worthington's President and Chief Executive Officer and Joe Hayek, Worthington's Chief Financial Officer.
Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later on our worthingtonindustries.com website.
Today we'll be sharing our results consistent with our new reporting segments for the first time.
We believe the new structure will provide greater insights into the underlying performance of our businesses.
We had a strong start to our fiscal year, reporting earnings of $2.55 a share in Q1 versus $11.22 in the prior-year quarter.
Excluding restructuring and one-time items, we generated a record $2.46 per share in earnings in Q1 compared to $0.64 in the prior-year quarter.
During the quarter, we recognized a net after-tax restructuring gain of $5 million or $0.09 a share primarily related to the sale of a shuttered facility owned by our WSP joint venture.
That compares to restructuring and impairment charges of $0.16 a share a year ago.
In addition, the prior-year results included a net benefit of $10.74 per share related to our investment in Nikola Corporation.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.1 billion were up significantly compared to $703 million in Q1 of last year.
The improvement was primarily due to higher steel prices combined with increased volumes across most of our segments.
Gross profit for the quarter increased to $219 million from $113 million a year ago and our gross margin increased to 19.7% from 16.1%.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 was a record $196 million, up from $75 million in Q1 of last year and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is now $604 million.
In Steel Processing net sales of $823 million nearly doubled from $431 million in Q1 of last year due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes.
Total shipped tons were up 14% from last year's first quarter when demand was just beginning to recover from COVID-related shutdowns, particularly at our automotive customers.
Direct tons in Q1 were 49% of mix, which was consistent with the prior-year quarter.
We continue to see solid demand across nearly all of our major end markets, including automotive, construction, heavy truck and agriculture.
Despite the solid demand and year-over-year growth, automotive shipments could have been better, if not for the continuing semiconductor-related slowdowns.
Everything we see suggest that while consumer and fleet demand for new cars remain strong, chip shortages will persist for the next several quarters and our automotive demand will be subject to some uncertainty as a result.
The demand is clearly there.
It would likely just take some time for the semiconductor shortage to resolve itself.
Our teams continue to do a terrific job navigating unprecedented market conditions while remaining laser-focused on the needs of our customers.
In the current quarter, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $108 million and adjusted EBIT margin of 13% compared to $14 million and 3% in Q1 of last year.
The large year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased demand, higher spreads and arbitrage gains.
In the quarter, we had pre-tax inventory holding gains estimated to be $47 million or $0.68 per share compared to holding losses of $7 million or $0.09 a share in Q1 of last year.
Based on current steel prices, we expect inventory holding gains again in Q2, but we will also continue to see the impact of the widening scrap gap.
In Consumer Products, net sales in Q1 were $148 million, up 10.6% from the prior-year quarter.
Legacy consumer products revenues were up slightly and the inclusion of sales from GTI, which was acquired in January, drove the balance of the growth.
EBIT for the consumer business was $21 million and EBIT margin was 14%, down from $24 million and 18% in the prior-year quarter.
The decrease in EBIT was due to higher labor and input costs.
Our consumer business has some longer fixed-price contracts with customers, which can create a short-term drag on margins when input rises -- when input prices rise as rapidly as they have.
These dynamics are typically short term and we do expect margins to improve moving forward.
Building Products generated net sales of $115 million in Q1, which was up 30% from $88 million in the prior-year quarter.
Increase was due primarily to higher volumes as the prior-year quarter was impacted by COVID-related disruptions.
Building Products EBIT was $49 million and EBIT margin was 42%, up significantly from $23.4 million and 27% in Q1 of last year.
We saw significant growth year-over-year in our wholly owned Building Products businesses but the majority of the upside was driven by strong results at WAVE and ClarkDietrich that contributed $26 million and $17 million respectively in equity earnings.
WAVE and ClarkDietrich both had better demand environments than in Q1 of last year and all of our teams in Building Products are doing an excellent job managing dynamic supply chains and continuing to execute in challenging conditions.
In Sustainable Energy Solutions net sales in Q1 were $25 million, down from $28 million in the prior-year quarter.
Largest end market for this business is transportation and the semiconductor chip shortage created a headwind for them with respect to demand.
In addition, the economy in Europe is recovering, but very slowly.
The business reported a negative EBIT of $3 million in the current period as volumes were too low to absorb fixed costs.
We remain very excited about this business and its prospects over the long term as its innovative products and solutions are poised to grow quickly serving hydrogen ecosystem and adjacent sustainable energies like compressed natural gas.
With respect to cash flows in our balance sheet, operations used cash of $50 million in the quarter, which was driven by $149 million increase in working capital, primarily associated with higher steel prices along with annual accrued compensation being paid out during the quarter.
Absent further increases in steel prices, we would expect the significant working capital increases to subside in the next quarter or two.
During the quarter, we received $20 million in dividends from our unconsolidated JVs, received $27 million in proceeds from asset sales, completed one acquisition for $105 million, invested $24 million in capital projects, paid $15 million in dividends and spent $61 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our common stock.
Following the Q1 purchases, we have 8.3 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
Looking at our balance sheet and our liquidity position.
Funded debt at quarter end of $706 million was relatively flat sequentially and interest expense of $8 million was in line with the prior-year quarter.
Ended Q1 with $399 million in cash and we continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation focused on growth and on returning capital to shareholders.
Earlier today, the Board declared a $0.28 per share dividend for the quarter, which is payable in December 2021.
It's great to start fiscal '22 with another record performance.
However, the operating environment remains quite challenging with the continued rise in steel prices, supply chain issues in steel and other components and the continuing labor shortage.
Our people continue to showcase their commitment by going the extra mile to ensure that we are working safe and doing their best to meet our customers' needs.
Demand levels are good across almost all of our end markets and backlogs remain at elevated levels.
We continue to raise prices in many of our product lines to offset rising input costs, particularly steel.
Higher working capital needs had a meaningful impact on free cash flow this quarter, but this will reverse if steel prices begin to decline as we expect in coming quarters.
This is the first quarter reporting our three new operating segments, Consumer Products, Building Products, and Sustainable Energy Solutions.
Hopefully you will find, as we believe, that each of these segments is an attractive business with unique advantages and compelling strategies to grow for years to come.
We will continue to leverage our transformation playbook, new product development and innovation and M&A to drive above-market growth and higher returns on capital.
While our innovation and M&A growth initiatives continue across the portfolio, the M&A environment is proving challenging with elevated purchase multiples and difficult earnings analysis due to the unpredictability of the COVID environment.
To the extent we do find compelling targets, our balance sheet remains strong with significant cash and borrowing capacity.
Finally, we just published our second corporate citizenship and sustainability report.
Since our inception, we have worked hard to be a good corporate citizen for all of our constituencies and in our communities, as well as to minimize our environmental footprint.
While we are a relatively clean manufacturing operation overall, in 2012 we started our successful GreenStar initiative that aims to recognize our manufacturing facilities for environmental conservation and stewardship.
In fiscal '21, 64% of our facilities achieved a four or five star performance rating.
We are working toward an even more robust approach to reducing our environmental footprint and expect to have more details in the future regarding our goals.
It is often difficult to follow a record year but we were off to a fast start and our teams remain focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and creating value for our shareholders.
We'll now take any questions.
","Worthington Industries had a strong Q1 with earnings of $2.55 per share, excluding restructuring and one-time items resulting in record earnings of $2.46 per share compared to $0.64 in the prior year. Consolidated sales increased significantly to $1.1 billion driven by higher steel prices and increased volume. Adjusted EBITDA reached a record $196 million, up from $75 million in Q1 2020. Steel processing net sales nearly doubled to $823 million due to increased demand across various end markets, including automotive, construction, and agriculture. Consumer Products sales increased by 10.6% to $148 million with strong growth from the acquisition of GTI. Building Products net sales climbed 30% to $115 million led by strong results from WAVE and ClarkDietrich. Sustainable Energy Solutions reported a net loss due to lower demand caused by semiconductor chip shortages and the slow economic recovery in Europe. Worthington remains optimistic about the business's long-term prospects. The company declared a dividend of $0.28 per share, continues to focus on growth and returning capital to shareholders, and aims to minimize its environmental footprint."
SNV_q3_2020.txt,"Kessel Stelling, chairman and chief executive officer, will begin the call.
He will be followed by Jamie Gregory, chief financial officer; and Kevin Blair, president and chief operating officer.
During the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance.
And now here's Kessel Stelling.
Just last month, six months, after converting to drive-through appointment only, our retail branch network reopened to walk-in customers.
Although things are far from back to normal, we're fundamentally a relationship bank, and I've enjoyed so much hearing from our front-line team members who take such pride and pleasure in serving our customers in person, even if it's across a plexiglass barrier or from a distance of six feet.
Our team's response to this ongoing pandemic continues to demonstrate what's unique about this company, our culture of service, our focus on customers and communities, our adaptability in changing circumstances and our ability to execute.
All of those, along with continued economic recovery contributed to our strong performance in the third quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 per share compared to $0.57 last quarter and $0.83 a year ago.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.89 per share compared to $0.23 last quarter and $0.97 a year ago.
The primary difference between reported and adjusted figures for the quarter was a $0.30 per share impact from a goodwill impairment of our mortgage reporting unit that Jamie will detail shortly.
Period-end loan balances of $39.5 billion were down $364 million from the prior quarter, with commercial loan growth partially offsetting declines in the consumer portfolio.
1% of loans had a full principal and interest deferral at the end of the quarter, down from 15% in May.
Total deposits of $44.7 billion were up $471 million from the prior quarter.
Broad-based core transaction deposit growth of $1.6 billion allowed us to accelerate our deposit pricing and remixing strategy, which led to stable net interest income at $377 million.
The net interest margin declined three basis points to 3.10%, slightly better than we expected as headwinds from student loan sales and bond portfolio repositioning completed in the second quarter were partially offset by the favorable trends in deposit pricing and remixing.
Adjusted non-interest revenue of $116 million was strong, up $20 million from the prior quarter.
The improvement was led by quarter-over-quarter increases in net mortgage revenues of $8 million and core banking fees of $5 million.
Adjusted non-interest expense of $269 million was down $8 million from the prior quarter, led by an improvement of $5 million in employment expenses.
Provision for credit losses of $43 million were down $98 million from the prior quarter.
The ACL ratio increased six basis points to 1.80%, excluding P3 balances.
The past due NPA and net charge-off ratios remained relatively stable.
The CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 9.3%, following strong core performance in the settlement of transactions we executed in the second quarter.
The total risk-based capital ratio increased 46 basis points to 13.16%, the highest level since 2014.
Jamie will now share more detail about the quarter.
Before moving to Slide 4, I'd like to provide an update on goodwill.
We have been conducting evaluations of goodwill in response to market volatility and expectations for a lower for longer interest rate environment referenced by the FOMC in August.
As a result, there has been a goodwill impairment for our mortgage reporting unit of $45 million.
This is a noncash charge that has no impact to cash, liquidity, tangible book value or regulatory capital ratios.
Beginning on Slide 4.
Total loans declined $364 million in the third quarter as commercial loan growth helped offset reductions from P3 loan payoffs of $77 million and strategic asset dispositions of single service loans.
Excluding the impact of asset dispositions and P3 payoffs, we had net loan growth of $245 million in the quarter.
Commercial loans, excluding P3 balances, increased $291 million.
Although pipelines are lower than they were pre-COVID, we continue to see demand, especially in middle market businesses and our higher growth and higher opportunity markets, such as Atlanta, Birmingham and South Florida.
Consumer loans declined $578 million, led by the disposition of roughly $185 million of non-relationship mortgages, along with continued declines in our lending partnership portfolios.
Additionally, a portion of the decline can be attributed to the continuation of our GreenSky strategy, which we highlighted last quarter, and which to some degree, is offset by an increase in balances within our held-for-sale portfolio.
While we will continue to evaluate opportunities to efficiently manage our balance sheet, there are currently no existing plans for material dispositions, such as those we made the last two quarters.
We expect loans, excluding the impact of P3 forgiveness, to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter.
As shown on Slide 5, we had total deposit growth of $471 million.
More importantly, we're continuing to strategically reposition the portfolio.
Broad based core transaction deposit growth of $1.6 billion offset the strategic declines in time deposits of $1.2 billion and broker deposits of $381 million.
We estimate approximately $2.3 billion or 80% of deposit balances associated with P3 loans remained on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.
The cost of deposits fell by 14 basis points from the previous quarter to 39 basis points due to a combination of rates paid and deposit remixing.
For context, this compares to a low of 26 basis points in the third quarter of 2014.
We continue to believe there are further opportunities to reduce deposit costs through CD turnover, repricing and remixing.
These activities in an environment of lower for longer interest rates, combined with strong growth in core customer deposits, should allow us to get our total deposit cost to the 26 basis point lows of the prior cycle.
Slide 6 shows net interest income of $377 million, stable from the previous quarter and included $12 million in fee accretion from our P3 loan portfolio.
There are $74 million of P3 processing fees remaining.
Earlier this month, the SBA announced a streamlined forgiveness process for certain P3 loans of $50,000 or less.
Approximately 7% of our P3 balances fall within this threshold.
There is approximately $10 million in fees associated with these loans, which will be accelerated when we receive the forgiveness proceeds.
Net interest margin was 3.10%, down three basis points from the previous quarter.
Consistent with our expectations, the current level of interest rates, combined with a nine-basis-point headwind from bond repositioning and student loan sales executed in the second quarter, put downward pressure on NII and NIM in the third quarter.
However, these headwinds were partially offset by a handful of factors, including further declines in deposit pricing and favorable deposit remixing trends.
Our guidance from the previous quarter largely remains the same, and we continue to expect modest downward pressure on NIM as the repricing within our fixed rate asset portfolio is partially offset by continued declines in overall deposit costs and further improvements in managing liquidity costs.
Excluding the potential impacts from P3 forgiveness, we expect NII and NIM will decrease slightly in the fourth quarter.
It was another strong quarter for non-interest revenue, which is shown on Slide 7.
Core banking revenue improved by $5 million from the second quarter, primarily due to increased transaction activity as most components are gradually returning to pre-COVID levels.
Net mortgage revenue of $31 million remained elevated, primarily due to increase in secondary revenues driven by higher loan sales and gain on sale.
Secondary mortgage production was $654 million in the third quarter, which is an increase of $19 million or 3% from the second quarter's record production.
We continue to see positive momentum in other fiduciary service business, including brokerage and trust.
Assets under management of $17.5 billion grew 6% from the previous quarter.
Other income for the quarter included a valuation adjustment for tax credits and gained from the previously mentioned mortgage portfolio sales.
In the fourth quarter, we expect stable revenues from core banking fees, fiduciary services and capital markets income.
We expect to see declines in mortgage revenue and other income.
Slide 8 includes non-interest expenses, which were $317 million or $269 million adjusted.
Adjustments include $3 million in restructuring charges, primarily related to branch optimization, as well as the $45 million goodwill impairment previously discussed.
This goodwill impairment is limited to the mortgage reporting unit and results from a combination of factors, including the extended duration of lower market valuations, high volumes and refinancings that have reduced mortgage yields and the clarity around longer term policy actions designed to keep interest rates low.
Total employment expenses were $5 million less than the previous quarter, primarily due to lower commissions, lower headcount and reduced COVID-related staffing expenses.
Total COVID-related expenses for the quarter were minimal.
We expect further headcount reductions in the fourth quarter as part of the normal attrition and a voluntary retirement offer we recently extended.
The voluntary retirement offer is expected to result in a onetime fourth-quarter expense of approximately $14 million and have a two-year payback.
These savings are part of the Synovus forward initiatives and will help offset expected increases to other line items such as travel and advertising in 2021 as banking activity returns closer to normal.
We continue to focus on what we can control, which includes prudent expense management.
Excluding the upfront expenses associated with Synovus Forward initiatives, we expect adjusted NIE in the fourth quarter will be in line with the third quarter.
Key credit metrics are on Slide 9.
There were slight increases in NPA, NPL and past due ratios from the previous quarter, but we currently do not see widespread deterioration in the portfolio.
Our comprehensive reviews have largely isolated the elevated risks to certain segments, including hotels and full service restaurants, and we continue to work with borrowers who have been most negatively impacted by the pandemic.
Provision for credit losses of $43 million includes net charge-offs of $28 million or 29 basis points.
Downgrades in the hotel portfolio, one of the hardest hit industries, accounted for $603 million of the increase in criticized and classified loans.
There were $125 million in hotel loans that had principal and interest deferrals at the end of the quarter, which represents about 8% of the total hotel portfolio.
Our latest economic outlook includes an unemployment rate of about 8% as of year-end before declining modestly in 2021.
This, along with credit migration and other portfolio activity resulted in an allowance for credit losses of $665 million, up $15 million from the previous quarter.
The allowance for credit loss ratio increased six basis points to 1.8%, excluding P3 loans.
The amount of provision for credit losses going forward will continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors, including economic outlook, loan growth, loan mix, risk rate migration, as well as the timing and impact of future government stimulus.
Heightened levels of uncertainty and those factors could result in reductions of allowance less than net charge-offs.
As the outlook becomes more stable and uncertainty declines, we expect changes in allowance to rely more heavily on the traditional factors previously mentioned.
Preliminary capital ratios on Slide 10 continued to build from a combination of earnings and balance sheet activities completed over the past several months.
These balance sheet activities include the settlement of our second-quarter bond repositioning and our ongoing efforts to reduce single service loan portfolios as we prioritize our balance sheet for core client relationships.
CET1 increased 40 basis points to 9.3% this quarter, that's an increase of 35 basis points from the end of 2019 and was accomplished while increasing the reserve by $382 million.
The total risk-based capital ratio of 13.16%, up 46 basis points from the second quarter was the highest since 2014.
We remain focused on supporting our overall capital position and are targeting the higher end of our CET1 operating range of nine to nine and a half percent, given the heightened uncertainty in the current economic environment.
We expect core earnings will continue to support our capital position and allow us to achieve our strategic objectives, with consideration for our anticipated balance sheet growth and the payout objectives we've outlined previously.
As a reminder, we do not expect any share repurchases for the rest of the year.
I'd like to begin on Slide 11 with an update on deferments.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $337 million in loans on a full principal and interest deferral, which was less than 1% of total loans.
The aggregate amount in deferment was well below the 3 to 5% range we estimated last quarter and down significantly from the 15% we referenced in our first quarter 10-Q filing.
We attribute the lower P&I deferral activity this quarter to the strength of our borrowers and improving economic environment and support provided through various government stimulus programs.
Of the $337 million in deferment at the end of the quarter, 50%, or $169 million were in the consumer book.
These were predominantly consumer mortgage loans, which are largely comprised of physician and private wealth customers.
The $169 million in deferments represents approximately 2% of total consumer loans.
Commercial deferments as of 9/30 were $168 million, or 54 basis points of the total commercial portfolio.
Full P&I deferments were largely concentrated in the hotel and full-service restaurant segments, which comprise 85%, or $143 million of commercial deferments at the end of the quarter.
We have not only seen a significant reduction in the level of deferments.
We are also seeing strong performance from those that have exited a deferral status.
94% have made a payment, while another 5 to 6% have not had a payment due or were in a grace period at the end of the quarter.
Only approximately 20 basis points of loans that exited a deferral status were past due are moved to nonaccrual status at the end of the third quarter.
In addition to the full P&I deferment program, we have continued to work with other borrowers who have been impacted during the current crisis to provide flexibility in payment terms, which may include modifications such as interest only or amortization extensions.
Inclusive of these modifications, we estimate that total loans with accommodations, as of the end of September, remained below 3%, which was at the low end of the range we projected last quarter for full P&I deferrals.
Moving to Slide 12 and the COVID-sensitive industries.
We shared on the second-quarter earnings call, a second round deferral estimate for each of these industries.
Consistent with the loan portfolio in aggregate, these industries also had a lower than estimated level of P&I deferments at the end of the third quarter.
As we mentioned on the previous slide, the hotel and full-service restaurant segment had a total of $143 million with a full principal and interest deferment as of 9/30, well below the original estimates.
The hotel industry continues to be a segment that has been hit the hardest by the change in customer behaviors, which was reflected in the downgrades Jamie mentioned earlier.
But the vast majority of our portfolio continues to pay as agreed.
Despite the results to date, we continue to closely manage and monitor this portfolio as we do not see the normalized return of revenues in the near term.
We have, however, conducted in-depth reviews of the loans in the hotel portfolio.
And from a longer-term perspective, we feel that we are very well positioned in several ways.
These include low loan-to-value, high-quality hotel properties with great brands and sponsorship from guarantors with strong liquidity.
As it relates to the restaurant industry, we have seen signs of recovery since the reopening efforts of April and May.
Quick service and fast casual restaurants in our portfolio have largely recovered based upon our cash inflow data, and in some cases, are outperforming pre-COVID levels.
Synovus has $365 million of full-service restaurants, and using our portfolio cash inflow data, we estimate they are operating at an average of 85% of revenue compared to the prior year.
There were $18 million of full-service restaurant deferrals at the end of the third quarter.
It is worth noting that we do not have any shopping center customers in a second round deferral.
While we continue to closely monitor this portfolio, our customers have experienced improving rent collections during the last quarter, overall, due largely to the strength of the grocery pharmacy, discount and home improvement segments.
We are also seeing stronger recovery in in-line service provider tenants that alleviate much of the concern from spring and early summer.
Retail trade, art, entertainment and recreation, as well as oil-related industries also had no deferments in the second round, and we continue to be optimistic as to the ability for our customers to weather the short-term cash flow reductions experienced during the economic shutdown.
While the deferral trends are extremely positive to this point, we are keenly aware, additionally mandated closings from COVID surges in our markets would have the potential of impacting cash flows and would affect these segments more quickly and severely.
Therefore, we will continue to closely monitor and manage our exposure within these industries.
Moving to Slide 13.
It provides an update on our portfolio's cash inflows, consistent with what we shared on last quarter's call.
The graph shows continued improvement in year-over-year cash inflows, which serve as a proxy for revenues.
During the third quarter, we saw the portfolio year-over-year inflows improve from being down 6% in June to being up 3% in July and then settling in essentially flat with the prior year in August.
These results are largely consistent with various industry metrics, as well as the conversations we're having with our customers throughout our footprint.
In addition to cash flow improvements, we have also seen our customers making the necessary adjustments within their expense bases to further reduce the impact that crisis is having on their bottom line.
We've included trends for some of the industries that were considered to be more sensitive to COVID, including accommodations, retail trade, food services and other services.
Results in these segments show consistent trending with the portfolio as a whole, but also note the differing impact within industry segment, which has served as the basis for many of the K-shaped recovery scenarios that had been developed and discussed more recently.
We continue to use this data to inform our bankers, as well as support our COVID specific deferment and portfolio management programs.
As I close out my section, let me transition to a business and Synovus Forward update, which we've highlighted on Slide 14.
We have maintained three primary focuses on the business front in 2020.
Number one, proactively manage the credit environment through the current economic downturn.
As I've shared on the previous slides, we feel good about our progress and results to date in this area.
Number two, utilize our relationship banking approach to continue to serve our customers, expand share of wallet and attract new relationships.
Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, we have continued to drive core loan, deposit and assets under management growth, while improving service levels and adding new technology to support our customers' changing needs.
Throughout 2020, we have accelerated the deployment of new digital tools and capabilities with enhanced servicing and online origination functionality, with the overarching goal of making it easier to do business with us, as well as the changing business dynamics associated with COVID.
Digital user enrollment is up 10% year to date, and we've experienced a 30% increase in the number of deposits being handled outside of our branch network.
We have achieved this success as we partner with existing and new fintechs to efficiently and effectively deliver these enhanced capabilities.
We fully recognize and remain committed that when we get to the other side of the current challenges we face, we want to be even better positioned to grow and win in our marketplace.
And that brings me to the third area of focus, Synovus Forward, we remain focused on the execution of this program to drive incremental efficiencies and sources of new revenue now and in the years to come.
Our original financial objective of an incremental $100 million of pre-tax income remains the baseline for execution.
We are beginning to realize the benefit of several of these initiatives while we kick off additional initiatives that will have 2021 deliverables and run rate benefits.
As we progress with these, we will continue to update and fine-tune the size and timing of the benefits.
On the expense front, we are executing on the $25 million third-party spend program with work streams continuing to be implemented through the early part of 2021.
Our plan for 13 branch closures in 2020 remains on track with additional back office real estate consolidation planned for 2021.
We are also in flight with our overall organizational efficiency program.
This program is a comprehensive portfolio consisting of many initiatives that will deliver reductions in personnel and other expenses, as well as cost avoidance and additional areas throughout the remainder of 2020 and 2021.
Execution on these initiatives are under way, as Jamie noted, the reduction in headcount during the third quarter.
Another example of progress is the voluntary retirement program, which we announced during the third quarter and will largely be completed in the fourth.
As Jamie mentioned, it is expected to have a onetime charge of approximately $14 million and have an earn-back period of less than two years.
We will continue to update and provide further details as we execute on the overall organizational efficiency program, and we remain confident in our ability to generate up to $65 million in savings overall.
As we previously noted, we will continuously evaluate the underlying economic environment to gauge the size and the timing of our overall expense management program.
While we've been more focused on the efficiency initiatives out of the gate, we are progressing with revenue opportunities that were identified during the diagnostic phase with continued confidence in the pre-tax income range of 35 to $55 million.
We have kicked off our pricing for value and customer analytics work streams.
These initiatives have the potential to begin creating revenue enhancement in 2021 through the repricing of solutions and products, as well as enhancing tools and capabilities to improve sales and retention efforts.
The dedicated teams leading these efforts are adjusting and enhancing the program on a continuous basis.
As we complete the programs and the execution and in-flight phases, we have additional initiatives that will commence, which are all part of our longer-term strategic road map and change management plans.
Before we move to Q&A, Slide 15 highlights a few accomplishments from the quarter that we believe are just as important as the numbers we've reviewed today.
I'll not cover each one in detail, but just to summarize, we expanded the talent and expertise of our already strong and diverse board.
We were named by Forbes as the best employer for women.
We celebrated as two of our senior-most female leaders in our executive and board levels were recognized for their contributions to our company and our industry.
And we formed a council comprised of some of our most senior African-American leaders to ensure accountability for continued progress in promoting racial equality.
We made significant investments in education, including donating $1 million to the United Negro College Fund to provide scholarships for African American students, who want to attend historically black colleges and universities or other higher learning institutions across our five state footprint.
We've continued supporting our communities through increased outreach and financial investments as organizations, schools, individuals, families and entire communities face unprecedented challenges, and we continue to deliver financial education across the footprint through our now virtual Raise the Banner program.
And finally, we've remained active participants in multiple CARES Act stimulus programs to help our customers recover sooner rather than later.
We're proud of these actions, and we believe they reflect our deep sense of responsibility for leading and strengthening the communities we serve.
","Synovus Financial Corporation reported strong third-quarter results, demonstrating adaptability and resilience amid the ongoing pandemic. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $0.89. An impairment charge of $45 million led to the difference between reported and adjusted figures. The company experienced net loan growth of $245 million, partially offset by asset dispositions and P3 loan payoffs. Total deposits increased by $471 million, with core transaction deposit growth allowing for strategic deposit pricing and remixing, which resulted in stable net interest income of $377 million. Adjusted non-interest revenue of $116 million was up from the previous quarter, primarily due to increased net mortgage revenues and core banking fees. Adjusted non-interest expense declined by $8 million, led by lower employment expenses. The provision for credit losses was $43 million, down from the prior quarter. Key credit metrics remained relatively stable, with past due NPA and net charge-off ratios remaining unchanged. Strong cash inflows and positive industry trends indicate a gradual recovery in the portfolio. Synovus Forward initiatives are underway to drive efficiency and generate new revenue streams, with the goal of realizing $100 million in incremental pre-tax income. The company plans to continue prudent expense management and earnings growth, supporting its capital position and strategic objectives."
CBT_q4_2020.txt,"Last night we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica McLaughlin will review the business segment and corporate financial details.
I want to begin by recognizing our employees around the world for their continued commitment to the Company, to our customers, and to their community.
Managing through this pandemic has challenged us on every front, and I have never been more proud of our team.
As we manage through this pandemic, we established a set of guiding principles here at Cabot to protect the house first and prepare ourselves to be ready to win as the recovery takes hold.
I believe our performance to date reflects that balance.
For the quarter, total segment EBIT was $84 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.75 on a sequential basis.
This result was driven principally by improved results in Reinforcement Materials, which recovered nicely as demand in our key end markets increased sharply as compared to the third quarter.
Performance Chemicals results also improved in the quarter, as automotive-related demand began a recovery and our self-help initiatives took hold.
In Purification Solutions, we took another step forward in our transformation plan with the sale of our mine and the structuring of a long-term supply agreement for activated carbon with ADES, which better positions us to serve the mercury removal market.
We continued our intense focus on cash generation, delivering $99 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and $248 million for the second half, well ahead of our previously communicated expectation of $200 million of operating cash flow in the back half of the year.
Erica will go into more detail on the segment results a bit later in the call.
I would first like to share my perspective on the full fiscal year 2020 results.
There is no doubt this fiscal 2020 was the year unlike any other we've experienced, as we battle the global public health crisis and the associated economic fallout.
The global pandemic severely affected demand from our key tire and automotive customers, especially in the third fiscal quarter and that impact was reflected in our full-year results.
On the performance front, we delivered adjusted earnings per share $2.08.
While this result was well below prior levels and the earnings potential of the Company, I am very pleased with how we managed through the crisis and I believe the strength of Cabot was revealed.
Our strong balance sheet and cash generation power and our experienced management team allowed us to navigate the pandemic, while remaining focused on our advancing the core strategy.
As you know, our strategy is built on three pillars: first, investing for growth in our core businesses; second, driving application innovation with our customers; and finally, generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization.
In the Reinforcement Materials segment, the team did a great job delivering necessary price increases in our calendar year 2020 customer agreements, implementing new commercial terms to manage feedstock volatility and delivering cost reductions to partially offset the pandemic-driven demand reduction.
In the Performance Chemicals segment, the team was focused on self-help measures and laying the groundwork to restore profitability to historical levels.
In the year, we successfully implemented price increases in specialty carbons to offset the impact of higher MARPOL-related feedstock costs.
The segment also executed on a number of strategic priorities during the year.
We closed on the acquisition of Shenzhen Sanshun Nano, a leading producer of carbon nanotubes and formulations for the high-growth lithium-ion battery market, and customer qualifications in inkjet packaging applications continue to build momentum.
In the Purification Solutions segment, we closed on the sale of our lignite mine in Marshall, Texas to ADES and entered into a long-term supply agreement for lignite-activated carbon.
This transaction improves our efficiency while also removing a significant hurdle to divestiture of the business.
While the earnings environment was challenging, we remain intensely focused on cash flow generation and balance sheet strength.
During the year, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $377 million and free cash flow of $177 million, largely through tight working capital management.
The strong cash flow generation allowed us to repay debt, maintain our dividend, fund the Sanshun acquisition along with our capex commitments and retain our investment-grade credit rating.
And finally, ESG leadership has been a focus of ours for a long time and it is becoming ever more important to our stakeholders.
We recently launched our updated 2025 sustainability goals, which build on our existing leadership position.
By expanding our goals beyond a strict environmental focus to include areas such as product development, supplier sustainability, diversity and inclusion and community involvement, we believe all stakeholders will participate in our success.
Overall, I'm extremely proud of our team, and I believe we are well positioned and ready to win as the recovery takes hold.
Now, turning to an update on the current business environment.
We see underlying trends in both tire and automotive demand strengthening with month-on-month improvement continuing through October and into November.
The economic recovery is unquestionably linked to stabilizing the public health crisis and this remains the key to bringing consumer confidence and the economy back to its full potential.
China is a good example of where COVID transmission has remained low and the economy is strengthening with GDP up 5% year-over-year in the September quarter.
Looking at our key end markets, the trend is positive.
Automotive production represents approximately 25% of our sales, ranging from tires on new cars to a host of applications in Performance Chemicals, such as structural adhesives, batteries, coatings and plastics.
External forecasting firms report light vehicle auto production down 3% year-over-year globally in the September 2020 quarter, as compared to a decline of 43% in the June quarter.
Current industry forecast calls for an 18% drop in global auto builds for the full year, including a small decrease of 3% for the December quarter.
Now, moving to tire production.
Global replacement tire industry sales are now expected to decline 12% for the full calendar year of 2020 based on estimates from LMC.
Light vehicle replacement tire sales improved in all regions in the September quarter, down only 6% year-over-year, compared to a decline of 31% in the June quarter.
As with auto production, the December quarter is expected to approach 2019 levels with total replacement tire sales projected to be down 2% year-over-year according to LMC.
Building on the V-shaped recovery in the September quarter, we continue to see consistent improvement in terms of mobility and miles driven, and this bodes well for the replacement demand of tires, both in terms of passenger vehicles, as well as truck and bus.
As a reminder, the replacement tire market has historically been more resilient compared to other parts of the broader transportation sector.
I will start with discussing results in the Reinforcement Materials segment.
Given the global economic environment, the Reinforcement Materials segment delivered strong operating results with EBIT down $12 million, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2019, but up $64 million sequentially, driven by improved global tire and automotive demand as compared to our third fiscal quarter.
The decrease in EBIT from the prior year was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher margins.
Globally, volumes declined by a 11% in the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period of the prior year, largely due to the impact of COVID and demand in Europe, the Americas, Japan and Southeast Asia.
Higher margins were driven by improved China pricing and higher pricing outside of China in our calendar year 2020 tire customer contracts.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2021, we expect an increase in EBIT due to our expectation for expanded unit margins.
This is driven by a continued sequential improvement from pricing in Asia as the market continues to recover.
Volumes are expected to remain in line with fourth quarter levels, as strength from the recovery offsets normal seasonal patterns.
Now, turning to Performance Chemicals.
EBIT increased by $4 million, as compared to the third fiscal quarter, driven by higher demand in automotive-related applications.
EBIT decreased by $16 million year-over-year, primarily due to 9% lower volumes in our Formulated Solutions business from the impact of COVID-19, a more competitive pricing environment in our fumed metal oxides product line, and a weaker product mix in our specialty carbons and fumed metal products -- metal oxides product lines from lower demand in automotive applications.
In the fourth quarter, volumes increased 2% year-over-year in Performance Additives, driven by increased volumes related to our recent energy materials acquisition.
Sequentially, Performance Additives volumes increased 3% and Formulated Solutions volumes increased by 1%, while we are pleased to see the sequential improvement in volumes, segment volumes continue to be impacted by the pandemic, particularly in demand for automotive and construction applications.
While the infrastructure end market, including wire and cable and pipe applications continue to hold up well in all regions.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect a material sequential step up in EBIT, driven by higher volumes across the major product lines as our key end markets continue to recover and as we leverage the recovery in the automotive end market to drive product mix improvement in specialty carbons and compounds.
We also expect to see a price improvement as the segment benefits from actions to restore pricing in our fumed metal oxides business and as we execute higher prices in specialty carbons to offset rising environmental costs.
Moving to Purification Solutions, EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased by $3 million, compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
The decrease was driven by lower volumes in the mercury removal applications and the unfavorable impact from reducing inventory levels to drive improved cash flow results.
Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a sequential volume decline driven by lower seasonal volumes in water and mercury removal applications and higher fixed costs due to a maintenance outage at one of our plants.
This is expected to be partially offset by lower depreciation and fixed costs due to the recently announced supply agreement and mine sale.
I will now turn to corporate items.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $151 million and our liquidity position remains strong at $1.4 billion.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, cash flow from operating activities were $99 million, including a decrease in net working capital of $7 million.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were $38 million, an additional uses of cash during the fourth quarter included $20 million for dividends.
During fiscal 2020 we generated $377 million of cash flow from operations, including a decrease in working capital of $185 million.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2020 were $200 million, which included both our targeted growth investments and the spend related to the North American EPA compliance.
Additional uses of cash during the fiscal year included $80 million for dividends and $44 million for share repurchases.
During the fourth quarter, the operating tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was 28% and we anticipate our operating tax rate for fiscal '21 to be in the range of 28% to 30%.
We expect capital expenditures to be between $175 million and $200 million in 2021 and this estimate includes continued EPA-related compliance spend and capital related to upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty products.
As we look ahead to 2021 I expect that it will be another dynamic year and we'll have to manage any future impacts from the pandemic in much the same way as we did in 2020.
Notwithstanding the challenges of COVID-19, we remain focused on executing our strategy and I would like to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.
First, we will stay close with our customers to support their evolving needs and continue to differentiate Cabot through our product quality, service reliability and commitment to sustainability.
Second, we will continue to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, particularly energy materials, E2C and inkjet for packaging.
We are excited about the growth potential of these businesses and we have sustained our investment throughout this downturn so that we can capitalize on their full potential in the coming years.
Third, we'll continue to drive efficiency and optimization across our operation.
During fiscal year '20, we established a global business services organization to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of those processes that power our way of doing business.
We will further leverage this investment through the deployment of digital tools to simplify and automate our ways of working and I'm excited about the potential here to complement our strategic growth efforts.
Fourth, the role of bolt-on M&A in our existing businesses remains an important part of our growth story.
Over the past few years, we have made very important strategic acquisitions in our core spaces, including extending our geographic presence in our specialty compounds business through acquisitions in Canada and Southeast Asia, and by expanding our product offering in energy materials to include CNTs through our acquisition of Sanshun.
We will continue to look for opportunities to build out our pipeline and execute on opportunities of these types.
Finally, in an uncertain and dynamic environment, it will be critical that we keep tight control of costs and working capital in 2021.
We feel good about the momentum into fiscal year '21, but we must remain vigilant on cost and working capital.
I hope this gives you some color on our 2021 priorities and how they will help Cabot to extend our leadership position.
I will close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook as we start fiscal year '21.
Clearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter of 2020 and we feel very good about how the first quarter is shaping up.
As Erica discussed, we expect a material step up in the Performance Chemicals segment and further strengthening in Reinforcement Materials, where performance is being driven by strong Asian spot pricing, the feedstock costs rise there and volume strength driven by stronger underlying demand and some level of inventory replenishments.
Based on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90.
On the cash side, we anticipate that operating cash flow will be strong as year-over-year earnings levels improve in fiscal '21, even though absolute net working capital levels will increase aligned with higher volumes.
Looking to the full-year of fiscal '21, there is still uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic that impacts our longer-term visibility.
Our results will be influenced by the sustainability of the economic recovery, the outcome of our tire customer agreements, the pace of costs returning to the business to support the recovery and how we manage pricing in this dynamic environment.
As the year unfolds, we will be managing these factors carefully to match the dynamic environment.
Overall, I feel very good about the way the team has performed and the progress we have made in this unprecedented environment.
I'm optimistic about the first quarter and remain confident that the team will respond to any challenges we may face throughout the year.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are robust, our market positions in global presence is unmatched, and our balance sheet and liquidity provide strength and flexibility.
I am confident in our growth opportunities ahead and our ability to deliver on our strategic objectives.
","Cabot Corporation's fiscal 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.75 sequentially, primarily driven by improved results in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Operating cash flow reached $99 million during the quarter, contributing to the company's strong liquidity position of $1.4 billion. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021's first quarter, Cabot expects a material step-up in Performance Chemicals EBIT and continued strengthening in Reinforcement Materials due to strong Asian spot pricing, volume strength, and inventory replenishments. The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 in Q1. While there is ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, Cabot remains optimistic based on the team's performance and progress made during the pandemic."
CPT_q3_2021.txt,"The theme for our precall music today was Camden Cares.
For many years, our Camden Cares initiatives have provided assistance to people in need among Camden's family or Camden residents as well as the communities where we live and work.
Our music today included a song by the late rate Bill Withers with this great wisdom.
""lean on me, when you're not strong, I'll be your friend.
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long till I'm going to need somebody to lean on"".
These words capture the spirit of all that our Camden associates do for others in need under our Camden Cares banner.
Camden's why, our purpose is to improve the lives of our teammates, customers and our shareholders one experience at a time.
At the outset of the pandemic, it was clear that the disruption from COVID-19 was going to be massive and leave millions needing someone to lean on.
We encouraged our teams to view the widespread chaos as an opportunity to go big on our pledge to improve people's lives, one experience at a time.
And not surprisingly, team Camden responded in truly extraordinary ways that we captured in this brief video.
We are pleased to report another very strong quarter of results and another raise to our 2021 earnings guidance.
We are seeing high levels of rent growth along with sustained occupancy levels over 97% for our portfolio which bodes well for the remainder of the year.
Camden is always focused on operating in markets with high employment and population growth and strong migration patterns, and this strategy has clearly paid off as evidenced by the ULI PwC report that was issued for 2021 real estate trends at the ULI Fall Conference in Chicago last week.
Camden's markets -- eight of Camden's markets ranked in the top 10 for 2022 investor demand.
We're very fortunate today to be in a really strong apartment market and in the right markets.
So at this point, I will go ahead and turn over the call to Keith Oden.
Same property revenue growth exceeded expectations yet again at 5.1% for the quarter and was positive in all markets, both year-over-year and sequentially.
We posted double-digit growth in Phoenix and South Florida, both at 10.1%, followed by Tampa at 9.5%.
Year-to-date, same-property revenue growth is 2.9%, and we expect strong performance in the fourth quarter across our portfolio, resulting in our revised 2021 guidance range of 4% to 4.5% for full year revenue growth.
New lease and renewal gains are still strong with double-digit growth posted in both categories.
For 3Q '21, signed new leases were 19.8% and renewals were 12.1% for a blended rate of 16% flat.
For leases, which were signed earlier and became effective during the third quarter, new lease growth was 16.6% with renewals at 8.5% for a blended rate of 12.2%.
October 2021 remained strong with signed new leases trending at 18.3%, renewals at 13.8% and a blended rate of 16.5%.
Renewal offers for November and December were sent out with an average increase of 15% to 16%.
Occupancy has also been very strong and was 97.3% for the third quarter of '21 and is still holding at 97.3% for October to date.
Net turnover remains low at 47% for the third quarter of '21 versus 49% in the third quarter of last year.
And move-outs to home purchases moderated from 17.7% in the second quarter of '21 to 15% in the third quarter of '21, trending below our long-term average of about 18%.
It's worth noting that these strong results have continued into what has historically been a seasonally weaker period for our portfolio.
This marks our third straight quarter in which we increased our same-property NOI and FFO per share guidance.
Our team is focused on finishing the year strong, which will position us for another solid year in 2022.
Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities.
During the third quarter of 2021, we purchased Camden Central, a recently constructed 368 unit, 15-story community in St. Petersburg, Florida.
And subsequent to quarter end, we purchased Camden Greenville, a recently constructed 558 unit mid-rise community in Dallas.
The combined purchase price for these two acquisitions is approximately $342 million and both assets were purchased at just under a 4% yield.
Also during the quarter, we stabilized Camden Downtown, a 271 unit, $132 million new development in Houston.
And subsequent to quarter end, we stabilized ahead of schedule Camden North End II, a 343-unit, $79 million new development in Phoenix.
Additionally, during the quarter, we completed construction on Camden Lake Eola, a $125 million new development in Orlando.
Subsequent to quarter end, we purchased five acres of land in Denver for future development purposes.
On the financing side, during the quarter, we issued approximately $222 million of shares under our existing ATM program.
We used the proceeds of the issuance to fund in part the previously discussed acquisitions.
Turning to financial results.
Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2021 of $142.2 million or $1.36 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03 per share, which resulted primarily from approximately $0.01 in higher same-store NOI, resulting from $0.02 of higher revenue driven by higher rental rates, higher occupancy and lower bad debt, partially offset by $0.01 of higher operating expenses entirely driven by higher-than-anticipated amounts of self-insured expenses.
-- approximately $0.015 and better-than-anticipated results from our non-same-store development and acquisition communities and approximately $0.01 from the timing of our third quarter acquisition.
This $0.035 aggregate outperformance was partially offset by $0.005 impact from our higher share count resulting from our recent ATM activity.
Last night, based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we also updated and revised our 2021 full year same-store guidance.
Taking into consideration our continued significant improvement in new leases, renewals and occupancy and our resulting expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year same-store revenue guidance from 3.75% to 4.25%.
And we have increased the midpoint of our full year same-store NOI guidance from 3.75% to 4.5%.
We are maintaining the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance at 3.75% as the higher-than-expected third quarter insurance expenses are anticipated to be entirely offset by lower-than-expected property tax expenses in the fourth quarter.
We are now anticipating that our full year property tax growth rate will be approximately 1.6%, which includes $1.8 million of property tax refunds anticipated in the fourth quarter.
Our 4.25% same-store revenue growth assumption is based upon occupancy averaging approximately 97% for the remainder of the year with the blend of new lease and renewals averaging approximately 16%.
Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2021 FFO guidance by $0.10 per share.
Our new 2021 FFO guidance is $5.34 to $5.40 with the midpoint of $5.37 per share.
This $0.10 per share increase results from -- are anticipated 75 basis points or approximately $0.05 increase in 2021 same-store operating results, $0.01 of this increase already occurred in the third quarter, an approximate $0.05 increase from our non-same-store development and acquisition communities, of which $0.025 already occurred in the third quarter and an approximate $0.02 increase in FFO from later and lower-than-anticipated fourth quarter disposition activities.
We now anticipate approximately $110 million of dispositions in early November and approximately $220 million of dispositions in early December as compared to our previous expectations of $450 million of dispositions, all occurring in early November.
This $0.12 aggregate increase in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.02 impact from our third quarter ATM activity.
Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021.
We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.46 to $1.52.
The midpoint of $1.49 represents $0.13 per share improvement from the third quarter, which is anticipated to result from an $0.11 per share or approximate 7.5% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, driven by both a 2.5% or $0.055 per share sequential increase in same-store revenue, resulting primarily from higher rental rates and a 6.5% decrease in sequential same-store expenses driven primarily by $0.025 fourth quarter decrease in property taxes, combined with a fourth quarter, $0.015 decrease in property insurance expenses and $0.015 third to fourth quarter seasonal decrease in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses, a $0.03 per share increase in NOI from our development communities in lease-up and our nonsame-store communities and $0.02 per share increase in FFO resulting from the full quarter contribution of our recent acquisitions.
This aggregate $0.16 increase is partially offset by $0.015 decrease in NOI from our planned fourth quarter disposition activities and $0.015 per share incremental impact from our third quarter ATM activity.
Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.4 times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.8 times.
As of today, we have approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $200 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our $900 million unsecured credit facility.
At quarter end, we had $242 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline.
At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
","Camden Property Trust reported another strong quarter with revenue growth exceeding expectations at 5.1%. The portfolio experienced double-digit growth in Phoenix, South Florida, and Tampa. New lease and renewal gains remain robust, with blended growth of 16%, while occupancy remains high at 97.3%. Same-property NOI and FFO per share guidance have been revised upward for the third straight quarter, with a full-year revenue growth projection of 4% to 4.5%. Camden continues to invest in real estate acquisitions and developments, with the recent purchases of two communities in Florida and Texas. The company's financial results for Q3 2021 include FFO per share of $1.36, surpassing guidance by $0.03. Full-year FFO guidance has been raised by $0.10 to a range of $5.34 to $5.40, with the midpoint at $5.37. The fourth-quarter FFO per share estimate is between $1.46 and $1.52, representing a $0.13 improvement from Q3. Camden's balance sheet is solid, with net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.4 times and total fixed charge coverage of 5.8 times. The company maintains liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and $242 million remaining under its development pipeline."
EXR_q3_2021.txt,"Well, we had an exciting quarter.
I'm not sure how else to describe it.
Among other accomplishments, we celebrated the addition of store #2000 to our portfolio.
We were recognized by Inside Self-Storage as the Best Third-Party Management company in the industry, and we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history.
Same-store occupancy once again reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower-than-historic levels.
Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power.
Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels.
In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continued to be lifted throughout the country.
Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter.
We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt.
These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4%, a 480 basis point acceleration from Q2.
And same-store NOI growth of 27.8%, an acceleration of 760 basis points.
In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%.
Turning to external growth.
The acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view.
Our investment team has never been busier, and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner.
While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites, the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year.
Also, our approach has resulted in better-than-market average yields.
But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume, and we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment.
We continue to look at all material transactions in the market and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores.
Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties.
It is worth mentioning that oftentimes, we are the buyer of these properties, and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another.
In the quarter, we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September.
Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint.
While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak.
Our revised guidance now assumes a 200 basis point moderation which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020.
We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.
As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.85 per share, a year-over-year increase of 41.2%.
Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees.
As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend.
We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals.
Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we've felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office.
Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time to fill -- and longer time required to fill vacant positions.
We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022 as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry.
This will also impact our G&A expense.
In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering.
And we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%.
We also refiled our ATM in the quarter, and we have $800 million in availability.
Our access to capital has never been stronger.
And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced.
Our quarter end net debt to EBITDA was 4.5 times, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions.
We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%.
Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to 0%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%.
These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense.
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share.
Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11, even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline.
We are excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio.
As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage.
","Extra Space Storage celebrated a strong quarter with the addition of its 2000th store, industry recognition, and record-breaking operating results. Same-store occupancy reached an all-time high of over 97%. Rental rates to new and existing customers soared by 43% and 41%, respectively, compared to 2020 and 2019 levels. Revenue growth of 18.4% and NOI growth of 27.8% were driven by increased late fees and lower bad debt. External growth initiatives through property acquisitions contributed to 41.2% FFO growth. Despite higher wage pressures, same-store expenses were reduced through savings in payroll, marketing, and property taxes. A second public bond offering and an ATM refinancing provided strong capital access. Revised guidance for 2021 reflects higher same-store revenue and lower expenses, raising the full-year core FFO range to $6.75-$6.85 per share. The company remains optimistic about continued growth in the fourth quarter and beyond."
LCI_q4_2021.txt,"On the call today are Tim Crew, Chief Executive Officer; John Kozlowski, the company's Chief Financial Officer, Maureen Cavanaugh, our Chief Commercial Operations Officer; and Steve Lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives.
A playback will be available for at least three months on Lannett's website.
In a moment, Tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and initiatives.
Then John will discuss the financial results in more detail.
We hope you remain safe and well as we all manage through the persistency of the pandemic.
I'll start today reviewing some of the highlights of the past year that are relevant to our future before turning to the key elements we see in that future.
First and foremost, in 2021, we continued to launch products and build our future portfolio.
We launched about a dozen new products, highlighted by a few significant contributors, including Levothyroxine tablets, Levothyroxine capsules and Clarithromycin.
The products we launched last year added new revenue streams and further diversified offerings, reducing our exposure and reliance on key products.
We also grew our base product pipeline with continued investment in a robust internal product development program.
For example, our recent Mycophenolate approval was achieved in just under 10 months, the third such product we developed to achieve so called first cycle approval in the past few years.
We have made great strides in our internal efforts including significant changes to our portfolio selection.
Such changes take time to be fully reflected in our financials, but we believe meaningful value is being built.
Further, we are working on our existing strategic alliance partners to expand our agreements to include new products.
For example, this past year Insulin Aspart was added to our HEC agreement, and more recently, generic Spiriva, Handihaler was added to our Respirent agreements.
Together these products represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few competitors expected.
We also formed a new strategic alliance partnership to launch Sevoflurane, a product with relatively few competitors and a market size of about $190 million based on IQVIA data.
We look to launch Sevoflurane in the back half of the fiscal year.
The second key accomplishment last year was even while we launched new products and grew our pipeline, we also maintained firm control over expenses and exhibited operating discipline.
We implemented and completed the cost reduction plan that included consolidating our R&D functions to a single location and lowered operating costs by approximately $15 million annually.
The third key accomplishment was that we significantly improved our capital structure.
This last year, we paid off our Term A loans with cash on hand and later successfully completed a full refinancing transaction of the Term B loans.
The refinancing transaction as we have often highlighted was significant for several reasons.
First, we extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more meaningful pipeline assets are expected to launch and contributed to a reduction in our debt.
Second, we upsize our credit facility and substantially freed up cash flow, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity.
Third, the new debt does not have any leverage covenants.
Fourth, as a result of this refinancing, in combination with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position.
Thus, we now have more ready resources to invest in growth opportunities.
Of course, another accomplishment to note was in our teams, particularly in our plants and labs, showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic and maintained a reliable supply of our affordable medicines.
This, of course, despite all the extra challenges we have been doing so this past year.
We are quite proud of all of these accomplishments.
Of course, there are also real challenges.
Well, competition is a fact of life in the generic industry.
The competitive environment we encountered last year was particularly impactful because it involved some of our most profitable products.
We offset some of these pressures with the aforementioned new product launches and cost reductions, but the decline significantly exceeded the offsets.
On top of a particularly competitive environment, COVID-19 continued to impact our financial performance with more downstream influences.
For example, as we have said, the pandemic resulted in fewer elective medical procedures being performed, this reduction in limited sales and use of our cocaine-based product.
As a branded product, our Numbrino NDA carries a higher than average gross margin for us, so changes up or down in sales have a disproportionate impact on our bottom line.
Fortunately, we believe many of the negative past year are beginning to attenuate while the positive factors continue to foretell meaningful opportunities.
With that as a background and leaving John to note the specific financial results, I will turn to our outlook for the upcoming years.
We expect our overall net sales and gross margin to continue to face pressure by recent and anticipated competitive pricing of certain key products, partially offset again by the benefit of new product launches.
We also expect sales of our Numbrino NDA to be impacted by a continuation of further elective surgeries being performed.
Once the pandemic subsides, we would expect to see an increase in these types of procedures and along with that, an increase in sales.
While we are forecasting a down year in sales and profits, we see fiscal '22 as a trough year.
Our key products have already been impacted by notable competitive pricing pressure, thus, those products have less further downside.
At the same time, the relative future potential of our pipeline continues to increase.
I also want to note that while we believe our generic ADVAIR DISKUS product has the potential to launch in calendar year 2022, we did not include any sales of the product in our FY '22 guidance.
Similarly, zolmitriptan is also not contemplated in our FY 2022 forecast, as a result of ongoing delays from our API supplier.
Nevertheless, we do expect both products to be meaningful contributors in fiscal 2023.
So now let's turn to our pipeline.
We continue to launch products [Indecipherable] approximately 13 ANDAs pending at the FDA including partner products, plus four additional products that are approved and pending launch.
We also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts.
We continue to target more valuable products than has been our historical average.
With regard to our large durable product pipeline, we currently have five disclosed assets.
First, with our partner HEC, we have two insulin assets, Insulin Aspart, a fast acting insulin product and Insulin Glargine, a long-acting insulin product.
Combined, the two products participate in a double-digit billion dollar US market as reported by IQVIA.
Second, our drug device respiratory portfolio with their partner Respirent now has three assets, generic ADVAIR DISKUS, which is filed with the FDA, along with generic Flovent Diskus, and most recently, generic Spiriva Handihaler.
Combined sales of these products also represent a multi-billion dollar US market as reported by IQVIA.
As we have said, all of these products are differentiated from traditional generic products because of the significant technical expertise required for development and substantial plant investments made by our partners that needed to manufacture them.
So for all of these products, we expect only a handful of competitors.
I will discuss next the significant progress we are making advancing these large durable product opportunities.
With regard to generic ADVAIR DISKUS, we have been in regular contact with the FDA regarding this priority application since it was accepted in May of this year.
We are encouraged by their level of engagement.
We anticipate a mid-cycle review update from the FDA sometime in the next few months.
Thus, we expect to provide a better sense of how the application is progressing on our next investor call in November.
Currently, we continue to participate more than one FDA cycle and believe, as just noted, an approval in US launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022.
For those new to Lannett story, generic ADVAIR DISKUS is one of the larger assets in our filed pipeline.
It is also currently the closest to expected commercialization in our partnered respiratory portfolio.
The second most advanced product in our respiratory portfolio is generic Flovent Diskus.
The last patient for the pivotal clinical trial for this product has been dosed and we anticipate the analysis of the trial to be completed within a few months.
We are currently planning for an ANDA submission before the end of the current fiscal year and a possible launch in calendar year 2023.
Next, as noted, we recently expanded our opportunities with Respirent to include generic Spiriva Handihaler.
The development arc for this product should be approximately 12 months to 18 months behind the generic Flovent Diskus product.
However, as there were various IP matters involved, we're not commenting today on the specific launch timing expectations.
Finally, as we have previously said, we're evaluating and in negotiations for additional product opportunities in inhalation respiratory space, particularly dry powder inhalers, and metered dose inhalers.
There continues to be additional multi-billion dollar market opportunities to pursue with both current and future partners.
Now turning to our two biologic insulin products, starting with biosimilar Insulin Glargine.
Clinical material for the drug product has now been manufactured in the new dedicated manufacturing site, which is a very significant milestone.
We still expect to submit an IND around the end of the calendar year and commence the pivotal clinical trial early next calendar year.
However, we have recently added a few months to the clinical timeline, due to current COVID-19 restrictions at the study site in South Africa.
We have also added a few more months to our timelines to address interchangeability with the FDA, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Thus, we currently think the biologics license application will be filed in the first half of calendar year 2023 and we would expect to launch in the first half of calendar year 2024.
Also note, China's version of the FDA, the NMPA has approved HEC's Insulin Glargine for China.
That product is made in the same new plant, where we have now just made our Insulin Glargine for clinical trials.
[Indecipherable] we have added to the development plan to address the interchangeability with the FDA is related to an important recent FDA approval of the first biosimilar and interchangeable Insulin Glargine, the [Indecipherable].
We believe that interchangeability approval is good news for Lannett and HEC's insulin.
It demonstrates the FDA will approve interchangeable insulin products, which over-time should improve affordable access to these important medications.
Regarding biosimilar Insulin Aspart, the development of the product continues and we currently anticipate a potential launch of the product about 15 months following Insulin Glargine.
Again, Insulin Aspart was produced in the same facilities, working with the same teams and technologies as Insulin Glargine, so we are able to leverage may be earlier Glargine investments in development and manufacturing that have been made by both Lannett and HEC.
Like our respiratory portfolio, we see several opportunities to leverage our insulin assets.
There are other dosage forms of both Glargine and Aspart, such as vials and other distinct insulin products.
These opportunities again represent multi-billion dollar markets, as reported by IQVIA.
We also see opportunities to leverage our USA clinical data, 10 development and related IP, along with the manufacturing capacity at HEC to form a strategic alliance with third parties looking to accelerate their access to insulin products in international markets such as Europe.
Well, discussions on such opportunities are very preliminary, such relationships could yield meaningful value for both ourselves and our partners.
Finally, a few brief comments on Made in America [Phonetic] and ESG.
While we see a future that includes several high technology products from overseas sources, today, we are mainly a US domiciled generic medicines company.
Lannett adheres to strict US laws and US environmental guidelines with regard to development and manufacturing compliance for our US made products.
Most of our large generic competitors are already based overseas and don't face the same set of regulations and ship most of their products from the far side of the globe.
We are proud that today, we serve the US market from the US market and do so with an enviable track record and reputation for being a high quality and reliable manufacturer.
We point out these characteristics that make Lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers think of Lannett when they consider Made in America in various ESG related initiatives.
To sum-up today's remarks, our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 were significant.
We faced head on a highly competitive market environment.
We launched new products and made important advances in the development of key products in our pipeline.
We expanded existing agreements that added three large durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises.
We refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extended our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our large pipeline assets.
We continue to believe that the exciting products in our advancing and expanding pipeline still have the potential to transform our firm into $1 billion company by 2025.
I'll begin with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
For the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared with $137.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year.
Gross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared with $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year fourth quarter.
R&D expenses declined to $6.0 million from $6.6 million.
SG&A expenses declined to $15.5 million from $15.6 million.
Operating income was $4.9 million, compared with $26.7 million.
Interest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter.
Net loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share versus net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million.
Turning to our balance sheet.
At June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million at March 31.
Cash increased during the fourth quarter due to a few factors.
First, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt.
Second, relates to working capital improvements that continued from the third quarter.
And the third, was the receipt of income tax refunds.
Looking ahead, we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity.
Accordingly, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position throughout the year and end fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 plus million.
As for our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which today we have not drawn upon.
Turning to our guidance, which as Tim mentioned earlier, does not include sales of generic ADVAIR DISKUS or zolmitriptan.
For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $400 million to $440 million, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 23% to 25%, adjusted R&D expense in the range of $26 million to $29 million, adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $58 million to $61 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $55 million, and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $12 million to $18 million.
Regarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA in Q1 to be lower than Q4, ramping up slightly in Q2 and continue to ramp-up more in the second half of fiscal 2022.
The increase is related to expected new product launches.
Gross margin in the first half of the fiscal year to be in the lower range of our outlook, ramping up to the upper end of the range in the second half of fiscal 2022 and operating expenses to remain relatively consistent throughout the year, though, we expect Q1 to be slightly higher than the other quarters, as they include certain compensation related expenses that are only recorded at the beginning of our fiscal year.
With that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have.
","In Q4, Lannett faced competitive pressure that impacted sales and margins, resulting in a $0.19 adjusted loss per share. Despite this, the company achieved key milestones by launching new products, advancing its insulin and respiratory pipelines, and securing strategic partnerships. Lannett's robust pipeline includes 13 ANDAs pending at the FDA, four approved and pending launch, and 20 products in development. The company expects to generate $400-$440 million in net sales for fiscal 2022, with a gross margin of 23-25%. Lannett's successful debt refinancing extended its debt maturity to 2026, freeing up cash flow and improving its capital structure. With its pipeline expected to contribute meaningfully in future years, Lannett maintains its goal of becoming a $1 billion company by 2025."
FLR_q2_2021.txt,"There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially.
You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in our 2020 10-K and in our Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.
Bob was the great grandson of our founder and worked at Fluor for 42 years before retiring in 2009.
For 27 years, he led the Fluor Foundation, our charitable and community involvement organization that was established by his father and his uncle Si Fluor in 1952.
Throughout his career, Bob brought meaning and value to the active giving back, inspiring thousands of employees across the company and across the globe, to commit time and resources to bettering their communities.
The company will continue to build on Bob's legacy of supporting stronger, more sustainable communities around the world.
In a few minutes, Joe will walk through the financials of our business in each of our segments.
So let me first provide a high-level overview of what we are seeing in each of our major end markets.
Starting with Urban Solutions.
In mining, work is tracking broadly to our expectations for the next 18 months.
We have seen a few large projects shift to the right as detailed estimate reviews and scrutiny of projects by our clients prior to an investment decision being taken is higher than we have seen in quite some time.
In addition to those projects, we have a steady slate of feed and limited notice to proceed work, where we have a high level of confidence in conversion to full project awards in the next couple of years.
Our prospect list is incredibly diverse, and we are not dependent on any one region or any one commodity to see significant growth in this business.
Backlog for mining declined by approximately $1 billion in the quarter.
That was due to the cancellation of a steel project in North America.
Moving to Infrastructure on slide four.
The bipartisan bill continues to gain momentum, and we are optimistic that it will focus on more traditional infrastructure projects, including roads and bridges, which we believe will provide some upside to Fluor and more importantly, funding certainty to our clients in the coming years.
Importantly, we are starting to see shifts in contract structures and collaborative models are being applied to the infrastructure sector as well as other sectors that allow contractors to compete on capabilities and qualifications instead of solely on price.
This is a positive development, and we are encouraged by this approach to risk mitigation.
On a particularly promising note, we are seeing advisory institutions acknowledging the challenges encountered in executing public works projects.
This has led to the development of more collaborative procurement models to support their public sector clients.
Last week, we were notified by TxDOT that our co-lead joint venture was selected to design, construct and maintain the 6.5-mile long I-35E Phase two project here in Dallas.
Our portion of the work will be booked in the third quarter.
We're excited about this project and look forward to supporting TxDOT on this and other capital programs in the future.
Regarding our legacy infrastructure portfolio, I want to provide an update on the Gordie Howe Bridge Project and the $138 million charge we announced today.
The project is experiencing significant COVID-related delays as well as overruns due to procurement and subcontractor cost growth.
This charge includes additional reserves for delays and disruptions in the schedule.
Fluor is not the lead operating partner on this contract.
It's important to note that these cost growth factors may be at least partially recoverable under the contract.
We expect that it will require several quarters to analyze recoverability and negotiate with our clients before the accounting standards allow us to recognize incremental revenue for these amounts.
While we are disappointed in the performance of the project, we believe we have a solid estimate on the cost at this point.
Design is essentially complete, and we have procured approximately 85% of the materials required.
We have been revising the forecast along the way, and this contract was previously included in our 0 margin projects in backlog.
As a noncontrolling partner in this JV, we continue to work with our partners to help them get this project into the best possible position.
We have just under $1 billion in backlog remaining for this project and anticipate substantial completion by the end of 2024.
Our other infrastructure projects continue to make solid progress, including the LAX people mover, which crossed a significant milestone in early July when the joint venture placed the first forward trusses for the elevated pedestrian walkway.
Turning to slide five.
In advanced technologies and life sciences, we are successfully wrapping up some of our large data center projects in Europe.
We also see opportunities for semiconductor manufacturing facilities, both domestically and internationally.
These projects are a mix of brownfield and greenfield, and provide a lot of opportunity for add-on work as these facilities grow.
In life sciences, we continue to see a good list of opportunities, as our world-class technology capabilities support our strategy of getting front-end work.
We have been awarded a few front-end projects this quarter with the goal of converting them into EPCM contracts.
Overall, we still see the ATLS end markets as an area for growth in our business, and we are focused on deploying our teams on to projects where we can grow our market share with contract terms and conditions that we find favorable.
In Mission Solutions, we experienced strong margins this quarter due to increased execution activity on DOE projects, higher-than-forecasted performance-based fees and the release of COVID-19 cost reserves.
This strong performance was somewhat offset by a decline in execution activity on army logistics and life support programs in Afghanistan and Africa.
In June, we fully demobilized our people and successfully completed our assignment in Afghanistan after 13 years.
At its peak, Fluor had 26,000 employees from 65 countries, speaking 39 languages at 76 sites and supporting over 100,000 troops.
This included 191,000 meals prepared per day and the establishment of the first-ever biodiesel program for the U.S. military deployed overseas.
Under this program, we produced over 0.5 million gallons of fuels for the bases.
We are now continuing to support the Army through our LOGCAP V task order award in Africa.
Next, please note that on the RAPID project, we have moved into the warranty period.
This project is now essentially complete.
Our major pursuits for the second half of this year in this group include the Savannah River Management & Operations contract extension and the Y12/Pantex Management & Operations contract in Tennessee and Texas.
Moving to Energy Solutions on slide seven.
We had a particularly strong quarter due to certain favorable events driving up our gross margin.
This reflects the negotiations of change orders, scope increases and cost improvements across numerous projects.
Furthermore, margins also benefited from the release of credit loss reserves after we received payment on a significant long-standing past due receivable.
These positive segment margin results were partially offset by a $20 million loss recognized on an embedded derivative, which is excluded from our adjusted earnings per share numbers.
Turning to slide eight.
We remain pleased with the progress on our LNG Canada project in Kitimat.
During the quarter, we saw a significant easing of public health orders that had slowed progress earlier this year, and we are now fully staffed onsite per our plan.
In the second quarter, we achieved several major milestones.
First, we drove the last of the Phase one plant piles.
This program started in January 2020 and included the installation of nearly 6,500 piles.
If laid end to end, the piles would extend 130 miles.
Secondly, the project's material offloading facility is now operational, receiving and unloading the first three major pieces of process equipment shipped via oceangoing vessel.
These pieces of equipment for Train one include the 345 ton, 50-meter-long main cryogenic heat exchanger and two precooler units, each weighing over 280 tons.
We are scheduled to direct these pieces this fall.
The site has gone vertical with the steel erection of the non-process building, including the central control and administration buildings.
During the quarter, we completed the LNG storage tank wall pours.
The LNG tank group and suspended deck raising is scheduled for next week.
Module fabrication has commenced for all facets of the project across the Asia and European module fabrication centers.
Preparation and planning have commenced for the first module delivery major, which are on target for Q4 2021.
We have formalized the term sheet with our client, which outlines principles of cost and schedule relief related to delays, including COVID, engineering and procurement impacts through February 26, 2021.
We are targeting finalization of a formal variation this month.
We continue to enhance our Energy Transition portfolio and believe that Fluor will be a vital contributor to a lower carbon future.
We are seeing success in several markets, such as renewable fuels, carbon capture, clean hydrogen, battery chemicals and asset decarbonization.
First, in the renewables fuel market, Fluor is focused on brownfield or revamp capabilities with a geographic focus in North America, where low carbon fuel standard credits are available, demand for liquid fuels continue and feedstock selection is broadly based.
Next, in the carbon capture market.
Fluor can perform projects with any technology globally.
This includes our own proprietary technology for both pre-combustion and post-combustion, Fluor Solvent and Econamine FG+, respectively.
We are also seeing further opportunities for carbon capture on new and existing LNG facilities.
Our clean hydrogen efforts include both green hydrogen and blue hydrogen.
Fluor is relying on its 50 years at the forefront of the gasification industry and has executed more than 30 pre-FEED and FEED projects.
Fluor can differentiate in this market with our ability to act as integrator and OSBL contractor.
Another Energy Transition market we are exploring is battery chemicals.
We are expanding our lithium capabilities and are pursuing the growing market of electric vehicle battery production.
In asset decarbonization, Fluor is leveraging our design experience for refineries and petrochemical facilities, including steam and electrical systems.
We have global execution capabilities for conceptual front-end design through EPC for both electrification and energy efficiency projects.
Aside from these markets, we are also pursuing projects in green ammonia, chemical recycling, bio-based chemicals, long duration energy storage, waste-to-energy conversion and bio LNG.
Most of our energy transition work is in the United States and Europe.
And based on our differentiated technical position, we continue to view growth in this area as a driver for increased revenue and earnings in the coming years.
Now let's turn to NuScale, a related energy transition offering on slide 10.
For the first seven months of this year, NuScale has received $192 million in outside investments from JGC and GS Energy, Doosan, Samsung and IHI, among others.
These infusions not only eliminate the need for Fluor to provide additional funding, but also accelerate NuScale's path to commercialization and demonstrates third-party investor interest in NuScale's business prospects.
Additionally, we continue to have positive and productive conversations around nuclear power as a necessary baseload clean energy source, both in North America and abroad.
We believe that our new scale product will become a vital part of a cleaner energy future.
Before handing the call over to Joe, on slide 11, I want to share a few observations as we head into the second half of the year.
First, we expect to see some inconsistency or lumpiness in new awards as the optimism in post-pandemic capital spending from clients is partially offset by concerns about cost growth for labor and materials.
We're also keeping a close eye on the impacts of the Delta variant of COVID as it relates to our exposure to global supply chains.
While these dynamics may shift certain projects out in time somewhat and impact the near term, there are longer-term trends in our business that I view as very positive.
First, as mentioned in my infrastructure remarks, we are starting to see a better balance of risks sharing in contract structures.
Projects are increasingly structured as predevelopment agreements where clients and contractors work together to identify and mitigate risks before bids are finalized.
These collaborative models are being considered because clients are seeing contractors declining to bid on large projects as terms and conditions have shifted risk allocation too far away from the owner.
Also, we continue to see a robust pipeline of study, pre-FEED and FEED work to support future growth.
We are currently working on or have recently completed pre-EPC work that represents over $150 billion in total installed costs.
Additionally, we are pursuing another 200 study in FEED projects, representing almost $200 billion in TIC over the next several years.
So while we are seeing some near-term headwinds in 2021 with new word lumpiness, we have considerable opportunity to capture projects that are in the pipeline, and they're well suited for Fluor.
Finally, regarding our cost savings initiative, we are making solid progress and have identified significant opportunities to improve processes and reduce costs and create an organization that is competitive and fit for growth.
Our various work streams are taking specific actions to ensure that our resources are tailored to what we need today.
And we are establishing new protocols so we can efficiently scale as our markets ebb and flow.
For the second quarter of 2021, we are reporting a diluted adjusted earnings per share amount of $0.32.
Our diluted share count was $156 million for the quarter, up from $140 million in the first quarter.
This includes the additional shares from the convertible preferred offering we completed in May.
In the third quarter, we expect our diluted share count to be approximately $170 million, as the effects of the issuance will be for a full quarter.
For the quarter and the year-to-date, the offering is anti-dilutive under GAAP due to the net loss.
So common earnings per share and diluted earnings per share results are the same.
However, in terms of guidance and results, we will discuss EPS, including the aforementioned adjustments as well as using the larger diluted share count going forward for comparison purposes.
Our financial statements will continue to conform to GAAP, and we will provide the required reconciliation.
But we will use the larger dilutive share count for all periods as appropriate.
I will walk you through that a little more clearly when we talk about guidance.
Turning to slide 13.
Specific to our convertible preferred offering, we saw it as a necessary and positive step toward reinforcing financial discipline for the company.
This offering allowed us to make a significant change in our net debt profile and not have to wait for proceeds from outstanding transactions that do not have an established closing date.
With the expected debt retirement, our debt to total capitalization ratio will decline to below 40% by year-end, fulfilling the goal that we set on Strategy Day.
The positive feedback we've received from the credit rating agencies and the credit provider shows that they are supportive of our efforts to drive Fluor to its historical leverage profile.
This ensures we have the capital strength to maintain our position to bid and win the projects to support the growth within our stated strategy.
Since completing the offer, we have retired $26 million in debt, to date, and anticipate additional substantial retirements by the end of 2021.
Our overall segment profit for the quarter was $67 million or 2.1%, and included the $20 million charge for embedded derivatives in Energy Solutions and quarterly new scale expenses of $19 million.
Excluding these expenses and the effect of the embedded derivative, improves our total segment profit margin to 3.3%, in line with our guidance for the year.
Our ending cash balance was $2.7 billion, and includes the unutilized proceeds from the convertible offering and the completion of a P3 sale in North America.
Cash flow from operations was $77 million for the quarter, and we expect cash flow generation to be positive for the second half of this year.
Operating cash flow improved from the first quarter due to decreased funding for COVID costs on projects, lower cash requirements for G&A and tax payments as well as a decline in working capital.
We also completed the sale of AMECO North America in the second quarter and received cash proceeds of $71 million.
We have shifted our focus to the divestiture of AMECO South America and Stork and have confidence we will transact these divestitures prior to Q1 of 2022.
We continue to consider small M&A opportunities, as previously discussed.
But given current valuations in the market, we remain extremely selective.
Our G&A expense was $31 million compared to $66 million last quarter.
The decrease is due to the impact of stock price on our incentive compensation in the second quarter.
Before I provide details about our outlook for the balance of the year, I want to provide a bit of insight into our current portfolio.
At the end of the quarter, our backlog contained $1.2 billion in projects that are in a 0 margin or loss position.
Outside of the Gordie Howe project, we have just over $200 million in backlog remaining for projects in a loss position, virtually all of which will complete by the end of 2022.
All new awards since we tightened our bidding criteria, two years ago, remained profitable.
Furthermore, looking at this slate of more recently awarded projects, project gross margin in all three segments is about 40 basis points higher than as sold gross margin, which shows there more disciplined approach to bidding is resulting in more predictable and profitable results.
Our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.50 to $0.80 per share was based on a share count of 140 million shares and thus, implied net income of $71 million to $113 million for 2021.
Based on the performance we see in the businesses and considering the additional shares related to the convertible preferred offering, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.60 to $0.80, which correlates to an adjusted net income of $94 million to $128 million for the full year.
Hitting this target is dependent on many of the currently identified projects being awarded in a timely fashion and our ability to convert them into revenue in the next two quarters.
As David mentioned, some projects may be delayed by owners until there is more certainty regarding near-term concerns around cost growth for labor and materials.
We continue to monitor these headwinds through our supply chain group and we are making sure the team remains aligned with our bidding process.
Despite the anti-dilutive nature of the offering at this time, we will continue to report adjusted EPS, assuming a fully diluted share count for measurability and will provide reconciliations as necessary.
We are also adjusting our segment level guidance for the second half of the year and expect segment margins to be approximately 3% to 4% in Energy Solutions, which excludes any fluctuation from the embedded foreign currency derivative, 3% to 4% in Urban Solutions, and 2.5% to 3% in Mission Solutions.
These margins also underpin Q3 and Q4 performance to support the updated diluted and adjusted earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.80.
On our Strategy Day in January, we provided long-term 2024 earnings per share guidance of $3 to $3.50.
This range was provided using our 2020 share count of 140 million shares.
Adjusting for a diluted share count of 170 million shares in 2024, we are updating our long-term earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.50 to $2.90.
To reinforce, we are not changing our income assumptions, just adding to the denominator.
Operator, we are now ready for our first question.
","Despite inherent risks acknowledged in the earnings call transcript, Fluor Corporation reported diluted adjusted earnings per share of $0.32 for Q2 2021. The company raised its full-year guidance to a range of $0.60 to $0.80 per share, excluding NuScale expenses. Notably, the company acknowledged potential inconsistencies in new awards due to concerns about cost growth for labor and materials. In Urban Solutions, the mining sector showed steady work, while infrastructure experienced shifts in contract structures. In Advanced Technologies and Life Sciences, opportunities were seen in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and life sciences. Mission Solutions reported strong margins, while Energy Solutions benefited from favorable events and higher gross margins. The company reiterated its commitment to a lower carbon future, highlighting its work in renewable fuels, carbon capture, and battery chemicals. NuScale, its energy transition subsidiary, secured additional investments from various entities, eliminating the need for further funding from Fluor. Lastly, Fluor expects segment margins to range from 2.5% to 4% in the second half of 2021. The company also adjusted its long-term earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.50 to $2.90 for 2024, reflecting an updated diluted share count."
OXM_q3_2021.txt,"Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to our fiscal 2019 results.
Before I begin reviewing third quarter results, I want to remind everyone of Oxford's core operating philosophies.
Our objective is always to deliver long-term shareholder value.
Our strategy for delivering this value is to own a portfolio of powerful lifestyle brands that can drive sustained profitable growth.
And our purpose as a company and in each of our brands is to make people happy.
With that, we're delighted to be reporting record sales and earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
These outstanding results are directly attributable to the power of our brand portfolio, the strength of our product offerings and our ability to connect with and serve customers across channels, combined with the great work our teams have done to fortify these foundational cornerstones during the pandemic.
As compared to the same quarter last year, our sales increased 41%.
And even more importantly, our sales also increased as compared to pre-COVID fiscal 2019 levels.
Excluding Lanier Apparel, where operations were effectively exited during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, net sales increased 15% over the same period of fiscal 2019.
The robust sales growth that we experienced during the third quarter was driven by 40% growth in our full price direct-to-consumer business, with growth in each of our brands compared to fiscal 2019, including a 13% increase in full-price retail and a 100% gain in full-price e-commerce.
Restaurant sales also contributed to our top-line improvement, growing 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 fueled by strong increases at existing locations, as well as the addition of five new Marlin Bar locations.
At the same time, adjusted gross margin increased an impressive 710 basis points to 62% during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2019.
Scott will elaborate on all these excellent metrics in more detail momentarily.
But I will mention that they drove record third quarter earnings of $1.19 per share on an adjusted basis compared to an adjusted loss of $0.44 per share last year and adjusted earnings per share, up $0.10 during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
While our third quarter results no doubt benefited from a very strong consumer market, we believe the primary driver of our outperformance was the excellent execution of our strategy and purpose.
The exit of Lanier Apparel during the third quarter mark an important milestone in our long-term strategy as Lanier was the last of our legacy private label businesses.
Our current portfolio consists of five excellent lifestyle brands: Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head.
These brands are 100% focused on the consumer and making that consumer happy with powerful clear brand messages, exceptional differentiated product, superior customer experiences, including our e-commerce websites, our stores and restaurants and strategic wholesale accounts.
Over the last two years, across our brands, we have redoubled our commitment to delivering our positive upbeat brand messages through beautiful creative content in imagery.
Those brand messages are resonating with our consumers and are a big part of the excellent results that we are delivering.
The predominant mix of direct-to-consumer, which is expected to be over 80% of our business enhances our ability to deliver happiness to our customers.
The direct model gives us significant agility and flexibility in managing the flow of product to our customers.
This flexibility has proven especially useful this year, as industrywide supply chain challenges had required our merchants to be highly adaptable as to what product we are featuring on the floor and on our websites at any particular point in time.
The direct business also provides us with significant margin power and is responsible for a large portion of the gain in gross margin that we achieved during the quarter.
Finally, the direct-to-consumer model gives us the opportunity to deliver an unparalleled customer experience that is consistent with the aspirational positioning of our brands.
And our incredible people have continued to provide that elevated experience through all the challenges of the last two years.
One of our strategic priorities over the last couple of years has been to enhance our digital marketing capabilities by improving our ability to assimilate and analyze data, use that data to develop insights about existing in potential customers, create campaigns designed to reach those consumers and measure the effectiveness of those campaigns with the goals of increasing our customer account, retaining existing customers and driving higher spend across all customers.
I'm pleased to report that on a trailing 12-month basis, customer metrics at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021, including customer accounts, rate of new customer additions, retention rates and customer lifetime value were all strong relative to pre-pandemic numbers.
From a product perspective, we continued to see strength in the casual, easy and cozy styles, that are a hallmark of all our brands.
Great examples of this are continued strength in Tommy Bahama knits and shorts, women's lounge and sleepwear, and Lilly Pulitzer's Luxletic athleisure collection.
At the same time, we saw a nice rebound in some of the occasion-driven categories that were most challenged last year including men's pants and woven shirts and women's dresses, as people reengaged in more social events.
As we head into the final stretch of the year, I'm pleased to report that the holiday selling to-date has been robust and I firmly believe that we will deliver a strong finish to a fantastic year.
I'm incredibly grateful to our team, and share their pride in what we have delivered for our customers and our shareholders.
As Tom just mentioned, we had outstanding performances in each of our brands during the third quarter, which resulted in significant sales, gross margin, operating margin and earnings growth to levels exceeding pre-pandemic results.
On the top line, demand for our products remained high and revenue exceeded 2019 at our direct-to-consumer channels and in each of our brands.
Excluding Lanier Apparel where operations were effectively exited during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, consolidated sales increased 15% to $243 million.
We had improvements in all regions, with particular strength in Florida, the Southeast and Texas.
Hawaii has been positive overall with strength, except on the island of Oahu, which is more dependent on foreign tourists, than the other islands.
Our gross margin continued to track significantly higher than 2019.
On an adjusted basis, gross margin expanded 710 basis points over 2019 to 62% in the third quarter.
Driving this improvement was the higher proportion of full price sales, our overall shift in our sales mix to higher margin direct-to-consumer channels of distribution and improved IMUs.
Approximately 270 basis points of higher freight cost, including the use of air freight partially offset some of the margin improvement.
On an adjusted basis, we gained 260 basis points of SG&A leverage in the third quarter, improving from 56% of sales in 2019 to 53% of sales in 2021.
Adjusted SG&A dollars decreased modestly from 2019 levels but decreases in employment costs due to headcount reductions and lower occupancy cost, partially offset by increases in marketing expense.
As a result, our consolidated operating margin expanded 970 basis points from 1% in 2019, to 11%.
Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide all experienced operating margin expansion.
Moving to the balance sheet, our liquidity position is strong.
We ended the third quarter with $188 million of cash and short-term investments and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
FIFO inventory decreased 17% compared to fiscal 2020 excluding Lanier Apparel due to higher-than-expected sales during the first nine months of 2021, ongoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems and prudent seasonal purchases.
We believe our inventory is well positioned to meet forecasted demand throughout the remainder of the holiday selling season.
Looking ahead, we are pleased with our holiday season results to-date and are confident we can deliver a solid fourth quarter.
Our outlook reflects our expectation of continued strength in full price direct-to-consumer business.
We expect full price direct-to-consumer sales growth and consolidated gross margin expansion over 2019.
While we raised our outlook for the year, year-over-year improvement in our full price direct business is expected to be partially offset by a handful of specific items in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
We expect sales from Lanier Apparel to be approximately $20 million lower than 2019's fourth quarter as we exited the business in Q3 of this year.
In addition, we expect our branded wholesale business to be approximately $15 million lower than 2019.
This is impacted by the shift to certain initial spring wholesale shipments.
These have historically shipped in the fourth quarter, but are expected to ship in the first quarter of 2022, as we reduced our reliance on air freight for warmer weather product.
We also expect the Lilly Pulitzer fourth quarter flash clearance sale, to be lower compared to 2019, due to strong year-to-date full price sales resulting in less available inventory for the flash sale.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be between $285 million and $295 million compared to sales of $298 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
Again Lanier Apparel generated $20 million in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect earnings of $1.20 to $1.35 per share on an adjusted basis, compared to earnings of $1.09 per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our outlook includes strong quarter-to-date results with a solid start to the holiday selling season.
For the full year, we now expect sales in a range of $1.127 billion to $1.137 billion as compared to sales of $1.123 billion in 2019.
For the full year, sales from Lanier Apparel are expected to be $25 million in 2021, compared to $95 million in 2019.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $7.52 and $7.67.
This compared to earnings of $4.32 per share on an adjusted basis in 2019.
Our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 is expected to be approximately 22%.
We continue to support our business with investments for future growth.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $35 million and $40 million in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting investments in information technology initiatives, new Marlin Bars and retail stores.
We're excited to open our first company-owned Beaufort Bonnet Company store in Grand Boulevard at Sandestin later this quarter.
We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, including a $157 million year-to-date.
Our capital allocation priorities include investing in our businesses, acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We remain in a strong position to return cash to shareholders and are proud of our long history of returning value through dividends, which we have paid every quarter since going public in 1960.
This quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share.
Additionally, in assessing our capital allocation plan, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $150 million.
","Oxford Industries delivered record sales and earnings in Q3, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Direct-to-consumer sales surged 40%, driven by full-price retail and e-commerce growth. The strong performance was fueled by the power of the brand portfolio, product offerings, and exceptional customer experiences. Gross margin expanded significantly due to a higher proportion of full-price sales and the shift towards direct-to-consumer channels. The company continues to invest in digital marketing, resulting in improved customer metrics. For Q4, sales are projected between $285 million and $295 million, while adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to range from $1.20 to $1.35. Full-year guidance has been raised, with sales expected between $1.127 billion and $1.137 billion and adjusted earnings per share forecasted to be $7.52 to $7.67, surpassing pre-pandemic results. The company remains committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and will continue to invest in growth initiatives."
WHG_q1_2020.txt,"On the call today, we have Brian Casey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Forbes, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you're keeping safe in what's a difficult circumstances for all of us.
As always, I'll discuss our quarterly earnings and we'll cover the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our company.
Looking back, the past quarter was one for the record books.
The global COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, sending liquidity and returns sharply lower with much of the pain felt in March.
The S&P 500 suffered the worst first quarter performance since 1928 while global equity and fixed income markets were equally battered.
Investors remain focused on when the number of new cases of the virus may peak for clues about the future, though the path to economic recovery is anything but clear.
In our U.S. Value Equity products, the unprecedented sell-off in equities was large in absolute terms, but higher quality companies up and down the market cap spectrum were the best relative performers.
Every single one of our U.S. Value strategies outperformed its passive benchmark, as the benefits of active management were clearly evident.
Our flagship LargeCap Value strategy showed resilience during the sell-off, capturing only about 85% of the downside and posting nearly 400 basis points of outperformance relative to the Russell 1000 Value Index.
LargeCap Value is ahead of the benchmark over multiple time periods, and its ranking among institutional LargeCap Value peers remains strong.
Through the first quarter, our LargeCap Value strategy was in the top-decile for the trailing three-year period and in the top-quartile for the trailing one-, five- and seven-year periods.
Our LargeCap Select strategy also finished the quarter ahead of the Russell 1000 Value benchmark and it now possesses a ranking in the top-decile among institutional peers in the eVestment large-cap value manager universe for the trailing three-year time period.
Our SMidCap strategy also beat the Russell 2500 Value Index by over 400 basis points and now has returns above the benchmark in most trailing year periods.
Rankings among institutional peers were also strong.
The strategy now ranks in the top half ranking for the trailing five and seven years and the top-quartile for the trailing one- and three-year time periods.
Our portfolio managers have worked hard to improve the track record and we are seeing growing interest in the strategy from the institutional channel.
SmallCap was the hardest hit sector of our U.S. Value strategies, but our portfolio managers continue to focus on finding companies with strong fundamental qualities and finished the quarter ahead of the Russell 2000 Value benchmark by approximately 260 basis points.
Our institutional strategy also maintained attractive peer rankings with a top one-third placement for the quarter and trailing one-year time period.
SmallCap's longer-term tracker record places it in the top-decile over the trailing seven-, 10- and since inception time periods.
As we work through the economic situation created by the COVID-19, market volatility will create an attractive investment opportunity for high-conviction, actively managed portfolios centered around quality and value.
While the value style, which emphasizes companies priced at low valuation levels has historically performed best coming out of a recession, today, many companies have higher debt levels than in past cycles and may find themselves with limited options.
Financial distress is particularly acute in the energy sector and we're already seeing several companies filing for bankruptcy protection.
As the market pays more attention at balance sheets, the cream will rise to the top and the debt-laden companies of the past cycle will falter.
Our investment process has always incorporated a fundamental understanding of a candidate's balance sheet and that has historically served our clients well in times of stress.
Many index funds hold more than one-third of their portfolio in companies with zero profits and high debt levels.
Increasing losses and debt will kill a lot of these companies and we believe this to be an opportune time for investors to sell index funds and lean in on active managers, who can thoughtfully navigate through the minefield of winners and losers.
Turning now to our Multi-Asset group, our product line-up in Multi-Asset holds an array of strategies aligned across the risk and return spectrum that are tailored for a client specific risk profile and investment objective.
Income opportunity, our largest strategy in the group, showed attractive characteristics relative to the equity markets.
However, investors rush to assets perceived as safe, pushing treasury returns up and holding back our relative performance.
Asset classes such as preferreds, convertible bonds and mortgage-backed securities experienced large declines during the quarter.
The drop in convertible securities has provided opportunities not seen since the global financial crisis.
And it's created an opportune time for investors to look at strategies such as our Global Convertible and Alternative Income strategies that have historically delivered solid risk-adjusted results.
Our Global Convertible and Alternative Income strategies performed as expected and acted as diversifiers in an asset allocation mix during a very difficult and volatile time.
Correlations across capital markets went to one and volatility shot up to levels last seen during the global financial crisis.
Among institutional peers, our Alternative Income strategy ranked in the Top 20% for the trailing one-year and top-decile in the trailing five-, seven- and 10-year time periods.
In Emerging Markets, the valuation case remains positive, particularly relative to developed markets following the asset class' under-performance of recent years.
In our strategies, performance fell behind primarily due to our underweights in China and Hong Kong.
Globally, Emerging Markets had unprecedented volatility and the reaction to COVID-19 was swift and indiscriminate.
Investors reached for any kind of liquidity and these markets were particularly impacted by this flight to liquidity and safety.
This reaction also caused currencies in several emerging market countries in which we invest, including Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Chile to see larger sell-offs.
We do not believe this volatility is over yet.
The duration and depth of the shockwaves are still to be determined and will vary across geographies.
Outside China, some of the largest emerging markets are in the middle of lockdowns and government economic reactions are evolving.
As in our other strategies, dislocations in these markets have created opportunities to invest in companies with strong management teams, strong cash flow and solid balance sheets.
Our emphasis on quality companies has enabled us to manage through past crises and gives us conviction that our holdings will be well positioned for the long run.
Shifting to Wealth Management, our teams in Dallas and Houston have been actively contacting clients to assist them through the market's uncertainty.
Many of our larger high net worth clients are choosing to add to their accounts during this time to take advantage of the sell-off and position themselves for an eventual recovery.
We have broadened service offerings at Westwood Private Bank for our high net worth clients, improving our ability to retain clients in the Westwood branded ecosystem.
The combination of banking services, integrated with Westwood's existing financial planning, trust and investment services is resonating well with our clients.
As we move forward, Westwood Trust will begin rolling out our new digital portal to allow us to better engage with clients.
The Select Equity strategy, managed out of Westwood Trust Houston office, saw its risk management metrics work as expected this quarter, posting outperformance against its benchmark.
Select Equity and its tax-efficient counterpart is designed to provide a high-quality, low-turnover portfolio with risk controls for downside protection.
At the market's lows this quarter, both held up well due to the emphasis on risk control and investments in companies with high-quality balance sheets.
Both versions of our strategy recently completed their three-year track record and are ahead of their global benchmark.
Additionally, we tax loss harvest throughout the year instead of waiting until year-end, which helps lower our clients' tax bills and has provided over 200 basis points of additional annualized alpha over the last three years.
In our institutional and intermediary sales group, we had inflows of nearly $400 million and $950 million in outflows for total net outflows of $560 million.
Most of the outflows were in our sub-advisor relationships in LargeCap Value, Global Converts, Alternative Income and Emerging Markets.
SmallCap was again our most successful strategy with net inflows in the quarter as existing clients added funds to their accounts and new clients were earned into our mutual fund.
With the strong relative performance in our U.S. strategies, we feel that we're well positioned to capture sales in the current environment.
The investments we've made in distribution infrastructure and alignment of investment teams, vehicles, pricing, product definitions, risk guidelines and messaging have allowed us to create a cohesive message that positions our sales teams for success.
Our intermediary and institutional investment teams continue to work on adding consultant approvals; and overall, our pipeline remains healthy and spread across several different strategies.
New opportunities were added in SmallCap and Income Opportunity during the quarter and a large portion of our pipeline is in the mid- to late-stage and we are hopeful of decisions throughout the year.
We have made it well within the red zone on approvals for our SmallCap fund at several of the largest wirehouses.
Although COVID-19 has created market disruptions and slowed the sales cycle with prospects, our distribution teams continue to execute on our plan to build a broader, more sustainable distribution business and our client services teams continue to provide strong service to our clients.
While we're not able to conduct face-to-face meetings, our teams are functioning quite normally.
We did an online campaign to 25,000 advisors a few weeks ago and we were thrilled to see over 10,000 views.
Conference calls, portfolio updates, RFPs and questionnaires continue as usual.
We are cognizant of the fact that clients and consultants need timely and relevant communication.
They need communication on how the pandemic is affecting portfolios and our portfolio investment decisions and they're interested to know how our business continuity plan is functioning and changing.
Our success working remotely is also a key point of inquiry as clients work to understand how we've protected the integrity of our business in this environment.
Prior to COVID-19, the asset management industry was already experiencing disruption on several fronts, including fee compression, margin erosion and rising data, technology and other costs.
As I've noted in the past, Westwood made major investments in technology to reduce costs, gain operational efficiencies, prepare our business for disruptions and increase our agility.
Given recent events, these have proven to be a wise investment as we have not only increased efficiency, but we're able to move to a fully operational, remote working environment with little to no disruption.
We will continue to evaluate our business and take meaningful steps to reduce our cost structure.
To-date, we've identified over 750,000 of cost reductions that are being implemented or in process over the balance of the year.
We've been researching the outsourcing of trading for the past six months and recently made the decision to move forward with this project.
We will move to an outsourced trading model later this summer and expect to save over $1 million per year beginning in 2021.
We will continue to utilize technology to define our future state to be more efficient wherever possible.
We will close or eliminate commercially unviable funds and put only our best products and people on the field.
Although, financial performance over the last year has been disappointing, we continue to execute on numerous initiatives to strengthen our foundation for the future.
Our partnership with InvestCloud continues to reap operational benefits.
The U.S. Value and Multi-Asset strategies are delivering alpha and we have commitments from private wealth clients for a new credit opportunities fund that we launched a few weeks ago.
We expect industrywide disruption to continue and the steps we've taken to reinvent ourselves have placed us in a position to survive and grow.
Finally, I want to emphasize that the health and safety of our employees and their families is our first priority.
All our employees are well, working remotely and completing their work in an efficient manner.
We understand that we have a business to run and we're working hard to balance the company's needs with the employees' personal needs.
And I'm really proud of everyone at Westwood and how well everyone is working together, yet apart, during this difficult time.
Our customers still have goals and priorities and we will continue to service them to the best of our ability.
Today, we reported total revenues of $16.7 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $23.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.
The decrease from the fourth quarter and the prior year's first quarter was primarily due to lower average assets under management.
First quarter net income was $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $2.5 million or $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The decrease primarily related to lower total revenues and unrealized losses on private investments, partially offset by lower operating expenses and income taxes.
Economic earnings, a non-GAAP metric, were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share in the current quarter versus $5.4 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
First quarter net income of $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $0.4 million or $0.05 per share in the prior year's first quarter.
The increase primarily related to lower operating expenses, particularly employee compensation and benefits, foreign currency transaction gains and income taxes, partially offset by lower revenues and unrealized losses on private investments.
Economic earnings for the quarter were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share compared to $4.1 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2019.
Firmwide assets under management totaled $11.6 billion at quarter end and consisted of institutional assets of $6.3 billion or 55% of the total, wealth management assets of $3.8 billion or 33% of the total and mutual fund assets of $1.5 billion or 12% of the total.
Over the quarter, we experienced market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $0.6 billion.
Our financial position continues to be very solid with cash and short-term investments at quarter end totaling $82.4 million and a debt free balance sheet.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 272,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4.9 million.
In April, we repurchased an additional 407,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.1 million.
This completed the amount authorized under our share repurchase program.
That brings our prepared comments to a close.
","Westwood Holdings reported first-quarter earnings per share of $0.13, below $0.30 in Q4 2019, due to lower total revenues and unrealized losses. Revenue of $16.7 million also fell year-over-year from $23.9 million due to lower average assets under management. Non-GAAP economic earnings per share were $0.50, slightly below $0.64 in Q4 2019 but above $0.49 in Q1 2019. The company's U.S. Value Equity products outperformed their benchmarks, with the flagship LargeCap Value strategy ahead of the Russell 1000 Value Index for multiple time periods. Westwood's Multi-Asset and Emerging Markets strategies also exhibited resilience, although performance in Emerging Markets was impacted by asset class underperformance and currency sell-offs. Net institutional and intermediary outflows totaled $560 million, with SmallCap recording inflows. Cost-cutting initiatives will yield savings of over $750,000 in 2020, including the outsourcing of trading operations. Investment infrastructure improvements such as the partnership with InvestCloud and a new credit opportunities fund launch position the company for future growth."
EMR_q3_2021.txt,"Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan.
Colleen joins us from the Automation Solutions finance organization and will be your main point of contact going forward as I transition to a new role in the operating business units.
I certainly wish you health and success.
Please join me on slide two.
I certainly have big shoes to fill.
As Pete mentioned, I'm coming into this role from our Automation Solutions finance organization, and I've been with Emerson for over 13 years.
I'm certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our organization.
I look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon.
Now I would like to take a moment to highlight two areas of real ESG impact within Emerson.
First, on slide three, in keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson that we introduced in February, our first topic is about greening by Emerson.
It is a great example of how Emerson solutions are relevant in enabling our customers' sustainability initiatives.
Emerson recently signed a multiyear agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel technology and process for fully recycling plastic number five polypropylene back to a clear pellet.
As some of you may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options.
Emerson is serving as their born digital automation partner going forward with initial plant projects in Ohio, Georgia and a remote operation center in Florida.
Now please join me on slide number four.
Our second topic is the greening with Emerson example.
Leveraging our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology.
Expanding the applicability of heat pump technologies, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency in food retail and working to minimize energy use and leaks in commercial HVAC applications are just a few of the exciting areas of cooperation.
We have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy and their labs.
We look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions and real sustainability road maps going forward.
God speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity.
Great to have you here.
Colleen and I had the opportunity to spend couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we're very blessed to have her join our Investor Relations team.
And we have a lot of energy and momentum behind us, which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last three months.
I had the opportunity over the last six months to meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you as I go through the next part of the year.
But I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and of course, your investment.
A few things just that are not financially related that I want to mention to the team here.
First of all, our cultural work is well underway.
We will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month.
We're all very excited about the selection process.
It will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us as we navigate some of the challenges and create many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future.
Secondly, our portfolio work is complete.
We have -- we are now getting ready to review it with the Board, which will occur at the October Board meeting.
We discussed briefly with the Board yesterday.
And essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversification of the portfolio.
We're all very excited about the process that we underwent.
It was very exhaustive, and we have turned over a lot of different stones, defining broad markets with high growth and lots of optionality in terms of M&A and organic activity.
I'll mention on the M&A side that industrial software continues to be critical as we think about share of wallet, as we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration and our many pathways there.
Our SI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans.
So that's been very, very well done.
But what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team.
Yes, there were market tailwinds, and we'll talk about those, particularly as they accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued across our Commercial & Residential businesses and they are relevant, but the execution was absolutely phenomenal.
There were a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability.
We did a lot of expediting.
We had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of cargo around the world and of course, labor availability in the United States.
But the team just did a great job.
And we're seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being reflected in the incrementals of the company.
The operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong and now most importantly, has given us the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies and further -- that will further, I think, drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base.
So very exciting headroom that's created, and we started those investments.
And I'll share a number of those with you, and we'll talk about that more as we go through the year.
We're especially pleased with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described and Ram will talk about a little later in the call.
If you please go to slide six.
So a continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the cost reset actions, and it drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.09, up 36% from the prior year.
Demand continues to strengthen with sales coming in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15%, and June trailing 3-month orders were at 26%.
Automation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales and 17% on an underlying basis.
Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis.
The cost reset benefits continued to be realized as planned reading through to the margins.
And along with the additional volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased margin to 19.6%.
Cash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings.
We're continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program.
In this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring actions.
The program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as we've planned.
This is a bridge of the earnings per share increase from the prior year.
The operational performance was very strong.
So the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar.
Operations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms.
They both delivered strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Lal mentioned.
Leverage was 34% across the enterprise.
Tax, currency, pension, stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact from share repurchase.
Again, in total, adjusted earnings per share was $1.09, up 36%.
Please go to the next chart, Chart number eight.
So as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%.
Gross profit increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then the leverage on the volume across the enterprise.
We did offset the impact of price/cost headwinds, which we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters and we will talk about a little later in the call.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points.
Effective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in the prior year.
Last year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we described at the time.
This was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame.
Adjusted EPS, as mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80 last year.
If you go to slide nine, please, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow.
Adjusted segment EBIT again increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points.
The leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business.
Adjusted pre-tax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%.
Operating cash flow was very strong, up 31% at $1.1 billion.
Free cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management.
Lastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales.
Turning to slide 10, we'll look at Automation Solutions.
Underlying sales turned positive this quarter at 8%.
Trailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%.
The improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business.
We're seeing increasing KOB three activity across our process automation customer base mainly driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and opex spend.
MRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels from pent-up demand and delayed STOs.
capex spending is recovering at a slower rate with tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects.
The platform continues to implement the comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the financial results.
Adjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage.
The integration of OSI continues to go very well.
We're very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have.
Backlog increased to $5.5 billion.
It is up 17% year-to-date.
We'll talk a bit about the project funnel and other opportunities later in the call.
Turning to slide 11, we'll review Commercial & Residential Solutions.
Sales were up on an underlying basis 29% versus the prior year.
Orders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength.
The June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both Climate Technologies and Tools & Home products.
All our businesses and geographies showed strong double-digit growth.
Residential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and Professional Tools.
The Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets.
Europe was up 37%, driven by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools.
Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 25%, driven by Cold Chain and various heating technologies.
Margins improved by 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA driven by the strong volume leverage and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price/cost headwinds that we are seeing in the business.
I'm going to pass this over to Ram, and he's going to talk a bit about operations, what we've done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face.
Clearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations.
Steel prices are at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and in our estimation, have not peaked yet.
Plastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined alternatives to maintain supply.
And while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over $1.40 a pound year-over-year.
Our hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022.
Electronics shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022.
Very little component inventory on microprocessors, controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced by our EMS suppliers is growing, severely impacting lead times.
And finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our businesses are impacted as well.
Our V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities and rolling labor constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites has added a new level of complexity to our operational plans.
It is important to note that price/cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter.
No change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next two quarters.
Now despite these challenges, turning to slide 13, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve the needs of our customers.
Our supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants.
As you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis quickly and effectively.
Our regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well as supply chain that we spent many years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times.
Many of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surge demand and in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions.
Let's turn now to slide 15.
We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance.
We now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%, Commercial Residential above their range in May at 15% to 16% and Automation Solutions closer to the top of that range at 0% to 1%.
The strong volume and improved cost base will flow through to margins.
Our estimates are now 50 basis points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to approximately 18% and 23%, respectively.
There's no change to the restructuring, tax rate, capital spend or dividend.
Strong profitability and working capital performance enabled an increase in our operating cash flow and free cash flow estimates, both of which increased by $300 million.
We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.07, plus or minus $0.01.
Our price/cost headwind for 2021 currently remains as estimated in Q2 and Ram covered at $75 million despite the current challenges that were highlighted.
We continue to manage this through containment, selective price actions, but the recent market developments that Ram described will be challenged through the next two quarters as we navigate them.
Stock compensation impact increases to $125 million.
So now we'll go over to Chart 16, and I'll just frame the order environment that we've experienced through the last three months.
Emerson's trailing 3-month orders continue to be very strong and have momentum from the last update we gave you in the second quarter, with Commercial & Residential Solutions continuing to climb higher in their order run rates and Automation Solutions turned sharply positive to the high teens in June.
Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to see strength in Residential, Cold Chain and the Professional Tools business, and all three very near to that average band of 43%.
Discrete and hybrid end markets in Automation Solutions continue to be very strong, while we see recovery in later cycle process automation markets, especially in North America.
KOB three and KOB two are driving most of the recovery, but we are beginning to see some KOB one activity materialize, particularly in chemicals, power and biofuels.
The Americas really strengthened, up 29% as deferred maintenance demand and site access drove momentum.
Finally, as we have commented in the past quarters, life sciences momentum continues to be extremely strong.
Let's now turn to Chart 17, and I'll review the underlying sales growth outlook.
Q3 underlying sales were up 15% versus prior year, exceeding our management expectations, driven by the strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions as well as the North America recovery just discussed.
Full year expectations on underlying sales are between 5% and 6%, at the top end of our prior guidance of 3% to 6% and sales of approximately $18.4 billion.
The fourth quarter is expected to land in the high single digits to low double-digit range.
For the remainder of the year, we expect to see the North America business continue to recover in Automation Solutions as well as continued broad strength in commercial residential solutions.
However, the impact of supply chain and labor issues will be a challenge.
As Frank mentioned, for the full year, we are expecting Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% and Commercial & Residential Solutions to be between 15% and 16%, driving us to our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales expectations.
So starting off in the Americas.
Quarter four is expected to be strong in Automation Solutions at approximately 20% growth, broad-based recovery across all industries, led by continued strength in discrete and increasing strength in hybrid.
Process is showing some recovery, although uneven with some strength from returning domestic oil demand, offset by reduced midstream investment and continued fiscal restraint in upstream.
For KOB 3, we expect to see continued spend for deferred maintenance and increasing spend for site access that has been pent-up from the pandemic with an expectation that we will see a strong fall shutdown turnaround season.
In Latin America, strength in mining industries particularly are expected to continue.
On the Commercial & Residential side of the business, ongoing momentum in the residential markets, driven by do-it-yourself trends, home starts and HVAC seasonality as well as strength in Professional Tools and Cold Chain are expected to continue.
Europe will continue to see demand in life sciences and biofuels on the automation side.
Project wins in power, midstream, downstream and sustainability will drive low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4.
Commercial & Residential will see robust demand for heat pumps and professional tools as well as the continuation of the refrigeration market recovery in Q4.
Turning to Asia, Middle East and Africa.
Our Asia automation business is seeing healthy project activity in marine, nuclear, life sciences and semiconductors and a positive trend for site-level spending in the Middle East.
On the Commercial & Residential side, we are seeing the commercial recovery across the region, specifically with commercial AC and cold chain solutions.
Ongoing COVID restrictions continue to be a challenge across the organization, particularly in this part of the world.
Let's now turn to Chart 19, and we'll review the business funnel for Automation Solutions.
So back in February, we commented that our traditional large project funnel was $6.4 billion, and this should be something that is very familiar to those of you who watch this carefully.
Since February, we have booked approximately $80 million of projects, some LNG and one most notably in Mexico.
New projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining and LNG projects, while projects removed from the funnel since February were mostly oil and gas and downstream refining projects.
The August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion in approximately 180 projects.
And below in the donut pies, you can see the industry mix of our traditional funnel.
We have identified new decarbonization opportunities.
And though generally smaller than our traditional definition of projects for our funnel classifications, these projects are increasingly relevant to our business.
They're being added into this view because they have the potential to grow in nature over time.
Today, as depicted on the chart, these opportunities are worth $400 million in approximately 120 projects.
The combination of our traditional project funnel and the new sustainability funnel is now valued at $6.7 billion.
And below is the combined industry mix where we are working to diversify our funnel.
On the right side of the chart, we are introducing the business opportunities with our recent OSI acquisition, which gave us an important foothold into the transmission and distribution automation space.
These opportunities have slightly different characteristics from our traditional project funnel definition, and therefore, we are keeping it separate for our discussion purposes today.
Generally, these opportunities are smaller and more numerous compared to our large traditional project funnel, but they are clearly strategically important.
The value of these opportunities is $1.5 billion and are made up of 530 projects.
To give you some perspective on the scale and how differentiated it is, approximately 15% of that $1.5 billion has a value of greater than $5 million, and 50% of it is between $1 million and $5 million.
The funnel is global, although approximately $1 billion of it is in North America and Europe.
Overall, we have strong opportunities ahead, and I'm bullish on overall project outlook as we diversify and expand into new spaces.
Now let's turn to Chart 20.
This is a very important chart.
And as Frank mentioned in our financial results showcase, our robust cost reset plan is being incredibly well executed across the enterprise.
As a reminder, this comprehensive plan began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023.
It involves over $600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings.
In February, we also introduced our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5 in adjusted EPS.
We are very much on track to reach those targets by 2023.
Importantly, however, the recent outperformance and momentum through the end of 2021 is creating some headroom for critical investments.
And I'm particularly excited about this, particularly as I think about key technologies that will enable our business to outperform over the long term.
As you can see, revenues, margins and cash flow are all better than February expectations and are enabling this acceleration in technology investments.
I've outlined four examples below and will come out over the next months and in depth in February as to how we're managing and thinking about these very significant investments.
Examples outlined are the Copeland K7 scroll, which is the largest new product investment in the history of our air conditioning business.
This thing drives obviously increased performance and meets the 2023 efficiency regulations and is optimized for 2025 refrigerants.
The Greenlee remote cutters, an award-winning tool on the right-hand side of the chart, which enhances safety for cutting underground cables.
The Gemini, which is our next-generation pressure and temperature device being developed in our Measurement Solutions business, which will have next-generation electronics, unmatched safety and process insight.
And lastly, our Plantweb Optics, our integrated operational performance platform, which unifies data, people and systems to drive operational performance.
","Emerson reported strong results in Q3, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, up 36% year-over-year, driven by underlying sales growth of 15% and margin expansion. The report highlighted the company's success in executing its cost reset plan, with benefits flowing through to profitability. The Automation Solutions segment saw a turnaround in demand and sales, with underlying sales growth of 9%. Commercial & Residential Solutions continued its strong performance, with underlying sales growth of 29%. Despite headwinds from material inflation, material availability, and supply chain constraints, operational teams implemented creative solutions to mitigate impact and maintain production. Emerson experienced a 34% profit leverage at 19.6% margin. The report outlined key technology investments planned for acceleration, including new product launches in air conditioning, measurement solutions, and operational performance platforms. The company raised its 2021 sales and earnings guidance, with underlying sales growth now expected near the top of May's guidance of 5%-6%, adjusted EBIT margin guidance increased by 0.5% to 18%, and adjusted earnings per share guidance raised to $4.07. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges and material inflation, Emerson remains optimistic about the overall demand environment and its ability to navigate these headwinds."
FSS_q1_2021.txt,"I'm Ian Hudson, the Company's Chief Financial Officer.
Also with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
These documents are available on our website.
In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.
I'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our first quarter results, before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide her perspective on current market conditions, our progress against strategic initiatives, and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter with record orders and operating results, exceeding our expectations despite ongoing pandemic related disruptions.
We also had to navigate through the February ice storms in the south, which caused us to temporarily close our facilities in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.
Fortunately, we did not experience any significant damage, but we did lose several days of production.
Despite these challenges, the teams recovered well with both groups delivering adjusted EBITDA margins at or above levels achieved in the first quarter of last year.
That feed is even more impressive, given the strength of the prior year quarter, which included record production at our largest facility and minimal impact from the pandemic.
Turning now to the numbers where consolidated net sales for the quarter were $279 million compared to $286 million last year.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $27.8 million compared to $32.3 million last year.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $41.2 million compared to $43.9 million last year.
That translates to a margin of 14.8% in Q1 this year compared to 15.3% last year.
Net income for the quarter was $22.2 million compared to $23.4 million last year.
That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.36 per share compared to $0.38 per share last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38 per share, compared to $0.39 per share last year.
Order intake for the quarter was outstanding with orders of $384 million represent -- representing our highest quarterly orders on record and an increase of $80 million or 26% compared to Q1 last year.
Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter also set a new company record at $410 million that represents an increase of $9 million compared to Q1 last year and an increase of $106 million or 35% from the end of 2020.
In terms of our group results, ESG net sales for the quarter were $228 million compared to $233 million last year.
ESG's operating income for the quarter was $27.1 million compared to $29.4 million last year.
ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.3 million compared to $40 million in the prior year.
That translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% in line with last year.
EFC reported orders of $324 million in Q1 this year, an improvement of $87 million or 37% compared to last year.
SSG's net sales for the quarter were $51 million this year compared to $53 million last year.
Operating income for the quarter was $7.2 million dollars compared to $7.4 million last year.
SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was consistent with the prior year at around $8.2 million while its adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved to 16.2% of 80 basis points from Q1 last year.
SSG's orders for the quarter was $60 million compared to $66 million last year.
Corporate operating expenses for the quarter was $6.5 million, up from $4.5 million last year.
The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable year-over-year variance of $2.6 million associated with changes in mark-to-market adjustments of post-retirement reserves.
These market based adjustments benefited our earnings in Q1 last year by approximately $0.02 per share but were unfavorable in Q1 this year.
Turning now to the consolidated income statement where the decrease in sales contributed to a $6 million reduction in gross profit.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.7% compared to 26.1% last year.
As a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were down 20 basis points from Q1 last year, despite the unfavorable mark-to-market variance I just mentioned.
Other items affecting the quarterly results include a $700,000 increase in other income and a $400,000 decrease in interest expense.
Tax expense for the quarter was down $2.2 million dollars, largely due to lower pre-tax income levels and higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter with 18.4% compared to 23.5% last year.
The lower tax rate in Q1 of this year was in line with our expectations after we had included an estimate of excess tax benefits.
At this time, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
On an overall GAAP basis, we therefore earned $0.36 per share in Q1 this year compared with $0.38 per share in Q1 last year.
To facilitate earnings comparisons, we typically adjust our GAAP earnings per share for unusual items recorded in the current or prior year quarters.
In the current year quarter, we made adjustments to GAAP earnings per share to exclude acquisition related expenses, coronavirus-related expenses and purchase accounting expense effects.
On this basis, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.38 per share compared with $0.39 per share last year.
Looking now at cash flow where we generated $26 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an improvement of $21 million over Q1 last year.
We ended the quarter with $168 million of net debt and availability under our credit facility of $270 million.
Our current net debt leverage ratio remains low even after funding the acquisition of OSW during the quarter for approximately $53 million.
Our strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and pursue strategic acquisitions like OSW.
At the same time, we remain committed to pursuing strategic acquisitions and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
On that note, we paid dividends of $5.5 million during the quarter, reflecting an increased dividend of $0.09 per share.
And we recently announced a similar dividend for the second quarter.
It's been over a year now, since the pandemic began.
And while there have been many challenges along the way, I remain in awe of how our teams have responded modifying our work practices to keep employees safe, exercising flexibility in handling uncertain market conditions, and finding new ways to serve our customers.
[Technical Issues] continues to experience some ongoing COVID related disruptions, but conditions are improving.
Our companywide efforts to raise awareness about vaccines, assist our employees in gaining access to vaccines and encourage participation levels, are paying off and we are pleased to report that our domestic employee vaccination rates are ahead of the national average.
In fact, in Illinois, where we have three of our largest facilities and the corporate office, over 60% of our employees are now fully vaccinated.
With that, we've seen an uptick in our sales, resources, traveling, reinforcing our customer-centric value proposition and contributing to greater order intake.
As in the last two quarters, we again saw improved demand for our products with our first-quarter order intake setting a new record for the company, surpassing the previous high by over $50 million.
Our first quarter orders reflect strength in most of our end markets and growing confidence in a post-pandemic recovery, which seems to be further solidified by recent economic stimulus.
That sentiment seems to be shared widely by our dealer partners and customers across most of our businesses.
Demand for sewer cleaners remains strong, with first quarter orders up 30% year-over-year, and almost double the amount recorded last quarter.
Safe digging is also continuing to gain acceptance.
Over the last couple of years, approximately 70% of our sewer cleaners orders have included an optional safe-digging package, which allows our sewer cleaners to also be used for hydro or vacuum excavation purposes.
We saw similar trends this quarter with customer appreciation for the safety and efficiency benefits of safe digging gaining momentum.
At MRL, our road marking and line removal business, first quarter orders were the highest quarterly levels since we acquired the business in 2019.
And with its planned expansion now complete, we are well positioned to benefit from potential infrastructure investment.
Our road marking services business, Highmark also won an $8 million striping contract during the quarter.
Since the 4th quarter of last year, we've also seen an uptick in our industrial end markets with improved orders for our Guzzler and JetStream products heading into the spring-cleaning season.
In addition, our dump bodies and trailer businesses reported strong organic order growth of 28% across our end markets, achieving record backlog.
While our backlog is at a record high, there are a few factors that may limit us from realizing the full benefits from the operating leverage that we typically experience with backlog at these levels.
The first factor that many of you will be aware of is the impact of the global semiconductor shortage on chassis availability.
We started to see some supply tightness late last year and our teams were proactive in securing additional chassis and recommending to our customers and dealer partners that they do the same for those orders were they supply the chassis.
As a reminder, that is about 50% of the time for our ESG businesses, excluding TBEI, where the customer almost always supplies the chassis.
We were recently notified by one of our chassis suppliers that they are temporarily suspending production of certain chassis for up to 90 days in light of the semiconductor shortage.
The issue primarily impacts our sewer cleaners, safe digging trucks, and certain street sweeper models.
The situation remains fluid and the teams have been working hard to mitigate the impact of the short-term disruption.
Based on the data we have received, we expect the situation will be resolved during the 3rd quarter with production expected to ramp back quickly thereafter.
Because we do not rely on any one single TSC manufacturer, and with the proactive actions we took, we have been able to pivot quickly to minimize the financial impact.
For example, at Elgin, our team was able to adjust production schedules, so that we build a higher concentration of the three-wheel Pelican sweepers during the period of the expected impact.
As a reminder, for that product line, we actually manufacture the chassis ourselves.
At our Streator facility, where we make sewer cleaners and Safe digging trucks, we have had an ongoing effort to secure additional chassis from other manufacturers.
However, because of lead times on certain chassis, there is a period of approximately two weeks where we have a shortage at Vactor.
With the goal of optimizing efficiency, the teams have worked diligently to manage the schedule, so that this brief pause will occur over the July 4 holiday.
With the additional chassis supply that we have secured, we are expecting a ramp up in production thereafter.
Like most companies, we are also experiencing rising commodity costs.
As our teams have done in the past, we took proactive measures such as locking in pricing and securing availability of steel based on forecasted needs.
Our teams are working diligently to mitigate the impacts of rising commodity costs by implementing price increases and surcharges where possible.
As it relates to labor availability, our ongoing commitment to environmental social and governance continues to benefit our company.
Investment in our employees differentiates us and our ability to attract labor at the majority of our facilities.
I now want to take a few minutes to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
We remain bullish about Safe digging prospects, and with noted industrial end market recoveries and infrastructure spend optimism throughout the channel, we are confident Safe digging trends will continue to improve.
Our TRUVAC safe digging product line portfolio includes a complete range of truck mounted safe digging equipment with applications across a number of end markets.
We were pleased to see that TRUVAC product demonstrations for the quarter were up 70% from last year.
As I just mentioned, these education efforts are also having a positive impact in sewer cleaners demand with the inclusion of the optional safe digging package, turning our sewer cleaners into a multi-purpose vehicle.
We also continue to make progress with our aftermarket initiative with aftermarket revenues for the quarter improving by 6% and representing a higher share of ESG's revenues for the quarter at around 27%.
We continue to closely monitor rental fleet utilization and remain disciplined in making decisions about the size and composition of our fleet.
As part of that process, we have seen healthy used equipment sales in recent months and an uptick in rentals.
We are monitoring the current COVID situation in Canada with Ontario and many other provinces being subject to some of the most extreme stay-at-home measures since the start of the pandemic.
While we have not experienced any significant financial impact to date, we may see some impact in our Canadian markets over the next few months, which is typically a seasonally strong period for equipment rentals and part sales.
On the organic growth front, we have several new product launches in the pipeline, a few of which I'll touch on today.
Within ESG, street sweeper electrification remains a key area of investment.
We have previously talked about our first orders for hybrid electric broom bear street sweeper, which are currently expected to ship later this year.
This hybrid model, uses both battery energy and either CNG or diesel power for sweeping, with performance designed to meet or exceed current sweeper performance.
The hybrid broom bear is now being demonstrated by our dealer channel, primarily on the West Coast and then moving to the Southeast, and the feedback to date has been encouraging.
In addition, development of a hybrid version of our most popular line of street sweepers, the Pelican, is under way.
The plug-in hybrid electric Pelican sweeper is assembled and undergoing testing with product demonstrations plan for the second half of this year.
Within our dump body and trailer product portfolio, we are also realizing benefits from new product introductions.
During the quarter, products launched over the last year equated to organic growth of about 4%.
Within SSG, based on the nature of its product portfolio, our innovation pipeline typically includes a higher volume new product introductions and enhancements, that while individually may not have a significant financial impact, collectively aggregate to meaningful organic growth.
For example, we launched production of our MicroPulse line during the quarter.
The MicroPulse is a low profile, high performance LED lighting product for both first responders and work truck vehicle.
The line includes production of both new product models and those that were previously outsourced.
In sourcing this line, which leverages automated laser technology, is estimated to improve the related margins and drive annual savings of over $1 million.
In addition, we are currently on track to launch a low cost light [Phonetic] power in the second quarter.
In addition to these organic growth initiatives, M&A will continue to contribute meaningfully to our future growth.
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of OSW, a leading manufacturer of dump bodies and a customer upfitter of truck equipment and trailers.
The acquisition provides considerable opportunity for long-term value creation through the application of our 80/20 improvement principle, organic growth initiatives and additional bolt-on acquisitions.
Last week, we held an initial 80/20 improvement training session at OSW, which was well received by the teams.
Integration is well under way, and while it is still early days, OSW was off to a solid start in the first quarter.
Our M&A pipeline has been active to say the least.
And it's been exciting to be back on the road visiting potential targets.
As Ian noted in his comments, our financial position and liquidity are strong, enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions and there are a number of M&A opportunities our teams are currently reviewing.
We have also continued to make significant investments in our existing plans to add capacity to support our long-term growth and to gain operational efficiencies through automation.
As we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint, we are evaluating our long-term strategy with respect to our Elgin and University Park production facilities in Illinois.
Both properties are currently leased at above market rates with lease terms ending in 2023.
We are currently looking at opportunities and alternative facilities in the surrounding areas as we proactively plan for a potential move.
The American rescue plan, COVID release package, includes approximately 1.9 trillion of economic stimulus with approximately $350 billion going to state, local and territorial governments with the goal of keeping frontline workers employed, distributing the vaccine, increasing testing, reopening schools, and maintaining essential services.
We are actively educating our dealer channel about the stimulus program and have distributed the latest estimate allocation of the $350 billion of state and local government support by jurisdiction to our dealer channel to share with its customer base.
As a provider of equipment for -- used for essential services like sewer kitting and street sweeping, Federal Signal stands to benefit meaningfully from additional aid that may be provided to state local sources for these purposes.
As was evident with our first-quarter order intake, our dealer partners remain optimistic about market conditions in 2021, noting that both corporate and sales tax collections appear to have held up better than originally anticipated, which should add stability to their revenue sources.
We expect that our long-term infrastructure bill will provide visibility for project planning and could see capital equipment demand increases in areas such as roads, bridges, broadband, Clean Energy and public transportation buildup.
We anticipate that this will provide benefits for the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, Safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners and street sweepers.
We have positioned Federal Signal in a manner in which we fully participate in the post-pandemic recovery by increasing capacity within our facilities, reducing lead times to a level where we can better respond to customer needs, investing in new product development and gaining market share.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year.
Orders thus far this year have exceeded our expectations, fueled by a combination of new product launches ongoing execution against our strategic initiatives and strong recovery in our end markets.
With certain chassis manufacturers temporarily impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, we are currently encountering some short-term production challenges at our largest facility.
Our teams are working diligently to navigate through this disruption as they have in the past when faced with similar situation.
After factoring in the impact expected over the next couple of months, at this time, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year of $1.73 to $1.85.
With our recently completed capacity expansion at several facilities, we are well positioned once the current chassis uncertainty eases.
Demand for our products is at an all-time high, with the recent federal stimulus, and the possibility of infrastructure investment offering potential for further momentum, which we have not factored into our current outlook.
","Federal Signal delivered a strong first quarter, exceeding expectations with record orders and operating results. Order intake surged to $384 million, a 26% increase year-over-year, with all end markets showing strength and optimism for a post-pandemic recovery. Consolidated net sales reached $279 million, but consolidated gross margin declined to 24.7% due to the drop in sales. Adjusted EBITDA stood at $41.2 million, resulting in a margin of 14.8%. Despite challenges, including disruptions from the February ice storms and semiconductor shortages affecting chassis availability, the company maintained its adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year at $1.73 to $1.85. The acquisition of OSW in the quarter adds to Federal Signal's growth trajectory, while investments in new product development, capacity expansion, and operational efficiency are expected to further bolster performance in the long term."
CL_q4_2020.txt,"This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.
Actual results could differ materially from these statements.
I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full-year performance as well as our 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021.
We will then open it up for Q&A.
As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.
We finished 2020 in very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis.
Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance.
For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth, organic growth in all four of our categories: oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well.
Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement.
We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange.
Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter.
Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in prices.
The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind.
In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 100 basis points year over year and a base business basis where we were up 90 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin while raw materials were a 320 basis-point headwind driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 280 basis-point benefit.
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year.
On the base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis.
This was primarily driven by a 210 basis-point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation, and e-commerce.
Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S., and investments behind growth and innovation.
For the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points driven primarily by a 100 basis-point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics cost.
For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year over year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis.
Our earnings per share was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis.
For the full year, our earnings per share growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.
We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year.
As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Filorga transaction with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.
A few comments on our divisional performance.
North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic.
We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our skin health businesses in the quarter.
Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales.
North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the hum by Colgate Electric Brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening pen, our toothpaste business, and Irish Spring.
Latin American net sales were down low single-digit as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.
The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year.
Oral care innovation has been a key growth driver with Colgate Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal, and our Natural Extracts line, all driving incremental growth.
Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter.
Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all three segments; oral care, personal care, and home care, and in every hub.
Strong oral care volume growth on the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional media and digital.
We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga where a strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel.
We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest hubs; Greater China, India, the Philippines, and South Pacific.
In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate Vedshakti in India, and our relaunched Colgate Anticavity business across the division.
Our personal care and home care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region.
Africa/Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all three categories and in every hub.
Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Maxfresh, and Colgate Total.
Meridol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel.
Hill's finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons.
Organic sales growth was again led by the US with e-commerce up significantly.
But Europe also delivered double-digit growth.
Encouragingly, we are seeing a reacceleration in our Prescription Diet business as vet channel traffic continues to improve.
And now for guidance.
We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range.
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low-single-digit benefit for the year, although we expect currencies to remain volatile.
We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%.
We expect our gross profit margin to be up year over year in 2021 despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials, and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID.
Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020.
Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both the GAAP and base business basis.
We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings-per-share growth in the low-to-mid single digits.
On a base business basis, we expect earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits.
Obviously, this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year.
There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range.
In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap, and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year over year in 2021 depending on the market.
However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels.
Also, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing.
We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment, and foreign exchange.
Raw materials, we have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated.
If this continues, it could put pressure on gross margin expansion depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity.
We've seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S., but also related to shipping containers in Asia.
We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term but to moderate later in the year.
Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year.
Stan joined us back in November, as we announced, and obviously, we're deeply excited to have him here.
He has hit the ground running already.
As I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished.
On our first quarter call I discussed three topics related to how we plan to manage through the crisis.
These three topics were: staying true to our values and purpose in helping us navigate a very difficult environment; adapting our strategies where necessary and executing with agility; and importantly, managing through the crisis with an eye toward the future.
On the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy, while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization.
Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people, and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority.
We worked with the World Health Organization this year and local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of.
In the second area, we continue to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY, increasing our brand building globally, and executing against our digital transformation.
And as John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow.
We were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizable negative impact from foreign exchange.
But most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, ad that was the third topic, managing through this crisis with an eye toward the future.
So now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond.
There are three reasons: the first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth.
As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways.
Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products, we can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products.
So we have strengthened existing tools and, importantly, built new capabilities to drive this growth.
For example, on Hill's, we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration on what is truly a differentiated brand.
Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time.
It's not just spending more, but spending smarter.
In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment.
For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management.
As I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products.
Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems, and innovation for new channels, all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently.
And given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth.
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth.
We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line.
We need to deliver profitable growth.
You can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings-per-share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization.
We're doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focus on all cost elements throughout the income statement.
Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in the transformation capabilities that we're deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.
The third reason is that we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people.
As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched.
In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth.
To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation, like the Optic White pen, the Miracle Repair serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities.
And all this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales.
And lastly, it's building out the right team.
You need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization.
We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation.
Like our transition SAP S/4HANA that's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions.
We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed, and capability building our ability now to develop applications must faster and realize the value of those applications much faster; and with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead.
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process.
You will remember that was called CBP that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management.
So to sum it up, when I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future.
","Colgate delivered strong Q4 results with 7.5% net sales growth driven by balanced organic growth across all categories. Despite foreign exchange headwinds, gross profit margin expanded 90 basis points on a base business basis, supported by strong pricing and productivity benefits. SG&A expenses rose 100 basis points due to increased advertising, logistics costs, and growth investments. Earnings per share grew 5% on a base business basis. For 2021, Colgate anticipates net sales growth of 4% to 7%, organic sales growth within its target range of 3% to 5%, and mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth on a base business basis. The company expects gross profit margin expansion despite rising raw material costs and continued COVID-19 uncertainties. It remains optimistic about its pricing strategy and is investing in digital transformation and e-commerce, where sales grew over 50% in Q4."
SIX_q1_2021.txt,"And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.
In addition, on the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
Investors can find both the detailed discussion of business risks and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the company's Annual Reports quarterly reports and other forms filed or furnished with the SEC.
We have divided our call into 3 parts.
First, I will provide an overview of our recent operating performance and the strong demand trends we are seeing second Sandeep will go into more detail about our financial results and give an update on the progress of our transformation plan.
Finally, I will return to discuss why we are excited about our future over both the short and long-term.
I am pleased to be able to report that the 2021 season is off to a strong start.
Despite the significant challenges due to the pandemic, last year we were the first company able to safely reopen a theme park in North America.
This year, we had the first theme parks open in California and in many cases we have opened our parks earlier than in 2019.
We have either opened or announced firm opening dates for all of our theme parks, with the exception of Montreal this is due to the creativity adaptability of our Six Flags team who worked hard to establish the highest standards of cleanliness and safety protocols.
I'm also pleased to report that our guests are excited to return to Six Flags and we are seeing strong demand across all of our markets.
I've spent the last couple of months visiting many of our parks, which has allowed me to connect with our great team members understand reopening challenges reinforce our priorities and examine the effectiveness of our operations.
My time with our outstanding park leaders only reaffirms that we have a highly capable team a healthy industry and a resilient business.
Our full-time team members appreciate that we stood by them throughout the crisis.
The signed a strong consumer demand for our parks are very clear.
Through this past weekend our year-to-date attendance trends have accelerated at our open parks increasing to 79% of 2019 levels compared to 51% in the 4th quarter of 2020.
We are seeing strong guest spending per capita and our active pass base has surpassed prior year first quarter levels placing us solidly on track toward recovery we have center decision making squarely on our guests extending privileges for season passes and memberships while also offering high tiered benefits to our members who continue their payments and they have rewarded us with their loyalty.
Experiencing such robust demand.
At this time of year does present operational challenges however.
We have encountered difficulty, fully staffing our parks upon reopening with a shortage of labor availability due to many factors, including school COVID schedules, immigration restrictions limiting the number of international temporary worker visas, and extended unemployment benefits keeping people at home.
We expect these labor challenges to start to abate as we enter the core of our operating season at the same time, the overall operating environment remains challenging, as we balance the requirement to delivering a safe experience during the pandemic, while still delighting our guests, our safety protocols have reduced right throughput, which can result in longer the normal lines and less rides per guest.
We are continuing to require masks in our parks but we will constantly assess as policy and partnership with our industry, the CDC and local health officials.
We are also working with local health officials and eliminating constraints around park capacity and right seating as more Americans receive their vaccinations.
Our outdoor venues have a tremendous amount of open space.
Therefore our parks are naturally conducive to social distancing and all states are supportive of working with us to safely increase attendance levels our recent results in guest surveys indicate that there is extraordinary demand for outdoor entertainment options close to home and we believe that this widespread desire will help drive attendance in the coming quarters.
So while it is still early in the season.
We are pleased by recent trends and are optimistic about both the short and long-term prospects of our business.
In the first quarter, we also continue to make progress on our transformation plan, which focuses on strengthening our core business and we are on track to achieve our previously issued financial targets.
I want to start by stressing that results for the first quarter are not comparable to prior year because we closed all of our parks in mid-March last year prior to the spring break for most of our parks.
For that reason, I will provide comparisons to 2019.
Total attendance for the quarter was 1.3 million guests a 38% decline from first quarter 2019.
Revenue in the quarter was down $46 million or 36% to $82 million.
Because of our fiscal quarter change our first fiscal quarter 2021 ended on April 4 instead of March 31 as it did in 2019.
As a result, our 2021 results include four calendar days in April when many of our parks operated during which we had 293,000 of attendance and this was inclusive of the Easter holiday weekend.
In 2019, the Easter holiday, which affects the timing of spring break in many of our markets occurred in the second quarter.
So far through this past weekend year-to-date attendance had open parks is trending at 79% versus 2019.
As a reminder our second fiscal quarter in 2021 will end on July 4 and will include a majority of the July 4 holiday weekend which will shift attendance out of the 3rd quarter and into the second quarter of this year relative to calendar in 2019.
Total guest spending per capita increased 16% in the quarter versus 2019.
Since the beginning of the membership program, a portion of the membership revenue has been allocated between admissions spending and in park spending.
Beginning in October 2020 the company prospectively began allocating an incremental portion resulting in a reduction in admission spending per capita and an increase in in-park spending per capita with no change in total guest spending per capita.
Applying a pro forma allocation to 2019 admissions spending per capita increased 17% and in-park spending per capita increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019.
The increase in admissions spending per capita compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher realized ticket deals for both single day tickets and the active pass base as our revenue management team focused on leveraging our pricing and product mix.
The increase in in-park spending per capita compared to 2019 reflected high consumer demand for our products.
Attendance from our active pass base in the first quarter represented 54% of total attendance versus 64% percent for the first quarter of 2019 demonstrating a more balanced approach to ticket sales.
On the cost side, cash operating and SG&A expenses versus 2019 decreased by $29 million or 20% primarily due to the following.
First, cost savings from our transformation efforts.
Second, savings and labor utilities and other costs related to the fact that several of our parks were not operating and third lower advertising costs.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $46 million compared to a loss of $42 million in the first quarter 2019.
GAAP loss per share was $1.12 compared to a loss of $0.82 in 2019, primarily due to the lower attendance in our parks.
We are pleased with the retention of our active pass base of 4.1 million pass holders, which included 1.7 million members and 2.4 million traditional season pass holders at the end of first quarter 2021.
Our active pass base is up 1% compared to first quarter 2020 and down only 9% compared to first quarter 2019.
As we reopen our parks.
We are steadily reducing the number of paused members to near zero.
The retention of these members is a testament to our unique offering and loyal following.
Looking ahead, we expect the active pass base trends to continue to improve as we have begun selling new season passes and memberships.
A very large active pass base is a tremendous asset for our company as pass holders generated more annual revenue and cash flow then single day visitors.
The utilize excess capacity as they tend to visit during off peak periods and shoulder months.
We also provide a weather hedge since they pay in advance and have the ability to visit for the entire season.
Finally, our members, provide a source of recurring revenue that smooths our cash flow and makes our earnings less seasonal.
Deferred revenue as of April 4, 2021 was $245 million, up $96 million or 65% compared to first quarter 2020 and up $67 million or 38% compared to first quarter 2019.
The increase was primarily due to the deferral of revenue from members and season pass holders whose benefits were extended through 2021 and the acceleration of season pass sales over the past few weeks of the quarter.
We expect to recognize most of this deferred revenue in 2021.
The capital expenditures for the quarter was $23 million.
We expect our full-year 2021 capital spend to be slightly lower than 2020 due to the carryover of new rights that were delivered and paid for, but not commission in 2020.
Our liquidity position, as of April 4 was $524 million this included $461 million of available revolver capacity net of $20 million of letters of credit and $63 million of cash.
This compares to a liquidity position of $618 million as of December 31, 2020.
Net cash outflow for the quarter was $95 million representing an average of $32 million per month.
This is significantly better than the projection of 53 million to $58 million per month that we gave on our last earnings call.
This improvement was driven by higher than expected attendance and season pass sales.
Based on our anticipated park schedules we expect to be cash flow positive for the balance of the year and will not be providing a quarterly outlook on cash flow going forward.
We are obligated each April to offer to purchase the outstanding partnership units from the unitholders who own the third-party interests of Six Flags over Texas, Six Flags over Georgia and Six Flags White Water Atlanta.
Less than $1 million of value in units has been put to Six Flags during the current year tender period that will end later today.
I would now like to give you an update on the progress of our transformation plan.
We expect the transformation plan to unlock $80 million to $110 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA once fully implemented and attendance returns to 2019 levels.
In 2021, we expect to achieve $30 million to $35 million from our organizational redesign and other fixed cost reductions.
We have already realized more than $8 million through the first quarter of this year.
As part of our transformation plan, we have incurred $44 million in cost so far through the first quarter 2021 including the non-cash write-offs of $10 million that occurred in 2020.
We expect to incur the remaining $26 million in 2021 and 2022, the majority of which is related to investments in technology, including a new CRM system.
We continue to make progress with our revenue and cost initiatives as shown by the positive impact on our attendance, per capita spending and cost savings.
Our new revenue management team is up and functioning as we focus on leveraging pricing and product mix, to drive incremental unique attendance and yield higher admissions and in park spending per capita.
We launched more than 20 RFPs as part of our non-headcount cost savings initiatives and we are seeing very promising results especially in procurement savings.
We began migrating toward centralized shared services in finance, IT and human resources and we began testing our new park labor scheduling system.
In closing my own remarks the operating environment remains dynamic.
We will not be providing annual guidance at this time.
However, we are extremely encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in our attendance trends and the value creation that will come from implementing our transformation plan.
We feel we are well positioned as we enter the heart of our 2021 operating season now, I'll pass the call back over to Mike.
Sandeep innovation is in our DNA.
In 2021, we will be introducing several record breaking and first of their kind rides including the Jersey Devil Coaster at Six Flags greater venture in New Jersey, the world's tallest fastest and longest single rail coaster inspired by New Jersey folklore.
Tsunami surge at Six Flags Great American Illinois which will be the world's tallest water coaster and we are reintroducing West Coast racers at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California, the world's first racing coaster with side by side tracks, which is the parks 19th coaster.
In addition, we are rebranding our water parks in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in Rockford, Illinois to Hurricane Harbor in creating a separate gate for our water park in Gurnee Illinois creating our 27th parks.
Finally, due to its popularity we will continue to operate our Drive-thru Safari in New Jersey as a separately gated attraction.
The parks successfully opened in March, creating the longest season in the Safari's history.
We will also be investing in our park infrastructure adding technology to help us modernize the guest experience and in specific areas like food and beverage to help us improve our overall food quality and efficiency.
In addition, to new ride and infrastructure investments we will be introducing numerous new events and festivals in our parks this year.
Some examples include roller coaster power hours and event held on Thursday and Friday evenings with unlimited number of gas can ride roller coasters non-stop while listening to a live DJ.
Our Mardi Gras Festival which continues to grow popularity, is one of our tent pole events in a bigger than ever, July 4 Fest which includes fireworks and in Park events.
I believe Six Flags is well positioned to delight our guests and to create significant value for our shareholders.
In the near term, my optimism is based on a few factors, first reopening progress.
We have approval to operate nearly all of our parks either today or in the near future.
And we have proven in several markets that we can safely operate our parks without capacity restrictions.
So we expect to gradually ramp our capacity back to normal levels while adhering the social distancing and other safety protocols.
Second, consumer demand is very strong.
Attendance at our open parks continues to accelerate as US consumers are eager to get out and have fun and Six Flags sits squarely in the middle of everything a consumer is looking for right now.
Our venues are extremely safe.
They are outdoors and provide ample room for social distancing, our safety standards and protocols have been recognized as best in class by all state, city and county officials.
In addition, the vast majority of our guests drive to our parks so we are not dependent on air travel.
Third, our active pass base continues to grow, which positions us well for the upcoming operating season with a built-in base of guest.
As I mentioned in my opening statement we are proud of our high customer retention and customer loyalty.
Customer loyalty is a very powerful competitive edge of Six Flags and one that provides a valuable recurring revenue stream.
Over the long term I'm optimistic for several reasons.
First, we have a unique value proposition.
Our combination of thrill rides and entertainment for the entire family provides a truly unique experience in an affordable form of entertainment that is resilient even in difficult economic periods.
In addition, our parks are located in each of the top 10 markets in the US, giving us access to the biggest and most lucrative markets around the country.
Second, it our transformation initiative will fundamentally improve our guest experience and our profitability.
We are already seeing the early benefits in our improved single day ticket mix, our in-park spending growth and cost savings from our leaner organizational structure in our procurement efforts, but we're just getting started and we are on track to deliver the full $80 million to $110 million of incremental EBITDA when we are back in a normalized operating environment.
Third and most importantly, we have a talented and dedicated team of people who have created a guest centric culture.
Our team members have exhibited tremendous resiliency during a very challenging period.
Our organizational design resulted in a strong balance of theme park expertise and outside industry perspectives, which will help us stay true to the past while embracing the future.
The strength of our people is truly why I'm confident that our future is bright.
We believe the strategic actions we are taking to transform our company will drive our growth and enhance shareholder value.
I look forward to updating you on our continued progress and as we ramp back up to normal operations, you can expect to hear about our progress in our three key strategic initiatives.
To modernize the guest experience through technology, to improve operational efficiency and to drive financial excellence.
Catherine, at this point.
Could you please open the call for any questions.
","Despite COVID-19 challenges, Six Flags reported a strong start to the 2021 season. As of April 4th, attendance at open parks reached 79% of 2019 levels, surpassing the 51% reported in Q4 2020. Total revenue for Q1 2021 was $82 million, a 36% decrease from 2019. Six Flags faced labor shortages due to various factors, which may ease as the season progresses. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $46 million, with a GAAP loss per share of $1.12, primarily due to lower attendance. The company's active pass base remains strong with 4.1 million pass holders, though it has declined slightly since 2019. Total guest spending per capita increased by 16% compared to 2019, driven by higher ticket and in-park spending. Six Flags anticipates $30-$35 million in incremental EBITDA in 2021 from its transformation plan, which includes organizational redesign and cost reductions. The company expects to invest slightly less capital in 2021 compared to 2020. Six Flags expressed optimism about the upcoming season, citing strong consumer demand, a growing active pass base, and progress in its transformation plan to improve the guest experience and profitability."
IPG_q2_2021.txt,"We hope you are all well.
We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures.
We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Philippe Krakowsky.
As always, I'll start with a high level view of our performance in the quarter.
Ellen will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies to be followed by Q&A.
These include the transition to work from home, and now are planning for return to office in many parts of the world, as well as the significant personal difficulties presented by the long course of the pandemic.
It's due to the efforts of our people, their commitment to their craft, our clients and to each other that we can share with you today these very strong results.
Performance that demonstrates our resilience represents a remarkable rebound from the impact of the pandemic, and is also the largest second quarter in our company's history.
Our strong results in the quarter build on IPG's consistent record of industry outperformance and margin expansion.
Our growth across regions, disciplines and client sectors speaks to more than a recovering global economy.
It underscores the elevated value that marketing and media partners can deliver in the integration of creativity, technology and data at scale made the significantly increased velocity of digital transformation.
At Interpublic, we're confident that we are attuned to the powerful currents that are transforming consumer behavior and are required for business relevance.
And then we are increasingly delivering differentiated and higher-end solutions that help our clients win in a world of accelerated technological and societal change.
That takes creativity and precision, data and accountability, all of which we're able to bring together in customized teams that drive talent from across our portfolio.
Ultimately, our growth speaks to our ability to drive outstanding business results for our clients.
Our net organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 19.8%.
That's against the second quarter of 2020 when as you will recall our organic change was negative 9.9%, which while well ahead of our peer group did mark our steepest decrease of the recession.
It's also important to note that our 7.9% organic increase this quarter relative to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019.
Compared to last year, our organic growth was at double-digit rates around the world.
In the US, it was 17.4%, growth in our international markets ranged from 14% in the Asia-Pacific region to 49% in Latin America.
We also had a very broad contribution from our operating segments and disciplines.
Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically with increases led by media, data and technology and with solid contributions from our global integrated networks.
There was also strength across most of our disciplines led by healthcare.
At our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 15.1% with strong increases from last year's heavily impacted Q2 across Octagon's sports and entertainment and Jack Morton's experiential offerings.
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of comprehensive acceleration.
Each of our eight major sectors had double-digit increases from a year ago.
The auto, retail and other sectors were up more than 20%, consumer goods, tech and telecom and healthcare increased in the mid to high teens, food and beverage and financial services were up in the low double-digit range.
Turning to operating expense and profitability.
Our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline.
And while remaining focused on appropriate cost control, we're also continuing to invest to support accelerating growth.
We continue to see the benefits of cost improvements from strategic restructuring actions taken last year, notably in our payroll expense and our expense for occupancy.
We also continue to see the benefits of low variable expenses as a result of the highly restrictive global travel environment and from the cost efficiencies of a largely remote workforce.
As we look ahead to post-pandemic work life, it's worth noting that we can, of course, expect that expenses for travel, meetings, office utilities and alike will begin to return in the second half of this year, most notably in Q4 and of course into next year.
Our second quarter net income was $263.3 million as reported.
Adjusted EBITDA was $405.8 million and adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue was 17.9%.
Our results reflect significant operating leverage compared to both last year and the 2019 period on our expense for base payroll and our office and other expenses.
We delevered on our expense accrual for our performance based incentive compensation plans, but our operating performance is tracking well ahead of planned target.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and was $0.70 as adjusted for the after tax expense of the amortization of acquired intangibles.
As we look to the balance of the year, you'll recall that in April, we shared a full year 2021 performance outlook based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery.
At that time, we outlined our view toward full year organic growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 15.5%.
In light of our very strong second quarter and also having recently refreshed our bottom-up outlook for the second half of the year based on conversations with our clients and operating teams, we believe it's appropriate at the mid-point of this quite unusual year, unprecedented, in fact, to upgrade those expectations.
Of course, we do sadly need to recognize that the COVID pandemic and the related risks to the macro environment are not yet behind us.
In particular, as we look ahead, we all understand that lagging vaccination rates in many parts of the world and the emergence of new variants may entail a higher COVID risk.
That's something we'll watch closely as we enter the second half of the year, especially our seasonally important fourth quarter.
With predicated on the continued progress and public health issues, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year of 9% to 10%.
And with that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 16%.
As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders.
We'll of course keep you apprised of progress as the year develops and we look forward to those conversations.
On that note, I'd like to hand over the call to Ellen now for more in-depth view of our results.
I hope that everyone is safe and healthy.
Adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $405.8 million, and margin was 17.9%.
These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous second quarter.
With growth having accelerated, certain variable expenses continue to lag and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.66 as reported and $0.70 as adjusted before the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles.
Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter.
I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.
Turning to second quarter revenue on slide four.
Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.27 billion, an increase of $416.2 million from a year ago.
Compared to Q2 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 3.1% with the US dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets.
Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points.
Our organic net revenue increase was 19.8%, which brings us to 10.6% organic growth for the six months.
At the bottom of this slide, we breakup segment revenue in the quarter.
Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically.
We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, McCann, FCBs with healthcare, a significant driver, MullenLowe, Huge and R/GA.
At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 15.1%, which reflects some recovery of the events and sports marketing offerings within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic.
Our public relations offerings also had solid growth in the quarter.
Moving on to slide five, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region.
In the US, which was 63% of net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 17.4%.
Revenue decreased a year ago in the same period by 8%.
Year-on-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB driven by healthcare, IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge.
International markets were 37% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 24.4% organically.
You'll recall that the same market decreased 13.1% a year ago in the second quarter which ranged by region between negative 10% and negative 15%.
Continental Europe grew 27.9% with notably strong growth in Germany, Spain and France.
There were a number of operating highlights in the region led by media, data and tech, McCann, R/GA and DXTRA.
The UK increased 18.7% organically, led by McCann, DXTRA, media, data and tech and R/GA.
Asia-Pac grew 14% organically.
Our organic growth was paced by Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India, while China and Japan decreased.
Our organic growth in LatAm was 49% with exceptional results across the region, including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
Our other markets group grew 29.2% with notably strong performance in the Middle East and Canada.
Moving on to slide six, and operating expenses in the quarter.
Our operating expenses excluding billable expenses, the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges increased only 11% from a year ago and to 22.5% growth of net revenue.
The result was second quarter margin expansion to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago.
We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first quarter and these were both structural and variable.
In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter of last year and continued to execute over the second half.
As a reminder, these actions involve the elimination of certain positions, and resulting headcount reduction that will not return with revenue growth.
We also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year.
We are currently seeing the benefit of most of these actions and at a full run rate they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings.
We've also had over the course of the pandemic a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses.
I would call out specifically lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and that's continued through Q2 2021.
As you can see on this slide, a ratio of total salaries and related expense, as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, which has significantly improved from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply.
Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53% of net revenue in the quarter.
That reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags our significant revenue growth, as was in the case in past business cycles.
Our severance expense ratio also decreased sharply to only 40 basis points of net revenue, compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was at an elevated level due to the impact of the recession.
Going the other way, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, consistent with our very strong operating results.
Expense for temporary labor also increased, as a percentage of net revenue to 4.5%, as a result of servicing the top line's quick acceleration.
At quarter-end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year, with hiring to support our growth.
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%.
Our occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue, mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate, as well as leverage on our revenue growth.
We leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 220 basis points, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and acquisition costs and leverage as a result of our revenue growth.
Our SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to the higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance expense, which was at a very low level a year ago.
On slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported second quarter results, in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance.
This begins on the left-hand side with the reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.
Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million.
The restructuring refinement in the quarter is a benefit of $200,000.
To be clear, this is a small adjustment to estimate of the 2020 restructuring program.
Below operating expenses in column four, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small non-strategic businesses.
At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share.
On slide eight, we turn to cash flow in the quarter.
Cash from operations was $468.2 million, compared with the use of $87.1 million a year ago.
We generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9 million last year.
Investing activities was $43.3 million in the quarter, mainly for capex of $34 million.
Financing activities used $101.8 million, mainly for our dividend.
Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $325.6 million.
Slide nine is the current portion of our balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $2.34 billion of cash and equivalents.
Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior note which matures in October of this year.
We plan to repay these notes from cash on hand.
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt.
Again, we have the maturity in October of this year, and then only $250 million due in April 2024.
Thereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028.
In summary, on slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment.
I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people.
The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially.
While we remain very pleased with our results, it's worth reiterating as Ellen just said that this is an unusual, in fact, unprecedented environment in which we're operating.
Now importantly, it bears noting that when compared to our non-pandemic results in 2019, Q2 results show our company is performing at a very high level.
We continue to feel this is the result of strategic decisions that we've taken over a number of years to position our company for the future, investments and actions that have created a sustainable advantage for our organization.
Today's IPG delivers addressable and accountable digital marketing programs, combined with our world-class creative storytelling capabilities, these solutions make us higher value partners to our clients.
One of our many priorities over the years has been the creation and implementation of open architecture solutions, where we bring the best of IPG together in collaborative teams that are customized to client-specific business needs and increasingly a key element of this approach, Open Architecture 2.0, as it were, is Acxiom whose data management expertise and data assets play a role in an increasingly broad range of our offerings.
In addition, Kinesso powers many of our applications and services that provide clients with a deep understanding of audiences in order to provide insights and then form creative work, segments for media delivery and line of sight to the effectiveness of the work that we're doing together.
We saw this model come to life in the quarter with a Cigna count win, which combined talent from McCann Worldgroup Initiative and R/GA powered by Kinesso and Acxiom.
This is a continuation of several years of strong performance in integrated pitches, especially those that include creative and media, as well as media and data.
Another another key decision that's contributed to our success has been our continued investment in strong agency brands, which helps us attract and retain top talent and deliver breakthrough creative ideas across a range of marketing disciplines.
As a result of this strategy, IPG companies across our portfolio earned a number of important accolades during the quarter.
Most notably, we had an impressive showing at the 2021 Cannes International Festival of Creativity.
IPG agencies took home eight Grand Prix, the festival's highest honor.
Wins across the network represented a broad range of clients, categories, agencies, disciplines and geographies.
FCB's performance was a standout, as the agency took home four Grand Prix and was named Global Network of the Year.
The agency's creative community and its leadership deserved credit for this terrific accomplishment.
FCB Health was also named Healthcare Network of the Year and AREA 23 and FCB Health Agency was named Healthcare Agency of the Year.
McCann client, Microsoft was named Marketer of the Year at the festival, which is another major honor.
And the agency also won a Grand Prix in brand experience and activation for its remarkable true name work for Mastercard, which empowers transgender and non-binary cardholders to use their true name when using their credit card.
In PR, McCann Paris earned a Grand Prix, partnering with Weber Shandwick for a campaign that ran across the Middle East, which teaches women in a culturally sensitive way to perform self-checks for early breast cancer detection.
FCB Chicago and Weber Shandwick teamed to earn a Grand Prix for work for AB InBev.
And R/GA continues to be recognized for its ability to humanize technology, winning a Grand Prix in social and influencer marketing for disruptive work it did for Reddit on the Super Bowl.
On Ad Age's annual A-List and Creativity Awards, both Deutsch LA and The Martin Agency were named to the prestigious A-list.
Initiative was named Media Agency of the Year and FCB Health's CEO was recognized as our industry's Executive of the Year.
At the holding company level, we made a number of announcements that position us for further success.
Chief among them was our launch of IPG Health earlier this month.
The move will align our top performing companies, FCB Health and McCann Health under a new global network, IPG Health, led by a dynamic and proven CEO and a skilled executive leadership team.
In this new operating structure, the distinct agency brands within FCB Health and McCann Health will remain active and continue to go to market independently.
They will also benefit from access to additional specialty services, knowledge sharing, proactive career management, shared investment in new capabilities and skill-sets, highly complimentary geographic coverage, as well as an even higher level of collaboration.
Around the world, healthcare and well-being are areas of growing importance for our clients and society at large.
As an industry sector, healthcare represents an increasingly vital part of the economy, and one where innovation is becoming an ever more important driver of success.
So the alignment of IPG's fully dedicated healthcare networks under the banner of IPG Health strengthens our leadership position in this dynamic sector.
The scale, reach and most importantly, quality of our people and our work makes for an exciting combination.
And it's why we think this new offering will continue to deliver great things in the years to come.
This month, we also added to our strong roster of marketing technology and e-commerce providers with a launch of Performance Art, a data-led creative CRM agency, whose leadership team is known for delivering platform level creative ideas that are at home in a client's e-retail flow as they are in a 30-second spot.
Turning to performance at our agencies, growth at IAN in the quarter was once again highlighted by media, data and tech and FCB led by healthcare.
UM saw significant wins in the quarter with Enterprise Holdings, Behr Paint and most recently, NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization.
UM also saw an important account retention for the Australian government.
At the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards, UM earned Global Media Agency of the Year honors and UM APAC was named Best Media Network in that region.
At Initiative, the agency was named 2020's Most Competitive Network Globally in Media Pitches and saw a major win in the UK with banking and insurance company, NatWest Group.
We also continue to see terrific momentum at Reprise, especially as it relates to their growing e-commerce capabilities.
Acxiom, Kinesso, and Matterkind are also performing well and they're key to how we help clients thrive in the addressable media market, which requires flexibility, given the quickly shifting landscape.
At Acxiom, we continue to invest behind innovative new products and services, such as customer data platforms, and identity resolution, with which we are seeing increased client adoption.
Another important development saw Acxiom deploy their latest customer intelligence platform on the cloud with a key financial services client.
At our creative integrated networks, FCB, McCann and MullenLowe Group were named the ACT Responsible 2020 Good Report, a unique ranking of the world's best use of creative communications to promote sustainability and social responsibility.
On top of its exceptional showing at Cannes, at FCB Global, the network continues to invest in talent and new offerings, hiring a head of data science and connections to expand its expertise in commerce, data and technology fueled creativity.
McCann also continues to prove a creative powerhouse.
As we saw, the network was recently named Webby Network of the Year and McCann New York was named Webby Agency of the Year.
MRM continues to leverage its Martek expertise and is seeing strong growth with its MRM commerce division, which help marketers drive engagement, interaction and conversion on commerce platforms.
At MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continues its strong new business momentum and during the quarter, added Hallmark's parent company, Crown Media, as well as Tally Financial.
MullenLowe is also a global leader in purpose driven work.
And we saw that as it continued to partner with governments in a number of countries around the world to inform people the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19.
At R/GA, campaign named the London office as the UK's Digital Agency of the Year.
And R/GA London added two new clients, financial services company, Allianz, and Vollebak Clothing.
We named the new CEO at Huge who joined the digital agency after a very successful tenure at Initiative, where he helped turn the agency into a leader in the media space.
During the quarter, Huge also saw strong new business activity, adding Sub-Zero Appliances, Wakefern, Tezos Foundation and Nikko Asset Management.
The Martin Agency continues to impact culture and drive strong business results for its clients.
Notably, the agency sold the city's short film for DoorDash at the Tribeca Film Festival last month and had captured the resilience of New York City's restaurants and the role they play in the city's life.
At IPG DXTRA, we also saw recognition as the number of companies were called out for their ability to deliver creative solutions.
Weber Shandwick was the most awarded PR agency at Cannes this year.
Current Global demonstrated their commitment to closing the disability and inclusion gap by creating guidelines and toolkits for marketers so as to make content more accessible for consumers with sight, hearing, or other cognitive impairments.
And this program was recognized as one of Fast Company's World-Changing Ideas for 2021.
Jack Morton launched what they are referring to as the return-to-live dashboard and that's a tool for brand marketers to access where, when, and how businesses in the US can safely get back to hosting live experiences.
Golin continued its strong performance in new business, was selected as LinkedIn's Global Social Media Agency of Record and also Agency of Record for Yamaha Music.
Golin was also named PRWeek's Global Agency of the Year.
Pivoting now back to the holding company, another key area that bears mention is our long-term focus on ESG, including diversity, equity and inclusion.
In all of our operations and activities, we're working to build on and more fully live into this commitment.
And this includes reassessing how we hire, train and promote a diverse workforce, incorporate rigorous practices around data ethics and media responsibility as well as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions further around the world.
Key accomplishments on this front include IPG being recently named by Forbes to their top ten list of America's Best Employers for Diversity.
During the quarter, we also created a new position, our industry's first culture officer, to focus on long-term thought leadership relating to a broad range of social justice issues for underserved and underrepresented communities.
During the quarter, as part of our integrated ESG efforts, we also announced an action plan that consists of three climate roles, committing to set a science-based target; sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030, and joining the Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism.
In addition, we've published our first SASB report, becoming the first company in the advertising and marketing sector to publish an alignment with SASB's industry standards.
Our agencies also contribute significantly to our ESG profile.
And importantly, here in the US, we saw media brands take a leading role in the industry conversation about promoting greater media equity.
And they announced that they're committing to invest at least 5% of client budgets in black-owned media by 2023.
Octagon launched an accelerator program with historically black colleges and universities for students interested in sports and entertainment as a career.
And R/GA created an innovative program to raise money for environmental organizations through a dedicated YouTube channel that plays nature videos, which have become hugely popular during the pandemic, and it directs all of the ad revenues generated on this channel to environmental NGOs.
Like many of us, I look forward to working live with colleagues and clients, especially given that we're an ideas-driven service business.
Our culture, our capacity for innovation and the ways in which we combine creativity with technology and data are all enhanced by in-person interactions.
Now here in the US, we expect to have more people returning to our offices in a flexible hybrid model, beginning in mid-September as is already the case in certain other parts of the world.
We will, of course, be mindful of the public health situation and of the learnings we've accumulated during the past 16 months when it comes to flexible work practices.
The expected costs associated with live collaboration with colleagues as well as travel will begin to return as a normal part of how we work and therefore be reflected in our operating results.
For example, as we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect an increase in travel costs in the fourth quarter, which could return to levels consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019.
As we said earlier, these are unprecedented times.
None of us had previously been required to adapt the constraints of living and working through a pandemic.
And likewise, none of us has experience in emerging for one.
Earlier on the call, we shared our perspective on the balance of the year, based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery that people continue to become vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities and that we're able to adequately mitigate the impact of dangerous new variants.
We've delivered a very strong first half of the year on top of the most challenging comps in our industry.
Further, despite continued macro uncertainty, we have greater clarity to the balance of 2021.
We therefore believe that current performance, combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, are significant drivers for the sustained enhancement of value for all of our stakeholders.
As always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend.
We also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program and we will keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops.
","Interpublic Group (IPG) reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021, driven by robust organic growth across its client sectors and disciplines. Net organic revenue increased by 19.8% year-over-year to $2.27 billion, with double-digit growth in all eight major client sectors, including healthcare, retail, and auto. IPG's IAN segment grew 20.5% organically, led by media, data, and technology, while its DXTRA segment experienced 15.1% organic growth, reflecting recovery in sports and entertainment offerings. Despite the ongoing pandemic, IPG maintained strong profitability with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.9%, driven by cost savings from restructuring and lower variable expenses. The company upgraded its full-year 2021 performance outlook, now expecting organic growth of 9%-10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 16%. IPG remains focused on ESG initiatives, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and has taken steps to address media equity and climate change concerns. As the economy recovers and restrictions ease, IPG anticipates a gradual increase in travel and office-related expenses in the second half of the year, most notably in the fourth quarter."
AFG_q3_2021.txt,"These materials will be referenced during portions of today's call.
A detailed description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in AFG's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also available on our website.
We may include references to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure in our remarks or responses to questions.
This was an outstanding quarter.
We're extremely pleased with the company's performance and continued strong market conditions.
Third quarter pre-tax core operating earnings and AFG's Property and Casualty Insurance segment were 60% higher than the comparable prior year period, and each of our Specialty Property and Casualty groups reported healthy growth and excellent underwriting margins.
Results in our portfolio of alternative investments continue to exceed our expectations and produced strong investment returns in the quarter.
This year, market conditions in the Property and Casualty business remain among the best I've seen in my 40 plus year career.
We believe that our disciplined, yet opportunistic operating philosophy, a lower net catastrophe exposure than our peers and a continued economic recovery contributed to these outstanding results.
I'll now turn the discussion over to Craig to walk us through AFG's third quarter results, investment performance and our overall financial position at September 30th.
As you'll see on Slide 3, AFG reported core net operating earnings of $2.71 per share, an impressive 96% increase year-over-year.
The increase was primarily the result of substantially higher underwriting profit in our Specialty P&C insurance operations and significantly higher P&C net investment income due to the continued strong performance of AFG's $1.7 billion and alternative investments.
Annualized core operating return on equity in the third quarter was nearly 18%.
Turning to Slide 4, you'll see the third quarter 2021 net earnings per share of $2.56 included non-core after-tax realized losses on securities of $0.15 per share, most of which pertain to fair value adjustments on securities that we continue to hold at the end of the quarter.
Now I'd like to turn to an overview of AFG's investment performance, financial position and share a few comments about AFG's capital and liquidity.
The details surrounding our $16.4 billion investment portfolio are presented on Slides 5 and 6.
Pre-tax unrealized gains on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio were $225 million at the end of the third quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, P&C net investment income was approximately 66% higher than the comparable 2020 period and included significantly higher earnings from alternative investments.
We're especially pleased with the performance of our alternative investments during the quarter.
Earnings from these investments may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on reported results and valuation of the underlying investments and generally are reported on a quarter lag.
The annualized return on alternative investments reported in core operating earnings in the third quarter of 2021 was a very strong 20.3%.
The average annual return on these investments over the past five calendar years was approximately 10%.
Alternative investments with underlying real estate exposures have been a key contributor to the performance of this portfolio.
We view our investments in real estate and real estate related entities is a core competency.
In addition to our portfolio of directly owned properties and mortgage loans, our real estate related investments include real estate funds and real estate partnerships accounted for by the equity method.
We found great success in investing in multifamily properties and desirable communities where we continue to achieve very strong occupancy and collection rates and steady rate increases.
These multifamily properties represented over half of our alternative investment portfolio on September 30, 2021.
Due to the significant portion of our alternative assets that are tied to real estate relative to our peers, we also believe that this portfolio of investments has a lower correlation to broader market performance and has the potential to produce more consistent returns over time.
Excluding the impact of alternative investments, P&C net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 decreased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting lower market interest rates.
As you can see on Slide 6, our investment portfolio continues to be high quality with 88% of our fixed maturity portfolio rated investment grade and 97% of our P&C group fixed maturities portfolio with an NAIC designation of 1 or 2, its highest two categories.
Our excess capital was approximately $3 billion at September 30, 2021.
This number included parent company cash and investments of approximately $2.7 billion.
Returning capital to our shareholders is an important component of our capital management strategy and reflects our strong financial position and our confidence in AFG's financial future.
Year-to-date, AFG has declared $24 per share and special dividends.
While all AFG's excess capital is available for internal growth and acquisitions, approximately $180 million of excess capital can be used for share repurchases and additional special dividends while staying within our most restrictive debt to capital guideline.
This figure is in addition to our regular quarterly dividend and a $4 per share special dividend declared and accrued in September and paid at the beginning of October, and the $4 per share special dividend declared yesterday.
We expect to continue to have significant excess capital and liquidity through the end of the year and beyond.
Our excess capital affords us the financial flexibility to make opportunistic repurchases, pay additional special dividends, grow our Specialty P&C niche businesses organically and through acquisitions and start-ups that meet our target return thresholds.
Annualized growth and book value per share plus dividends was an outstanding 37% in the first nine months of 2021.
Book value per share excluding unrealized gains related to fixed maturities was $59.70 at September 30, 2021 compared to $63.61 per share.
At the end of 2020 and reflects the $21.5 per share and dividends declared during the first nine months of 2021.
Results during the quarter were excellent as you'll see on the overview on Slide 8.
Third quarter pre-tax core operating earnings in AFG's Property and Casualty Insurance segment establish another record for the third time this year at $329 million.
Specialty Property and Casualty Insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $169 million in the 2021 third quarter, an impressive 63% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by higher year-over-year underwriting profit in our Specialty Casualty Group and to a lesser extent our Specialty Financial Group.
Despite the impact of Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters during the quarter, our catastrophe losses were very manageable at $31 million.
Each of our Specialty Property and Casualty Groups reported strong premium growth, underwriting margins across our portfolio of businesses were excellent, and overall Specialty P&C combined ratio of 89%.
The third quarter 2021 combined ratio improved 3.1 points from the 92.1% reported in the comparable prior year period and included 2 points of catastrophe losses and 5.4 points of favorable prior year reserve development.
Turning to pricing, we continue to see strong renewal rate momentum and we're continuing to achieve strong renewal rate increases in the vast majority of our businesses with exceptionally strong renewal pricing in our longer tail liability businesses outside of workers' comp.
Average renewal pricing across our entire Property and Casualty group was up approximately 11% for the quarter.
Excluding our workers' comp business, renewal pricing was up approximately 13% in the third quarter.
Both measures are an improvement over the rate increases reported in the second quarter of 2021.
This quarter marked our 21st consecutive quarter of overall Specialty Property and Casualty rate increases, which continue to be meaning -- meaningful and excess of perspective estimated loss ratio trends.
Gross and net written premiums for the third quarter of 2021 were up 19% and 16% respectively when compared to the third quarter of last year.
The drivers of growth vary considerably across our portfolio of specialty property and casualty businesses.
Overall, in the aggregate, year-over-year growth in gross written premium during the first nine months of 2021 excluding crop insurance was fairly evenly split, but just over half attributable to net net growth and change in exposures and just under half attributable to rate increases.
Property and Transportation Group reported an underwriting profit of $45 million in the third quarter of '21 compared to $47 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Higher underwriting profits in our crop business in Singapore branch were more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our transportation, property and inland marine and non-crop agricultural businesses.
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our portfolio of transportation businesses, which has served us very well over time.
The diversity within this book, which includes specialty transportation niches like rigging and crane and ambulance and paratransit, home delivery, moving and storage, coverage for owner operators and workers' comp solutions tailored to the wheels industry has helped us deliver attractive margins and strong returns in this group of businesses.
Knowing what we know at this point, we also expect to have an above average crop year from both the profitability and a growth standpoint with net written premiums projected to be up approximately 32% for this year.
Yields throughout much of the corn belt are average to well above average, offsetting below average drought related yields from the North Central States, freeze-related losses in Texas and drought-related losses in the Western United States.
About 40% of our MPCI corn and soybean business is in the eastern corn belt, where growing conditions were more favorable.
The month of October serves as the discovery period for the majority of our corn and all of our soybean business.
Corn and soybean harvest pricing settled at 17% percent and 4% higher respectively than spring discovery pricing, and was comfortably within desired ranges of volatility.
The third quarter 2021 gross and net written premiums in this group were 26% and 22% higher respectively than the comparable prior year period, with growth reported in all businesses in this group.
The growth came primarily from our crop insurance business, primarily a result of the impact of higher commodity futures pricing and projected volatility on rates.
And also our transportation businesses, primarily the result of new accounts combined with strong renewals.
Overall, renewal rates in the Property and Transportation Group increased 5% on average for the third quarter of '21.
The Specialty Casualty Group reported an underwriting profit of $110 million in the 2021 third quarter compared to $53 million last year.
Higher profitability in our workers' compensation excess and surplus lines, excess liability and general liability businesses were key drivers of these results.
This Group reported a very strong 82 calendar year combined ratio for the third quarter, an impressive improvement of 8.7 points from the comparable period in 2020.
Underwriting profitability in our workers' comp businesses overall continues to be excellent.
Our workers' compensation book is another area where the strength and diversity of our stand-alone worker's comp businesses has served us well.
Gross and net written premiums for the Specialty Casualty Group increased 15% and 14% respectively when compared to the same prior year period.
Nearly all of the businesses in this group achieved strong renewal pricing and reported premium growth during the third quarter.
Significant renewal rate increases and new business opportunities contributed to higher premiums in our excess and surplus lines business.
Renewal rate increases, strong account retention and new business opportunities contributed to higher premiums in our targeted markets business.
And our mergers and acquisitions liability and executive liability businesses also contributed meaningfully to the year-over-year growth.
Renewal pricing for this group was up 13% in the third quarter and excluding workers' compensation businesses, renewal rates in this group were up approximately 18%.
Both measures are improvements from the rate increases achieved in the second quarter of 2021.
Now the Specialty Financial Group reported an underwriting profit of $26 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to an underwriting profit of $13 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Improved results in our surety and financial institutions businesses contributed to the higher year-over-year underwriting profitability.
This group continued to achieve excellent underwriting margins and reported an 84.2 combined ratio for the third quarter.
Gross and net written premiums increased by 9% and 8% respectively in the 2021 third quarter when compared to the prior year period and nearly all businesses in this group reported growth, including our surety, fidelity and crime and lender services businesses.
Renewal pricing in this group was up approximately 8% for the quarter, consistent with the results in the second quarter of 2021.
Although the largest business in the special financial group is our financial institution services division, which generates about half of the group's gross written premium.
This group also includes a compelling mix of Specialty Property and Casualty businesses, offering coverages such as fidelity and crime, surety, trade credit and coverages tailored to lending and leasing institutions.
For more than 10 years, the average overall combined ratio of this group has consistently been below 90.
Now turning to A&E reserves.
During the third quarter of 2021, we did complete our annual ground-up review of our asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations within the Property and Casualty group.
This was undertaken internally and reviewed all open accounts and considered any trends observed.
Good news is we have identified no new trends and activity was within our expectations and consistent with the expectations from our 2020 external study.
As a result, the review resulted in no net change to the property and casualty group's A&E reserves.
We do continue to enjoy robust survival ratios, which are well above industry averages in which our one measure of the strength of our A&E reserves.
Based on a relatively moderate payment patterns and the pace of new filings, we'll most likely continue to assess our reserves utilizing in-house resources next year.
We have also assessed the adequacy of our asbestos and environmental reserves for historic railroad and manufacturing operations.
Asbestos liabilities continue to be adequate, though we are making a small adjustment to our environmental liabilities based on slightly revised projections at three environmental sites.
Based on results for the first nine months of the year, we now expect AFG's core net operating earnings in 2021 to be in the range of $10.10 to $10.70, up significantly from our previous range of $8.40 to $9.20 per share.
We're obviously pleased once again to increase our 2021 core earnings per share guidance in a meaningful way.
This guidance reflects an assumed annualized return of approximately 10% on alternative investments in the fourth quarter of 2021, which would produce a return of approximately 20% on our $1.7 billion of alternative investments for the full year in 2021.
As we consider the outlook for our Specialty Property and Casualty operations based on results to the first nine months, we strengthened our guidance across the board, indicating higher expected 2021 net repayments and stronger underwriting profit.
We now expect the 2021 combined ratio for the Specialty Property and Casualty Group overall between 86% and 88%, an improvement of 2 points at the midpoint of the range of our previous estimate.
Net written premiums are now expected to be 11% to 14% higher than the $5 billion reported last year.
Growth in net written premiums excluding workers' comp is now expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, an increase from the range of 12% to 16% estimated previously.
And then looking at each sub segment.
We now expect the Property and Transportation group combined ratio to be in a range of 86% to 88%.
Our guidance assumes above average crop earnings for the year and we continue to expect growth in net written premiums for this group to be in the range of 15% to 19%.
Our Specialty Casualty Group is now expected to produce a combined ratio in the range of 85% to 87%.
Our guidance assumes continued strong renewal pricing in our E&S excess liability and several of our other longer-tail liability businesses.
We have raised our projection for growth in net written premiums to a range of 8% to 12% higher than 2020 results.
Premium growth will be tempered by rate decreases in our workers' compensation book, which are result of favorable loss experience in this line of business.
Excluding workers' comp, we now expect 2021 premiums in the Specialty and Casualty Group to grow in a range of 15% to 19%, an increase of 5 percentage points from the midpoint of our previous guidance.
And we now expect the Specialty Financial Group combined ratio to be in a range of 84% to 86%, reflecting strong underwriting results for the first nine months of the year.
We continue to expect growth in net written premiums for this group to be between 10% and 14% based on projected premium growth in our fidelity and crime and surety businesses.
And our expectations for overall renewal pricing are unchanged from last quarter, remaining in the range of 9% to 11% overall.
And excluding workers' comp, we expect renewal rate increases to be in the range of 11% to 13%.
Craig and are very pleased to report these exceptionally strong results and a significant increase in our earnings expectations for the full year.
We believe that our entrepreneurial opportunistic culture, combined with our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility position us very well as we close out the year and we look forward to the opportunities in 2022.
We'll now open the lines for the Q&A portion of today's call, and we'd all be happy to respond to any questions.
","American Financial Group (AFG) reported an exceptional third quarter, with a 96% increase in core net operating earnings per share to $2.71. This surge was driven by higher underwriting profit and investment returns. Alternative investments exceeded expectations, yielding a 20.3% annualized return and contributing significantly to P&C net investment income. Specialty Property and Casualty Insurance operations saw a 63% increase in underwriting profit, with strong premium growth and underwriting margins. Despite Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters, catastrophe losses remained manageable at $31 million. Renewal rate momentum remained strong, with average renewal pricing up approximately 11% for the quarter. The Property and Transportation Group reported higher underwriting profit in crop and transportation businesses, but lower profit in non-crop agricultural lines. The Specialty Casualty Group saw strong profitability in workers' compensation, excess liability, and general liability businesses. The Specialty Financial Group's underwriting profitability also improved. Based on strong results, AFG raised its 2021 core net operating earnings guidance to a range of $10.10 to $10.70 per share, assuming a 10% annualized return on alternative investments in the fourth quarter. The company expressed confidence in its financial flexibility and is well-positioned for continued growth opportunities."
TFX_q2_2020.txt,"Additionally, during this conference call, you will hear management make references to what the estimated positive or negative impacts were as a result of COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020.
You will also hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance during the month of July.
Management is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters.
It's a pleasure to speak with you today.
I'd also like to take a moment to recognize the Teleflex employees around the world.
These past few months have been far from normal, and our employees continue to inspire me as they have stepped up in extraordinary ways to ensure that we are able to provide our products to the hospitals, clinicians and patients who need them most.
Now on to our Q2 results.
When you take into consideration the global escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are quite pleased with our second quarter performance as it significantly exceeded our internal expectations and reflected improvements in underlying monthly revenue trends for the product categories most impacted by the postponement of non-emergent procedures, most notably, Interventional Urology, Interventional Access and Surgical.
Q2 revenue was $567 million, which was down 12% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis.
The decline in revenue is due to the negative impact from COVID-19, which we estimate caused a net negative impact of approximately $130 million or approximately 20%.
If we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that we grew our underlying business by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, or near the high end of our initially provided 2020 full year constant currency revenue growth rate range.
From an earnings per share perspective, like revenue, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 in the quarter also significantly exceeded our internal expectations.
This reflects the recovery we saw in monthly procedures as we moved through the quarter, coupled with prudent operating expense management.
Lastly, at the end of the second quarter, we also commenced our workforce reduction plan, which will allow us to capitalize on programs designed to drive further long-term profitability.
This latest effort is primarily focused on streamlining certain sales and marketing functions within EMEA as well as certain manufacturing operations within our OEM segment.
Turning to a more detailed review of our second quarter results.
As I mentioned, quarter two revenue declined 12% on a constant currency basis and 13.1% on an as-reported basis.
The decline in revenue was primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $144 million across several global product categories.
This was somewhat offset by approximately $14 million of additional revenue within our vascular access and other product categories, which experienced higher-than-expected demand as a result of COVID-19.
From a margin perspective, we generated adjusted gross and operating margins of 53.9% and 21.8%, respectively.
This translated into a year-over-year decline of 380 basis points on the gross margin line and 340 basis points on the operating margin line, as reduced sales volumes and unfavorable revenue mix impacted by COVID were major headwinds.
These headwinds were partially offset by our cost containment efforts as we continue to tighten our belts where we deem appropriate in the current environment, balanced with continued investment to sustain our long-term growth aspirations.
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.93, down 27.4% year-over-year, but well ahead of our internal expectations as the business started to recover during the quarter.
And while I never like to see declines in year-over-year revenue and profitability, I am very pleased with our overall financial performance as it demonstrates the resiliency of the diversified global product portfolio we have built over the past few years.
Next, I thought it would be helpful to provide some context regarding how we saw COVID-19 impact our second quarter results.
During the second quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 was a headwind to revenue across Interventional Urology, Surgical, Interventional Access, Anesthesia and OEM.
Somewhat offsetting these headwinds were positive tailwinds within Vascular Access and other, as hospitals continued to have strong demand for those types of products.
Netting these two impacts, we estimate that COVID was a $130 million headwind or an approximate 20% detractor from our 2Q revenue growth.
Importantly, we were encouraged that after a difficult April, the key global business units impacted most negatively by COVID improved sequentially as we moved through May and June.
Specifically, Interventional Urology year-over-year revenue was down approximately 79% in April.
It was down approximately 30% in May and then down approximately 8% in June.
Turning to Interventional Access.
Year-over-year revenue declined approximately 30% in April, approximately 28% in May, and then it was down approximately 2% in June.
And finally, our Surgical business experienced year-over-year revenue declines of approximately 34% in April, 31% in May and then approximately 21% in June.
As we anticipated and stated on our last earnings conference calls, as various states and countries began to reopen, Interventional Urology led the recovery.
But we also saw improving trends within Interventional Access and Surgical as most hospitals have restarted non-emergent procedures in earnest.
And while our business our businesses have not yet to fully return to normal, we are encouraged by our trends into July, which largely reflect further improvement in the business.
That said, while we view the latest trends as encouraging signs of a continued global recovery, we remain cautious as select hospital capacity has come under pressure in certain geographies as COVID-19 cases have reemerged.
As a result of the uncertainty associated with the scope and duration of COVID-19, we made the decision not to reinstate our 2020 financial guidance at this time.
Let's now turn to the quarterly results.
I will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenue.
The Americas delivered revenues of $312.5 million in the second quarter, which represents a 16% decline.
Growth within the Americas was driven by Vascular Access and respiratory products, which both saw elevated demands driven by COVID.
However, this was more than offset by declines in other product categories.
We estimate that the Americas would have grown approximately 8% excluding an estimated 24% impact of COVID on the region.
Importantly, as we progressed throughout the second quarter, Interventional Urology saw sequential improvement from April to May and then from May into June with a positive momentum largely carried forward into July.
While we are encouraged by this recovery, we are cautious due to the recent outbreaks and reduced non-emergent procedure capacity in states, including Texas and Florida.
EMEA reported revenues of $131.6 million in the second quarter, representing an 8% decline.
Like the Americas, growth drivers included vascular and respiratory businesses, which benefited from elevated demand related to COVID-19.
However, like the Americas, growth in these product categories was outweighed by declines elsewhere.
Adjusting for COVID, we estimate approximately 1% underlying growth for the region.
Revenues totaled $67.1 million in the second quarter, which represents a decline of 7.8%.
However, we estimate that we would have had a positive constant currency revenue growth in the low double digits consistent with our long-term outlook for the region if not for the impact of COVID-19.
And lastly, our OEM business reported revenues of $55.8 million in the second quarter, or 70 basis points recurring on a constant currency basis.
As we anticipated, during the second quarter, our OEM business saw a lagged impact related to COVID relative to our other businesses.
Investors familiar with Teleflex will be aware that our OEM business supplies device companies with complex catheters and surgical sutures.
And the 2Q impact reflects reduced orders from these customers whose business is tied to non-emergent procedures.
Excluding the estimated COVID-19 impact, the business grew roughly 25%, which includes a 16% benefit from HPC.
As it relates to the acquisition of HPC, the integration efforts are well under way, and I am very pleased with how the business is performing under our leadership.
Let's now move to a discussion on our revenues by global product categories.
Consistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments, commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis.
Starting with Vascular Access.
Due to the growth within both our central venous catheter and EZ-IO products, Q2 revenues increased 8.8% to $164.9 million.
We estimate that COVID-19 positively impacted the growth rates of our vascular products during the second quarter by approximately 5%.
Moving to Interventional Access.
Second quarter revenue was $82.6 million, which is lower than the prior year by 20.3%.
The decrease was largely due to the delay in the performance of certain non-emergent procedures because of COVID-19.
We estimate that underlying growth was in the mid-single digits, adjusting for an approximate 24% COVID-19 headwind.
Q2 revenues were $64.9 million, which is lower than the prior year by 23%.
The revenue decline was due to lower sales of laryngeal masks and regional anesthesia products.
We estimate that COVID had an approximate 22% negative impact in the quarter.
Revenue declined by 28.4% to $67.3 million, driven by lower sales of our ligation portfolio and instruments.
We estimate a significant 30% headwind from COVID during 2Q.
However, as we stated earlier, we have seen sequential improvements on a monthly basis since April lows.
Moving to Interventional Urology.
Q2 revenue decreased 40.9% to $40.1 million.
We estimate an approximate $58 million COVID-19-related headwind during 2Q.
Unfortunately, the cancellation of elective procedures impacted this product line more than any other in our portfolio.
That said, because the UroLift procedure is primarily performed in an outpatient lower acuity setting, we envisioned that UroLift will be one of the first types of procedures that would be performed once the United States began to reopen, and that's exactly what we have seen with sequential improvements from April to May, May to June and from June into July.
And finally, our other category, which consists of our respiratory and urology care products grew 5.4%, totaling $91.4 million.
In large part, we estimate the growth during the quarter was due to increased demand for certain humidification and breathing products resulting from COVID-19.
If we were to exclude the estimated benefit from COVID-19, we estimate that the other category would have been down slightly as compared to the prior year period.
That completes my comments on quarter two revenue performance.
Turning to some clinical and commercial updates.
Our body of clinical evidence for UroLift continues to expand during the second quarter with data from two studies presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event and data from another study published in the Canadian Journal of Urology.
The first study presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event in May was a meta-analysis of patients' sexual function following treatment with the UroLift System versus medical therapy, while the second study was an analysis comparing patient outcomes from the large Real World Retrospective study to those found in the L.I.F.T.
pivotal trial and the P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial.
The results from the first study compared sexual function outcomes of 849 sexually active men who received daily treatments with an alpha blocker, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, either alone or in combination and 190 men from combined clinical studies of the UroLift System at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months.
Results from the analysis showed that patients treated with the UroLift System experienced significant improvement in ejaculatory function and erectile function at 12 and 24 months post treatment.
Patients also reported significant improvement in overall sexual satisfaction through 48 months post treatment.
In contrast, none of the medical therapies significantly improved patients' erectile or ejaculatory function at any time point and some therapy significantly reduced function.
Additionally, the UroLift System significantly outperformed all three medical therapies across all-time points at preserving patient ejaculatory function.
Only patients who received UroLift System reported significant improvement in overall satisfaction in sexual life.
The second study compared patient outcomes from the large Real World Retrospective study to those found in the L.I.F.T.
pivotal trial and P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial, which studied catheter-dependent BPH patients.
Results from analysis showed patients from all groups experienced similar absolute IPSS scores at all-time points following treatment with the UroLift System.
Analysis also revealed equivalent safety profiles among non-urinary retention and urinary retention patient groups from the Real World study when compared to corresponding groups in control studies.
Finally, the results indicated that the majority of retention patients became catheter independent at the end of the study.
Lastly, a study comparing patient experience of those treated with the UroLift System to those who received tissue ablation by a steam injection was published in the Canadian Journal of Urology.
The study compared 53 non-retention patients from two U.S. sites.
Early postoperative results showed positive differences for patients treated with the UroLift System compared to resume, including better sexual function outcomes, less interference in daily activities and higher patient satisfaction.
We continue to extend our body of clinical evidence which should help to get the fast followers on board with UroLift, which is quickly becoming the standard of care as the leading minimally invasive surgery to address a massive global market opportunity.
Turning to the next slide on key commercial updates.
We received FDA clearance for the UroLift advanced tissue control or ATC system.
This is an instrument that optimizes UroLift for the treatment of obstructive median lobe.
We plan to hold a market acceptance test for this product in late 2020.
And while we estimate that between only 5% and 10% of the market have an obstructive median lobe, this enhancement demonstrates our commitment to invest in R&D to expand our leadership position in BPH.
In addition, as we began to see a recovery in the performance of non-emergent procedures as the second quarter progressed, we made the decision to launch our pilot national DTC campaign in early July, building on the success of our regional DTC efforts.
The national campaign will run from July to December, and the strategic role of DTC is important, as about half of the 12 million men being treated for BPH believe prescription medications are their only solution.
Our regional digital DTC efforts indicated strong patient engagement in June, along with positive sentiment from clinicians, both of which gave us confidence in the July launch.
While it's still early, the initial patient response is very strong, with significant increases in call volumes and web traffic spikes to urolift.com versus the weeks prior to launch.
Physician feedback has also been very positive.
Indeed, UroLift is leading the way in BPH, and this is the first time in recent years that a BPH brand is reaching patients directly in a meaningful way.
Additionally, we submitted the UroLift two for 510(k) FDA approval at the end of the second quarter.
And lastly, I would like to congratulate the interventional urology team on surpassing 200,000 patients treated with UroLift.
While this is a significant milestone, with DTC in the U.S., approximately 2,700 urologists trained and major market launches scheduled over the next few years, we have only scratched the surface in treating the approximate 100 million men globally estimated to have BPH.
Turning to some clinical updates within our Interventional business unit.
We recently began enrolling for a prospective single-arm IDE study, targeting 150 patients across approximately 15 sites within the U.S. to evaluate the performance of Teleflex coronary guidewires and specialty catheters in chronic total inclusion percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.
The study will evaluate the performance of the entire range of Teleflex complex PCI products in chronic occlusive coronary disease, which is the most demanding PCI environment.
We view PCI as a high-growth space within the Interventional Cardiology segment, and we will continue to invest in areas that will improve our weighted average market growth rates over time.
Overall, we continue to invest in clinical and commercial catalysts that will help to sustain our upper single-digit revenue growth aspirations in a normalized environment.
Given the previous discussion of the company's revenue performance, I'll begin at the gross profit line.
For the quarter, adjusted gross profit was $305.8 million versus $376.6 million in the prior year quarter, or a decrease of approximately 19%.
Adjusted gross margin totaled 53.9% during the quarter, which is a decrease of 380 basis points versus the prior year period.
The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to COVID-19-related impacts, including unfavorable product mix, lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs.
The mix impact was significant for the quarter.
The adverse revenue impact from COVID-19 tended to skew toward higher gross margin products, including UroLift, Surgical and Interventional Access.
In total, we estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our adjusted gross profit by approximately $100 million in the quarter.
Because of the reduced revenue and gross profit resulting from COVID-19, we continue to look for opportunities to help mitigate the earnings impact while at the same time, maintaining Teleflex's ability to rapidly rebound once non-emergent procedures recover.
As such, operating expense reductions tend to be focused on categories that are non-revenue-generating and are discretionary in nature, including savings from meetings, travel and management variable and performance-based compensation.
As a result of the efforts, we estimate that operating expenses were reduced in the second quarter by approximately $35 million.
While we expect the actions taken to continue to deliver opex savings through the second half of the year, by far, the largest quarterly benefit will be realized in the second quarter.
Adjusted operating profit was $123.9 million as compared to $164.7 million in the prior year or a decrease of approximately 25%.
Second quarter operating margin was 21.8% or down 340 basis points year-over-year, driven by the gross margin declines and loss of operating leverage, partly offset by the reduction in operating expense.
For the quarter, net interest expense totaled $15.5 million, which is a decrease of approximately 24% versus the prior year quarter.
The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects reduced interest rates associated with our variable rate debt, partly offset by higher average debt balances in the second quarter of 2020 versus the prior year period.
During the quarter, we took steps to further improve our liquidity by issuing $500 million of 8-year senior notes at 4.25%.
The proceeds obtained from the note issuance were used to repay revolver borrowings.
Moving now to taxes.
For the second quarter of 2020, our adjusted tax rate was 15.8% as compared to 13.4% in the prior year period.
The year-over-year increase in our adjusted tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from stock-based compensation as compared to the prior year period.
At the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share decreased 27.4% to $1.93.
Included in this result is an estimated adverse impact from COVID-19 of $1.18 as well as a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $0.04.
Now I'd like to discuss our recently introduced workforce reduction plan.
During the second quarter of 2020, we committed to a workforce reduction plan, designed to improve the profitability by streamlining certain sales and marketing functions in our EMEA segment and certain manufacturing operations within our OEM segment.
We estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of between $10 million and $13 million, consisting primarily of termination benefits, which will also result in future cash outlays.
We expect that most of these charges will be incurred prior to the end of 2020.
Once the plans are fully implemented, we project annual pre-tax savings of between $11 million and $13 million, and we expect the savings will begin in 2020.
I will also provide a summary of all of our ongoing restructuring and cost savings programs.
Including the latest workforce reduction plan, savings across all programs are expected to be between $59 million and $72 million.
Approximately 1/2 of the savings are expected to be realized in 2020 and 2021 and in the remaining 1/2 over the period 2022 through 2024.
As such, we have good line of sight to non-revenue-dependent margin expansion in the foreseeable future.
This also adds to our confidence that our prior LRP financial targets of 6% to 7% revenue growth, 60% to 61% gross margin and 30% to 31% operating margin remain the right goals for Teleflex.
And the question is only when, not if we achieve them.
Turning quickly to select balance sheet and cash flow highlights.
For the first half of 2020, cash flow from operations totaled $134 million as compared to $157.3 million in the prior year period or a year-over-year decrease of $23.3 million.
The decrease is attributed to a $10 million pension contribution made in the first half of 2020 and was not made in the first half of the prior year and a $54 million increase in first half 2020 contingent consideration payments versus payments made in the first half of 2019.
Overall, the balance sheet remains in good shape.
At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $553 million versus $406 million at the end of the first quarter.
Net leverage at quarter end was approximately 2.6 times, providing comfortable headroom when compared to our covenant, which requires that we stay below 4.5 times.
Lastly, we have no near-term debt maturities of material size.
Before closing, I'd like to make you aware of a matter that will be disclosed in our 10-Q filed today.
In June, we began producing documents and information responsive to a civil investigation demand received by one of our subsidiaries, NeoTract from the U.S. Department of Justice through the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia seeking documents and information pertaining to communications with and certain rebate programs offered to a single NeoTract customer in relation to the DOJ's investigation of that customer.
Subsequently, in July, the DOJ advised us that it had opened an investigation under the Civil False Claims Act with respect to NeoTract's operations broadly in addition to the customer investigation.
We maintain policies and procedures to promote compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act and other applicable laws and regulations.
And while the company intends to cooperate with the government's investigation and request for information, we will vigorously defend our programs, practices and conduct, which we believe are lawful and in accordance with industry best practices and standards.
We cannot, at this time, reasonably predict the duration, scope or the outcome of this matter.
In closing, we delivered solid second quarter results as our diversified portfolio helped to dampen the impact COVID had during April, and procedures have started to improve month-over-month in May, June and into July.
However, it remains difficult to predict the shape and duration needed to measure the path to recovery.
And while the next several quarters will have elements of uncertainty, we remain confident that our long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid, and we still see great opportunity over the long-term to serve our key constituents.
We, as an organization, will continue to focus on serving the vast majority of hospitals that remain open for procedures while also monitoring closely, those select regions that are temporarily shut down.
We continue to adapt our business and opportunistically shift toward a greater emphasis on digital tools, both internally as well as with our customers.
We will manage the business prudently, while staying focused to capitalize on long-term potential of our global product portfolio.
","Teleflex's Q2 performance exceeded internal expectations, driven by improving monthly revenue trends and prudent expense management. Despite a 12% revenue decline primarily due to COVID-19, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.93, surpassing estimates. Excluding the estimated $130 million COVID-19 impact, Teleflex saw underlying business growth of approximately 8%, driven by continued demand for vascular access and other product categories. The company's revenue was negatively impacted by COVID-19 across Interventional Urology, Surgical, Interventional Access, Anesthesia, and OEM, but was partially offset by growth in Vascular Access. Monthly procedures improved sequentially in May and June, particularly in Interventional Urology, which has led the recovery. Teleflex has not yet fully returned to normal but is encouraged by trends into July. Despite uncertainty due to COVID-19, the company remains confident in its long-term underlying fundamentals and anticipates achieving its previous LRP financial targets of 6% to 7% revenue growth, 60% to 61% gross margin, and 30% to 31% operating margin. Teleflex has initiated a workforce reduction plan to further improve profitability, with an estimated $11 million to $13 million annual pre-tax savings once implemented."
ROL_q1_2021.txt,"I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize Henry Tippie for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years.
As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippie recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers.
Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company.
During his distinguished career, not only was Henry our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins' purchase of Orkin in 1964.
Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leveraged buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School.
Henry, along with Randall Rollins, our Chairman at the time, were the only two Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968, and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary.
Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders.
Randall Rollins was inducted as well.
Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions.
We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided.
Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team.
He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future.
In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day.
They have risen again to the occasion, going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before.
We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year.
They truly are our most valuable asset.
While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance.
I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year.
As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results.
Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020.
Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year.
Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials.
It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively.
Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continued this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020.
I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member.
While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months.
Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nix, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Cynkus.
They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward.
We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations.
Jerry Nix was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee.
He is also now serving as a member on our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee.
Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees.
Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee.
As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires.
Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh.
While we have spent the last six months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology.
Thomas is extremely qualified, having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years.
And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position.
The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines.
And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively.
These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced.
Commercial, ex fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020.
This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020.
Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding.
We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment.
Turning to our mosquito service.
As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business.
For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%.
Additionally, the strength of our termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future.
Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands.
We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia.
Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry.
Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Trutech and Critter Control brands.
Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations.
Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services.
As part of our approach in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS in two additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services.
With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes.
Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time.
Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience.
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021.
I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge.
His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me.
The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company.
For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board.
As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties.
As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties.
Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases.
The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million.
Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020.
Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020.
And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share.
When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%.
Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020.
This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts.
As we move from what we would call Stage two to Stage three of our five-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience.
Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive.
Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule.
If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer.
This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs.
These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter.
Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth.
In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%.
Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%.
Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth.
Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9%, and from that, residential was up 12.8%; commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%; and termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%.
Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020.
We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021.
In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter.
The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%.
Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues.
This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts.
There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021.
At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins.
As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest three expense areas.
At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency.
Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven.
Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees.
As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year.
We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020.
We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021.
","Rollins reported strong Q1 results with a 9.8% revenue increase to $535.6 million, driven by growth in residential (14.9%), termite (12.2%), and commercial (2.9%) pest control services. Earnings per share surged from $0.09 to $0.19. Continued strength in termite and mosquito businesses, as well as acquisitions, contributed to growth. The company's technology investments, including the deployment of a new branch operating system in several brands, have improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. Rollins' commitment to cost containment and improved customer retention rates have also boosted margins. Despite inflation concerns, the company does not anticipate material margin impacts due to favorable trends in payroll, fleet, and materials costs. Rollins' strong balance sheet, with $117.3 million in cash, supports its plan for continued acquisitions and capital expenditures."
GHM_q3_2022.txt,"We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Graham Corporation.
Joining me on the call are Dan Thoren, our president and CEO; and Jeff Glajch, our chief financial officer.
You should have a copy of the third quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which just released a few minutes ago.
If not, you can access the release as well as the other slides that will accompany our conversation today at our website, grahammanufacturing.com, and I also want to point out that we also have now ir.
grahamcorp.com to access the investor information.
These documents can be found on our website or at sec.gov.
During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe these will be useful in evaluating our performance.
We have provided reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release and the slides for your information.
I am starting on Page 3.
As you might imagine, having just assumed the role of CEO in September, reporting this fiscal third year -- third quarter's results is a little bit rough.
Revenue has increased to $28.8 million, but we had a loss of $0.35 per share.
The loss was driven by Navy project cost overruns in our Batavia operations as a result of decisions we made during the quarter to ensure timely execution of our high-profile submarine and carrier projects.
The multiple decisions that led to the loss were for long-term gain over short-term pain and were not made lightly.
Our Navy business is very important for our future.
We had to protect this business and ensure our customers knew we were committed to hitting their need dates, even though we took a significant financial hit in the quarter and over our fiscal year 2022.
Jeff and I will provide more detail on subsequent slides.
As a result of the quarter loss, we were out of compliance on our financial covenants, which required suspending our dividend.
Jeff will talk more about the waiver we obtained and the coming amendment of our credit facility.
While this was a disappointing quarter and has been a very challenging year, we are deeply committed to our strategy to diversify beyond refining at petrochem with our defense work.
The pivot toward defense has been successful, as indicated by bookings and revenue.
Our defense revenue is now over half our total revenue.
We had a huge bookings quarter at $68 million.
Over half of these bookings were at Barber-Nichols.
Now that we have the bookings, we have to execute this work profitably.
Final point on this page is that Barber-Nichols' performance is exceeding our expectations.
They are building a larger backlog and delivering strong margins.
Jeff will provide more detail in the financial discussion.
But first, I'd like to provide more detail on our Navy challenges in Batavia.
We'll move to Slide 4.
So let me first address what led up to our third quarter performance.
To date, Graham manufacturing has been very successful in winning the trust and confidence of the U.S. Navy and its prime shipbuilders with its high-quality heat exchange and vacuum products used in the nuclear Navy power plants.
Navy orders and backlog continue to climb and have now significantly exceeded our commercial backlog and will soon exceed our commercial revenue.
As of December 31, 2021, our Navy backlog in Batavia was over $100 million.
Those orders come with big expectations.
As we have worked over the last two years to continue to win new business and meet those expectations, a perfect storm brewed in our third quarter.
There were several events that led to our need to readjust in Q3.
After getting started on Colombia, there was a Navy wide reset of quality requirements that caused delays with welder and quality recertification.
This was followed by the impact of COVID-19, the ongoing limited skilled workforce in the welding trades, and the sheer magnitude of work running through our shop combined with first article learning curve, all of these items caused us to get behind on our Navy jobs.
We do continue to have first article challenges.
This is quite typical with defense projects, and we would have expected this on the Columbia project.
We've reviewed this with you in the past.
Now while the CVN-80 work is not a true first article job for us, the lack of process documentation from the previous work combined with severe labor challenges and use of contract welders new to the equipment caused challenges on the carrier work as well.
Even as we work to catch up on hours, our equipment became the pacing item associated with our nation's most strategic ship and submarine build schedules.
The pressure to expedite was extreme.
Let's turn to Page 5.
The chart on Page 5 shows our labor plan with blue bars, our actual labor, application in gray bars, and the resulting deficit of hours caused by actual being less than our planned hourly expenditure.
The depth of our deficit occurred around May of 2021.
In past calls, we talked about redirecting commercial welders to Navy and hiring contract welders to address this deficit.
In third quarter, we redirected even more commercial welders, outsourced more commercial work, hired more contract welders and even added some of our new welders that completed our training programs.
These actions help to reverse the Navy labor deficit, but they came at additional costs.
Outsourcing commercial work results in less margin.
We also realized less third quarter revenue as the outsourced suppliers were not able to ramp up quickly.
The contract welder costs were high, the specialized training required by the Navy took a long time and retention of the contract welders was poor.
Ultimately, we've been able to reduce our Navy program labor deficit by doubling our Navy workforce, mitigating the schedule slips and keeping our customer relationship strong.
The deficit should be erased in the first half of fiscal '23, but we expect to start reducing high-cost contract welders as we enter the next fiscal year.
In the end, the actions we took to stay on track in the last quarter resulted in revising estimates on labor hours and material, and we booked loss conversion costs that were recorded in the quarter and impacted our results as well.
Jeff will cover that detail in the financial briefing.
Certainly, we've learned a lot from this experience and have or will institute corrective and preventative actions to ensure that we continue to grow our Navy business and can deliver quality products in a timely fashion and earn a fair return for our efforts.
Our customers have been very appreciative of our efforts and we do not see any negative consequences if we hold current deliveries.
This equipment is built into the bowels of these ships, and they will never come out.
Thus, quality is paramount and Graham has not disappointed.
As we catch up on these programs and reduce our labor deficit, we can reclaim margins by eliminating contract welders, reassigning our commercial welders back to our commercial product and reduce the outsourcing that we're doing today.
Our people pipeline continues to be critical, and our welder training program will be continued.
Looking back, we could have done a better job in predicting and mitigating the situation with better developed FP&A, financial planning and analysis, and project management skills.
We are adding new talent with defense expertise in Batavia to better manage these processes.
In fact, we're adding a new position and Batavia will have a Navy business leader beginning February 28.
As we look forward, our processes need to advance to enable our ability to document and optimize all of our fabrication processes to prevent a recurrence of this first article issues that we've seen.
We see opportunities to increase future profits with investment in time-saving automated welding, and we're evaluating current contract margins and revisiting pricing on future production opportunities.
In summary, our Batavia defense business was hit by a perfect storm at a very inopportune time.
We made decisions to protect our strategic Navy business.
It cost us in the short term, but proved our dedication to our customers for the long term.
As Dan mentioned, our third quarter performance was quite disappointing.
Sales were $28.8 million, up $1.6 million over last year's third quarter.
Barber-Nichols contributed $12 million in sales in the quarter, helping to offset the weak sales quarter of our legacy Graham manufacturing business.
Our Batavia operations were impacted because of its need to focus on catching up and executing the two large Navy projects.
Those projects will both require more labor and material costs to complete that were projected at the start of the quarter.
The additional labor hours to complete the projects impacted the quarter's revenue since we did not move the projects as far along as expected.
The added labor and material costs, including the use of higher cost contract laborers required us to record increased reserves.
The sum of all these items impacted both revenue and gross margin.
The impact of the cost increases and required fully burdened contract costs in the quarter were $2 million.
In addition, the delayed revenue was approximately $6 million, and the delayed operating profit is approximately $750,000.
Furthermore, to get back on schedule with the Navy projects, we reallocated our commercial labor to Navy work, which resulted in increases in cost estimates for those jobs, which have now been outsourced.
All of the above items contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $2.6 million in the quarter and an adjusted net loss of $0.27 per share.
On the positive front, with the addition of Barber-Nichols, we had 58% of our sales to the defense industry, as well as 5% or $1.5 million to the space industry.
If we can move on to Slide 7.
The impact of the third quarter results on top of a challenging first half of the year have yielded an unacceptable loss even as sales increased 16% or $11.3 million to $83.1 million.
There is a bright light within the results, and this has been the contributions of Barber-Nichols, which we acquired on June 1.
In the seven months since the acquisition, BN has contributed $31.9 million in sales, offsetting significant declines in refining and petrochemical markets.
In fact, our diversification into defense, which is less cyclical than our commercial business, has resulted in 52% of our year-to-date revenue coming from that industry.
The shortfall in commercial sales in the first nine months of the fiscal year reflects the very low order levels, which we saw in the second half of fiscal 2021.
The two Navy projects in our Batavia operations will continue to convert over the next three quarters, and we expect this to be behind us by mid fiscal 2023.
As of December 31, we recorded all known expected costs on these large projects.
We are also implementing expanded processes within our project management group to better review all of Batavia's major projects.
The year-to-date impact of increased cost on these two jobs is approximately $4.5 million.
In addition, the delayed revenue was approximately $12 million and the delayed operating profit is an additional $1.5 million.
These latter amounts will be recognized over the next three quarters as the jobs are completed.
We've had to outsource more commercial work and have also had cost challenges on a couple of projects.
This, too, has impacted financial results.
The increased cost of outsourcing and higher costs has impacted the commercial business by $3 million.
All of the above items contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $5.4 million year-to-date, and a year-to-date net loss of $0.70 a share and an adjusted loss of $0.60 per share.
Barber-Nichols again, is a strong positive in the first three quarters.
In the seven months since the acquisition, BN sales are on track at $31.9 million, and EBITDA margins are well ahead of expectations.
I have noted in previous calls, that we were expecting $45 million to $48 million in sales and low double-digit EBITDA margins.
The sales number is on target, and we are now seeing mid-teen EBITDA.
In fact, through seven months since the acquisition, BN has achieved our targeted EBITDA for the full fiscal year.
So its Q4 EBITDA will represent overachievement compared with our expectation.
Moving on to Slide 8.
And given the weak financial performance in the first three quarters, we have failed to meet our debt covenant related to debt-to-EBITDA and fixed cost charges.
This miss was due to the EBITDA loss.
We were given a waiver by our lender for Q3 and are proactively in negotiations to amend our existing bank agreement.
Because of the covenant misses, it was necessary to suspend our dividend.
And as part of the waiver agreement, we have agreed not to utilize more than $15 million of our revolver.
I want to be clear that the issues we are seeing are P&L profit issues and not liquidity issues.
We have sufficient liquidity from cash we are generating from operations to work through our challenges.
In fact, in January alone, lowered our revolver debt from $9.75 million to $6 million.
We expect to lower it further between now and the end of March.
Conversations with our lender have been very positive.
I've been pleased with the bank's willingness to understand the details and not overreact to the numbers.
They understand the near-term challenges are primarily related to profitability and delayed revenue.
While there are certainly some significant cost -- cash cost increases, the costs booked in Q3 and the elongation of project revenue and profit recognition into future quarters have doubled down the impact on our year-to-date P&L.
The bank and I both expect the lending amendment to be completed by the end of Q4.
Onto Slide 9, some very good news on the order front.
As Dan noted, orders in Q3 were $68 million.
Just over half of this came from Barber-Nichols, which most of their orders coming from key defense projects.
They also continue to bring in a nice level and variety of space orders.
On the commercial side, Graham manufacturing saw another strong quarter of aftermarket and short-cycle orders.
Those are promising since historically, an increase in those areas has often been a precursor to a recovery in capital investment by our customers.
We also booked a significant refinery order in China.
Our backlog at the end of Q3 is a record $272.6 million, with both Barber-Nichols and the legacy Graham business having a nice step-up in their respective backlogs during the quarter.
Defense represents 77% of total backlog.
This defense backlog extends over the next 6 years, though much of it converts in the next three to four years.
Additionally, we are seeing growth in our commercial backlog.
The commercial backlog was quite low entering the fiscal year.
It has grown from $33 million at the end of March to $63 million now.
About one-fourth of that increase occurred when we added BN, the rest was due to orders received in the first nine months of the year.
Another positive feature of the commercial backlog and its growth is that it has a much shorter conversion cycle than the defense backlog generally 12 to 18 months.
We've had a rough fiscal 2022, but the future looks far better.
Moving on to Slide 10.
We have lowered our guidance for fiscal 2022.
Our revenue guidance is now $120 million to $125 million, which implies $37 million to $42 million in Q4.
We expect a breakeven adjusted EBITDA in Q4.
While this is below our prior expectations, it's far better than Q3 results, and we believe we have turned the corner on many of the challenges we have faced this fiscal year.
I will now pass the call back to Dan to talk about our strategy going forward.
We are now on Slide 11.
At a high level, we have been talking about a strategic pivot toward defense for many years, and we have been making good progress.
The long-term visibility of strategic naval programs provide stability and an ability to invest intelligently in our business, and it offsets the cyclicality and challenges of our refining and petrochemical markets.
The acquisition of Barber-Nichols strengthened the strategy and brought additional market experience to our company.
As with any new venture, we have had some lessons learned and opportunities to further strengthen our strategy.
I'd now like to give you some insight on how our strategy is evolving going forward.
Let's turn to Page 12.
Graham Corporation is a related group of mission-critical engineered product companies that win on superior quality, performance and customer trust.
Our corporate role is to strengthen our member companies with best practices, leader rotation and board expertise while providing value-enhancing services and core in any collaboration to win large programs.
In fact, we are filling out critical leadership positions in upgrading talent for what the future of Graham Corporation requires.
Our board took on this requirement themselves last year after the BN acquisition, and they began a search for director candidates with strong defense experience.
Our Batavia operations, which we are referring to as Graham manufacturing, will continue to serve the Navy refining and petrochem markets with high-quality, highly engineered heat transfer and vacuum systems.
It is expanding into new energy and we'll now put more focus on aftermarket opportunities to be a life cycle partner with our customers.
Internally, we are restructuring for significant Navy growth and we'll be leveraging our large installed base for growth capital.
Our strengths will help us realize our goals.
In Batavia, we want to realize strong margin in all of our markets, improve our operational effectiveness and develop capabilities to provide more value to our customers.
We need to establish roles and responsibilities to align with the structure designed to be responsive analytical and forward thinking.
And we need to create an organization that is accountable and that can diagnose problems, evaluate alternatives, improve, develop, reshape and quickly redirect as required.
Importantly, we need to make sure our people are provided the tools, materials and information they need to do their jobs well.
Barber-Nichols continues on its path of intelligent full life cycle turbomachinery systems in identified high-growth potential markets.
BN has structured people, technology and customer relationships mostly in place.
They are moving to the next level in teams, processes and improvement to optimize business performance, while working even closer with customers developing new product to ensure year-over-year growth.
Our future opportunities will be the result of proper execution of our plans that will get us beyond these short-term issues.
We believe this is the inflection point.
We have no doubt hit bottom.
So I am confident we can go up from here.
I realize that we have to prove to you that we can drive earnings and generate cash.
As Jeff noted, we already have in the first month of 2022 -- in the first month of 2022, I'm sorry.
As we look to our future, we see the BN acquisition as a model that we will look to repeat.
There were several novel approaches utilized that we believe can entice the best and the brightest, small independent companies to join us.
We are an organization in the midst of dynamic change.
We serve great markets.
We have the confidence of the customer.
We have the orders and the backlog to prove it.
We have been challenged on execution, but have identified the issues and put corrective actions in place.
We have a plan for growth.
We believe we have a strong business model with excellent earnings, power and cash generation.
While we have several quarters of work to get these projects out the door, we are on the upward trend of the curve.
And then Jeff and I will answer questions from the audience.
","Graham Corporation experienced a challenging third quarter, reporting a loss per share of $0.35. Navy project cost overruns in the Batavia operations, due to labor and material shortages and first article challenges, significantly impacted performance. Despite the loss, revenue increased to $28.8 million, with defense representing 58% of sales. Barber-Nichols, acquired in June, contributed $12 million and is exceeding expectations, boosting overall sales. However, the company suspended its dividend due to covenant breaches related to debt-to-EBITDA and fixed cost charges, and is in negotiations to amend its bank agreement. The backlog remains strong at $272.6 million, with defense representing 77%, and Graham Corporation remains committed to its strategic pivot towards defense. The company's restructuring and focus on operational effectiveness and aftermarket opportunities are expected to drive future growth and profitability."
NJR_q1_2021.txt,"I'm joined here today by Steve Westhoven, our President and CEO; Pat Migliaccio, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of our senior management team.
This could cause results to materially differ from our expectations, as found in slide one.
We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP measures such as net financial earnings or NFE.
We believe that NFE provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance.
However, it is not intended to be a substitute for GAAP.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed more fully in Item seven of our 10-K.
Our agenda for today is found on slide two.
Steve will begin today's call with highlights from the quarter, followed by Pat, who will review our financial results.
New Jersey Resources delivered strong performance in the first quarter.
And on slide three, I'll take you through the highlights.
We reported NFE of $0.46 per share, driven by the performance of our core business, New Jersey Natural Gas.
We are also reaffirming our NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and increasing our fiscal 2022 NFE guidance to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from prior guidance.
At New Jersey Natural Gas, we completed almost 90% of the Southern Reliability Link and expect to place the project into service this year.
We received approval to move forward with our infrastructure Investment Program, a 5-year, $150 million accelerated recovery program that will improve the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.
And we filed for SAVEGREEN 2020, a new energy efficiency program that is designed to help our customers reduce their energy consumption and save money.
At Clean Energy Ventures, we acquired the 2.9 megawatt Mt. Laurel Solar Facility, which is part of our plan to invest $165 million this year.
In our Storage & Transportation business, we've begun to construct -- to convert the Southern portion of Adelphia Gateway to natural gas and expect it to be in service later this calendar year.
And just yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted PennEast petition to hear its appeal.
But despite this positive news, we are still excluding PennEast for our long term projections until there's more clarity on the project.
And at NJR Energy Services we entered into an asset management agreements, which will result in contracted cash proceeds of $501 million over a 10-year period.
I'll take you through the transaction in more detail on the next slide.
Turning to slide four.
Energy Services entered into a series of AMAs with an investment-grade public utility.
These transactions illustrate the value of our portfolio of natural gas storage and transportation contracts that are a testament to the hard work of our talented team.
The transactions assist our counterparty in securing needed supply, while Energy Services monetizes the value of a portion of the assets it controls.
Let me walk you through some of the specifics.
Beginning in November of 2021, which is our fiscal year 2022, NJRES will begin to release portions of our pipeline capacity.
Under the terms of the agreements, NJRES will receive payments of $261 million over the first three years of the AMAs.
After FY 2024, NJRES will receive additional payments of approximately $34 million per year through 2031.
The benefits for NJRES include, extracting value from our assets without the need for weather-related price volatility and reducing operational risks associated with the direct management of these transportation assets.
The result will be more predictable earnings and cash flows and a lower risk Energy Services business.
These transactions also allow us to increase our fiscal 2022 guidance by $0.15 per share, as we'll see on the next slide.
And later in the call, Pat will take you through other financial impacts of these transactions.
Turning to our NFE guidance for fiscal 2022 on slide five, we are increasing our overall guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share.
This reflects the impact of the AMAs and the expected cash settlement of our equity forward.
However, our long term annual growth rate of 6% to 10% remains based off our originally communicated guidance of $2.05 to $2.15 per share, which excludes the impact of the AMAs and any other contribution from Energy Services.
As Pat will discuss later, the NFE benefits of AMAs will not be the same every year.
And on slide six, I'll take you through some of the operational highlights.
Looking at the top left, we invested $89 million in New Jersey Natural Gas during the first quarter, with about 1/3 of the capex providing near real-time returns.
Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we added over 1,900 new customers, only slightly below the customer additions from the same period a year ago, which was pre-pandemic.
This is due to the favorable growth demographics in our service territories.
Construction on the Southern Reliability Link continues to progress, and we now have almost 90% of the project complete with an in-service date expected this year.
We plan to file our rate case to recover the costs associated with the project in fiscal 2021.
And as I mentioned earlier, we received approval for our IIP program and filed for SAVEGREEN 2020.
On slide seven, I'll take you through the operational highlights of our other core business, Clean Energy Ventures.
We added 2.9 megawatts of capacity this quarter.
And as you can see on the top right, we now have 360 megawatts of installed capacity.
We have a strong project pipeline with about $260 million worth of investments, either under contract or exclusivity that are targeted for commercial operation in fiscal 2021 and 2022.
Total invested capital at CEV this quarter was $23 million with $17 million of commercial projects and $6 million at Sunlight Advantage.
The bottom right shows our expected CEV revenue for fiscal 2021, a significant portion of which is secured through our SREC hedging program.
The sustainability agenda we've outlined for our company focuses on innovation, emissions reductions, energy efficiency and transparency.
But I'm pleased to report NJR has made significant progress.
Last quarter, we announced that NJR achieved our goal of reducing our New Jersey operational emissions by 50% of 2006 levels, well ahead of schedule.
And we set a new higher target of 60% reduction by 2030.
This is a significant accomplishment that reflects the decades of investment in safety and environmental responsibility.
It reflects our strong commitment to sustainability and the hard work of our team.
Our new target ensures our company's goals are aligned with the state's 2050 statutory goals for emissions reduction.
Last month, we issued our 12th Annual Corporate Sustainability Report, which is available on our website.
For the first time, this year's report includes ESG reporting and disclosures established by SASB, which is another step to increase transparency and strengthen our communications with our investors in the financial communities on these issues.
Slide 10 shows the main drivers of our NFE for the first quarter.
As we communicated at our Analyst Day in November, this is the first quarter where we're utilizing the deferral method of accounting for CEV.
And as such, we've recast our financials for the comparable periods.
Reported NFE of $44.7 million or $0.46 per share compared to NFE of $34.9 million or $0.38 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
New Jersey Natural Gas saw an NFE improvement of $5.6 million due primarily to a full quarter of higher base rates from NJNG's fiscal 2020 rate case settlement as compared to a partial quarter a year ago.
CEV was down $2, primarily due to increased O&M expenses related to project maintenance costs, especially with new projects placed in service, which is partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.
Storage & Transportation saw a modest increase during the quarter, mostly related to increased operating income from Leaf River, and was offset by interest expense related to the acquisitions of Leaf River and Adelphia Gateway.
Energy services improved $6.6 million, primarily due to higher financial margin compared to last year, due to increased natural gas pricing spreads.
Home Services and Other saw slightly lower operating revenue and slightly higher interest expense.
As Steve mentioned, we reaffirmed our NFE guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share for fiscal 2021.
On slide 11, you can see the segment contributions with our core businesses, NJNG and CEV, accounting for 80% of total NFE.
To help understand the distribution of our net financial earnings by quarter, let me walk you through how we expect NJNG's utility gross margin and CEV's revenues will occur.
For NJNG, we expect to recognize approximately 70% of our utility gross margin in the first half of the year, in line with our historical trends.
At CEV, the majority of our revenue will come in the second half of the year, in particular the fourth quarter, when we expect to recognize the majority of our SREC revenue.
We expect the net financial earnings contributions of our Storage & Transportation business to be fairly consistent throughout the year, because of the fixed price contracts.
On slide 12, we've highlighted the details of our SREC hedging program.
We continue to actively hedge to ensure SREC revenues are largely unaffected by future changes in SREC prices.
Energy year 2023, we increased our hedge level to 75%.
Comparing year 2024, market fundamentals and pricing remained strong with SREC trading at over 85% of SACP.
And we now have 49% of our 2024 volumes hedged.
Turning to slide 13.
I'll explain some of the nuances to achieve the revenue recognition for the AMAs.
Under the terms of the agreements, NJR will initially release the transportation capacity to our counterparty, and later on, will permanently release the contracts to the utility.
The accounting standard requires to allocate revenue to both the initial and permanent release.
With the disproportionate amount of revenue signed to the permanent releases that occur in fiscal years 2024 and 2032.
Subsequently, this allocation will generate a mismatch between revenue and cash proceeds.
Finally, I will note that while the revenue provides some general indication of the NFE, it does not reflect the impact of taxes, demand charges and other items.
Importantly, though, the cash proceeds provides us with additional benefits that I'll detail shortly.
As you can see on slide 14, we now expect our cash flows from operations to grow the CAGR of approximately 25% from fiscal 2020 to 2024 compared to our previous estimate of 20%.
And as you can see from the chart on the right, the strength of our cash flows implies that our dividends are expected to become a smaller percentage, supporting our long term dividend growth rate of 6% to 10%.
Another benefit from the AMAs is the improvement to our credit metrics, which you can see on slide 15.
As we reported at our Analyst Day, our FFO to adjusted debt ratio is rising from fiscal 2022 to 2024.
And when you have the positive impact of the AMAs, our metrics are expected to increase to the high teens in fiscal 2022, and reach about 20% by fiscal 2024.
And because of these strong credit metrics, we will cash settle the equity forward we put in place during our December 2019 equity issuance.
At that time, we issued 5.3 million shares, and we entered into an equity forward to issue an additional 1.2 million shares at a later date, which we no longer need to do.
Also, as we mentioned during our Analyst Day, we have no block equity needs in foreseeable future.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter.
NJR is off to a good start for fiscal 2021 and on track to meet our NFEPS guidance for this fiscal year.
We increased our fiscal 2022 NFEPS guidance by $0.15 per share, and we expect strong cash flow to support our dividend growth.
Our key infrastructure projects, SRL and Adelphia Gateway, continue to make progress, and we expect both to be in service this calendar year.
Our improved credit metrics allow us to cash settle our equity forward.
And as we said in our Investor Day, we have no need for further block equity issuances.
And we've made substantial progress in our commitment to de-risk the Energy Services business by providing more stable fee based revenue.
","New Jersey Resources delivered a strong first quarter with net financial earnings (NFE) of $0.46 per share, driven by the performance of New Jersey Natural Gas. The company reaffirmed its NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and increased its fiscal 2022 NFE guidance to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from prior guidance. Key milestones include the near completion of the Southern Reliability Link, approval for a $150 million infrastructure investment program, and the acquisition of a 2.9-megawatt solar facility. Additionally, New Jersey Resources entered into asset management agreements (AMAs) with an investment-grade utility, resulting in $501 million in contracted cash proceeds over 10 years, which will significantly improve the predictability of earnings and cash flows and reduce operational risks in its Energy Services business. The company expects strong cash flow growth and improved credit metrics, allowing them to cash settle their equity forward and eliminate future block equity needs."
BG_q1_2021.txt,"Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well.
Turning to Slide three, you'll see the agenda for today's call.
I'll start with some highlights of the first quarter before handing over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance.
Let's start with an overview of the quarter, turning to Slide four.
We brought positive momentum into the quarter, and we continued to capture the opportunities in front of us, delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of increased earnings.
Operationally, our team did a fantastic job maximizing our assets.
We reached a new high watermark for crush capacity utilization, and we continued to reduce unplanned downtime.
We also executed well in the marketplace through outstanding customer service, innovation, agility and partnership.
Our strong results over the past few quarters reflect the value of working as a unified global company and the benefits of our integrated model delivers to our customers on both ends of the value chain, from farmers to customers to consumers.
We're committed to continuous improvement and managing risk effectively because while we're incredibly proud of what we have achieved, we recognize there's always more we can do, especially in an industry that doesn't always offer a straight-line path from quarter-to-quarter.
The dramatic swings in consumer and customer behavior during the COVID pandemic are case in point.
COVID is still very much a factor in most parts of the world, especially in Brazil and India, and our thoughts are with all of those who are still in the center of the battle with this pandemic.
In regions where restrictions are easing, we're seeing increased demand in pricing across the range of products as people begin to get back to regular life patterns.
And regardless of those more encouraging trends, our top priority continues to be the safety of our team, their families and communities.
Turning now to our segment performance.
As you saw last week, we changed our reporting to better align with our new value chain operating structure.
John will go into more detail on that later in the call, but our new segments more closely reflect the way we manage our business.
In the first quarter, we delivered especially strong results in Agribusiness.
Earnings were driven primarily by oilseed processing, particularly in softseeds, and our merchandising value chains.
Refined and Specialty orders -- Oils had a record quarter, benefiting from tightening global supplies, improved demand, particularly in North America, and our continued focus on customers and innovation.
And before handing the call over to John, you'll note that with our strong first quarter results and favorable outlook across a number of our markets, we raised our full year adjusted earnings per share forecast to approximately $7.50.
I'll share some additional thoughts on the remainder of 2021 before opening the call for Q&A.
In -- you may have seen our announcement last week that we have changed our segment reporting to align with our new value chain model and to reflect how we manage the business and review financial information.
Within Agribusiness, we have realigned grains and oilseeds operations in the processing and merchandising.
The Fertilizer segment has been eliminated with those results now included in the processing component of Agribusiness.
Processing, in addition to fertilizer, is principally the oilseed operations plus the soy and softseed crush-related origination activities previously included in grains.
Let's turn to earnings highlights on Slide five.
Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $5.52 compared to a loss of $1.46 in the first quarter 2020.
Our reported results include a net gain of $1.09 related to the previously announced sale of our Rotterdam oil refinery as well as our packaging plant in Mexico.
Reported results also include a mark-to-market timing difference of $1.30 per share.
Adjusted earnings per share was $3.13 in the quarter versus $0.91 in the prior year.
Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $737 million in the quarter versus $354 million in the prior year driven by strong performances in our Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils segments.
As Greg noted, Agribusiness results in the quarter reflect outstanding execution by the team, managing our crush capacity and trade flows.
In processing, improved performance in the quarter was driven by higher results in all softseed and soy crush value chains, which included an increased contribution from U.S. soybean origination.
In addition, we achieved record Q1 soy and rapeseed crush volume capacity utilization, reflecting reduced unplanned downtime and excellent coordination between our commercial and industrial teams.
This improved crush output brings immediate financial benefits, especially in periods of strong margins like we have been experiencing.
In Merchandising, improved volumes and margins in our global oils, corn and wheat value chains were primarily driven by increased export demand, strong grain origination in North America and Australia and outstanding execution of logistics and risk management.
Results in our Financial Services business were also higher.
In Refined and Specialty Oils, the strong performance reflected higher results in all regions driven by improved execution as well as favorable market trends.
Margins in North America refining benefited from early stage recovery in foodservice and increased demand from the renewable diesel sector.
Higher margins in South America and Europe more than offset lower volumes.
Asia benefited from strong demand in India prior to the reimposition of restrictions due to the surge in new COVID cases.
In Milling, results were down in both North and South America primarily due to lower margins.
Additionally, volumes in Brazil were negatively impacted by the resurgence in COVID cases.
The increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to the performance-based compensation accruals, a portion of which was not allocated out to the segment.
The decrease in Other was related to our captive insurance program.
Results for our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture benefited from higher sugar and ethanol volume and higher sugar prices in local currency.
Prior year results reflect less favorable environment and were also negatively impacted by approximately $25 million in FX translation losses of the joint venture due to depreciation of Brazilian real.
For the quarter, income tax expense was $192 million as compared to an income tax benefit of $55 million for the prior year.
The increase in income tax expense was due to higher pre-tax income.
Adjusted for notable items, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%.
Net interest expense of $64 million was in line with our expectations.
Here, you can see our positive earnings trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four years, along with the most recent trailing 12-month period.
This improved performance not only reflects a strong operating environment, but also the hard work of our global teams and the benefits of our new operating model that brings organizational alignment across the regions and, importantly, has shifted our culture to one of continuous improvement and capital discipline.
Slide seven compares our first quarter SG&A to the prior year.
We achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $16 million, of which approximately 80% was related to indirect costs.
COVID-related restrictions continued to impact areas, such as travel, but we also realized lower employee and professional services costs.
Moving to Slide 8.
The most recent trailing 12-month period, our cash generation, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, were strong at approximately $2.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations.
This cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably fund our cash obligations over the past year and retained approximately $1.4 billion to strengthen our balance sheet in support of our credit rating objective of BBB/Baa2.
On Slide nine details our capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations for the first quarter.
After allocating $32 million of sustaining capex, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety and $8 million to preferred dividends, we had $493 million of discretionary cash flow available.
Of this amount, we paid $71 million in common dividends to shareholders and invested $21 million in growth and productivity capex, leaving approximately $400 million of retained cash flow.
Moving on to Slide 10.
The $400 million of retained cash flow and other cash sources, including proceeds from the sale of assets, more than offset our approximately $700 million of cash outflow this quarter for working capital.
As a result, net debt decreased by approximately $100 million.
We also took action to increase our availability under committed credit lines to $5.8 billion, leaving us with ample liquidity to support potentially higher working capital needs.
As you can see on Slide 11, we further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter to a point where the entirety of our net debt funded 91% of our readily marketable inventory with the 90% balance of RMI being funded with equity.
The trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 18.7% or 12.1 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%.
ROIC was 13.4%, 7.4 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6% and well above our stated target of 9%.
The widening spread between these metrics reflects how we have been effectively using RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit.
Moving to Slide 13.
Our discretionary cash flow and cash flow yield have continued to increase, reflecting strong cash flow generation that is available for strengthening our balance sheet, investing in growth and returning to shareholders.
For the trailing 12 months, we produced a discretionary cash flow of almost $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of nearly 29%.
As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our strong Q1 results, forward curves and market conditions, we've increased our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook from at least $6 per share to approximately $7.50 per share.
This is based on the following expectations.
In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be up from our previous expectations, but down from 2020.
In Refined and Specialty Oils, we expect full year results to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher compared to last year due to strong first quarter results and positive demand trends in North America.
Results in Milling and Corporate and Other are expected to be generally in line with last year.
In noncore, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be a positive contributor driven by improved sugar and Brazilian ethanol prices.
Additionally, the company expects the following for 2021: an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 22%, net interest expense in the range of $230 million to $240 million, capital expenditures in the range of two -- $425 million to $475 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $415 million.
With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.
Before opening the call to Q&A, I want to provide some perspective on the balance of 2021.
As we noted, with our strong first quarter performance and what we see from the forward curves, we're forecasting full year earnings per share to be around $7.50.
While we don't have full visibility in the back half of the year, the market and demand trends are favorable.
We expect higher volumes because of increased post-COVID foodservice demand in several countries as well as from the U.S. renewable diesel industry in the second half of the year.
Because of the work we've done, we now have the ability to pursue the type of projects that help us meet growing demand and continue to improve our platform.
We have a number of projects in various stages to enhance the efficiency of our core oilseeds business.
We're taking a thoughtful approach as we invest in our specialty fats and oils and our plant-based proteins businesses.
And we're staying disciplined, but also recognize that the demand for sustainable products is providing us more opportunities than ever to grow our business as we continue to connect farmers to consumers.
The leadership team and I are incredibly proud of the entire Bunge team's continued focus on execution, and we're confident in our capabilities and the business model we have here at Bunge.
While there's always more work to be done, we're making progress every day, and the results are evident.
","Bunge reported strong Q1 financials with adjusted earnings per share of $3.13, a significant increase from $0.91 last year, driven by strong performance in its Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils segments. The company cited increased demand and margins in its soy and softseed crush value chains, as well as record volume utilization. In Refined and Specialty Oils, improved execution and favorable market conditions drove higher results. Bunge has also strengthened its balance sheet, with net debt now funded by 91% of its readily marketable inventory. Amidst ongoing COVID-19 challenges, the company remains optimistic about the demand environment and has raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook to approximately $7.50 per share."
TFX_q3_2021.txt,"During this conference call, you will hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance.
Management is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters.
It's a pleasure to speak with you today.
For the third quarter, Teleflex generated double-digit constant currency revenue and 27% adjusted earnings-per-share growth on a year-over-year basis despite a greater-than-expected headwind from increased COVID-19 infections due to the Delta variant.
All of our global product families grew on a constant currency basis year-over-year with the exception of our other category due to the divestiture of the respiratory assets to Medline.
Although we encountered a change in macro trends versus expectations at the time of the second quarter, the solid performance for Teleflex during the third quarter of 2021 reflects the diversified nature of our business and the benefits of the company's broad portfolio of medically necessary products and category leadership.
Our six primary product families and broad global footprint helped offset pressure on product revenues associated with elective surgery that were subject to pauses during the third quarter.
As many investors will be aware, there were restrictions on elective surgical procedures in as many as 28 states during the third quarter.
However, as we have seen since the pandemic began, our broad-based portfolio provides a hedge in periods of increased COVID activity with more than 60% of our business, either benefiting from increased COVID-related treatments or remaining relatively insulated from disruptions due to the pandemic.
Although we do not routinely provide intra-quarter commentary, given the larger-than-expected surge in COVID-19 infections from the delta variant, I will share some details for the third quarter.
Relative to guidance provided at the time of our Q2 earnings report, we saw a greater-than-anticipated pause in elective surgical procedures across select geographies in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
However, as COVID-19 infections trended down, we saw our average daily sales for products most exposed to elective surgical procedures begin to improve as we progressed through September.
During the third quarter, our Americas, EMEA, Asia and OEM segments demonstrated resilience with all regions showing constant currency revenue growth over 2020 despite the headwinds from the delta variant.
As I mentioned earlier, this underscores the benefit of our diversified product portfolio.
For the third quarter, gross and operating margins exceeded levels achieved in 2020 and 2019 in comparable periods.
Our continued progress in margin expansion in 2021 has allowed us to increase directed investments toward growth drivers, which is an important component of our long-term strategy to enhance durable growth.
We remain cognizant of uncertainty around COVID-19 infections as the weather turns colder in the Northern Hemisphere, new variants and healthcare worker shortages.
Accordingly, we believe that it is prudent to assume that COVID-19 will remain a headwind and that a broad-based return to elective surgical procedures to normal volumes is unlikely during the fourth quarter.
We anticipate these elements to be transitory in nature, and we expect a more normalized environment to be established in 2022.
Given our year-to-date results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our constant currency revenue growth to a range of 8% to 9% from 8.5% to 9.75% previously.
The revision in the constant currency growth outlook is primarily driven by lower growth expectations for products used in elective surgical procedures.
However, given strength in our operating margin performance and improvements in our balance sheet, we are increasing earnings per share guidance to a range of $13.15 to $13.35 versus our previous range of $12.90 to $13.10, implying growth of 23% to 25% year-over-year.
Turning to a more detailed review of our third quarter results.
Third quarter revenue was $700.3 million, an increase of 10.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.
The year-over-year increase reflects the benefit of our diversified portfolio and was driven by contributions from all business segments, offset by the impact of COVID-19 and the divestiture of the respiratory assets to Medline.
In comparison to the comparable period in 2019, third quarter revenue increased 5.8% and demonstrated accelerating quarter-over-quarter growth in our Vascular, OEM and Anesthesia businesses, which offset sequential deceleration in areas of the business more exposed to the surge in COVID-19, including Interventional Urology, Interventional and Surgical.
Third quarter growth and operating margin performance exceeded our expectations reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio, partially offset by greater-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19.
Our year-to-date margin performance is an encouraging sign for our longer-term profitability objectives.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.51 increased 26.7% year-over-year and exceeded our internal expectations.
Despite higher-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19 on our adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter, the year-over-year performance reflects growth in our diversified product portfolio, modest price increases, gross margin expansion and better-than-expected operating expense management.
We continue to execute on our strategy to deliver durable growth with investment in organic growth opportunities, product innovation, margin expansion and deployment of capital for deleveraging our balance sheet and M&A.
I am proud of how the team continues to execute in a challenging environment.
Our third quarter financial performance demonstrates the resilience of our diversified global product portfolio, our targeted investment in growth drivers, including UroLift and MANTA while also reflecting progress toward our longer-term margin aspirations.
Turning now to a deeper look at revenue results.
I will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenues.
Americas revenues were $417.3 million in the third quarter, which represents 10.9% growth year-over-year.
Contributors to the year-over-year growth were Surgical, Vascular and Interventional, partially offset by the impact of pauses in elective surgical procedures.
EMEA revenues of $143.9 million increased 3.6% year-over-year with Interventional and Vascular products leading the growth.
EMEA benefited from a favorable COVID-19-related comparison due to improved procedure volumes year-over-year as countries across the region continued to open up despite disruptions related to COVID-19.
Revenues were $75 million, increasing 6.3% year-over-year.
Japan was strong in the third quarter, growing north of 30%, but was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 in Southeast Asia.
Let's now move to a discussion of our third quarter revenues by global product category.
Consistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments, commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis and ranked by size of our business units.
As a reminder, there were no meaningful differences in year-over-year selling days in the third quarter.
Starting with Vascular Access.
Third quarter revenue increased 8.5% to $175.5 million.
Our category leadership in central venous catheters and midlines, along with our novel coated PICC portfolio, continues to position us for dependable growth.
Our Vascular Access portfolio remains important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, driving strength in the third quarter due to increased rates of coronavirus infections.
Our PICC portfolio continues to perform well with 10% growth year-over-year.
We continue to invest behind our differentiated PICC portfolio and are taking market share.
Intraosseous was also solid in the third quarter with growth up 12% year-over-year.
Third quarter revenue was $104.3 million, up 10.4% year-over-year.
We executed well during the third quarter, although increased COVID-19 infections slowed complex PCI and TAVR procedures.
We continue to invest behind our interventional portfolio, including complex catheters and MANTA, our large-bore closure device.
MANTA momentum remains strong, both in the U.S. and in international markets, with over 80% global growth year-over-year in the third quarter.
Given the year-to-date performance for MANTA, we are confident in our ability to achieve 8% share in 2021 of the $200 million to $300 million global market opportunity.
Turning now to Anesthesia.
Third quarter revenue was $97.1 million, up 26.6% year-over-year.
Products from Z-Medica contributed roughly 85% of the growth as the business continues to track to our $60 million to $70 million revenue expectations for 2021, partly offset by lower sales of tracheostomy products.
In our Surgical business, revenue was $92.8 million, representing 10.9% growth year-over-year.
Among our largest product categories, we witnessed robust growth in sales of our ligation clips and instruments as the elective surgical procedure environment was stronger than in the prior year period, partially offset by the impact of the Delta variant in select geographies.
Urology, third quarter revenue was $83.1 million, an increase of 1.5% year-over-year and below our expectations at the time of the quarter two conference call.
The quarter was impacted by elective surgery cancellations due to state restrictions and ICU capacity limitations as delta variant infections rose sharply in certain regions of the U.S. as well as continued business disruption associated with the pandemic.
We are closely monitoring trends in our UroLift business.
Importantly, our analysis of commercial and Medicare billing claims over the past six months indicates that UroLift has not lost market share to competing minimally invasive treatments for BPH and remains the leading procedure.
We continue to see COVID-19 as having the most significant impact on UroLift utilization with physician office staffing shortages also disrupting the business.
We see both of these impacts as transitory in nature and expect a more normalized environment in 2022.
The preference for UroLift continues to be driven by strong clinical results, with studies showing rapid symptom relief and recovery, no new sustained sexual dysfunction and durable results.
Indeed, our analysis shows that very few of our experienced users offer other technologies for the treatment of BPH given their confidence in UroLift.
The UroLift system remains distinct from other device-based BPH treatments, and we intend to maintain our leading market position in day surgery treatments for this condition.
We continue to target patients that are suffering from BPH and have either failed or are not satisfied with drug therapy, a population that is estimated to be 1.5 million men in the United States.
As we look toward the fourth quarter of 2021, we are assuming a relatively stable macro environment as compared to our September trends given lingering COVID-19 headwinds for elective surgical procedures.
When taking into account the softer-than-expected UroLift revenues during the third quarter and our recalibration of the fourth quarter, we are reducing our 2021 Interventional Urology revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17% year-over-year.
We would anticipate a more normal environment for elective surgical procedures to emerge during 2022.
We remain encouraged by the physician engagement as measured by our active users, new physician training, and the ability to perform UroLift procedures in all relevant care settings.
Our OEM business, which accounts for roughly 9% of total sales increased 29.4% year-over-year to $64.1 million in the third quarter.
We continue to see strength in our OEM business as customer ordering normalizes, and we remain well positioned in our markets with customers valuing our design and manufacturing capabilities.
And finally, our other category, which consists of respiratory products that were not included in the divestiture to Medline, manufacturing service agreement revenues and Urology Care products declined by 4.3% to $83.4 million year-over-year.
The decline largely reflects the loss of revenue due to the divestiture of the respiratory products, partially offset by manufacturing service agreement revenues and growth in Urology Care.
We continue to expect manufacturing service agreement revenues to phase out at the end of 2023.
That completes my comments on the third quarter revenue performance.
Turning to some commercial updates and starting with UroLift.
In the third quarter, we trained 124 urologists.
Interest in UroLift remains strong, and with over 355 doctors trained in the year-to-date, we remain positioned to meet our training target of 450 to 500 urologists in 2021.
Turning to our consumer marketing efforts.
We continue to view direct-to-consumer as a multiyear catalyst for UroLift in the United States.
We have continued to fund our DTC campaign to prime the pump for the recovery in elective procedures, and we'll keep investing in the fourth quarter.
We recently won a bronze award for best new branded television campaign from DTC perspective, which is a meaningful accomplishment given 13 finalists.
Search interest for UroLip remains high and well above other minimally invasive BPH treatments with the majority of urologist surveys continuing to report patients asking for the UroLift System.
Moving to UroLift 2.
We remain on a full rollout in the United States.
We've formally launched the product as well as the UroLift ATC to the broad urology community at the AUA meeting in September.
We are well positioned to convert the majority of physician customers to UroLift two by the end of 2022, fueled by advantages in tissue compression, reduced storage space and increased manufacturing capacity.
UroLift two remains an important margin driver as we remain positioned to generate 400 basis points of UroLift gross margin expansion as the revenue base is fully converted.
Regarding Japan, we continue to make progress toward an upcoming commercial launch for UroLift.
Recently, the three major Japanese urology societies agreed on guidelines for UroLift usage, which is a positive development.
As for reimbursement approval, we remain highly engaged with the MHLW and has been officially notified that UroLift will be reviewed at an expert panel in November.
Although we cannot control the timing of the regulatory pathway, the panel confirmation is an important milestone toward reimbursement in Japan, marking one of the final steps in the process.
There is no change to our baseline assumptions that our commercial ramp will begin in 2022.
Japan remains an important long-term opportunity for UroLift with a $2 billion TAM and we are excited for our upcoming launch.
We continue to expect our sales in the region to ramp in a similar fashion to the U.S. in a market that is 1/3 the size.
Aside from Japan, our international regulatory and commercialization efforts for UroLift remain active.
On another positive note, we are excited about our initial commercial activity in Brazil.
Although we have been expecting to enter Brazil in late 2022, we have been able to shorten our time line with a limited market release late in the third quarter of 2021.
We have made good progress with select key opinion leader training and initial UroLift cases have already been performed in the hospital and office setting.
Although it is early, and the market will take some time to develop, Brazil remains an important geography in our expansion of UroLift outside of the United States, and we are quite encouraged by the early experience.
On the U.S. reimbursement front, and as a reminder, CMS published its proposed physician fee schedule for calendar 2022 on July 13, 2021.
The proposed rule would negatively impact reimbursement for roughly 600 procedures performed in the doctor's office across a broad range of surgical specialties with a disproportionate hit to device-heavy procedures such as UroLift.
Teleflex provided a detailed response to CMS during the public comment period regarding our position on the proposed rule.
We believe that the changes to the physician fee schedule would limit healthcare access for Medicare patients and shift procedures to more costly sites of service.
Teleflex, along with numerous other stakeholders, have urged CMS to postpone the implementation of the proposed physician fee schedule until additional analysis can be performed given the unintended consequences of the current proposed route.
We anticipate that the final rule will be published in November, consistent with historic timing.
We are pleased with the performance of our recently launched Arrow ErgoPack kit, which contributed over $5 million in revenue during the third quarter.
Among other improvements, the new kit configuration for our CVC catheters as a nitinol guidewire which is kink-resistant and an enhancement that clinicians find beneficial.
Given our leading market share in CVCs, the launch is a trade-up strategy that drives incremental gross profit dollars and helps sustain our dominant market leadership position in CVCs.
Lastly, on our acquisition of Z-Medica, which was completed in December of 2020.
The integration of Z-Medica continues to track slightly ahead of our internal milestones, and we are pleased with the progress we are making.
Regarding potential label expansion opportunities for the hemostat portfolio, we have completed patient enrollment in a 231-patient IDE study, evaluating the performance of QuikClot Control+ hemostatic devices from mild-to-moderate bleeding in cardiac procedures as compared to standard goals.
We intend to file a 510(k) for expanded use of QuikClot Control+ following the completion of the study.
Given the previous discussion of the company's revenue performance, I'll begin at the gross profit line.
For the third quarter, adjusted gross margin totaled 59.5%, a 230 basis point increase versus the prior year period.
The year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by product and regional mix, benefits from cost improvement initiatives, favorable impacts from pricing, M&A and foreign exchange, partly offset by raw material and distribution inflation.
Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 28.5% or a 340 basis point year-over-year increase, driven by the gross margin improvement as well as disciplined expense management and partially offset by planned investment in the business.
For the quarter, net interest expense totaled $11.8 million, a decrease from $16.4 million in the prior year period.
The year-over-year decrease in net interest expense reflects savings from the redemption of the 2026 notes and also includes the impact of debt paydown using the proceeds of the respiratory divestiture and operating cash flows.
Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 11.3% compared to 7% in the prior year period.
The year-over-year increase in our adjusted tax rate is primarily due to a lower benefit from stock-based compensation compared to the prior year period.
At the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 26.7% to $3.51.
Included in this result is an estimated favorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.13 per share versus prior year.
Turning to select balance sheet and cash flow highlights.
Year-to-date, cash flow from operations totaled $450.5 million compared to $241.5 million in the prior year period and represented a year-over-year increase of $209 million.
The increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results, lower contingent consideration payments, lower payroll and benefit-related payments and proceeds received under the manufacturing supply agreement with Medline.
Moving to the balance sheet.
Our financial position remains sound.
At the end of the third quarter 2021, our cash balance was $481.2 million versus $375.9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
As noted previously, we made a $259 million payment in July against our revolving credit facility, using funds primarily generated from the initial close of the respiratory business divestiture.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $342 million drawn on our revolver and net leverage was approximately 2 times.
Now moving on to our 2021 guidance update.
We are adjusting our 2021 constant currency revenue growth guidance to a range of 8% to 9% year-over-year compared to 8.5% to 9.75% previously.
Realized outlook reflects the benefits of our diversified portfolio, offset by lower UroLift revenues due to the recovery in elective surgical procedures progressing at a slower rate than what our prior 2021 financial guidance had assumed.
We continue to assume a 2% tailwind to reported revenue from foreign exchange rates in 2021, which is unchanged from our previous assumption.
As a result, we are reducing our as-reported revenue growth guidance to 10% to 11% year-over-year versus 10.5% to 11.75% previously.
The updated guidance would equate to a dollar range of between $2.791 billion and $2.186 billion.
Now for some commentary on our margin outlook.
We are lowering the top end of our 2021 adjusted gross margin guidance by 25 basis points to a range of between 59.25% and 59.5%.
On a year-over-year basis, we expect gross margin expansion to be driven primarily by a favorable mix of high-margin products, including Interventional Urology, Interventional Access and Surgical as well as from manufacturing productivity improvement programs and benefits from previously announced Footprint restructuring programs, partially offset by inflation.
Relative to our prior guidance, the revised outlook is associated with lower UroLift revenues and the impact of higher inflation than previously assumed.
There is no change to our expectation at Z-Medica, will add approximately 50 basis points to gross margin for 2021.
On the topic of inflation, we continue to experience increased cost pressures in raw materials, freight and to a lesser extent, labor.
Additionally, at the end of 2020, we had entered into contracts for sea freight lanes in order to lock-in pricing at that time.
The majority of those contracts expired at the end of September, with the remainder expiring at the end of the year.
As a result of the expiring shipping contracts and increasing inflation, we now estimate that inflationary costs will be roughly $3 million higher in the fourth quarter than what was incurred in the third quarter.
This impact is reflected in our revised guidance for gross margins.
For adjusted operating margin, we are increasing our 2021 guidance range to 27.5% to 28%, representing an increase of 75 basis points at the low end and 50 basis points at the high end of the range versus prior guidance.
The increase in adjusted operating margin reflects the year-to-date performance, partially offset by the lower gross margin outlook.
Moving down the P&L.
We now expect interest expense to be roughly $57 million versus our previous guidance of $60 million to $62 million.
The decrease in net interest expense for 2021 largely reflects a reduction in debt, funded by proceeds from the respiratory divestiture and our strong cash flow generation.
On taxes, we now expect our adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be roughly 12% to 13% versus the prior range of 13% to 13.5%.
Considering all of these elements, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2021 by $0.25 at the high and low end of the range to $13.15 to $13.35, a 23.2% to 25.1% year-over-year increase.
In closing, I will highlight our three key takeaways from the quarter.
First, our diversified product portfolio enables Teleflex to deliver double-digit constant currency growth in the third quarter, even with greater-than-expected disruption from COVID-19.
Second, we continue to execute on our strategy to drive durable growth across our diversified portfolio with investment in organic growth opportunities, margin expansion and deployment of capital for M&A.
Third, we raised our earnings per share guidance for 2021, reflecting 23% to 25% earnings growth year-over-year.
In closing, we feel good about our overall performance in the quarter, which was anchored by our diversified portfolio of medically necessary products.
Our balance sheet is in a solid position with leverage at 2 times, providing ample financial flexibility for our capital allocation priorities.
We remain confident in our future and our ability to continue to meet commitments to patients, clinicians, communities and shareholders.
","Teleflex reported strong third-quarter results despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Revenue growth reached 10.3% year-over-year, driven by all business segments except the divested respiratory assets and Urology, which saw lower growth due to elective surgery restrictions. The company's diversified portfolio, including high-growth areas like Vascular Access, Interventional, and Anesthesia, offset the headwinds from COVID-19. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year, driven by product mix, cost improvements, and disciplined expense management. Teleflex raised its 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $13.15 to $13.35, representing a 23% to 25% increase, due to better-than-expected margin performance and improved balance sheet strength. Despite ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19 and inflation, Teleflex remains optimistic about its ability to drive long-term growth and meet its commitments to stakeholders."
ABM_q1_2021.txt,"Total revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 7.5% decline versus last year, which exceeded our expectation and reflects continued sequential improvement.
As anticipated, our Aviation segment remains the primary driver behind the revenue decrease.
On both the GAAP and an adjusted basis, earnings grew by a 160% or more year-over-year.
GAAP continuing earnings per share grew to a $1.10 per share or $1.01 per share on an adjusted basis.
Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 400 basis points to 8.3% compared to last year.
Anchoring these results was elevated demand for higher margin Work Orders for virus protection as well as our EnhancedClean services which are longer term in nature.
Effective labor management continued to be a lever for profitability.
As you may remember, the majority of our contracts are performance based, so any efficiencies we find in staffing as occupancy drops or schools are in a hybrid situation [Phonetic] in order to our benefit.
This is the advantage of having a flexible labor model.
Earl, will discuss our segments in more detail, but overall, our industry group drivers are similar to what we saw during the balance of last year.
Not surprisingly our Aviation and Technical Solutions segments were challenged by the pandemic due to decreased global travel and limited site access for retrofit projects and educational facilities.
Education as the segment though grew top and bottom line during the quarter, which shows how well our team has adapted operationally to the hybrid learning system and Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing are still strong outperformers.
We've been able to offset COVID related revenue compression with higher margin Work Orders, EnhancedClean contracts and labor management.
We're now almost at the one-year mark since the start of the pandemic and I've just summarized our fourth consecutive quarter of strong results.
This sustained performance suggests that we have reached a level of consistency in our results and stabilization across our client portfolio.
Let me now provide some thoughts on where we believe the operating environment is headed, especially in light of our full year guidance.
Before I dive into what momentum to normalcy looks like in 2021, I want to underscore that normalcy does not imply less vigilance around virus protection.
Over the past several months, there have been countless news and scientific journals reminding us that COVID-19 and its after effects will continue to linger over the foreseeable future.
Many believe it will be a permanent fact of life with people getting regularly vaccinated similar to how we handle flu vaccinations.
We are so enthusiastic that vaccine rollouts are under way across the country.
Most importantly, the vaccines will save lives, but the rollouts will also lead to momentum back to work, school, travel and attending entertainment venues.
However vaccine rollouts have not been uniformed on a state by state basis nor have stayed policies on masking, public gatherings and other factors that impact infections and new cases.
These factors as well as the ongoing discovery of new variants highlight how societies need to respond to COVID-19 on an elevated level, will not end in the near-term.
This is why it's so critical for us to partner with our clients and assess their evolving needs and engage our expert advisory panel.
In B&I, the vaccines will spur momentum back to work, which for us means a return of more traditional janitorial work as well as the continuation of disinfecting given higher occupancy.
Currently, average occupancy across the country is approximately 15%.
We anticipate this could increase to 25% by Labor Day and grow to 50% plus through calendar year-end.
As clients begin to plan their returns, they are focusing on building trust in their facilities through health and safety protocols, rigor around cleaning, disinfecting and especially physical spacing will be incorporated into their plans.
For this reason, we do not anticipate a near-term reduction space utilization across commercial real estate, especially with Class A buildings and blue-chip clients.
For a sector like education, we believe the hybrid models will be in effect for at least the rest of the school year.
Soon, if not already, institutions will start planning for the fall 2021 semester with a push for more in-person learning in the K through 12 segment and higher ed.
How this unfolds could vary by region.
We should have a better line of sight when we speak to you after Q2 earnings.
And I'm sure as vaccine adoption continues to expand, there's probably no sector more poised for a robust volume recovery than Aviation.
We are definitely hearing about pent-up demand for personal travel and minimally a modest return of business travel.
For ABM, our business portfolio consists of both airlines and airports.
As airports were opened during the pandemic, operations in areas like terminal cleaning, transportation and shuttle service enabled us to mitigate reduced volumes on the airline side.
And ultimately, this diversification helped us breakeven last year, which was a major achievement.
On the airline side, current travel volumes are approximately 50% of pre-COVID levels.
Assuming vaccine rollouts gain traction, we believe we could see that grow moderately by year-end.
As both airlines and airports see increased traffic, the need for disinfection, virus protection and EnhancedClean will grow.
On an enterprise level, we conducted a Pulse Survey of approximately 200 clients last month that largely aligned to our own full year expectations.
Most respondents are expecting their facilities to more fully reopen and their companies to be endorsing reoccupancy in varying forms by September and they plan to continue taking multiple measures to protect spaces against COVID-19 as they reopen primarily in the areas of surface and air disinfection.
And even with the increase in flexible work schedules and work from home protocols, the vast majority of our clients say that they expect the total amount of space utilization to remain largely the same.
Now, the size of our survey, it's just a subset of our client base, but it supports what we are hearing more broadly as we communicate with our customers on their future plans.
It also speaks to our confidence in providing full year guidance today.
For fiscal 2021, we are introducing full year guidance of earnings per diluted share of $2.85 to $3.10 or $3.00 to $3.25 on an adjusted basis.
Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margins is 6.6% to 7%, which compares to 6% last year.
We also expect to return to growth by the second half of this year and consistent demand for high margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services through year-end.
We also anticipate retaining most of our labor arbitrage through year-end.
Our success will not translate to complacency.
Based on how the pandemic has changed our trajectory, we have been capitalizing on our momentum to elevate our brand and business.
At the end of February, we launched ABM's first national TV commercial.
It was a celebratory moment for the entire firm and we could not be proud of.
If you've not seen it on CNBC or Bloomberg TV, you can find it on our IR website today.
As we discussed last year, we are going to be investing in our clients, team members, and infrastructure.
We're focused on providing technology and data analytics capabilities to enhance client and team member experiences.
We are also prioritizing areas like talent development to further empower our people and create even more consequential relationships with our clients.
We are committed to building upon our strong culture and fostering a community of belonging where team members feel connected, valued, and inspired.
This reinforces our mission and vision as an organization and will have significant long-term commercial outcomes for us.
Internal initiatives such as our culture and inclusion council are dedicated to driving meaningful social change and cultivating an inclusive environment for everyone at ABM and we are taking active steps to turn this vision into reality.
I'm excited to share that we have entered into partnerships with organizations that are focused on building a more equitable society.
ABM has made a commitment to support the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Funds, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the Afterschool Alliance, and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.
We are partnering with these organizations in an effort to make a difference in the areas of advocacy and civil rights, basic human needs, education, and workforce development.
We were just starting to discuss the coronavirus and its impact on the economy.
At that time I reiterated how our diversified portfolio coupled with our nimble operating model or hallmarks of our long-term success over the past 110 years.
Our results over the past 12 months has proven this beyond a doubt and with our solid liquidity and leverage, we are better positioned than ever to pursue growth and profitability that will unlock even greater shareholder value.
The dedication of the ABM team continues to fuel our performance quarter-after-quarter.
We have a culture like no other in our industry.
I'm proud that our results have been the greatest proof point of our resilience, agility and excellence.
Today marks my 100th day at ABM and my early impressions about the organization's drive to collaborate and execute have only grown.
As I continue to evaluate and assess our business needs, my main area of focus will be on helping to determine the appropriate enablers for both strategic growth and continuous improvement.
As I will discuss in more detail shortly, our strong results over the past several quarters coupled with our leadership position in the marketplace provides us with great opportunity to invest in our future growth potential.
I look forward to finalizing our thoughts on areas such as our internal investment strategy and sharing with all of you over the course of the year.
Now onto the results.
Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 7.5% compared to last year.
The decrease in revenue reflects the continued impact COVID-19 has had across our business segments.
As a reminder, the pandemic had not yet impacted operations significantly until our second quarter last year and as such this quarter reflects the full year-over-year impact.
Partially offsetting this revenue decline was the ongoing demand for higher margin disinfection related Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.
Work Orders were particularly strong within our Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing industry groups.
On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was $74.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share compared to $27.9 million or $0.41 last year.
In addition to our strong operational performance, the increase versus last year was driven by favorable development in prior year self-insurance adjustments.
We saw an $11.4 million benefit this year compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Additionally, we saw our second consecutive quarter of current year positive insurance trend recording a benefit of approximately $3 million.
On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter increased to $68.3 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to $26.2 million or $0.39 last year.
Our GAAP and adjusted earnings growth versus last year continued to be driven by significant increases in higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.
As our clients have incorporated health and hygiene services such as disinfection into their operation at higher levels, we continue to experience higher margin as a result of direct labor efficiencies, as our operators proactively manage the deployment of labor commensurate with COVID-19 related revenue decline.
Additionally, results also reflect one less working day, which amounted to labor expense savings of approximately $6 million.
Other items such as corporate discretionary expense, amortization, and interest were also lower compared to last year.
These results were partially offset by our planned infrastructure and organizational investment in areas such as IT.
However, I want to note that our investment spend for the quarter was approximately $4 million, which was lower than originally anticipated.
During the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $124 million for a margin rate of 8.3% compared to $68.8 million or 4.3% last year.
I will now discuss our segment results.
As I referenced earlier, these results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19, which has resulted in revenue compression across our services.
As Scott discussed, our diversified segment structure has been a strength for us during the pandemic and each segment has been impacted by the pandemic in different ways, both positively and negatively.
In most cases though with perhaps the exception of Technical Solutions, our segment results reflect some combination of a mix shift toward higher Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.
Labor modulation on lower service demand as well as operational investments in areas such as EnhancedClean.
B&I revenue was $809.4 million, which was down just $11.5 million or 1.4% versus last year.
The parking and sports and entertainment businesses were the predominant drivers of the revenue decline due to the ongoing pandemic.
Almost entirely offsetting this decline was increased demand for higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services at our national accounts and certain client in corporate sectors such as financial institutions.
Operating profit for the quarter reflected this more favorable mix of business resulting an $85.7 million or a margin of 10.6% compared to last year's $38.2 million and 4.7% respectively.
Technology & Manufacturing remains one of our most resilient segments.
T&M produced solid results for the quarter as it has since the beginning of the pandemic.
The segment reported revenue of $249.2 million, an increase of 6.5% versus last year with an operating profit of $26.9 million or a margin rate of 10.8%.
Work orders and EnhancedClean services drove demand for T&M particularly within the industrial manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and high-tech sectors.
We also experienced growth with our logistic clients as we supported them during the peak holiday season.
Our Education segment grew revenues of $209.4 million with operating profit of $21.5 million or 10.2% margin.
We believe these results reflect some stabilization as schools have continued the hybrid learning model that has been in effect since the back half of last year.
Performance was primarily attributable to direct labor management due to modified staffing levels and other expense savings as well as demand for disinfection and COVID related Work Orders.
Looking ahead, we anticipate some reinstitution of a traditional selling season in 2021, which did not really exist last year due to the pandemic.
We continue to monitor how schools are going to evolve their approach to teaching in the current environment particularly as vaccination rollouts progress.
Aviation reported revenue of approximately $143 million with operating profit of $3.2 million.
As anticipated, this segment remain most impacted by COVID-19 and its effect on global travel.
The quarter saw a modest sequential increase in travel due to the holiday, but also reverted quickly due to lockdowns in areas such as the UK.
We continue to operate according to flight and passenger demand, providing higher tech services such as electrostatic spraying as we managed variable costs and expenses on a real time basis to match demand.
Finally, Technical Solutions reported revenue of $113 million versus $142 million last year.
This decline was driven by site access issues as clients such as an education continue to limit traffic into their facilities in order to protect administrative staff, teachers and students.
However backlog remains healthy above $150 million and we remain focused on churning through these projects as soon as possible.
Operating profit was $6 million or 5.3% on a margin basis.
Turning to cash and liquidity.
We reported positive cash flow during the first quarter despite this traditionally being a cash flow negative period.
This even includes the deferral of approximately $31 million in payroll taxes from the CARES Act.
We generated more than $45 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of approximately $39 million for the quarter.
Our strong performance enabled us to end this quarter with total debt including standby letters of credit of $851 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 1.8 times.
Additionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $378 million.
Given the consistency of our leverage and cash position over the last several quarters, we believe we have reached a point of stability both operationally and financially.
As a result, we are evaluating our capital allocation priorities.
In addition to organic investments in our business, we are also exploring the M&A market for potential targets to drive growth and build on our current momentum.
While remaining cognizant of our reentry into M&A, we will also consider share repurchases opportunistically.
We currently have approximately $145 million remaining in our authorized share repurchase program and we'll balance any potential activity with our M&A efforts to ensure maximum flexibility.
During the quarter we paid our 219th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share for a total distribution of $12.7 million to shareholders.
Now turning to our guidance outlook.
We are introducing a fiscal 2021 GAAP guidance outlook range of $2.85 to $3.10 and on an adjusted basis $3.00 to $3.25 per share.
Scott shared with you some great context from an operating perspective that supports our guidance.
So let me now provide some additional assumptions behind our guidance.
Given our performance during the first quarter, we believe revenue will continue to improve sequentially with a return to growth in the back half of the year.
And as growth improves and turn positive we will have to staff back up accordingly.
Therefore there may be a partial reduction in the level of labor efficiencies we have experienced over the past year, but make no mistake, we do expect to retain a portion of these savings based on new opportunities and labor management practices we have adopted during COVID.
And as it relates to higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services, we do not anticipate a material slowdown in demand for the balance of the fiscal year.
We expect our investments to pick up throughout the remainder of the year as we support the strategic initiatives namely in our IT transformation.
On a year-over-year basis, we do expect an increase in corporate expenses for the year although timing may vary from quarter-to-quarter as you saw in the first quarter.
Additionally, as a reminder, we undertook furlough and expense reduction efforts during the third quarter of last year.
And as such, expect to see year-over-year increase in expenses as we have resumed a portion of those expenditures.
We are still in the planning and design phase of our technology roadmap and we will update you as we finalize our plans.
I'd also like to remind everyone that we will see an extra working day in Q2 and one less working day in Q3.
Each working day should represent approximately $6 million of labor expense similar to Q1.
We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2021.
This tax rate does not include discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards.
At the end of December, WOTC was formally extended by Congress through 2025 and current estimate suggest a $5 million or $0.07 impact on 2020.
And finally, while we are not guiding to free cash flow, until we can finalize the impact of our tech transformation on capital expenditures.
I want to express my enthusiasm for the strong start to the year.
Given our strong cash flow performance to-date, we believe we'll be able to achieve a range above our historical $175 million to $200 million and look forward to updating you as we finalize our longer-term plan.
In closing, we're excited about our performance for the quarter as well as our outlook for the year and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter.
","Despite a 7.5% revenue decline due to the pandemic, ABM experienced strong earnings growth in Q1. This growth is attributed to increased demand for higher-margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services, particularly in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing segments. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share surged to $1.10 from $0.41 last year, and on an adjusted basis, earnings rose over 160% to $1.01 per share. This improvement was also driven by effective labor management, resulting in a 400-basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins to 8.3%. ABM anticipates a return to growth in the second half of 2021, with continued demand for high-margin services and labor arbitrage retention. Despite a modest 50% current travel volume in Aviation, the company remains optimistic about the sector's recovery as vaccine rollouts progress. ABM's full-year guidance ranges from $2.85 to $3.10 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.00 to $3.25 per share on an adjusted basis, reflecting the company's strong liquidity and leverage and its commitment to strategic growth."
