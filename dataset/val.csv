Earnings Call Transcript:
 These reconciliations, together with additional supplemental information, are available at the Investor Relations section of our website, herbalife.com.
Additionally, when management makes reference to volumes during this conference call, they are referring to volume points.
2021 was another record year for Herbalife Nutrition.
Even during this period of continued global uncertainty due to the pandemic, our entrepreneurial direct sales channel helped consumers around the world pursue their nutrition and wellness goals by giving them access to our high-quality nutrition products.
For the full year, demand for our nutrition products resulted in net sales of $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year and an annual record for the company.
Our three largest regions, Asia Pacific, North America, and EMEA, along with 37 individual markets, set annual net sales records.
Full-year 2021 reported diluted earnings per share of $4.13 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.79 was an increase of 49% and 29%, respectively, compared to the full year 2020.
Full-year 2021 reported net income of $447 million and adjusted EBITDA of $874 million were both annual records for the company.
For the full year, we averaged over 500,000 active sales leaders per month, a record for the company and an increase of 9% compared to 2020.
We brought in 2.9 million new distributors and preferred customers, which was down just 1% compared to 2020 and actually up 31% compared to the more normalized 2019 year.
We continue to broaden our reach and attract new audiences in 2021, with two-thirds of our new distributor and preferred customers identifying as millennials or Gen Z. This younger demographic drives a high level of business activity by engaging with the business in new ways, including innovative nutrition club models and increased utilization of social media and digital tools.
Today, we also announced sales leader retention results for the last 12-month requalification period ending in January of 2022.
This year, a record 68.9% of our sales leaders were retained, up from last year's prior record of 67.9%.
We believe this result reflects the ongoing sustainability of our business and the attractive opportunity that we offer to our distributors.
Turning to the fourth quarter, our net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Q4 year-over-year trend was impacted by a challenging comparison period.
On a two-year stack basis, we saw growth of 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
The Asia Pacific region had another quarter of growth, up 5% compared to the prior year.
The region was led by continued strength in India, which grew 33%.
India is supported by strong underlying metrics, including 35% year-over-year growth in new distributors and in preferred members, as well as a 32% increase in active sales leaders.
We're making investments in India to further support the market with a newly opened 150,000-plus square foot state-of-the-art center in a suburb of Bangalore.
The new facility will allow us to accommodate planned growth in India as we go from the current level of 900 jobs to approximately 1,500 employees over the next five years.
The space will be home to a new local product research and development facility designed to accelerate new product launches.
It will also contain a state-of-the-art quality control lab, a distributor meeting facility, and a global business services center.
Looking at North America, we saw a decline in net sales of 3% in the quarter.
This decline is up against a challenging prior-year comparison period.
However, the two-year stacked growth rate in the region increased by approximately 29% compared to Q4 of 2019.
One area of continued strength in North America is our U.S. nutrition club business.
We ended the year with over 12,000 nutrition club locations, an increase of more than 30% compared to the end of 2020.
We are excited to see our sales force is energized by the...
...going cost of the shift to home delivery experienced at the onset of the pandemic.
Further, we have seen significant increases in input costs consistent with the news headlines related to raw materials, labor, and freight costs.
To partially offset these margin pressures in the near term, we will continue to leverage our pricing power.
We are also actively engaged in productivity improvement programs for both our front and back-office operations through the transformation program John referenced earlier.
This program involves the realignment of infrastructure to more effectively leverage our global shared service centers, investment in new technologies to increase efficiencies internally, as well as better support distributors and customers, and repositioning of certain strategic functions closer to the regions and markets they serve to better affect local initiatives.
We expect the first phase of this initiative will incur total pre-tax charges in SG&A in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
We carved out approximately $13 million of these charges in 2021, with most remaining expenses to be incurred throughout 2022.
We expect this first phase will result in annual incremental savings in the range of $10 million to $15 million with some savings beginning in 2022 increasing through 2023, with the full impact of the savings expected to begin in 2024.
We are also assessing a second phase of the program to begin in 2023 with expected ongoing annualized savings of the same magnitude as Phase 1.
As a result, for the full year, we are projecting our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.75.
This includes an approximate $0.17 currency headwind.
We are also providing full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $785 million to $845 million, which includes an approximate $21 million headwind due to currency.
Our 2022 guidance includes the assumption of $50 million in share repurchase per quarter, which reflects the minimum buyback amount we anticipate completing on a quarterly basis.
We continue to project reliable cash flow from our business model.
We believe there is value in guiding for a base level of consistent share repurchase while leaving room for potential incremental opportunistic share repurchases to take place over the course of the year.
We have demonstrated this pattern of consistency during 2021 by repurchasing approximately $100 million, $160 million, and $100 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively.
We anticipate this pattern of consistency to continue in 2022.
For the first quarter, we estimate net sales to decline in the range of down 10% to down 4%, which includes an approximate 240-basis-points currency headwind versus the prior year.
We expect the progression of the year-over-year comparisons will lead to a decline in net sales for the first half of the year, followed by growth in the back half.
First-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $1, which includes a projected currency headwind of $0.03 compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million.
Turning to cash flow, capital structure, and our share repurchase activity.
Our business continues to generate substantial cash flow.
Operating cash flow of $460 million for full-year 2021 was down from 2020, primarily due to the impact of several unfavorable accounts related to year-over-year net sales declines.
For 2022, we expect this to turn around in the second half of the year when the business returns to growth.
After completing just under $1 billion in share repurchases during the year, at the end of 2021, we had just over $600 million of cash on hand.
As I mentioned earlier, we have included a minimum of $50 million in share repurchases per quarter in our guidance for the year, which will cut into the approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our three-year share repurchase authorization.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Factors, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory findings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.
Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter.
Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis.
Excluding COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year.
As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of healthcare businesses continues to prove highly resilient.
Even as COVID case rates surged in the US and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals and diabetes care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital base businesses.
This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID tests, of 11% on an organic basis through the first nine months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year.
As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year.
I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob.
And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year.
Strong growth in the quarter was led by US pediatric and international adult nutrition.
In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the US from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio.
Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double-digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion.
In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally, as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage.
Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales.
During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surged, particularly in the US, demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests.
In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic.
Over the of last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus.
Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable, and easy to use, is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics.
Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month.
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions.
Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets.
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019.
Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care.
In Structural Heart, we continued to enhance our portfolio in large, fast growing markets with the recent US FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS System.
As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the healthcare industry, a portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic.
After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.
And we filed with the US FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year.
During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called JETi that removes peripheral blood clots.
Peripheral thrombectomy is a large high growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence.
And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion.
During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users.
So in summary, we continued to achieve strong well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products.
COVID testing, particularly COVID testing, remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area.
And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our earnings per share guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year.
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail.
Turning to our results.
Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, you along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter.
Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%.
The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter.
We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double-digits versus last year.
And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around one-half of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me are our chief executive officer, Bob Steers; our president, Joe Harvey; and our chief financial officer, Matt Stadler.
Further, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
My remarks will focus on our as-adjusted results.
Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $1.24 per share compared with $0.76 in the prior year's quarter and $1.06 sequentially.
The fourth quarter of 2021 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation-to-revenue ratio and effective tax rate, respectively.
Revenue was a record $159.7 million for the quarter compared with $116.6 million in the prior year's quarter and $154.3 million sequentially.
The increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management and open-end funds and higher performance fees from certain institutional accounts when compared with the third quarter.
Our implied effective fee rate was 58.1 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 57.5 basis points in the third quarter.
Excluding performance fees, our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points, and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57.3 basis points.
Operating income was a record $82.6 million in the quarter compared with $49.4 million in the prior year's quarter and $70.4 million sequentially.
Our operating margin increased to a record 51.7% from 45.6% last quarter, primarily due to the cumulative adjustment mentioned a moment ago, which reduced compensation and benefits to reflect actual amounts to be paid.
Expenses decreased 8.1% when compared with the third quarter as lower compensation and benefits was partially offset by higher G&A.
The compensation-to-revenue ratio, which included the cumulative adjustment was 26.16% for the quarter.
For the year, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 32.22%.
The increase in G&A was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment, increased hosted and sponsored conferences, and higher recruitment fees.
And the increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds.
Our effective tax rate, which was 25.36% for the quarter, included a cumulative adjustment to bring the rate to 26.15% for the year.
The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in a nondeductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre-tax base.
Our firm liquidity totaled $248.2 million at quarter-end, compared with $241 million last quarter.
Firm liquidity as of December 31 reflected the payment of a special cash dividend in December of $60.3 million or $1.25 per share.
Over the past 12 years, we have paid a total of $15.25 per share in special dividends, and we continue to be debt-free.
Assets under management totaled a record $106.6 billion at December 31, an increase of $9.4 billion or 10% from September 30.
The increase was due to net inflows of $1.8 billion and market appreciation of $9.1 billion, partially offset by distributions of $1.6 billion.
This marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we have recorded net inflows.
Bob Steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.
And now, I'd like to briefly discuss a few items as we begin the new year.
First, regarding our expected compensation-to-revenue ratio.
We intend to balance anticipated revenue growth from year-end assets under management that exceeded our full-year assets under management by about 13%.
With a disciplined approach toward adding human capital, in addition to the full-year impact from the new hires we made last year, we plan on making controlled investments in order to broaden our product offerings, expand our public a...
...ly, net flows in the quarter were not just strong but also diverse, with meaningful contributions from each of the wirehouse, regional brokerage, and RIA segments.
In addition, DCIO open-end fund net inflows were a record $476 million and marked the 14th consecutive quarter of net inflows.
DCIO assets in our open-end funds ended the year at a record $6 billion.
Our non-U.S. open-end funds registered net inflows of $45 million in the quarter and a record $202 million for the full year.
We will continue to invest to support growth in this important channel, and we expect that flows will continue on an upward trajectory.
For the year, the powerful combination of strong absolute and relative performance derived from our unique and diversifying asset classes resulted in 25% organic growth in wealth and industry-leading market share as well.
Our U.S. global real estate and preferred securities funds achieved market share records of 33%, 12%, and 46%, respectively, against other comparable actively managed funds.
2021 was a record year for the institutional advisory channel as well with $1.9 billion of net inflows.
However, 2021 was also a year in which we reorganized our sales leadership and converted to a regional approach to our institutional sales coverage.
We enter 2022 fully staffed and prepared to go higher and deeper into the global institutional marketplace.
In the quarter, the advisory channel had net outflows of $456 million.
These outflows were driven by a single and unexpected client termination of $400 million.
However, not included in the headline advisory flow results was $564 million of net new mandates from institutional clients, which were invested into our open-end funds.
Other full-year achievements for the advisory channel include positive net flows from each of the U.S., EMEA, and Asian markets.
Additionally, all of our core strategies, U.S. real estate, global real estate, global listed infrastructure, and preferred securities registered net inflows.
The pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandates has increased dramatically $900 million in September to $2.1 billion, another new record.
New awards in the quarter totaled $1.3 billion and included our first relationship in Africa, a $300 million global listed infrastructure mandate.
Sub-advisory flows in the quarter were subdued.
Net outflows in Japan were $242 million and distributions totaled $276 million.
Sub-advisory net outflows ex Japan in the quarter were a modest $56 million.
At the risk of sounding overly optimistic, we believe our current momentum and growth prospects have never been brighter, driven as always, by our industry-leading investment results.
It bears repeating that virtually 100% of our AUMs are outperforming their benchmarks for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year time periods, a truly remarkable accomplishment.
Looking ahead, the combination of industry-leading investment performance, rising demand for real asset strategies and our plans for new product introductions designed to meet this demand has us poised for continued organic growth.
In addition to our open-end fund organic growth, next month, we plan to market the first new listed real estate securities closed-end fund in over nine years, supported by an exceptionally strong and deep syndicate.
And as I've discussed, the institutional advisory channel entered this year with a record pipeline, fully staffed, and the reorganization behind them.
Also under new leadership, our EMEA wholesale business is also poised to deliver meaningful organic growth.
To capitalize on all of this momentum, this year, we plan to launch multiple new initiatives which will seek to position Cohen & Steers at the intersection of public and private real estate markets through the introduction of vehicles tailored to the unique requirements of both the institutional and wealth marketplaces.
These initiatives are designed to take us higher and deeper into real assets and position us for continued future growth.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I appreciate you all joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2021 results.
In particular, more than two-thirds of our people are essential workers, and they have continued to come to work every day, enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers.
I'm very proud of our entire team.
Regarding the business, as we indicated last quarter, overall, we have seen our commercial volumes stabilize and continued strong performance out of our government business.
While we remain in a difficult and uncertain environment, we are encouraged by the stabilization, as well as the positive developments regarding the vaccines, which not only will protect our people, but should also ultimately lead to more travel and a recovery in our commercial markets.
With that, turning to the quarter, our sales decreased 28% year-over-year from $561 million to $404 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% from $0.64 per share to $0.31 per share.
Our sales to commercial customers decreased 48%, and our sales to government and defense customers increased 13%.
For the quarter, sales to government and defense customers were 52% of our total sales.
Our Aviation Services segment grew 6% sequentially from our first quarter.
This was a result of increased volume in our MRO business, which is seasonally higher in Q1 over -- Q2 over Q1, as well as the continued strength of our government business.
Our commercial parts volumes overall were relatively stable throughout the quarter and remained above the lows we saw in April and May.
That said, I am particularly encouraged by our margin improvement progress.
Over the last several quarters, we have reduced our footprint across the enterprise, decreased our indirect and overhead spending, exited or restructured several underperforming contracts and divested a loss-making non-core business.
You are now starting to see the results of these actions in our adjusted operating margins, which improved meaningfully from 2.5% to 4% sequentially on stable revenue.
With respect to cash, we generated $28 million from operating activities from continuing operations and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further improving our already strong balance sheet position and putting our net leverage below 1 times EBITDA.
We also continue to add significant new business that positions us for growth going forward.
Our CFM56 partnership with Fortress solidifies a source of supply to meet growing demand for used serviceable material on the -5B and the -7B engine variants.
We expect demand for USM to increase across the board as we emerge from the pandemic and to be particularly strong for these engine platforms.
Also, our follow-on contract from the Navy to support the C-40 aircraft recognizes our performance over the last five years and provides for an expanded statement of work over the next five years.
It's worth noting that this was the first time that this contract was awarded to an incumbent, which speaks to the high-quality of our service.
Additionally, our 10-year agreement with Honeywell to be its sole authorized service center for 737 MAX Electronic Bleed Air System components positions us to support MAX operators worldwide when that aircraft to return to service.
These new contracts, along with others we have announced over the last several months, such as the Unison expansion and extension, represent nearly $1.7 billion in total contract value captured so far this fiscal year.
This demonstrates the unique value of our Aviation Services offerings, and these business wins will help accelerate our recovery coming out of the downturn.
Our sales in the quarter of $403.6 million were down 28% or $157.3 million year-over-year, driven by the impacts of the pandemic on commercial passenger flying activity.
Sequentially, Aviation Services sales were up 5.9% or $21.4 million, while sales in Expeditionary Services were down 50% or $18.6 million.
The sequential decline in Expeditionary Services was driven by two factors.
First, the exit of the composites business was completed at the end of Q1, and this business generated $7 million of revenue in Q1 and zero in the current quarter.
Second, as previously discussed, mobility had a particularly strong Q1 due to elevated shipments of pallets.
Within Aviation Services, our government and defense business was up 19% or $30 million year-over-year, reflecting strong performance on existing contracts.
In the quarter, as well as in Q1, our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corps generated strong revenue due to elevated activity on the program.
Gross profit margin in the quarter increased to 17.2% from 15.3% in the prior year quarter, driven by the CARES Act payroll support.
On a sequential basis, gross profit margin was up 12 -- was up from 12.1% in our first quarter, reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and to exit underperforming contracts and product lines.
SG&A expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $38 million or 9.4% of sales, down $13 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure.
Of this improvement, approximately $3.2 million was the result of temporary reductions in compensation and benefits, which we restored beginning on December 1.
As an update on our previous disclosure, we have been in settlement discussions with the Department of Justice regarding an investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act.
During the quarter, we recorded $6 million of additional accrual and discontinued operation, which brings our total reserve for this matter to $8 million based on our latest settlement offer.
We generated $27.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations for the quarter.
This is net of a use of cash of $6.8 million as we continue to reduce the size of our accounts receivable financing program.
Excluding the accounts receivable financing program, cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $34.4 million.
Inventory decreased $12.7 million during the quarter.
Our net debt at quarter end was $112.1 million, down $37 million from $149.3 million at the end of Q1.
Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong with net leverage of 0.95 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $110 million and unused capacity under our revolver of approximately $390 million.
As such, we're well positioned to fund what we expect to be unique opportunities to grow our business over the coming quarters.
Overall, we are pleased with our results given the current environment and also pleased with the progress we have made in improving our operating efficiency.
As I mentioned, for many reasons, we are encouraged by the multiple vaccines coming to market and the plans for distribution.
As the vaccines are distributed and case numbers decline, we expect travel restrictions to be lifted and people to start flying again.
Until then, we expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment, and we will continue to focus on driving cash flow, as well as continued margin improvement.
We will also remain focused on capturing new business, I am confident that our strong balance sheet, combined with the airlines' increasing desire for our lower-cost value-added services, will lead to even more growth opportunities.

[/INST] # Despite the ongoing pandemic's impact on commercial travel, the company experienced stabilized volumes and robust government business. Revenue declined 28% year-over-year, dropping from $561 million to $404 million, while adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% to $0.31. However, the company made progress in margin improvement, with Aviation Services leading the way with a 6% sequential growth and a surge in MRO business. Government and defense sales accounted for 52% of total sales in the quarter, driven by strong contract performances. The company has also secured significant new business with a total contract value of $1.7 billion, positioning itself for growth in the future. Additionally, the company has settled with the Department of Justice for $8 million and maintained a strong balance sheet with net leverage below 1 times EBITDA.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, I'll cover two items.
Actual events or results could differ materially.
Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items, are available in the first quarter 2021 financial results news release, which is available on our website.
We're off with an excellent start to 2021, and I'm proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved in just a few short months.
We've been building momentum, and the strong operational execution of our teams is paying off as the global economy improves.
There are several highlights I want to cover.
First, strong demand from the end of 2020 continued through the first quarter.
In many markets, demand is returning to or exceeding 2019 levels.
We reported 20% higher adjusted earnings per share over '19 and 5% over a very strong first quarter last year before we felt the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Consistent with our track record of strong free cash flow, we also delivered record free cash flow of $125 million in the first quarter, which was up substantially from a very strong performance a year ago.
We achieved these solid results despite operational logistical headwinds from winter storm Uri.
I'm incredibly proud of our team in Texas who took proactive steps ahead of the storm to avoid a hard shutdown to any of our assets.
Then they worked tirelessly to repair and restart our facilities, which helped ensure supply for our customers.
We had half of our Texas manufacturing facility operational within one week of the storm, and we were more than 95% operational within three weeks.
Moving to other highlights, we've made significant progress with our circular economy efforts, which I'll talk more about in a moment.
And our progress hasn't gone unnoticed with Barron's adding Eastman to its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies for 2021, a true honor for us.
And we issued our inclusion and diversity report, which you can find on our website.
At Eastman, we take our environmental, social and governance commitment seriously, and transparency is of the utmost importance.
We also continue to allocate our capital with returns to stockholders in mind.
To that end, we recently completed a small bolt-on acquisition of 3F Feed & Food, a leading animal health and nutrition company with accelerated growth in the animal nutrition business.
And finally, we think the favorable trends in the economy, coupled with our innovation investments and continued disciplined cost management sets us up for strong earnings per share and free cash flow growth this year and next.
On our January call, we gave you an update on the progress we're making to become a leader in the circular economy.
We announced that we're building one of the world's largest plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling facilities at our site in Kingsport, Tennessee.
Since then, we've broken ground on the facility and continue to target mechanical completion by the end of '22.
Even more impressive is the amount of momentum we're building with customers in many different markets around the world.
The demand for our new branded products include Eastman Tritan Renew, Eastman Cristal Renew, is strong.
At this point, demand for our specialty products and the circular economy offerings has been better than we anticipated.
And specific to the new facility we announced, we're ahead of schedule in terms of customer demand for the capacity.
We have a robust pipeline for additional announcements throughout the year and look forward to sharing those with you.
Turning to our outlook.
As we entered the second quarter with strong demand and mix momentum, we also expect to benefit from cost discipline, including lower operating costs from our operational transformation program.
However, there are specific headwinds we face, including maintenance turnaround, supplier reliability and some slowdown in auto production.
In addition, we have price increases that are continuing to catch up to higher raw material, energy and distribution costs in some products.
Despite these headwinds, we expect a sequential increase in EPS, with second quarter adjusted earnings per share expected to be at or above second quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $2.22.
Moving the full year, we expect strong market growth and product mix improvement to continue.
Our innovation-driven growth model will enable us to grow faster than the underlying market recovery, and we expect a number of markets will be rebuilding inventory.
We also expect much of the capacity constraints, supplier reliability and logistics headwinds to lessen alongside a potential moderation in tight commodity markets.
We expect to continue to benefit from about $100 million of full year tailwind for improved capacity utilization compared to last year when we aggressively managed inventory well below the decline in demand with our focus on cash.
And we're on track to keep our cost structure flat compared with 2020 and well below 2019 and '18 levels.
We, therefore, expect adjusted earnings per share will be about -- be between $8.25 and $8.75 for the full year of '21.
On cash, we expect free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectations for stronger adjusted EBITDA.
We expect 2021 will be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow greater than $1 billion, and we will work to grow free cash flow from here.
Putting it all together.
These outstanding results remind me about what gives Eastman this incredible resiliency and strategic advantage.
First and foremost, it's the people at Eastman who continue to persevere and help us win as we saw in Uri and a time of crisis, and this is what we see every day from this good team.
And as I reflect on how we position our company through the global trade disruptions of 2019 and then COVID in '20, I feel confident in our ability to grow earnings per share and cash off this new level of earnings.
Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop over the last several years, we have not sacrificed our efforts to innovate and invest in our specialty portfolio and expect those investments to continue to pay off as we finish off '21 and move into '22.
In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on what we can control and remain committed to long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all our stakeholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We're excited to share these strong results with you.
But before I turn things over to Jay Farner, I will read our disclaimers.
Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 performance in addition to our financial outlook.
Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started.
The excellent results that we're about to discuss and the innovations that drove them are a testament to your focus and dedication in what was an incredibly difficult year for the world.
Your contributions to our clients and communities were a shining example of how successful our for-more-than-profit mindset can truly be.
The platform continues to be the key to our long-term success in the verticals where we operate as well as the record results that we've achieved in 2020.
Over the next few minutes, you'll see how the technology that we've built and refined over decades will continue to drive success, not only in the products that you're familiar with today, but also in product extensions and entirely new verticals in the future.
If you were to ask us what our most important product is, we'd say it's the platform itself.
In walking through our results, I'll provide updates on each of the key pillars of the Rocket Platform, our technology, the strength of our brand, the Rocket Cloud Force, which I'll discuss later, and our data science foundation.
I'll finish today's remarks by talking about how our platform allows us to continue to grow and become more efficient in our existing lines of business while also launching and rapidly scaling new businesses.
Our mission over the last several decades has been to take the most complicated and stressful transactions in life and simplify them with technology.
Whether those transactions are mortgage, real estate, auto sales, or any number of new initiatives we're currently incubating, we provide a simple digital process, exceptional client experience, and certainty.
This mission began in 1998 when our founder and Chairman, Dan Gilbert, wrote an email committing all of the company's resources to moving online.
His vision was simple, but decades ahead of its time.
Most of the Internet companies of that era focused on problems like search, advertising, or basic e-commerce.
Dan saw things differently.
He spotted the potential to take the most complex transaction in a consumer's life, the buying and financing of a new home, and leverage technology to make it accessible online to consumers across the country.
For more than two decades, we've been quietly building our technology platform right here in Detroit to transform the way our clients experience life's most important events.
We've continued to strengthen our digital products and infrastructure in 2020, deploying nearly 4,500 product features throughout the year and delivering improvements to our platform every 28 minutes on average.
Supporting our platform is our strong national brand that consumers and partners know and trust.
As we grow, we continue to invest and find new ways to extend our reach and expand our marketing channels we leverage, allowing us to connect with more and more clients.
I'm pretty sure the majority of you were among the nearly 100 million fans who watched the Super Bowl a couple of weeks ago.
In that game, we ran two 60-second advertisements highlighting that ""certain"" is better when it comes to buying a home.
We aired one commercial, highlighting rocket mortgage and our technology that helps bring certainty to the home buying process, something that is needed now more than ever in today's red hot real estate market.
The second demonstrated the significant role mortgage brokers play in American homeownership.
As you know, brokers are important partners as we continue to extend the reach of our platform.
This massive exposure, the first-ever national advertisement showcasing brokers during a super Bowl allows...
...in 2020 will roughly triple the industry average.
While our low-cost platform model is driving record profitability, we're continuing our long-term strategy to reinvest in the business.
Key targets for investment include our brand, product development, and initiatives to drive growth in the purchase market.
We continue to invest in talent growth, particularly in technical roles.
As an example, our data science team now includes over 300 professionals.
We're seeing high performers choose to join Rocket across multiple teams, including the ongoing expansion of our technology and product strategy teams.
Our brand is another key investment priority, including our recent Super Bowl ads, which generated significant brand recognition and drove record traffic to our online and mobile properties.
Among our key product development priorities is Rocket Logic, the next generation of our core workflow management platform.
The new platform guides users through the next best action, resulting in faster, more accurate workflows.
We are very impressed with our initial pilot where we are seeing 20% improvement in turn times within the pilot group.
What's even more exciting is that Rocket Logic can be applied to enhance processes beyond mortgage origination.
We expect Rocket Logic and our many automation initiatives to drive continued efficiency in the business model.
The core of our economic flywheel is that we are constantly leveraging our profitability advantages to reinvest in the business, further strengthening our competitive position.
Another key advantage of the Rocket Companies' platform is our ability to test, launch and rapidly scale new business models.
This entrepreneurial approach can be seen in our scaled mortgage operations.
In two years, our partner network has grown from less than $20 billion in closed loan volume to $120 billion on an annual basis.
We see similar opportunity within our early stage, rapidly expanding businesses such as Rocket Auto, Rocket Loans, and Rocket Homes.
To that end, and as Jay announced a few minutes ago, the launch of Rocket Labs will further accelerate our focus on expanding the business in ways that leverage our platform and serve our client base.
We believe our clients will be greatly served over time with these additional business lines.
Turning to our first-quarter outlook.
We expect closed loan volume of $98 billion to $103 billion compared to $51.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020; net rate lock volume of $88 billion to $95 billion, up from $56 billion in the first quarter of 2020; and gain-on-sale margins of 3.6% to 3.9% compared to 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020.
We're excited about the continued strength and momentum of the Rocket platform.
We ended 2020 with an extremely strong balance sheet, including $2 billion of cash and $7.7 billion of total liquidity.
Total liquidity includes cash on hand, undrawn lines of credit, undrawn MSR lines, and corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our option.
As we communicated at the time of our IPO last summer, our capital allocation priorities always start with properly capitalizing and reinvesting in the business.
As I discussed earlier, we are actively deploying capital with investments in our platform, our brand, and our talent.
We also want to deploy through add-on acquisitions that would be additive to our economic flywheel and bring value to our client base.
Our next priority is to return capital to shareholders through dividends, opportunistic use of share buybacks, or a combination of the two.
Given our record level of profitability in 2020, the Board approved a special dividend of $1.11 per Class A common share funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion.
Our substantial cash generation provides us significant optionality to drive long-term value for our shareholders.
Additionally, we remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of Rocket Companies' common stock.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen.
During today's call, we'll discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2021.
The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance.
From my perspective, the highlights are the Q4 revenues got back to year-ago levels despite food equipment being down 17% and net operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 records for the Company.
It was a pretty solid finish to the year that needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges, and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021.
While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built and honed over the past eight years to the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did.
Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we refocused the entire company on only two core imperatives.
A, to protect the health, safety and well-being of our people, and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence.
And in my view, we executed extremely well on both.
Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in support of these two key pandemic priorities.
Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring and there is no question that we differentiate ourselves with many of our key customers, as a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts.
We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we've thought through, how we should manage the Company through the pandemic.
Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress-tested the Company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past eight years have resulted in a very strong and very resilient company.
And as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down.
And for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long-term.
This conclusion led to two key decisions that we made regarding how we're going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis.
First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last eight years to reinforce our commitment to our people.
First, by providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe.
And by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprisewide employment reduction mandated programs at any point in 2020.
These were not obvious reason decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances but we believe that they were the right decisions for our Company.
And I know that our people will remember them.
These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3.
Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our Win the Recovery agenda in mindset across the Company.
Win the Recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy.
What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic.
Win the Recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic.
As across the Company, we had to read and react to th...
...lways do on the current levels of demand in our businesses.
Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality.
The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level.
Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and has 2 percentage points revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%.
At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint.
We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint.
Enterprise Initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021, as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points.
Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year.
We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment and embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals.
Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the Company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis.
We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income.
I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021.
Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses.
Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model.
Third priority, our selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential.
I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only.
After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021.
In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021.
We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%.
Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year.
And instead, focus on our time and efforts on the recovery in 2021.
While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given their expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022.
With the caveat again and the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment and based on current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021.
At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%.
To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong, as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we've built over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy.
Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper-tier performance in any environment.
Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year and our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.

 These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including impacts from the pandemic and related governmental responses and their impact on the general economy, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are described in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Also during the call, we will reference a number of non-GAAP financial measures.
The impact of foreign exchange rate changes subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, interest rate increases differing from assumptions outlined in guidance, impact from the further spread of COVID-19 or other variants, and environmental and litigation charges.
It was a successful year across EnPro as we continue to rise to the occasion to meet the challenges and opportunities that have arisen over the past 12 months.
To begin, I will provide financial and strategic highlights for the full year, and then Milt will share details on our fourth quarter results.
2021 represented another transformational year at EnPro.
We continue to successfully reshape our portfolio and shift toward our growth markets with products and services that command higher margins and cash flow returns.
With the acquisition of NxEdge and the divestiture of CPI in December, as well as the divestiture of the polymer components business in the third quarter, we achieved meaningful strides in our portfolio reshaping strategy, which is positioning our company for a very promising future.
As volumes recovered from the 2020 pandemic lows, we saw positive momentum across the organization.
For the year, sales grew 6.3% to $1.14 billion.
Organic sales grew 14.4%.
We saw strong demand in most markets, including general industrial, semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, petrochemical, food and pharma, and aerospace.
Adjusted EBITDA of $208.4 million, increased by 23.8% compared to 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3%, increased 260 basis points, driven primarily by organic sales increases.
Select product, select price actions, and the net benefit of strategic portfolio reshaping completed in both 2020 and 2021, partially offset by raw material inflation, as well as supply chain labor and logistics constraints.
As we said last quarter, we still expect raw material inflation and supply chain challenges to continue.
And we will see uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment as we enter 2022.
Our commercial and supply chain teams continue to evaluate all opportunities to mitigate these current circumstances, while meeting the needs of our customers in the Strong demand environment.
We are realizing the substantial benefits of our portfolio reshaping actions, which have enabled us to capture incremental margin expansion in 2021 while keeping a close eye on cost and further simplifying our already agile organization.
Our strong order trends continued during the fourth quarter and we are beginning 2022 with solid demand.
In particular, we continue to see broad-based strength across our businesses and are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers, particularly in semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, aerospace, nuclear, and food and pharma markets.
As we look forward, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically in our Advanced Surface Technologies and Sealing Technologies segments, while driving cost and return improvements in the Engineered Materials segment.
We will build upon this core industrial technology foundation, now in place, maintaining our focus on margins and cash flow returns.
Further, we expect to maintain our strong recurring revenue streams with aftermarket revenue across our businesses approaching 50% of total company revenue.
Finally, we remain focused on driving long-term shareholder returns through a disciplined approach to capital allocation supported by our steady cash flows and also through our commitment to sustainability and diversity.
2022 marks our 20th year as an independent public company.
As I enter my first year as EnPro CEO, I m...
...exchange translation, sales were flat.
Fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA decreased 21.9% versus the prior-year period, driven by raw material inflation and supply chain headwinds, as well as the decline in automotive production in Europe and the United States.
Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange translation, adjusted segment EBITDA decreased by a comparable amount around 20.2% compared to the prior-year period.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow.
We ended the fourth quarter with cash of $338.1 million, $310 million of which is located outside the United States.
We have initiated efforts to repatriate portions of this cash for use in debt reduction, where it makes sense to do so from a tax efficiency perspective.
At December 31, we had $213.6 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
Free cash flow in 2021 was $123.2 million, up from $39.3 million in the prior year, driven by higher operating profits and lower cash taxes resulting from a tax refund associated with a federal income tax audit resolution, partially offset by working capital investments supporting stronger demand.
During the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.27 per share quarterly dividend.
For the year, dividend payments totaled $22.4 million.
Our board of directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share effective with the March payment representing our 7th consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend since we began paying dividends in 2015.
Moving now to 2022 guidance.
Taking into consideration all the factors that we know at this time, we expect low double-digit revenue growth over reported 2021 sales of $1.14 billion and we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $263 million to $275 million, implying adjusted EBITDA margins north of 20%.
Further, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.25 using a normalized 27% tax rate, reduced from 30% last year.
The reduction in our normalized tax rate assumption for 2022 results from the portfolio actions completed late in 2021 which tilt our portfolio to a higher portion of earnings in the United States.
Our guidance assumes depreciation and amortization expense, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $37 million to $39 million and net interest expense of $30 million to $33 million.
Our net interest expense estimate factors in 425-basis-point increases in our variable borrowing rate as 2022 progresses.
Underlying demand and order trends remain strong as we enter 2022, even as inflationary raw material cost, the impact of the omicron variant on labor availability, and supply chain and logistics constraints that put early year pressure on growth and margins.
We will be implementing additional pricing actions across the company as the year progresses in response to inflationary headwinds.
Finally, I want to note that we continue to monitor the current COVID situation and will remain attentive to the safety and well-being of our colleagues, who have demonstrated great resilience in the face of the very challenging conditions over the past two years.
EnPro had a remarkable year.
I am proud of our team and our many accomplishments as we perceive and doing what we said we would do, execute on our multi-year strategy to transform EnPro into a leading industrial technology company, leaning into our best businesses, while investing in markets with faster growth, higher margins, and higher cash flow returns.
Our 2022 guidance implies adjusted EBITDA margins around 21%, up from the 14% in 2019 when we first began our portfolio reshaping strategy.
All the while remaining steadfast in our dual purpose of delivering outstanding financial results and enabling and supporting development of our colleagues and the communities in which we operate.
Our journey is just beginning.
We appreciate your interest in our company.
Now I'll open the line to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, chief executive officer; and TS Ng, chief financial officer.
We delivered a strong performance in the first quarter with revenue and earnings that were above our guidance.
Demand trends appear to be stabilizing in most of the end markets we serve, and we're optimistic that we are positioned to deliver strong results in the second quarter.
Revenue in the first quarter was $399 million, a slight decrease from the record fourth quarter as expected with a 6% increase from a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share, exceeding the high end of guidance as gross margins improved to 12% in the quarter.
Looking at our business by end markets.
Optical communications revenue of $302 million was up about $2 million from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of total revenue.
Within optical communications, telecom revenue of $230 million increased 7% from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of optical revenue.
This growth is particularly notable considering we had expected telecom revenue to be flat at best.
Further, we expect this momentum to continue in Q2.
Datacom revenue was $73 million in the quarter, an expected decrease from Q4, of 15%.
Datacom represented 24% of optical communications revenue.
We believe this decline is primarily the result of broader industry trends and not due to execution or competitive issues.
In fact, based on anticipated near-term demand, we believe datacom trends could be nearing the bottom and we expect datacom revenue to be roughly flat in Q2.
By technology, silicon photonics based optical communications revenue decreased from the fourth quarter to $77 million and represented 25% of optical communications revenue.
Revenue from QSFP28 and QSFP56 transceivers was $45 million, down slightly from fourth quarter.
By data rate, 100-gig programs continued to represent nearly half of optical communications' revenue at $147 million.
And products rated at speeds of 400 gig and above were up strongly from the fourth quarter of $38 million or 13% of optical communications revenue.
Looking at our nonoptical communications business.
Revenue moderated sequentially as expected to $97 million from $105 million in Q4.
As anticipated, revenue from industrial lasers declined from the fourth quarter and was $41 million compared to $53 million in Q4.
These same demand trends seem to be persisting, so we anticipated industrial laser revenue to be roughly flat in Q2.
Longer term, we remain optimistic about our potential to further penetrate the industrial laser market as more manufacturers inevitably turn to outsourcing to better compete in this global market that is, in fact, larger than the optical communications market.
Automotive and sensor revenue were both stable at $24 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
Finally, revenue generated from other nonoptical applications grew 15% sequentially to $28 million, mainly from Fabrinet West.
Fabrinet West has been a great success for winning business for our offshore volume manufacturing sites.
We have seen numerous programs migrate from early prototyping in Fabrinet West to volume production in Thailand.
At the same time, Fabrinet West has been an enabler for us to win business in new markets and with new customers that might have otherwise gone to competitors.
As such, we have been focused on establishing a similar model to Fabrinet West in Israel.
We already have a number of customers there, and we believe we have the opportunity to grow our business with these customers as well as attract new ones.
We have signed a lease for a building in [Inaudible] which is a former semiconductor manufacturing facility.
It is already equipped with most of the infrastructure we need for a new product introduction center.
We are currently in the process of setting up SMT lines advance packaging and a failure analysis lab similar to what we have to support NPI in our Bangkok facilities.
We have hired a general manager for Fabrinet Israel and we are targeting to be up and running early next year.
In summary, we believe we are off to a good start to the fiscal year with revenue and earnings that meet our guidance ranges and return to gross margins that were within our target range.
We're optimistic that our telecom strength will continue and the datacom trends appear to be bottoming.
In addition, we're excited to have achieved important milestones toward establishing a second new product introduction facility at Fabrinet Israel.
Combined with our continued leadership as a contract manufacturer for the most complex products, we are very excited about our future.
I will provide you with more details on our performance by end market and our financial results for Q1 as well as our guidance for Q2 for fiscal year 2020.
Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $399.3 million and above the upper end of our guidance range.
Non-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share and was also above our guidance range even after a foreign exchange headwind of $1.9 million and the mark-to-market loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.7 million.
These losses accounted for approximately $0.09 per share.
Now turning to the details of our P&L.
We were pleased to see non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter improve to 12%, a 20-basis-point increase from the fourth quarter as efficiency more than offset the impact of merit increases.
Non-GAAP operating expense was $11.6 million in the first quarter.
As a result, non-GAAP operating income was $36.2 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.1%, flat with the fourth quarter.
Taxes in the quarter were $2.2 million, and our normalized effective tax rate was less than 5%.
We expect our effective tax rate to be 5% to 6% for the full year.
Non-GAAP net income was above our guidance range at $32.2 million in the first quarter or $0.86 per diluted share as I indicated earlier.
On a GAAP basis, which includes share-based compensation expenses and amortizations of debt issuing costs, net income for the first quarter was $25.9 million or $0.69 per diluted share, also above the high end of our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
At the end of the first quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $436.4 million compared to $444.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.6 million and with capex of $6.3 million, free cash flow was an outflow of $3.7 million in the first quarter.
During the quarter, our working capital increased to higher than normal level in support of major new program transfer.
This will begin to self-correct in the second quarter as we start to consume the transfer inventory and collect receivables.
We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter.
As such, $62.2 million remain in our share repurchase program and we will continue to evaluate market condition to opportunistically repurchase shares when possible.
I would now like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
As Seamus described, we expect a strong second quarter and anticipate that revenue will be between $408 million and $416 million.
From a margin perspective, we are optimistic that we will see efficiency continue to drive incremental improvements in non-GAAP gross margin within our target range of 12% to 12.5%.
From an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.94 and GAAP net income per share of $0.74 to $0.77 based on approximately $37.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
In conclusion, we are excited with our strong performance in the quarter.
We remain very positive about our long-term prospects for continued leadership in the marketplace.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Please note that this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay.

These and other factors that could impact the Company's actual performance are set forth in the Company's third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today.
It should also be noted that SEC Regulation G requires that certain information accompany the use of non-GAAP financial measures.
M.D.C. Holdings posted another quarter of strong operating results, highlighted by year-over-year home sales revenue growth of 33%, homebuilding operating margin expansion of 370 basis points and net income growth of 96%.
Net new order growth for the quarter increased 73% as compared to last year on a sales pace of 6.1 homes per community per month.
These results underscore the excellent homebuilding fundamentals we are currently experiencing across our markets and demonstrate our ability to grow our operations while continuing to improve our profit margins.
Homes increasingly serve as offices, classrooms and places of entertainment for the family, and as a result, people have gravitated to a living environment then can be accommodated in this new reality.
While this trend has been a positive development for the overall housing market, it has been particularly beneficial to the new home market for several reasons.
First, there is a limited existing inventory for consumers to choose from.
According to the National Association of Realtors, total housing inventory at the end of September totaled 1.4 million units, which was down 19% from a year ago and represents less than a three-month supply of homes.
Second, a newly constructed home gives consumers the peace of mind that they will be living in a home that no one else has lived in, which is a real selling point for many families during these uncertain times.
Supplementing the demand we've experienced as the pandemic, is the demographic shift toward home buying that we believe will serve as the tailwind for industry moving forward.
Millennials are increasingly aging into their prime home buying years, while baby boomers and empty nesters are looking to downsize into homes that fit their new lifestyles.
MDC is well positioned to take advantage of these demographic shifts due to our strategic focus on opening communities with affordable products.
Homebuyers of all ages are looking for value when it comes to buying a home, and we have found ways to accommodate the desires through more efficient floor plans, while the combination of lower rates and pandemic-related buying has spurred demand across all product types, we believe the more affordable segments of the market will be the most resilient over time.
We have been fortunate in having a deep bench at MDC.
And to that end, I am pleased that Rebecca Givens has agreed to step into Michael's role as Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
On the operations side, David Viger has moved into the important role as Chief Operating Officer of our homebuilding operations.
Anthony Berris has been promoted to President of our Financial Service operations.
And Dawn Huth has taken on additional responsibilities as Senior Vice President of National Finance.
All of these individuals have proven themselves to be highly capable leaders during their time at MDC, and I look forward to them contributing to our continued success in the future.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate David Mandarich, who has been elected as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
David has been associated with the Company since 1977, most recently as our President and Chief Operating Officer.
And he is widely regarded as one of the most skilled leaders within the homebuilding industry.
His move into the CEO role is a key step in the evolution of our Company.
And I look forward to continued collaboration with him on strategic directions of the Company.
David will be participati...
...ed the quarter with 194 active subdivisions, which is slightly higher than a year ago.
With the strong sales activity we've experienced during the third quarter, we have a number of subdivisions that are approaching closeout earlier than expected.
As a result, we anticipate roughly 185 active subdivisions at year-end.
Although this would be a decrease from the end of the third quarter, it would be unchanged from where we started the year.
On Slide 10, we provided further net new order detail by month since April.
You can see that sales activity ramped up significantly after the initial slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We saw order activity peak during the month of August, but September remained strong and well above the prior year, even after we increased prices in most of our subdivisions.
We also saw the rate of cancellations continue to decrease as the months progressed.
We expect some seasonality to kick in during the fourth quarter.
However, October has remained very strong relative to the prior year.
Based on the activity we've seen to date, we expect our October 2020 net orders to exceed our October 2019 orders by at least 50%.
As a result of our strong sales, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.1 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year.
The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 4% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives, and a shift in mix to California.
These factors were slightly offset by a shift in mix to lower-priced communities consistent with our ongoing strategy of offering more affordable home plans.
I will now turn to land activity on Slide 12.
The number of lots we acquired this quarter increased 63% year-over-year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on continuing to grow our business.
While the number of lots we approved earlier this year were down due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we approved over 3,800 lots for purchase during the third quarter of 2020.
In the end, in spite of immense volatility, the number of lots approved over the last 12 months has increased by 34% compared to the prior year period.
As a result, our total lot supply to end the quarter was 8% higher than at the same point in 2019, supporting our growth potential for future periods.
We expect to see strong lot approval and acquisition activity continue into the fourth quarter given the robust demand that we have seen in recent months and our conviction about growth prospects for housing in future years.
In summary, clearly, we are encouraged by the resilience the housing market has shown in the third quarter given the immense challenges our country has faced in 2020, and we believe that we have executed our operating strategy well in this volatile environment.
More importantly, we see an opportunity to sustain growth well into the future, supported by solid demographics and changing customer preferences.
Our current backlog, not only puts us in position for a strong end to 2020, but also provides us with the opportunity for significant year-over-year increases in home sale revenues and pre-tax income to start 2021.
With our strong balance sheet and current land pipeline, we are well positioned to grow community count significantly in 2021 and have a preliminary target of at least 10,000 home deliveries for the coming fiscal year.
We are mindful that there are many risks to achieving this target, especially with COVID-19 still impacting our daily lives.
These risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our Company and the safety of our employees, subcontractors and customers will remain top priority.
Following our strong third quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.33 to $0.40 per share.
This represents a 33% increase from the prior year and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their continued support.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The slides for today's call can be found on the Investors section of our website, along with the news release that was issued today.
These uncertainties include economic conditions, market demands and competitive factors.
Also, the discussions during this conference call may include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the slide deck for today's call, which is posted on the Investors section of our website.
Turning to slide three.
Also joining us on the call is Ram Mayampurath, who was announced earlier today has been appointed Rogers' Chief Financial Officer, effective May 1.
Rogers delivered another strong financial performance in Q1 driven by growth in advanced mobility markets, a strengthening market recovery and continued operational excellence.
First quarter net sales increased 9% to $229 million and exceeded the top end of our guidance.
Gross margin improved to 39% as a result of our strong operational performance.
EPS also exceeded the high end of our guidance, and we reported earnings of $1.66 per share on a GAAP basis and record adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share.
The increase in Q1 sales was broad-based, and nearly all of our markets increased at double-digit rate.
The impressive growth was enabled by both our strategic focus on fast-growing markets and the ongoing economic recovery.
We continue to realize the benefits of our multiyear investments in innovative technologies to capitalize on the accelerating opportunities in advanced mobility markets.
EV/HEV and ADAS sales increased at double-digit rates sequentially and grew more than 30% compared to Q1 of 2020.
Sales of compression pads and related solutions for EV batteries were especially strong and more than doubled year-over-year.
Sales of our power semiconductor substrate solutions were also higher.
We anticipate further top line growth as these markets continue to accelerate.
As announced last quarter, we are investing aggressively in additional capacity for our advanced battery compression pad and ceramic substrate technologies to take advantage of this opportunity.
We are also investing in additional resources and capabilities to support this growth.
We are at a growth inflection point, and these investments will position Rogers to capitalize on the significant momentum in these markets and add to our strong market positions in the near term and longer term.
Sales in the defense market increased at an impressive rate in Q1, similar to the EV/HEV and ADAS markets.
Our focused strategy and new product introductions continue to drive design wins and growth.
We saw a resurgence in industrial demand in Q1 as sales grew sharply versus the prior quarter and returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Our sales in the industrial market are closely tied to levels of capital investment, which continues to improve.
Demand was strongest for applications used in semiconductor equipment.
Other markets, such as clean energy and wireless infrastructure, also showed strong improvements in Q1 with sales growing at double-digit rates.
In the portable electronics market, sales were seasonally lower in the first quarter and consistent with our expectations.
The impact to sales from the disruption to our UTIS facility was minimal as a result of selling our undamaged finished goods inventory.
We continue to work closely with our customers during this time, and we remain on track to resume production in the fourth quarter of this year.
Q1 sales were largely unaffected by global supply chain disruptions, but we began seeing more impacts as we exited the quarter.
In the second quarter, the lack of availability of certain raw materials, primarily due to weather interruptions along the U.S. Gulf Coast, will somewhat temper our sales growth and gross margin.
However, we expect this headwind to modera...
...r than Q4 expenses.
The higher adjusted operating expenses were due to higher performance-based compensation costs as well as higher benefit costs.
Other income expense was $1.2 million favorable compared to Q4.
Included in other income expense in Q1 are the realized gains on our copper hedging contracts, which offset the impact of higher copper costs included in the gross margin in the first quarter.
As discussed earlier, Rogers' effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25.2%, higher than our forecasted rate of 22% to 23%.
We now expect our effective tax rate for 2021 will be 23% to 24% due to the geographic mix of pre-tax income.
Turning to slide 12.
The first -- in the first quarter, the company generated strong free cash flow of $33 million and ended the quarter with a cash position of $199.1 million.
In the quarter, we generated $36.5 million from operating activities, net of an increase of $10.8 million in working capital and repaid $21 million on our credit facility.
We ended the first quarter with an outstanding balance on our credit facility of $4 million and a net cash position of $195.1 million.
In Q1, the company spent $3.6 million on capital expenditures.
Despite the low level of expenditures in the first quarter, we continue to guide capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million in 2021, with over 50% of the expenditures to capture the accelerating advanced mobility market opportunities in both AES and EMS business segments.
The guided expenditures exclude the capital necessary to restore the UTIS operation, a significant portion which we expect to be reimbursed by insurance proceeds.
I've had the pleasure of working closely with Ram during my time at Rogers.
He is an excellent choice to continue driving the company's growth and profitability forward.
It is a privilege to be named as Chief Financial Officer at Rogers, and I'm extremely excited about the opportunity to serve in this capacity at such a pivotal time for the company.
Lastly, I look forward to becoming better acquainted with the members of our investment community.
Turning now to second quarter guidance on slide 13.
As Bruce discussed earlier, we see continued strength in many of our markets, particularly in advanced mobility, general industrial, defense and wireless infrastructure.
Based on the strong outlook, we are guiding our second quarter revenues to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million.
The effect of our UTIS factory being off-line and the lack of availability of certain raw materials will impact our second quarter growth.
Following several quarters of significant gross margin improvements, we expect Q2 to be flat sequentially before improving further in the second half of 2021.
To prepare for our strong second half, we will be stepping up our resources across the business in the second quarter.
Also in the quarter, we will continue to see challenges from mix, raw material cost increases and supply constraints related to the Gulf Coast interruptions mentioned earlier.
We have taken commercial actions to mitigate the increase in raw material costs.
These actions will have a positive impact on our gross margins in the second quarter, with full impacts benefiting the second half of 2021.
We expect to overcome the supply constraints by the end of the second quarter and see favorable impact from higher volume and better mix in the second half.
We guide our gross margins to be in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%, consistent with our first quarter.
The company will recognize higher operating expenses in the second quarter from timing of certain expenses, including performance-based compensation.
Costs incurred to support anticipated growth in the second half and to restore UTIS operations will also increase operating expenses in the quarter.
We are guiding GAAP Q2 earnings in the range of $1.58 to $1.73 per fully diluted share, and we guide fully diluted adjusted earnings in the range of $1.80 to $1.95 per share for the second quarter.

 Please ensure that your lines are muted until the operator announces your turn to ask a question.
Leading our call today will be Mike Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Lower, our Chief Financial Officer.
I will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.
Today, we reported all-time record quarter results with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.79, an increase of 207% compared to last year.
These outstanding results were driven by strong performance in new, used and customer financial services and disciplined expense management.
Demand continues to exceed supply for new vehicles, and we expect this to continue through 2021 in part due to the production disruption.
More importantly, low interest rates and consumer preference for vehicle ownership versus ridesharing and public transportation are supporting demand.
We expect our shipments from the manufacturers to double in the second quarter compared to the prior year.
AutoNation same-store new vehicle units were up 22% year-over-year and up 12% compared to 2019.
We remain focused on our pre-owned vehicle procurement strategy, nearly 90% of our pre-owned vehicles retailed in the first quarter were self- sourced, meaning, we acquired through trade-in, switch returns.
We'll Buy Your Car or service loaners and avoided auctions.
Acquiring vehicles at the right price, speed to the front line, a fair one price environment and leading digital capabilities are winning formula for our customers, which shows in our results.
AutoNation same-store pre-owned units were up 28% year-over-year and 20% compared to 2019.
We continue to leverage our digital capabilities to drive cost reductions and increase efficiency.
Tools like Customer 360, which has over 10 million active customer records, enable us to provide a truly comprehensive and personal experience for our customers, which leads to higher close rates and increased vehicle sales.
These efforts allowed us to deliver adjusted SG&A as a percent of gross profit, a 62.7% in the first quarter of 2021 which represents a 1,120 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Our target is to operate at or below 65% SG&A as a percent of gross profit for '21.
We are committed to our business growth strategy through investment in our existing franchise business.
Expansion of AutoNation USA and future acquisitions.
We are on track to open five new AutoNation USA stores in 2021 and 12 additional new stores in 2022.
Our target is to have over 130 AutoNation USA stores in operation from coast to coast by the end of 2026.
Today, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire 11 stores and one collision center for Peacock Automotive Group in Hilton Head and Columbia, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia, representing approximately $380 million in annual revenue.
The brands acquired are Porsche, Jag [Phonetic], Land Rover, Audi, Subaru, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Volkswagen and Hyundai.
This acquisition will increase AutoNation's footprint from coast to coast to over 325 locations and it's set to close in the summer.
We have set the target to sell 1 million combined new and pre-owned vehicles annually.
AutoNation remains committed to delivering value to our shareholders, which includes opportunistic share repurchase.
During the quarter we bought back 3.8 million shares or 5% of our shares outstanding.
Today we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $234 million or $2.79 per share versus $82 million or $0.91 per share during the first quarter of 2020.
This represents an all-time high quarterly earnings per share and a 207% increase year-over-year.
During the quarter, we sold our remaining stake in Vroom for a gain of approximately $6 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which was excluded from our adjusted results.
Our first quarter same-store revenue increased $1.3 billion or 27% compared to the prior year due to strong growth in new, used and customer financial services.
While prior-year comparisons are impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see strong consumer demand exceed supply for new vehicles.
Given this backdrop, we remain focused on optimizing our business in the current environment.
For the quarter, same-store total variable gross profit increased 52% year-over-year, driven by an increase in total combined units of 25% and an increase in total variable PVR of $767 or 21%.
Our customer care business continues to gradually improve with same-store customer care gross profit increasing 1% year-over-year.
Taking together, our same-store total gross profit increased 27% compared to the prior year.
First quarter SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 62.7%, as Mike stated a 1,120 basis point improvement compared to the year-ago period.
This strong performance was driven by a combination of strict cost discipline, leverage of our digital capabilities and healthy vehicle margins.
As measured against gross profit, overhead decreased 590 basis points, compensation decreased 320 basis points and advertising decreased 210 basis points.
Based on current business conditions, we project SG&A as a percentage of gross profit to be at or below 65% for the full year 2021.
Floorplan interest expense decreased to $9 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to lower interest rates and lower average floorplan balances.
This, combined with lower non-vehicle interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding generated record adjusted EPS.
Regarding our balance sheet and liquidity, we have ample capacity to continue investing in our business, including our AutoNation USA expansion as well as opportunistic share repurchases and acquisitions.
Our cash balance at quarter end was $350 million which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion.
Our covenant leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA declined to 1.3 times at the end of the first quarter, down from 1.8 times at the end of the fourth quarter.
Including cash and used floorplan availability, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 times at the end of March.
Our AutoNation USA expansion continues to provide a very attractive growth opportunity.
During the first quarter, our five existing AutoNation US stores generated over $3 million in pre-tax profit.
As Mike referenced earlier, we plan to open five new stores by the end of this year and 12 new stores in 2022 and targeting over 130 total locations by the end of 2026.
And we will continue to look for attractive acquisitions that complement our portfolio and we – and meet our return thresholds.
During the first quarter, repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $306 million.
We have approximately $892 million of remaining Board authorization for share repurchases and approximately 80 million shares outstanding.
Looking ahead, we will continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, utilizing our strong balance sheet, robust cash flow generation and ample liquidity to invest in our business and drive long-term shareholder value.
We had another impressive and record-breaking quarter.
We remain focused on delivering a peerless customer experience with industry leading digital capabilities and outstanding associate interactions.
Our commitment to the customer experience is why we're number 1 for the J.D. Power Dealer of Excellence Recognition Program for the third year in a row.
Less than 2% of all US franchise dealers achieved this honor.
78 AutoNation stores representing over 20% of our dealerships were recognized.
Our associates did not let the pandemic interfere with their ability to provide a great experience.
We're in the stores and in the offices to meet the needs of our customers.
With that, I'm delighted to take any questions.

[/INST] # AutoNation reported record quarterly results, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, a 207% increase year-over-year. New, used, and customer financial services drove this growth, with demand continuing to exceed supply due to production disruptions and consumer preference for vehicle ownership. AutoNation's same-store new vehicle units increased by 22% year-over-year and 12% compared to 2019. The company also reported increases in same-store pre-owned units (up 28% year-over-year and 20% compared to 2019). AutoNation's digital capabilities, including Customer 360, helped improve efficiency and reduce costs, resulting in a 62.7% SG&A ratio as a percent of gross profit, a significant improvement over the prior year. The company remains committed to its business growth strategy, including opening new AutoNation USA stores and acquiring dealerships. Notably, AutoNation announced the acquisition of 11 stores and a collision center from Peacock Automotive Group, increasing its footprint to over 325 locations and representing $380 million in annual revenue. The company also targets to sell 1 million combined new and pre-owned vehicles annually and continues opportunistic share repurchases, having bought back 3.8 million shares during the quarter.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm pleased that you're able to join us today.
The slides are available on our website at investors.
We caution you that such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
Leading our discussion today are Maria Pope, President and CEO, and Jim Ajello, Senior Vice President of Finance, CFO and Treasurer.
Hot summer weather and power market volatility had a significant impact on our region and on our results this quarter.
Turning to slide four, we reported net income of $50 million or $0.56 per share for the third quarter of 2021.
This compares with the loss of $17 million or $0.19 per share for the third quarter of 2020.
Year-to-date financial performance is on track.
And despite, third quarter volatility in the energy markets and higher O&M, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.70 to $2.85 per share.
Our long-term outlook remains unchanged and we are reaffirming our 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth guidance.
Overall, our business is strong, driven by load growth from the technology and digital sectors, as well as elevated residential use due in part to the hot summer weather and continued COVID constraints.
Year-to-date revenue is up 12% versus 2020 and for the quarter, up 17% versus last year.
Jim will cover third quarter results in more detail, provide regulatory and capital updates and discuss the outlook for the rest of the year.
The ongoing impacts of climate change underscore the importance of investments and actions that we are taking to rapidly transition to a clean energy future and meet our 2030 decarbonization goals while also ensuring that we have sufficient capacity.
We estimate that our 2030 targets will require approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of additional carbon-free resources and approximately 800 megawatts of non-emitting capacity resources.
In addition to removing coal from our portfolio, we're seeking approximately 1,000 megawatts of renewables and non-emitting capacity resources as part of our RFP, which will be issued in December.
As part of this procurement, we plan to add 375 to 500 megawatts of renewables to our portfolio.
We will also bring on approximately 375 of non-emitting to special capacity.
We will work with the OPUC and parties to evaluate opportunities to procure additional resources, so the types of projects submitted in the IRP process, excuse me, the RFP process make sense for customers and are attractively priced.
We could see procuring about a third of our clean energy resources needed to meet the 2030 emissions target reductions with this RFP.
We not only need more renewables.
We need to upgrade the grid to integrate these resources, making it easier for customers to participate in demand response and distributed energy programs, helping to keep service reliable and affordable.
In our recent distributed resource, excuse me, distributed system plan.
We lay out plans for the grid of the future that supports robust two-way energy flows and better manages energy use, especially during peak periods.
We estimate that as much as 25% of flexibility needed to meet our decarbonized future would come from customers and distributed energy resources, such as solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles.
During the 2021 summer heat up, we worked with customers to save 62 megawatts of power equivalent to powering 25,000 homes.
We're working to significantly grow this program to 500 megawatts by the end of 2023.
We are very pleased to have been selected by the Department of Energy as part of their connect communities program and are working with local DE&I groups on the placement of resources, such as batteries, two-way EV charging and solar panels to ensure that our customers in underserved communities participate in this clean energy transition.
As one of the early participants in the western energy and balance market, we have been a leader in advocating for the expansion and strengthening of wholesale markets...
...er expenses.
While O&M was higher this quarter when compared to Q3 2020, on a year-over-year basis our cost have increased only 2% annually since 2019.
The fact that we have reduced planned outages by 29% year-over-year, stood up a large wildfire prevention program and greatly increased vegetation management is a testament to the efficiency we built into the O&M program.
Managing consistent with inflation, while increasing wildfire resiliency, improving our customer experience and growing our digital capabilities demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce, as well as the use of technology.
Finally, there was a $0.03 decrease to earnings per share from the following items; $0.03 benefit from lower depreciation and amortization due to plant retirements, $0.04 of higher tax expense due to the timing difference of asset retirements in 2020, and $0.02 from other unfavorable miscellaneous items.
Turning to slide seven.
Last month, we reached an agreement with stakeholders on cost of capital in our 2022 general rate case.
Our agreement supports a capital structure of 50% debt, 50% equity, and a 9.5% allowed ROE.
We see this as a constructive outcome and look forward to discussing remaining unsettled issues with parties in the case.
As you see saw earlier this month, we made several regulatory filings, which we shared-in which we shared our plans to advance the strategy to meet our targets for reducing greenhouse emissions in the power we serve to customers.
We still plan to bid in benchmark resources into the RFP process.
To support our bids, we filed for an affiliated interest entity that will help support our decarbonization interest.
Our proposal is intended to address certain structural tax disadvantages encountered by utilities due to the unintended consequences of tax normalization requirements.
The affiliate interest would provide a greater price benefit to our customers as PGE decarbonizes its generation portfolio.
Turning to slide eight, which shows our updated capital forecast through 2025.
We increased our capital expenditure forecast by over $100 million this quarter.
This increase is concentrated in 2022 and is primarily associated with grid-based investments.
With our recent settlement in the GRC, assuming approval by the OPC, this affirms that we will not need to issue equity in 2022 to meet our capital requirements, unless there is a significant renewable addition stemming from the aforementioned RFP.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet, including strong liquidity and investment grade ratings, accompanied by a stable credit outlook.
Total available liquidity at $930 million is just over $1 billion.
At PGE sustainability is woven into the fabric of who we are as a company and we stand behind that through our actions as an organization, including in our financing plans.
This quarter, we renewed and increased by $150 million our revolving credit facility to include sustainability linked performance metrics.
We also refinanced the Wheatridge renewable energy facility with low cost debt under a green bond in alignment with our green financing framework.
The demand for this was evident as it was nearly six times oversubscribed.
Our investors are keen to purchase debt linked to sustainable investments.
Going forward, we will seek out opportunities to tie our long-term debt toward our sustainability strategy through capital investments.
Not only are these actions good for our business, but they're also good for society.
Turning to slide nine.
Our year-to-date 2021 performance remains on track and we reaffirm our guidance range of $2.70 to $2.85 and remain on track to achieve long-term earnings growth guidance of 4% to 6% from the 2019 base year.
The picture for 2021 and beyond remains clear, strong growth in cost demand for clean, affordable, safe, reliable and equitable energy paves the way for us to execute on our long-term financial targets and deliver value for customers and investors alike.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated, depending on a variety of risk factors.
As I have the last several quarters, I want to start by saying that first and foremost, our thoughts are for the safety and well-being of all those dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Good news is that during the quarter we have seen real improvement from a health and safety standpoint, both in our Company and in our communities related to COVID-19.
I also want to again highlight that for over a year now, our team partners have continued to put forth tremendous efforts in the face of many obstacles created by the pandemic.
Consolidated revenues for our third quarter were $464.3 million, up 4.2% from the prior year and fully diluted earnings per share were $2.21, up from $1.12 in the third quarter a year ago.
Our Core Laundry operations revenues were positively impacted by a modest level of customer reopenings as well as increases in the sale of PPE.
Our Specialty Garments segment also contributed to our overall performance with a very -- with very strong results during the quarter that exceeded our expectations.
Shane will provide you with the details of our quarterly results shortly.
Clearly, our comparisons to the prior year third quarter are being positively impacted by the significant effect that COVID-19 pandemic had on our fiscal 2020 third quarter.
As a reminder, that quarter a year ago was the quarter most impacted by customer closures during the pandemic.
Overall, we are pleased with the results of our quarter which exceeded our expectations from a top and bottom line perspective.
In addition, we have started to see early signs of improved activity in the energy dependent markets that we service.
Our new account sales and account retention experience was solid during the quarter and we continue to position our sales resources to take advantage of current opportunities as well as capitalize on future opportunities as the economy recovers.
As I'm sure many of you are aware, we are operating in an increasingly inflationary environment.
The cost of labor as well as other business inputs are clearly on the rise.
In addition, we expect, and have begun to experience a rebound of several costs that trended significantly lower during the pandemic, such as merchandise, healthcare, energy, travel and others.
For example, merchandised amortization for the full year fiscal 2021 is running at least 100 basis points lower than more historical levels.
As we look ahead beyond our fourth quarter into fiscal 2022, we expect that the increases in these costs as well as the inflationary impact on labor and other business inputs will pressure our margins.
We will provide you with further insights into our outlook for fiscal '22 during our fourth quarter earnings call.
Our solid balance sheet positions us well to meet our ongoing challenges, while continuing [Phonetic] to invest in growth and strengthen our business.
As we've talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructure and our technologies.
All of our investment is designed to deliver solid long-term returns to UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components to our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in the industry.
We continue to make good progress on these core initiatives such as our CRM systems project.
Our CRM deployment is certainly a foundational change to our infrastructure that will allow for service improvements and efficiency moving forward.
We will continue to invest in our infrastructure and future over the next several years, including key investments in supply chain, other technology infrastructure, route efficiency as well as our brand.
We will provide additional details as we progress with some of these key initiatives in the quarters ahead.
As always,...
... provided for during the pandemic, as our expectations around future uncollectible accounts have moderated.
These benefits were partially offset by higher healthcare claims costs which trended unfavorably due to what we believe was pent-up demand from our Team Partners deferring elective activities during the pandemic.
Energy costs were 4.2% of revenues in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 3.4% the prior year.
Our Specialty Garments segment, which delivers specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services had a very strong quarter and exceeded our expectations in both revenues and operating income.
Revenues increased to $38.2 million from $36.2 million in prior year or 5.7%, and were primarily driven by growth in our cleanroom and European nuclear operations.
Segment's operating margin increased to 21.7% from 17.6% primarily due to lower merchandise costs and bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues, as well as costs incurred in the prior year responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services.
Our First Aid segment's revenues were $17.1 million compared to $20.9 million in the prior year.
However, the segment's operating profit was nominal compared to $1.6 million in the comparable period of 2020.
These decreases were primarily due to elevated PPE sales in prior year.
In addition, the current quarter operating results reflect continued investment in the Company's initiative to expand its first aid van business into new geographies.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $535 million at the end of our third quarter of fiscal 2021.
For the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, capital expenditures totaled $96.6 million as we continue to invest in our future with new facility additions, expansions, updates and automation systems that will help us meet our long-term strategic objectives.
During the quarter, we capitalized $4.2 million related to our ongoing CRM project which consisted of license fees, third-party consulting costs and capitalized internal labor costs.
As of the end of our quarter, we had capitalized a total of $32 million related to the CRM project.
In the third fiscal quarter of 2021, we began to depreciate part of the system over a 10-year life, and our quarterly depreciation approximated $0.7 million.
As a reminder, the depreciation of the full system combined with additional hardware we will install to support our new capabilities like mobile handheld devices for our route drivers will eventually ramp to an estimated $6 million to $7 million of additional depreciation expense per year.
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter under its previously announced stock repurchase program.
As of May 29th, 2021, the Company had repurchased approximately 368,000 shares of common stock for $61.8 million under the program.
Based on our results to date, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect that our fiscal 2021 revenues will be between $1.810 billion and $1.817 billion.
We further expect that full year diluted earnings per share will be between $7.80 and $8.00.
This outlook assumes that our Core Laundry operating margin in the fourth quarter will approximate 10.6% at the midpoint of the range.
This outlook also reflects continued benefits in areas that have trended lower during the pandemic, including merchandise and travel costs, although we have also assumed that those benefits will continue to moderate.
We further assume that our payroll costs will increase as a percentage of revenues as we work to fill open positions and begin to adjust compensation levels in certain high demand roles in response to the current employment landscape.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'll begin on Slide 3.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.30 and generated total revenue of $5.9 billion.
Our linked quarter pre-tax pre-provision net revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by continued momentum across our fee businesses, growth in average loan balances, and continued focus on expense management resulting in positive operating leverage.
We released $310 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, supported by our outlook on the economy and better-than-expected credit quality metrics.
Our book value per share totaled $32.22 at September 30, which was 1.5% higher than June 30.
Our CET1 ratio was 10.2% at September 30.
Slide 4 provides key third quarter performance metrics, including a return on tangible common equity of over 20%.
Slide 5 highlights strong trends in digital engagement.
On Slide 6, we are providing an initial information about our Business Banking and payment relationships, which we plan to update every quarter.
Our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for us and provides a number of cyclical and secular growth opportunities.
Over the next few years, we believe there is a significant potential to expand and deepen relationships within this ecosystem.
Our starting point is that, we have about 1.1 million Business Banking relationships, which we define as businesses with under $25 million in revenue.
Currently, about half of our payments customers of this size have a Business Banking product and just under one-third of our Business Banking customers have a payments product.
The opportunity is to both increase the number of Business Banking relationships and to deepen these relationships by connecting our banking customers with our payments products and services, and connecting our payments customers with our banking products and services.
As we discussed previously, we believe we can grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.
Average loans increased 0.8% compared with the second quarter, driven by growth in other retail loans, primarily installment loans, as well as growth in credit card and residential mortgages.
This growth was partially offset by lower commercial loan balances which was impacted by lower levels of PPP loans.
At September 30, PPP loan balances totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion at June 30.
Excluding PPP loans, third quarter average loans grew by 1.8% on a linked quarter basis.
Turning to Slide 8, average deposits increased 0.5% compared with the second quarter and 6.4% compared with a year ago.
On both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we continued to benefit from favorable mix shift as average non-interest bearing deposits increased while higher cost time deposits declined.
Slide 9 shows credit quality trends.
Non-performing assets declined on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and our net charge-off ratio hit a record low of 20 basis points.
Our reserve release was $310 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics.
Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.3 billion, or 2.1% of loans.
The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the economic outlook and trajectory of credit quality within the portfolios.
Slide 10 provides an earnings summary.
In the third quarter of 2021, we earned $1.30 per diluted share.
These results include a reserve release of $310 million.
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased by 1% compared with the second quarter.
The growth was primarily driven by higher loan fees associated with the Paycheck Protection Program.
Excluding PPP-related fees, net interest income would have been stable, reflecting lower loan yields and the impact of change in loan mix, offset by the beneficial impact of core loan growth, lower premium amortization, and an additional day in the quarter.
Our net interest margin was stable co...
...essing businesses exceeded the pandemic compared period in 2019, while CPS volume was about in line.
As expected, prepaid card volume declined in the third quarter as the impact of government-related stimulus continues to diminish.
The reduced prepaid volume resulted in a slight decline in credit and debit card revenue on a linked quarter basis.
However, corporate payment revenues increased by 13%, which was better-than-expected, driven by improving business spend activity.
Merchant processing revenue increased by 4.8% due to higher merchant and equipment fees, as well as higher sales volumes.
Turning to Slide 14, non-interest expense increased 1.2% compared to the second quarter.
This increase primarily reflected higher revenue-related compensation and performance-based incentives.
Slide 15 highlights our capital position.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 10.2%, which increased slightly compared to June 30.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire MUFG's Union Bank.
We expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second quarter of 2022.
After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9%.
As PPP winds down and we approach the end of the forgiveness period, we expect PPP fees to decline $60 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP fees, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.
We expect PPP to be immaterial to both net interest income and the net interest margin in 2022.
In the fourth quarter, we expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen, driven by improving sales volumes.
However, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower than the third quarter, which affects linked quarter comparisons.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in amortization of tax-advantaged investments of approximately $60 million, as well as some seasonal impacts in marketing and in business investments.
Credit quality remains strong.
Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal.
For the full-year of 2021, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
To summarize our third quarter results, we're positive on several fronts, highlighted by a solid growth in core loans, good fee revenue momentum, and strong credit quality.
We are finishing off the year in a strong position heading into 2022 and we're excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across the franchise, supported by our continued investment in people, digital, technology, and data analytics.
Our three payments businesses will continue to benefit from the improved spend activity, particularly as consumer and business travel recovers toward pre-pandemic levels.
More importantly, we believe our secular growth initiatives aimed at connecting payments with banking provide a meaningful potential for market share gains over the immediate and longer-term.
Our Business Banking initiatives are still in the early innings but we're gaining traction and our partnership with State Farm continues to evolve and grow.
We are encouraged by the results we're seeing.
Aside from our organic growth opportunities, our recently announced acquisition of Union Bank provides a platform to achieve cost synergies, expand our distribution network in demographically attractive West Coast markets, and leverage our broad product set in leading digital capabilities across a loyal but underpenetrated customer base.
All of this will enable us to accelerate revenue and earnings growth, and continue to deliver the industry-leading returns on equity that our shareholders have come to expect.
We'll now open up the call to Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today we will be reviewing our second quarter 2020 financial results, providing investors with an update on our transformation and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Further information can be found in our SEC filings.
We'll begin on slide 3.
First, I'd like to start today's call by expressing my gratitude for all our associates, who remain so committed keeping our workplace safe and productive in these uncertain times.
As a company whose central focus is to make life's experiences possible, their hard work, creativity and dedication has been inspiring.
Invacare's mission is built on the tenets of integrity leadership accountability and helping everyone be part of an inclusive culture around the world.
We benefit as a company from the diversity of our team, differences of individuals, and the inspiring differences of people who rely on our products in their daily life.
We're pleased with our performance in the second quarter, achieving our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA, as well as sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter.
We effectively shed costs, but managed cash to offset lower sales.
During the quarter, we also overcame tremendous supply chain challenges, primarily related to our respiratory products, which limited our ability to meet the extremely high demand for these products, which are used for pandemic related care.
Turning to slide 4; we've established a strong track record of enhancing profitability.
This quarter, delivering an 84% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.
Profitability grew, as a result of stronger gross margin from favorable sales mix, cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives, and reduced SG&A expense.
I'm pleased with our strong performance in this challenging environment, which highlights the value of changes, we continue to make.
On slide 5; we saw two distinct patterns driving demand, as a result of the pandemic.
Beginning in late first quarter, we saw strong demand in our respiratory category for both stationary and portable oxygen concentrator.
That elevated demand continues today.
We had a smaller peak in demand for bed systems in our lifestyles category.
At this point for the most part, that peak in bed demand has passed, the timing of the return to more normal sales rates and mix for these product groups are still to be determined, based on the course that the pandemic takes from here.
In Mobility and Seating, the good momentum we had in first quarter begin to slow in the early parts of second quarter, as public health restriction limited access to clinicians for custom fitting, which reduced sales.
Looking ahead, we see encouraging signs that demand for Mobility and Seating products are starting to recover, as third quarter quote and order rates are improving over second quarter run rate.
In summary, we believe the second quarter will be the low point for sales in the year, as it coincided with the most restrictive phases of the global lockdown.
Based on reasonable assumptions around the loosening of public health restriction, and when needing to access the healthcare facilities, we anticipate sales will begin to normalize over the next two to three quarters.
We're confident that our diverse product portfolio, geographic coverage, continuous improvement initiatives and balance sheet will enable us to manage the business through the pandemic and accelerate our return to growth.
Turning to slide 6; second quarter results show that our transformation is working.
Importantly, North America returns to profitability and generated $4.8 million in operating income in an unprecedentedly tough market.
As a reminder, the North American segment has been undergoing in multiyear transformation, after the impact of national competitive bidding and sales restrictions related to the FDA Consent Decree, Craig, which combines with significantly reduced sales and profitability, starting nearly a decade ago.
In terms of our business opt...
...nd constant currency net sales decreased 3%, with growth in respiratory products more than offset by declines in Mobility and Seating and non-bed lifestyle products.
Within Mobility and Seating, higher value power mobility products were resilient, only experiencing a slight decline of 1%.
The North America segment realized a favorable mix shift for its higher acuity products, as end users with more severe needs continue to access healthcare, while less urgent elective care was more often delayed.
Gross profit increased 230 basis points or $2.4 million, driven by favorable product mix and lower operational cost, including reduced material and freight costs as a result of previous transformation initiatives.
The North America segment returned to profitability, with operating income of $4.8 million, an improvement of $6.1 million driven primarily by lower SG&A expenses primarily in employment costs and the benefit of reduced operational costs.
Turning to slide 12; All Other, which comprises the sales in the Asia-Pacific region, increased by 8.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales of lifestyle and Mobility and Seating products.
Operating loss increased by $300,000, driven by higher corporate SG&A expense, primarily related to equity compensation, partially offset by improved operating income in the Asia-Pacific business, attributable to lower SG&A expense.
Moving to slide 13; as of June 30, 2020, the company had total debt of $319 million, excluding operating lease obligations of $15.9 million, capitalized on the balance sheet.
At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $104 million of cash on its balance sheet.
The increase was primarily the result of cash borrowed on the company's credit facilities, proceeds from the sale of dynamic controls, and government loan programs, partially offset by cash used to fund operations and cash paid to expense a portion of the convertible debt.
In the second quarter, the company extended the maturity of a significant portion of the 2021 convertible note, and a portion of the 2022 convertible notes, to new maturity date of November '24, with terms substantially similar to the existing 2024 notes.
We are very pleased to have executed this transaction during a turbulent market.
On slide 14, we are reintroducing new full-year guidance for 2020.
Based on the loosening of public health restrictions and renewed access to healthcare facilities, the company anticipates reported net sales in the range of $810 million to $840 million.
Adjusted EBITDA, similar to the prior year in the range of $20 million to $30 million, and free cash flow usage, in line with the prior year in the range of $7 million to $10 million.
This guidance assumes consolidated net sales to improve sequentially, staying below the prior year.
Due to the more stringent quarantine programs in the company's key markets in Europe, net sales are expected to recover slowly, staying below the prior year in the range of mid-teen declines.
In North America, net sales are expected to be below the prior year, in the range of low single digit declines.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve sequentially and for the full year, achieve results similar to 2019, despite lower net sales due to the pandemic.
It was a good quarter in tough times.
We acted decisively to ensure the safety of our associates and customers, while protecting our business against the near-term impact of the pandemic.
This resulted in continued improvement in profitability, and a significant achievement in these unprecedented times.
As I look further out, I'm confident that the actions we've taken to improve our competitiveness, reduce our cost structure, and strengthen our balance sheet, has set the foundation for long-term profitable growth.
It was the direct result of the many quarters of hard work that enabled our team to deliver a strong result this quarter, and we plan to unlock additional value for years to come.
We'll now take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our speakers are Jim Owens, H.B. Fuller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Corkrean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
First, a reminder that our comments today will include references to organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues and the impact of acquisitions or divestitures.
We believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist their understanding of our operating performance and how our results compare with other companies.
Unless otherwise specified, discussion of sales and revenue refers to organic revenue, and discussion of EPS, margins or EBITDA refers to adjusted non-GAAP measures.
Many of these risks and uncertainties are, and will be exacerbated by COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the global business and economic environment.
Last evening, we reported another quarter of strong revenue and earnings growth.
Organic revenues in the second quarter were up 19% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 21% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 increased 38% versus last year.
We overcame significant supply chain disruptions and moved quickly to raise prices in the quarter.
We achieved an all-time record quarter in revenue as we met increasing customer demand and gained market share.
Throughout the quarter, H.B. Fuller experienced raw material and container shortages, but because of strong support and global collaboration with key suppliers and the ingenuity of our technical and supply chain teams, we made certain to keep our customers supplied.
H.B. Fuller's ability to assure supply of critical adhesives and provide innovative solutions that customers need remains a competitive differentiator for our company, which is evident in our top-line growth.
H.B. Fuller's revenue growth was broad-based across segments and geographies.
Organic revenues increased in each segment versus the second quarter of 2020, including strong double-digit growth in both Engineering and Construction Adhesives segments, and very solid growth in Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives against a very strong second quarter of 2020.
Revenues also grew in each geography, including organic growth of 19% in the Americas, 27% in the EMEA and 9% in the Asia-Pacific region.
Importantly, our revenues are also up from pre-COVID levels.
Total organic revenues increased by 9.5% versus the second quarter of 2019, which had no COVID-19-related impacts with double-digit growth in HHC and Engineering Adhesives and mid single-digit growth in Construction Adhesives.
Strong volume leverage in the quarter, coupled with pricing benefits and operational efficiencies we're driving in the business offset significantly higher raw material costs and drove a 21% increase in EBITDA dollars year-over-year.
Raw material input cost increased in the second quarter by about 10% from the end of 2020 with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we forecasted.
We have implemented $150 million of annualized price adjustments to date and we'll implement an additional $75 million in the third quarter.
We're prepared to do more as necessary.
These price adjustments will offset the impact of raw material increases in this fiscal year.
Suppliers have made good progress in restoring capacity for the commodity and specialty chemicals we purchase.
However, the rate of recovery going forward will likely be uneven until inventory levels are rebuilt to fully meet demand.
Our planning assumptions anticipate that the current supply volatility will lessen and pricing will begin to stabilize in the fourth quarter.
We now expect the year-on-year raw material inflation to be over 10% and expect that our pricing will fully offset raw material increases by the end of the third quarter.
We expect gross margin headwinds in the third quarter, which is seasonally slower for volumes, and we will see additional pricing and margin benefit in the fourth quarter, which is typically our strongest v...
...earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction.
Cash flow from operations in the first half of the year of $80 million compares to $108 million in the same period last year, reflecting working capital requirements to support strong top-line performance, as well as higher raw material costs.
We continue to reduce debt, paying down $62 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $51 million during the same period last year and keeping us on track for our full-year debt paydown plan of $200 million.
Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits.
As you will recall, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance range last quarter to $455 million to $475 million and this guidance remains unchanged, given our expectations for the continued strong volume growth and accelerating pricing offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed 10% for the fiscal year.
Based on the seasonality of our business and the timing of raw material and price increases, we expect revenues in the third quarter to be up about 15% versus the third quarter of 2020 as we continue to deliver strong top-line growth.
EBITDA margin in the third quarter is expected to be about 100 basis points lower than the second quarter on a sequential basis.
As pricing actions are fully implemented, margins will improve in the fourth quarter, which is also our strongest quarter from a volume standpoint.
We expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $200 million of debt during 2021.
During our last conference call, I outlined the three critical priorities we set for 2021 in the current supply constrained inflationary COVID recovery environment.
These three priorities are volume growth, price and greater productivity, and we executed well against each of these key imperatives in the second quarter.
Our first priority is to drive volume growth by supporting our customers in the current high-demand and supply constrained environment.
Volume growth and share gains are our foundation for creating durable shareholder value.
Our 19% second quarter organic revenue growth is even more significant than it appears, considering our HHC business had a very strong quarter of 7% organic growth in the second quarter last year.
And our business, overall, grew 9.5% compared to pre-COVID levels in the second quarter of 2019.
Our second imperative is to strategically manage pricing, aligned to the value we deliver, in this inflationary environment.
We implemented $150 million in price increases, effective from March 1 through July 15, and we're planning an additional $75 million in price increases later in Q3.
We are also delivering on our third priority to release greater productivity and capacity through our operational excellence programs.
In the second quarter, we out-delivered competitors and supported customers and our factory labor and overhead, as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, decreased versus the second quarter last year.
COVID-19 has changed how businesses operate and supply constraints and pricing volatility are challenges that are impacting our industry today.
In this environment, H.B Fuller's strategic priority, the benefits of our robust global operations and supply chain, our culture of collaboration and market-based innovation and the speed and agility we have developed across our company is delivering results for our customers and for our shareholders.
We will continue to navigate the challenges of a constrained supply environment, grow our business and build on our rising leadership position in the global adhesive industry and we will continue to deliver strong results for our customers and for our shareholders.
Operator, please open up the call so we can take some questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 It was great to see many of you in person at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November.
And as you will recall, we shared our expectations that we would meet or exceed our three-year Vision '22 targets.
We also laid out our plans to make 2022 yet another inflection point in our growth trajectory and further accelerate the company's growth rate in the next three phase -- three-year phase of our journey to 2025.
The team highlighted the power of connected intelligence, which brings together IQVIA differentiated capabilities and drive our leadership position in the clinical and commercial markets.
This underpins our new 20 by '25 strategy, which alludes to our plans to achieve at least $20 billion of revenue by 2025.
We're excited about this next phase of growth for IQVIA, and we are busy refining our strategies and action plans, and you will hear more about it as the year progresses.
Two years -- two weeks ago, IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year.
Importantly, we earned a first-place ranking within the healthcare, pharmacy, and other services category for the first time.
1 in the categories of innovation, capital deployment, global competitiveness, quality of product and services, and long-term investment value.
Turning now to our results.
We ended 2021 on a high note despite COVID-19's continued impact on many parts of the world.
We delivered robust top and bottom-line growth in the quarter, which, as you know, was against a much tougher year-over-year comparison than earlier in the year.
These results reinforce our confidence that we will achieve our 2022 guidance.
And of course, it sets us up well to meet our ambitious 20 by '25 targets.
Let's review the fourth quarter.
Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency.
The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all three segments, as well as higher pass-throughs partially offset by FX headwinds.
Compared to prior year and excluding COVID-related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis.
Ron will provide a lot more detail in his remarks, including additional COVID-adjusted numbers for each segment.
Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 12.7%, reflecting our revenue growth, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives.
The $27 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to our operational performance.
Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.55 grew 20.9%.
That was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the majority of the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.
Let me now provide an update on the business.
On the commercial side of the business, it was a strong year for new molecules and launches as the industry continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption.
This year, 50 new molecules were approved by the FDA and 72 new commercial launches took place.
IQVIA supported nearly 80% of launches by top 20 pharma and approximately 60% of all launches.
This highlights our scale globally and across all customer segments in applying advanced technology and analytics capabilities to enhance launch planning, engagement, and measurement.
Overall, we've seen significant momentum and continued demand for our technology solutions.
There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage, and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE.
In fact, the footprint of our OCE platform itself has continued to grow, with over 350 clients having adopted one or more modules on the platform since launch.
Early in 2021, we launched IQVIA Next Best Action, which is an AI-driven omni-channel customer engagement decision engine.
Two top 20 pharma cli...
...ind from FX since we initially guided in November.
Now additionally, we're raising our full year 2022 profit guidance versus what we provided you in November.
So, to summarize the overall guidance for the full year, we expect revenue to be between $14.700 billion and $15 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.1% to 9.2% at constant currency and 6% to 8.1% on a reported basis compared to 2021.
Now we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%.
And we also now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $9.95 and $10.25, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%.
Now our full year 2022 guidance assumes at December 31, 2021, foreign currency exchange rates remain, in fact, for the balance of the year.
Now compared to the prior year, I should mention FX is now a headwind of 110 basis points to our full-year revenue growth, and our projected revenue growth includes a little bit over 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity.
Now with our analyst and investor conference in November, we told you to anticipate that our COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $1 billion in 2022 but will more than compensate for that headwind with strong growth in our base business.
And let me give you some additional detail around this that I think will be helpful.
Excluding COVID-related revenue, the FX headwind, and the contribution of acquisitions, our total company revenue guidance implies organic growth at constant currency in the low to mid-teens.
At the segment level, we anticipate full-year Technology and Analytics Solutions revenue growth of between 5% and 7%.
Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in TAS to be in the high single digits.
Research and Development Solutions revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%.
Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in R&DS to be in the upper teens.
And finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions revenue was anticipated to be down about 2%.
But excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in CSMS to be in the low single digits.
Let's move to the first quarter now.
As you all know, the first quarter of last year marked a continued rebound in our base business after the 2020 pandemic-related decline.
In addition, Q1 and Q2 of last year represented our peak COVID-related revenues.
As a result of this, the first half of the year will have the most challenging year-over-year compares.
For the first quarter, our revenue is expected to be between $3.515 billion and $3.575 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6% on a constant-currency basis and 3.1% to 4.9% on a reported basis.
Now excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the mid-teens.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $800 million and $815 million, up 7.5% to 9.5%.
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $2.40 and $2.46, growing 10.1% to 12.8%.
So, to summarize, we delivered very strong fourth-quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what was also a very strong fourth quarter of 2020.
R&DS recorded its largest-ever quarter of service bookings and for the first time, had over $10 billion of total net new bookings in a year.
Our contracted backlog improved to a record of nearly $25 billion, up over 10% year over year.
We delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, bringing the full year to a record $2.3 billion.
We closed 2021 with net leverage of 3.6 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
Our board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.
And finally, we're reaffirming the full year of 2022 guidance that we provided in November for revenue, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm pleased to report another strong quarter led by record revenues at CooperVision, where we exceeded the high end of expectations for the quarter.
Our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios posted strong results, and our key account strategy generated share gains in markets around the world.
Within CooperSurgical, our fertility business continued to perform extremely well, and we recently announced an exciting agreement to acquire Generate Life Sciences, a great strategic fit with our fertility and labor and delivery offerings.
For the full fiscal year 2021, I'm proud to report record revenues at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, record non-GAAP earnings and record free cash flow.
As we enter fiscal 2022, we have strong momentum and expect another record-setting year.
Regarding fourth quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were $759 million, with CooperVision at $565 million, up 11%; and CooperSurgical at $194 million, up 11%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.28.
For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way, growing 19%.
All three regions reported strength in this product category, with our premium product, MyDay, and our mass market product, clariti, both performing really well.
Biofinity also had a solid quarter, supported by strength in toric multifocal.
For the regions, the Americas grew 6%, led by our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, with particular strength in MyDay, where we continue seeing strong fit activity.
EMEA grew a healthy 15%, with improving consumer activity and strength in our key accounts driving growth and share gains.
Within this region, we posted broad-based growth from our daily silicones and Biofinity.
Asia Pac grew 14%, led by a steady improvement in consumer activity and success with several new product launches.
This region remains a very important growth driver for us, and we're investing accordingly as we're outperforming the market and taking share.
For our FRP portfolio, Biofinity posted solid results, driving growth in markets around the world with its broad offerings, including the toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space.
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active.
I've highlighted in the past the many products and range extensions we've been launching around the world for MyDay, clarity, and Biofinity, and all that activity continued.
This has driven consistent share gains, and we expect that to continue.
One recent launch that I want to highlight this quarter is our new MyDay multifocal.
We've launched the product in the U.S. and several major European markets, and the feedback and results are absolutely fantastic.
We're consistently hearing from eye care practitioners that the new binocular progressive fitting system is a breakthrough approach that simplifies fit and provides optimal visual acuity at all levels.
And we're hearing that from patients who are touting it as the best multifocal they've ever worn for exceptional near, intermediate, and distant vision.
We expect this launch to continue performing extremely well and to provide a nice halo effect, supporting the already successful MyDay brand of torics and spheres.
Moving to myopia management.
Our portfolio grew 63% to $21 million, with MiSight up 165% to $7 million and Ortho K products up 40%.
We reached our goal of $65 million for the year, up 76% year over year, and our momentum is strong.
As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; our broad range of market-leading Ortho K lenses; and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses.
Regarding MiSight, we didn't quite reach our target this quarter, but we did reach $19 million in sales for the full year, up a very impressive 149% year over year.
We're making great progress with independent optometrists, buying ...
...uct launches, and we're doing that intelligently by leveraging our operations to ensure we receive strong returns.
I believe CooperVision is the most innovative company in the contact lens space today, with leading products in myopia management and the broadest product offerings in the market, and CooperSurgical is in an extremely exciting position, led by our fertility business.
As a company, we remain on a steady upward trend, and we see that continuing for fiscal 2022 and many years beyond.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 11% year over year and also 11% in constant currency to $759 million.
Consolidated gross margin decreased year over year by 20 basis points to 67.5% driven primarily by currency, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.
Operating expenses grew 16% as strategic investments in sales and marketing to support myopia management and fertility continued.
Within this, we did see slightly higher than initially forecasted investments for SightGlass Vision and MiSight in China, along with elevated distribution costs tied to higher demand of direct shipments.
Consolidated operating margins were 24.9%, down from 26.8% last year.
Interest expense was $5 million on lower average debt, and the effective tax rate was 10.3%, helped by stock option exercises in the quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.28, with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding.
FX negatively impacted us and was roughly $0.05 worse than expected when we gave guidance last quarter.
Free cash flow was solid at $110 million, comprised of $175 million of operating cash flow, offset by $65 million of capex.
Net debt decreased to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.38 times.
Moving to 2022 guidance and excluding the recently announced Generate Life Sciences acquisition, consolidated revenues are expected to be in the range of $3.032 billion to $3.090 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.225 billion and $2.267 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $807 million and $823 million, up 6% to 8% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $13.60 to $14, up 9.5% to 12.5% in constant currency.
And the tax rate is expected to be around 13%.
At the midpoint of guidance, this equates to constant currency revenue growth of roughly 7% and constant currency earnings per share growth of roughly 11%.
Regarding currency on a year-over-year basis, we're expecting an FX headwind of roughly 2.5% on revenues and 7% on EPS.
This impact will be most detrimental in Q1, where we're expecting earnings per share in the $3 to $3.10 range.
Before opening the call to questions, let me touch on the Generate Life Sciences acquisition that we announced on November 10.
As of today, we're optimistic we'll close in the next couple of weeks, which would give us roughly 10.5 months of their operations in our fiscal 2022.
Having said that, we're still waiting for final regulatory approvals, so we're not providing specific guidance today.
In the meantime, let me walk you through the deal accretion that we expect.
As previously announced, Generate has roughly $250 million in trailing 12-month revenue.
Gross margins are expected to be roughly 70%.
And opex is expected to be elevated in year one as synergies are expected to be minimal as we integrate and invest in the business.
As we are now closer to securing permanent financing for this transaction, we are updating our year one non-GAAP earnings per share accretion estimate to around $0.50 and would add that we expect this accretion to improve in year two with synergies.
In summary, we're pleased with how we closed this fiscal year.
And we look forward -- and as we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we continue to believe our strategic investments will drive top-line momentum, supporting share gains in both businesses and long-term sustainable earnings growth.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC.
For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP results included after-tax transformation and other charges of $54 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges.
In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver.
But through it all, UPSers leverage the flexibility of our integrated network and the technology that powers it to deliver what matters.
A little over one year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework under a customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy.
Inside that strategic framework is a focus on three main areas.
First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume.
Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost takeout initiatives.
And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers, and higher returns on the capital we deploy.
While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results.
Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated.
Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion, driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all three of our operating segments.
Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion, driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control.
Each of our segments delivered year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit operating margins.
And for the first nine months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history.
Brian will share the details of our performance shortly.
As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMBs.
These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network.
Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities.
This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week.
We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial pickups and deliveries.
In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery.
The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital.
And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis.
As we look at our third-quarter results, we see that SMBs value the new capabilities we are providing.
In the U.S., SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9% year over year.
In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past six quarters.
volume, up 380 basis points from one year ago.
And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%.
We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our Digital Access Program, to customers outside of the U.S. Let me also touch on SMBs and healthcare.
When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology, and expertise.
Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB healthcare customers and significantly driving profit growth in this sector.
And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year with 99.9% on-time delivery.
We are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress.
While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights.
In the U.S. we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH, or pieces per hour, increased by 2.5%.
Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Da...
...logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our healthcare portfolio.
In the third quarter, supply chain solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million, and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%.
As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS freight results, given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30th of this year.
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense.
Other pension income was $285 million.
And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items.
Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet.
We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income.
So far, in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash from operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow.
And in the first nine months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends.
In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan.
with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter.
We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years.
Now I'll make a few comments regarding the full-year outlook.
We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and inventory and labor shortages.
Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter.
Due to our third-quarter outperformance, combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives, and our increased fourth-quarter plan, we are raising our full-year guidance.
On a consolidated basis, we expect full-year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year over year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS freight.
Additionally, consolidated operating margin should be around 13%.
In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume.
We anticipate the full-year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%.
As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter.
First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year.
And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives.
As a result, we expect the sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Moving to the international segment.
We expect full-year revenue growth of around 20.7%, with an operating margin of about 23.9%.
And in the supply chain solutions segment, we anticipate full-year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%.
Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion, and return on invested capital will be around 29%.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion.
And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%.
As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June.
We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework, and delivering on our commitments despite a very dynamic environment.
We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers and our people and the financial performance of our company.
And operator, please open the lines.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin our call today, I want to remind you that in order to talk about our company, we're going to mention a few things that are not historical facts.
These non-GAAP measures are adjusted net loss, adjusted net income, adjusted loss per share, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating loss, adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.
We're using these non-GAAP measures today because they allow us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to non-recurring items.
In addition, RPC is required to use EBITDA to report compliance with financial covenants under our revolving credit facility.
Please review these disclosures if you're interested in seeing how they are calculated.
rpc.net for a copy.
During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute our downsizing plans, first disclosed in October, including closing various facilities and scrapping equipment.
In addition, we reduced headcount by approximately 21% since the end of the second quarter.
Our CFO, Ben Palmer, will discuss this and other financial results in more detail, after which I will have a few closing comments.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded additional impairment and other charges of $10.6 million related primarily to severance and underutilized assets, bringing the total of impairment and other charges to $82.3 million in 2019.
We do not currently expect any additional significant charges based on this review.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, revenues decreased to $236 million compared to $376.8 million in the prior year.
Revenues decreased due to lower activity levels resulting from a more pronounced fourth quarter seasonal decline than in the prior year, lower pricing, and a smaller fleet of pressure pumping equipment.
Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter was $17.3 million compared to an operating profit of $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $23.2 million compared to EBITDA of $61.7 million in the same period of the prior year.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, RPC reported a $0.07 adjusted loss per share compared to a $0.06 diluted earnings per share in the prior year.
Cost of revenues during the fourth quarter of 2019 was $176.9 million or 75% of revenues compared to $274.4 million or 72.8% of revenues during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Cost of revenues decreased primarily due to lower materials and supplies expenses and other expenses associated with lower activity levels.
In addition, cost of revenues declined due to lower employment costs as a result of our downsizing.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to significantly lower activity levels and more competitive pricing for our services.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $36.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $40 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year and this was due to lower employment costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $40.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of 5.2% compared to $42.6 million in the prior year.
Technical Services segment revenues for the quarter decreased 38.7% compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
Excluding impairment and other charges, we incurred an operating loss of $17.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 19.9% [Phonetic] operating profit in the prior year.
These results were due to lower pricing and activity in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our Support Services segment revenues for the quarter decreased 13.2% compared to the same quarter in the prior year.
Operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.2 million compared to $2.5 million in the prior year.
On a sequential basis, RPC's fourth quarter revenues decreased 19.5% to $236 million from $293.2 million in the third quarter due primarily to pronounced seasonally lower activity levels and slightly lower pricing.
Cost of revenues during the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased by $48.3 million or 21.5% due to lower activity levels and our cost reduction actions.
As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased from 76.8% in the third quarter to 75% in the current quarter due primarily to a favorable job mix within RPC's pressure pumping service line.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $36.8 million during the fourth quarter of the current year compared to $42.6 million in the prior quarter.
RPC generated an adjusted operating loss of $17.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to an adjusted operating loss of $21 million in the prior quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDA was $23.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $22.8 million in the prior quarter.
Our Technical Services segment revenues decreased by 55.6% [Phonetic] or 20.3% to $218.9 million in the fourth quarter.
The Technical Services segment incurred a $17.2 million operating loss in the current quarter compared to an operating loss of $18.2 million in the prior quarter.
Our Support Services segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $17.1 million compared to $18.8 million in the prior quarter.
Operating profit was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to $1.6 million operating profit in the prior quarter.
At the end of the fourth quarter, RPC operated 10 pressure pumping fleets.
We will continue to adjust the number of fleets based on conditions and customer activity level.
At year-end '19, RPC's pressure pumping fleet totaled approximately 735,000 hydraulic horsepower.
Fourth quarter 2019 capital expenditures were $41.4 million and the full-year total of $250.6 million and we currently estimate 2020 capex to be approximately $80 million.
As 2020 begins, we are focused on improving utilization and well site execution as well as effectively managing our costs.
We believe the actions taken as a result of our strategic assessment better align our operations with current market conditions.
Despite the challenging environment during 2019 and approximately $250 million of capital expenditures, we ended the year with $50 million in cash and no debt.
We will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and allocate capital to maximize long-term shareholder returns.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Then Tom Dineen, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the third quarter 2021 financial results, and then I will discuss our operations and the state of the market.
Copy of these documents may be obtained by contacting the company or the SEC or on the company website at ruger.com/corporate or, of course, the SEC website at sec.gov.
We do reference non-GAAP EBITDA.
Now Tom will discuss the company's third quarter 2021 results.
For the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $178.2 million and diluted earnings were $1.98 per share.
For the comparable prior year period, net sales were $145.7 million and diluted earnings were $1.39 per share.
For the first nine months of 2021, net sales were $562.7 million and diluted earnings were $6.64 per share.
For the corresponding period in 2020, net sales were $399.6 million and diluted earnings were $3.31 per share.
The substantial increase in profitability for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses.
Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profitability declined principally due to three factors: First, all of our firearms facilities took a very well-deserved shutdown week in July, which reduced the number of workdays in the quarter to 59 compared to 64 workdays in Q2.
This decrease in production reduced sales and resulted in some unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs.
Second, after a relatively quiet second quarter, COVID positive cases in our plants were then tripled in the third quarter.
This resulted in significant increases in lost production.
And third, following six quarters of exceptional demand, excess resales decreased from the second quarter, adversely impacting our overall profitability.
Our strong financial results yielded significant cash generation.
During the first nine months of 2021, we generated $117 million of cash from operations.
We reinvested $15.6 million of that back into the company in the form of capital expenditures.
We estimate that 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $20 million, predominantly related to new product development.
Our ability to shift manufacturing equipment between cells and between facilities improves our overall utilization and allows for reduced capital investment.
Our balance sheet at October 2, 2021, remain strong.
Our cash and short-term investments, which are invested in U.S. T-bills totaled $192.7 million.
Our current ratio was 3.8:1, and we had no debt.
Our stockholders' equity was $338.1 million, which equates to a book value of $19.21 per share, of which $10.95 per share was cash and short-term investments.
In the first nine months of 2021, we returned $45.2 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends.
Our Board of Directors declared a $0.79 per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of November 15, 2021, payable on November 30, 2021.
Upon receiving this $0.79 quarterly dividend, shareholders will have received $3.36 of dividends per share in 2021.
As a reminder, our quarterly dividend is approximately 40% of net income, and therefore, it varies quarter-to-quarter.
That's the financial update for the quarter.
Demand for our products has remained strong.
Despite a moderation of overall industry demand, as reflected in the last two quarters of adjusted NICS, we shipped all of the firearms that we built this quarter without the need to aggressively promote or discount any of our products.
We've just begun to replenish the distributor and retail inventories that were largely depleted over the past 18 months, putting us in a great position as we head into the fourth quarter, which has traditionally been a period of strong demand.
The estimated unit sell-through of the company's products from the independent distributors to retailers increased 9% in the first nine months of 2021 c...
...may be attributable to strong consumer demand for Ruger products, increased production in 2021 and the introduction of new products that have been met with strong demand.
New product development continues to drive results.
The MAX-9 pistol and the Ruger LCP MAX pistol, which were both launched in 2021 remain in strong demand.
In the first nine months of 2021, new product sales represented $116 million or 22% of firearm sales compared to $88 million or 24% of firearm sales in the first nine months of 2020.
As a reminder, we include only major products introduced in the past eight quarters in our new product sales metric.
Derivatives, product line extensions of mature product families and models introduced more than two years ago are not included.
We are hard at work on some exciting new product initiatives, including the return of Marlin lever action rifles, which we begin -- plan to begin shipping later in the fourth quarter.
Since March of 2020, our workforce has been strengthened by 370 folks, an increase of just over 20%, and our quarterly unit production has increased by more than 160,000 units or 45% during that period.
A 20% increase in personnel yielding a 45% increase in production.
That is a tremendous accomplishment by our operations teams at all of our manufacturing plants.
Despite the growth in production at the end of third quarter 2021, our finished goods inventories remained near historic lows and distributor inventories of Ruger products were 150,000 units lower than they were at the end of 2019, the last time inventories were at what we would consider normal or expected pre-COVID-19 levels.
As Tom mentioned earlier, after an unprecedented 16-month run of seemingly insatiable product demand and continual monthly production increases, we took a one week shutdown during the first week of July.
This is our first shutdown in two years, which gave our workforce a very well-deserved break and allowed us to perform some routine maintenance and reconfigure some of our manufacturing operations.
The shutdown reduced our third quarter production sales and earnings, but that was a small price to pay.
It was the right thing to do, and I'm glad we did it.
Our dedicated and hard-working folks deserved and needed a break.
And after the shutdown, we are better prepared as we head into what we expect will be a busy fourth quarter and 2022.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we have remained proactive in maintaining the health and safety of our employees and mitigating its impact on our business.
We provide all hourly employees with additional paid time off and offer incentives to any employee who becomes vaccinated.
If practical, we allow employees to work remotely.
And we continue to follow robust cleaning, sanitizing and social distancing protocols to maintain a cleaner and safer workplace.
With the United States once again seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases in positivity rates, we remain vigilant and are proactively adjusting our plan accordingly to keep our associates healthy and safe and to minimize any disruption to our business.
Our financial strength, evidenced by our debt-free balance sheet provides financial security and flexibility as we manage through the challenges like COVID-19 and remain focused on our long-term goals and the creation of shareholder value.
In the third quarter, we added a 225,000 square foot facility in Mayodan, North Carolina, about 1.5 miles down the road from our original Mayodan building that we purchased in 2013.
This new facility doubles the size of our footprint in Mayodan and provide some room for expansion.
We moved our finished goods inventory, our ShopRuger operations and our customer service call center into the new facility.
This freed up some manufacturing space in our original building in addition to the overall -- excuse me, to the available space in the new facility.
Those are the highlights of the third quarter of 2021.
Operator, may we have the first question?

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Despite the extraordinary challenges 2020 presented on a global scale, we are extremely pleased with the strong execution of our team -- that our team has shown, not only in the field, but by all of the employees within the family of companies, who demonstrated the true resiliency of the Reliance business model.
I applaud each and every one of you for your tremendous efforts to quickly and nimbly adapt to the changing environments, ensure our customers were always taken care of, and most importantly, maintain your unwavering commitment to health and safety, our most important core value.
Since 2017, our SMART Safety program has been focused on embedding our culture of safety across our entire family of companies.
Working together as one company, we focused on this initiative in 2020 like never before in response to the new and unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to developing new policies and procedures to prevent the spread of the virus, we improved our safety performance in 2020 with an approximately 23% reduction in our incident rate compared to 2019.
While this is a significant milestone, as I've stated in the past, we will not be satisfied until this rate reaches 0.
I'd like to take a moment to congratulate both Karla Lewis and Arthur Ajemyan for the recently announced well-deserved promotions.
Consistent with our Board's strategic executive leadership succession plan, Karla was promoted from CFO to President and was simultaneously appointed to our Board of Directors effective January 15.
Karla has demonstrated excellent judgment and leadership in each role she has held since joining Reliance in 1992, and her unique abilities and talents have earned the respect of our employees and shareholders.
Karla's promotion recognizes her significant contributions to Reliance.
It will allow her to broaden her knowledge of Reliance's field operations and increase the diversity of her experience.
In addition, Arthur Ajemyan was promoted to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 15.
Arthur has held various positions in Reliance's finance and accounting department for over 15 years and has done a phenomenal job.
I congratulate both Karla and Arthur on their promotions and look forward to continuing to work closely with them in their new roles.
Now let's turn to our 2020 results.
We delivered a solid financial performance in 2020, driven by consistently strong operational execution despite considerable turbulence in the market.
Our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our people and unique business model as well as our ability to execute through both good times and bad given the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies.
Our decentralized structure allowed us to respond rapidly to fluid market conditions and demand trends.
These factors, combined with pricing discipline and continuous improvements to our value-added processing capabilities, enabled us to achieve our second consecutive year of record annual gross profit margins at 31.5%, up 120 basis points from 2019 and exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%.
We also maintained healthy profitability levels despite the extraordinarily volatile and challenging market conditions.
For the full year, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.71 as a result of the combination of strong margin discipline and effective expense control, which helped mitigate our decline in profitability.
On the heels of a record year in 2019, we maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion in 2020 driven by our profitability and focus on working capital management.
Fueled by our ongoing focus on rightsizing our inventory to reflect current demand levels and our differentiating advantage of cross-selling inventory among our family of companies, we achieved our companywide inventory turn goal of 4.7 times based on tons for 2020.
In line with historical trends and the cornerstone of our business model...
...s you've heard us say before, approximately 60% to 65% of our SG&A expenses are people related.
When looking at the 11.5% year-over-year decline in same-store SG&A expenses, approximately half of the decrease was people-related as our headcount declined 14% compared to the prior year.
In addition, lower incentive pay due to lower gross profit and pre-tax income levels also contributed to the decline in our compensation costs.
Although we are entering the first quarter of 2021 with a more efficient expense structure because of strong volume and pricing trends, we expect our expenses will increase in the first quarter of 2021 from the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with seasonal trends.
I will address our Q1 2021 outlook for demand and pricing shortly.
For the full year of 2020, our effective income tax rate declined to 22.1% from 24% in 2019 mainly due to our lower pre-tax income level in 2020.
We currently anticipate our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be 24%.
Our strong gross profit margin and effective expense management resulted in $2.01 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020, well above our outlook of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share but down 17.6% from $2.44 in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to reduced demand levels related to the pandemic, with commercial aerospace and energy end market sales being significant contributors to the decline in our sales.
In comparison to the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 was up 7.5% from $1.87 due to improved pricing, strong gross profit margin and recovering demand in most end markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $230.2 million during the fourth quarter due to our profitable operations and effective working capital management, including our focus on rightsizing our inventory levels.
At the end of the year, our total debt outstanding was $1.66 billion, resulting in net debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 1.1 times.
Also at the end of the year, no borrowings were outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
As mentioned last quarter, we significantly strengthened our liquidity position through the successful completion of both our $900 million senior notes offering and amended/restated $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility.
The facility amendment, combined with the proceeds from the notes offering, provides us with ample liquidity and an improved debt maturity profile.
I'll now turn to our outlook.
While macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, favorable market conditions have persisted so far into the first quarter of 2021, with improving demand and additional mill price increases on many carbon and stainless steel products.
This environment allows us to maintain higher gross profit margin levels as we increase our selling price prior to receiving the higher-cost metal in our inventory.
We expect these favorable conditions to continue for the remainder of the first quarter.
As a result of these favorable conditions and the normal seasonal improvement, we estimate our tons sold will be up 10% to 12% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2021 will be up 12% to 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for the first quarter of 2021.
In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter 2020 financial and operational results.
Outstanding execution by all of our employees greatly contributed to our success in 2020.
Their efforts, coupled with our resilient business model and disciplined execution of our strategy, resulted in yet another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow, enabling us to continue supporting our growth and stockholder return priorities.

[/INST] # Despite pandemic challenges, Reliance Steel & Aluminum experienced a solid financial performance in 2020 due to strong operational execution and a resilient business model. The company achieved consecutive years of record gross profit margins at 31.5%, exceeding their sustainable range. Despite a decline in profitability, non-GAAP earnings per share reached $7.71. Reliance maintained healthy cash flow from operations and achieved an inventory turn goal of 4.7 times. Looking ahead to Q1 2021, the company anticipates a 10-12% increase in tons sold and a 12-14% rise in average selling price compared to Q4 2020. This is expected to result in non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.50 for Q1 2021. The company highlighted the importance of its safety program, which resulted in a 23% reduction in the incident rate compared to 2019. Reliance also announced leadership promotions within its finance department.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Leading our call today will be Mike Jackson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Lower, our Chief Financial Officer.
I will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.
AutoNation's third quarter results were the best ever in the Company's history.
We reported an all-time record quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.38, an increase of 102% compared to last year.
In the third quarter, we saw solid demand and a strong pricing environment due to low interest rates and increased interest in vehicle ownership from consumers.
With the higher demand and tight inventory, we adjusted pricing and we were able to improve our margins.
New vehicle inventory remains tight, and we expect it will remain tight into '21.
For the quarter, same store total variable gross profit per vehicle retailed increased $966 or 28% compared to the prior year.
Same-store new vehicle gross profit per vehicle retailed increased $914 or 56%, and same-store used vehicle gross profit per vehicle retail increased $602 or 43% compared to prior year.
With our continue focused on our We will Buy Your Car initiative, we more than doubled the number of vehicles we source compared to last quarter.
Approximately 75% of the pre-owned units retailed are acquired from customers.
For the third quarter, we acquired over 12,000 units, with We'll Buy Your Car, and we're currently sourcing over 4,000 units a month to both supplement our inventory as well as reduce our average used vehicle acquisition cost.
During the third quarter, we continued to leverage our digital capabilities to drive cost reductions and increase efficiency for the business's long-term success.
These efforts, combined with our strong gross profit growth, drove significant SG&A leverage in the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 64.4% in the third quarter of 2020, representing a 800 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2019.
We are committed to operating below 68% SG&A as percent of gross profit on a long-term basis.
Our AutoNation USA stores delivered another profitable quarter.
The continued growth and strong execution at these stores solidified our decision to move forward with the AutoNation USA expansion announced in the second quarter.
We plan to build over 100 AutoNation USA pre-owned stores, with over 50 completed by the end of 2025.
Our plan includes five new AutoNation US stores to be opened by the end of '21.
The AutoNation USA expansion will include extending AutoNation's coast to coast footprint into new markets, with our first new stores to open in Austin and San Antonio in '21.
These stores will continue to leverage the AutoNation brand and its proven processes for competitive advantage.
With this expansion, we have set the long-term goal of selling over 1 million combined new and used retail units per year.
As Mike just highlighted, today we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $212 million or $2.38 per share versus $106 million or $1.18 per share during the third quarter of 2019.
This represents a 102% increase on a per share basis.
Third quarter 2020 adjusted results exclude charges of $28 million after-tax or $0.31 per share associated with the previously announced exit of our aftermarket collision parts business and an unrealized loss of $2 million after-tax or $0.02 per share associated with our equity investment in Vroom.
During the third quarter, same-store revenue was in line with the prior year as increases in used vehicle and customer financial services revenue were offset by declines in sales of new vehicles and customer care.
High supply of new vehicles continued to limit sales volumes, and lower miles driven has limited the pace of customer care recovery.
That said, we continued to execute in an extremely high level during the quarter, with adjusted same store gross profit increasing 13% year-over-year.
Recovering demand, coupled with limited new vehicle supply, drove strong margins, with same store total PVRs up $966 or 28% compared to the prior year.
We were also able to grow our same-store used unit sales, which were up 3% year-over-year as we successfully met strong demand with trade-in volume and inventory sourced through our We'll Buy Your Car program.
Looking ahead, we expect the rebalancing of volume and vehicle margins as inventories recover next year.
Our customer care business also continues to gradually improve.
Adjusted same store customer care gross profit declined 2% in the quarter compared to the prior year.
And, as Mike highlighted, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 64.4% for the third quarter, which represents an 800 basis point improvement compared to the year-ago period.
This impressive performance was driven by the combination of strong cost discipline, leverage of our digital capabilities and healthy vehicle margins.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to maintaining expense discipline, and we continue to target operating below 68% SG&A as a percentage of gross profit.
A decline in floor plan interest expense also benefited our results.
Floor plan interest expense decreased to $11 million compared to $33 million in the third quarter of 2019 due to both lower interest rates and lower average floor plan balances.
This, combined with lower non-vehicle interest expense, a slightly lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, generated adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.38, up 102%.
Moving to the balance sheet and liquidity.
Our cash balance at quarter-end was $351 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $2.4 billion at the end of September.
Our covenant leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA declined to 2.0 times at the end of the third quarter, down from 2.3 times at the end of the second quarter.
Including cash and used floor plan availability, our net leverage ratio was 1.4 times at quarter-end.
Looking ahead, we will continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, utilizing our strong balance sheet, robust cash flow generation and ample liquidity to invest in our business and drive long-term shareholder value.
To this end, today we are providing additional details regarding the expansion of our AutoNation USA footprint, leveraging our established brand and proven success to further penetrate the attractive used vehicle market.
Our AutoNation USA stores require upfront capital investment of about $10 million to $11 million per store, and we expect to build at least 50 additional stores by the end of 2025.
Our AutoNation USA expansion is an exciting growth driver, with each store expected to earn a pre-tax profit of almost $2.5 million annually, once running at initial run rate.
In addition, today we announced that our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization to $500 million.
Throughout this pandemic, AutoNation has remained committed to our associates and communities we live and work in.
2020 marks the fifth anniversary of our DRIVE PINK initiative.
Our associates, our customers and our partners have helped AutoNation reach a tremendous milestone of raising and contributing over $25 million in the fight against cancer.
I'm excited by the opportunities there are in front us.
We have built an industry-leading brand, and we're the largest and most recognized automotive retailer.
We will capitalize on our strategic advantages.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations portion of Medifast's website at www.medifastinc.com.
These statements do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them.
After I've provided some updates on our business performance, Jim will review the Q4 financial results in more detail.
We closed the year on a strong note, with accelerating top line growth over the third quarter.
Revenue increased 55.3% to $264.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, and we continue to execute strongly across all areas of the business.
Earnings per diluted share were $2.36, a 42.2% increase over the prior year period.
However, due to significant differences in tax rates between the periods, we believe income from operations is a better gauge of how we perform from a profitability standpoint.
Jim will discuss our tax rates in more detail when he covers our financial results.
For the fourth quarter, income from operations was $38 million, an increase of 103% versus the same period last year.
Growth was driven by significant year-over-year and sequential improvements in the number of active earning OPTAVIA Coaches, which grew to 44,200 in the fourth quarter, another new record.
Additionally, productivity per active earning coach increased 13.4% to $5,932 during the quarter compared to the prior year period.
Our client community remains strong, and we finished 2020 even better than expected, with successful incentive coach programs in Q4 that position us well for 2021.
The initiatives we've implemented over the past one to two years are delivering consistent, meaningful progress as evidenced by the results we announced today.
The company's focus continues to be supporting our growing community of independent OPTAVIA Coaches as they develop and focus on the four competencies that drive our business success, namely, attracting new clients, supporting clients on the Optimal Weight 5&1 Plan and supporting new coaches and developing coach leaders.
There's an ever-growing number of individuals seeking greater health and wellness, and we remain resolutely focused on targeting those for whom diets have filled and who desire a holistic approach to optimizing their overall health and well-being.
The key insights supporting our sustained growth is that clients do better on their health and wellness journey when they have the support of a coach.
Coach-led model has been clinically proven to be more effective in this regard.
As such, we have combined the most powerful aspects of the direct selling model and direct-to-consumer offerings and created a model that puts the OPTAVIA Coach at the center of helping clients on their health transformation journey with the company providing the distribution infrastructure to supply products directly to the end consumer.
We reach our target audience through the community of OPTAVIA Coaches, who leverage social media channels to relate their success with our proprietary habits of health transformation system and products.
Our vision is to achieve long-term sustainable growth in the mid-teens by penetrating the large and growing addressable market in the United States, continuing our expansion into Asia Pacific markets and developing other large markets throughout the world.
As we continue to grow at scale in both coaches and clients, it's essential that we place sharp focus on building an operational foundation through investments related to organization, technology, digital products, manufacturing and distribution.
This will allow us to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunity.
Consistent with the business and brand strategy that we communicated last quarter, we are moving forward with the sunset of our Medifast Direct channel and Medifast branded products and anticipate this being complete by the end of the second quarter.
By focusing on building capabilities in the areas that matter most to our OPTAVIA Coaches and client-cente...
...r total company consumable units sold in the fourth quarter, up from 79% in the prior year period.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 55.6% to $199.2 million compared to $128.1 million in the prior year period.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 75.2%, a slight increase compared to 75.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
SG&A for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $51.9 million to $161.3 million compared to $109.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.
The increase was primarily due to higher OPTAVIA commissions expense as a result of growth of OPTAVIA sales as well as increased salaries and benefits related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 320 basis points year-over-year to 60.9% versus 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Income from operations increased $19.3 to $38 million from $18.7 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of increased gross profit, partially offset increased SG&A expenses.
Income from operations as a percentage of revenue was 14.3% for the quarter, an increase of 340 basis points from the year-ago period.
The effective tax rate was 26% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 22.4% for the September 30, 2020 year-to-date and compared to a tax benefit of 4.7% in the year-ago period.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the effective tax rate increased 3.8%, which reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.12 due to a discrete tax reserve recorded during the period.
For the full year of 2020, earnings per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.12 due to this discrete tax reserve.
The fourth quarter of 2019 tax benefit reflected the impact of federal tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by increases in the effective state tax rate of 2%.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $28 million or $2.36 per diluted share, based on approximately 11.9 million shares outstanding.
This compares to net income of $19.9 million or $1.66 per diluted share-based on approximately 11.9 million shares outstanding in the prior year.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $174.5 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $92.7 million at December 31, 2019.
The company remains free of interest-bearing debt and believes it is well positioned in this challenging near-term macroeconomic environment.
Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter of $13.4 million or $1.13 per share, which was paid on February 5, 2021.
There was -- there are approximately 2,323,000 shares of common stock remaining under our stock repurchase program.
Consistent with last quarter and due to the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not providing guidance at this time.
We would, however, like to provide you with some insight into the first month of the first quarter and that January's top line year-over-year growth trends are performing consistent with or better than the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter.
If you are attempting to develop a financial model for 2021, I will remind you that Q2 through Q4 2020 have much harder comparables than Q1 2020 from a top line basis.
As Dan discussed, in 2021, we intend to sunset our Medifast Direct channel and Medifast branded products and further invest in our supply chain and technology.
We've also budgeted for a return for in-person convention if safety measures permit.
These decisions and investments will have an impact on our operating margins during 2021 but will enable long-term growth and operating income objectives.
Again, if you are developing a financial model for 2021, these initiatives will increase costs.
In closing, 2020 has been a very robust growth in the face of a very challenging and uncertain environment.
We remain confident in our business model and are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that lie ahead.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 During our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.
And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.
Joe and I will share highlights of our fourth-quarter performance and what we're seeing quarter to date.
And by now, you've heard most others in our space.
And despite the volatility we're all facing, it's good to see the category and the industry moving in the right direction.
You'll hear some of the same themes from us, like progressive improvements throughout the quarter as dining rooms reopened, growth in off-premise and digital expansion.
The biggest difference you'll hear is in our level of performance.
By staying true to our strategy and making aggressive moves to grow the business, our team has navigated this pandemic very well.
Chili's generated significant top-line progress throughout the quarter.
And with our operators' disciplined margin management, we delivered positive cash flow for the quarter, which we used to pay down debt.
Our debt load is now below our pre-pandemic level.
We continued this momentum into July, ending the month with Chili's down just 10.9%.
And in the 84% of our company-owned restaurants with open dining rooms were down just 3.8%, and 36% of our company-owned Chili's restaurants ran positive comp sales for the month.
It wasn't our quick reaction to the crisis that enabled us to deliver these results.
It was our choice to stay true to the strategy we've been working for more than two years.
We had already made significant progress in the areas required to thrive in this environment; off-premise, digital, value and scale.
We didn't have to scramble in the pandemic hit.
We walked into it with seven solid quarters of performance.
All we had to do is stay focused and push the accelerator a little harder.
As a result, we set the bar in casual dining, landing the top spot in sales and traffic for three straight months according to KNAPP-TRACK, and we're poised for continued future success.
You've heard how many restaurant companies are leaning into digital to manage through this crisis.
And while Chili's is no exception, we were leading the way in the digital space long before the pandemic.
Over the past decade, we've made significant investments to build our digital infrastructure, foster connections with guests and enabling us to quickly respond to their evolving dining needs.
Increasing convenience is a big component of how we leverage our digital capability.
We can lean into our 8 million member loyalty database, gain check-level purchasing insight from our tabletop devices and continue to improve our five-Star app with features like one-tap reorder of our guests most frequent-ordered items.
And last year, we integrated DoorDash into our POS system and our e-commerce experience, making it possible to shift our marketing focus from national TV spots to our digital platform, where we continuously test and learn to increase e-commerce conversions.
And as a result, our digital sales of off-premise meals have grown from low teens to more than 50% in the fourth quarter with only a slight dip as dining rooms reopen.
We have also driven frequency -- increased frequency through our takeout and delivery channels at a fraction of the marketing expense.
That's the beauty of a digital strategy that makes dining easier and more convenient for guests.
Because we can meet them where they are, guests use us more.
Finally, here's something you haven't heard from anyone else in our space.
During the last fiscal week or last week of fiscal 2020, we accomplished something no other restaurant company has ever done.
In a single day, we launched It's Just Wings, our first virtual brand, in 1,050 Chili's and Maggiano's across the country.
Sales continue to build every week, and we clearly see the potential to exceed $1...
...to effectively manage expenses in the face of meaningful sales decreases.
Our managers have been efficient in utilizing our scheduling tools to optimize labor hours to fit the current business environment.
Hourly labor and payroll tax have a good degree of variability and were favorable year over year, although total labor, including restaurant management, was unfavorable in the quarter by 260 basis points driven by sales deleverage.
Restaurant expense margin for the quarter increased by 6.2%, again primarily due to sales deleverage.
Despite our operators reducing year-over-year spend in this area by more than $29 million, we recorded meaningful savings in advertising spend, repair and maintenance and supplies related to on-premise dining, a portion of which we believe will be ongoing.
As to cost of sales, we were positive 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to favorable menu mix.
By earlier commented, our restaurant operating margin from the quarter was 6.4%.
However, in conjunction with the progress we made, top line, our operating margin improved through the quarter, increasing to 12.2% for the June period.
Assuming an improving operating environment, we believe we are set up for additional margin improvement as we carry forward identified efficiencies, further open dining room capacity and leverage sales from our virtual brand, It's Just Wings.
Strengthening the balance sheet is an important part of our financial strategy moving forward, and we are currently focusing free cash flow toward debt reduction and liquidity enhancement.
To further enhance our liquidity position, we executed an equity offering in the quarter, raising approximately $139 million, which was used to pay down revolving credit debt.
Our overall total debt balance at fiscal year end was approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of just over $220 million from the end of the third quarter as revolving credit borrowings decreased from $700 million to less than $473 million.
Our liquidity, which we consider to be cash balances and revolving credit availability, now exceeds $575 million.
In addition, we recently completed a 15-month extension of our revolving credit facility now maturing in December 2022.
As sales and cash flows improved, we resumed new restaurant development activity that have been temporarily halted early in the quarter.
We plan to open or relocate four new Chili's restaurants during this current quarter.
Now as to operating guidance, while in past years, we would typically provide annual guidance for Brinker during this earnings call, potential volatility and unknowns of the current operating environment makes that exercise difficult.
Instead, we are providing some limited guidance as to our consolidated performance for the current first quarter and anticipate providing quarterly insights as we move through the year.
For Brinker in the first quarter, we expect consolidated comp store sales to be down in the low to mid-teens range.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share are currently estimated to be a loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.40.
We anticipate positive operating cash flow, and weighted average shares is estimated to be 45 million to 46 million shares.
I would also like to remind everyone that fiscal year 2021 includes a 53rd week, which takes place during the fourth quarter.
Despite the difficulties experienced from this pandemic, our team has risen to the challenge.
Our strategy of focusing on value, convenience and safety has proven to be well received by our guests has given us the ability to outperform our competition and leaves us very well-positioned to continue to take market share as we move through the fiscal year.
I greatly appreciate the hard work and commitment from our team members, especially those on the front line serving our guests each and every day.
I have every confidence we will continue to demonstrate our ability to sustain our progress and return to growth on the top and bottom line for the long term.

[/INST] # Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's, achieved significant progress in the fourth quarter, navigating the pandemic effectively and outperforming competitors. Despite an industry-wide decline, Chili's total sales improved throughout the quarter, showcasing the strength of its value, convenience, and safety-focused strategy. Off-premise sales surged to over 50% in Q4, down only slightly as dining rooms reopened. Digital investments and partnerships with platforms like DoorDash have fueled this growth. Furthermore, Brinker's expansion into virtual brands with the launch of It's Just Wings has generated promising results. Despite sales declines, the company improved its operating margin to 12.2% in June and reduced its debt load by over $220 million, enhancing its financial stability. Brinker anticipates continued improvement in margins as it leverages efficiencies, increases dining capacity, and expands its virtual brand. While the current operating environment remains uncertain, Brinker is providing limited guidance for Q1, indicating comparable store sales will be down in the low to mid-teens range and an adjusted net loss per diluted share between $0.40 to $0.25.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial.
With us on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer.
Calling your attention to slide two.
These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions, including our proposed acquisitions of Charles Stanley PLC and TriState Capital Holdings, and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or general economic conditions.
We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
During today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance.
I want to first, by apologizing, I'll sound like a broken record, using the word record over and over again.
It really was an outstanding year and quarter.
I wish management could take credit, but it is really the work of our advisors and associates that delivered these results.
Their dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing.
We've proven once again that focusing on our time-tested client-first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisors and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions, in this case, in record-setting fashion.
The record results we generated would not have been possible without everyone's contribution.
Starting on slide four with our quarterly results.
The fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts.
The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and record quarterly net income of $429 million, or earnings per diluted share of $2.02, which reflects the impact of the three for two stock split in September.
Excluding the $10 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $437 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equaled $2.06.
The increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees, primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee-based accounts.
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, a very impressive result, especially in the near zero-rate environment and given our strong capital position.
Moving to slide five.
We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially.
We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $627 billion and record financial assets under management of $192 billion.
We continue to focus on supporting advisors and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client-focused culture.
As a result, we had a fantastic year in terms of advisor retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisors to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options.
We ended the quarter with records of 8482 financial advisors, net increases of 243 over the prior period and 69% over the preceding quarter, representing a new record during the fiscal year we recruited financial advisors with approximately $330 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $54 billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels.
Also in the Private Client Group, advisors generated domestic net new assets of approximately $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the fiscal year, a very strong result reflecting our excellent reten...
... an 8% sequential increase, reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet.
Liquidity and capital remained very strong.
The total capital ratio of 26.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6% are both over double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, giving us significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.
You can see that RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, decreasing 26% during the quarter, as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the Charles Stanley acquisition, which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022, for as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions, over the past five quarters.
During the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares, split adjusted for $118 million.
As of October 27th, $632 million remained under the current share repurchase authorization.
Due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank.
The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve.
Criticized loans declined and non-performing assets remain low at just 20 basis points.
The bank loan loss provision of $5 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter.
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held for investment, declined from 1.34% in the preceding quarter to 1.27% at quarter end.
For the corporate portfolios these allowances are higher at around 2.25%.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year, which exceeded many records.
As for our outlook, we are well positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios, quarter-end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial advisor recruiting and investment banking.
In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first quarter with a 2% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts.
Additionally, based on our robust recruiting pipeline, we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platforms.
In the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong and we expect a solid fixed income brokerage results, driven by demand from the depository client segment.
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management.
And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow, as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet.
We will continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through our securities-based loans and mortgages and we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on the long-term and our long-term growth.
And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core businesses continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A.
Our recent announcements to acquire TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time.
We believe these acquisitions stay true to our long-standing criteria, which is a good cultural fit, a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders.
These results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Slides for today's call are posted on our website, and we invite you to follow along.
Participants are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of today, April 29, 2020.
Information on potential factors and risks that could affect our actual results of operations is included in our SEC filings.
The company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to the statements made in today's call other than through filings made concerning this reporting period.
In addition, today's discussion will include references to non-GAAP measures.
Clean Harbors believes that such information provides an additional measurement and consistent historical comparison of its performance.
Starting on Slide 3.
Before discussing our Q1 results, I'd like to address the coronavirus pandemic and how we're responding to it.
Obviously, the outbreak has created a healthcare crisis and caused economic disruption around the globe, and I hope that all of you and your families are staying safe.
Here at Clean Harbors, the safety of our employees is part of our culture and the top priority during this pandemic.
As an essential services provider with teams on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis, we have instituted rigorous safety protocols and work closely with suppliers to make certain we have the necessary equipment to protect our employees.
During the crisis, our workforce has remained out in the field and at our plants, supporting our customers' needs across North America.
The workforce representing critical administrative functions has supported our field teams from home, and the strength of our systems has allowed that transition to be virtually seamless.
We expect the virus to impede our business in the second quarter, particularly within Safety-Kleen.
In addition to limited driving and business activity across North America, Safety-Kleen also had been affected by the sharp downturn and the value of base oil.
In short, we are faced with some difficult near-term market conditions, and we are making -- taking significant actions in response.
Let me touch on some of those actions.
Starting with alignment of our cost structure with the demand environment, we are rightsizing our workforce through furloughs and other reductions and implemented a nonbillable hiring and wage freeze, and we restricted all travel.
We've also gone back to many of our vendors and suppliers to negotiate for savings or improved payment terms.
In addition, we've temporarily shutted half of our rerefining capacity to reflect the current demand for base oil as well as the likelihood of less available used motor oil in Q2 and beyond.
From a liquidity perspective, we drew down $150 million on our revolver to strengthen our balance sheet in the event that crisis worsens.
We have reset our net CapEx spend plans for 2020, and we've lowered our expected spend by more than $50 million to preserve capital and support our free cash flow for the year.
That said, I believe our strong balance sheet leaves us well-positioned to succeed.
Turning to Q1 financials on Slide 4.
Revenues rose 10% from a year ago as both operating segments recorded solid growth.
At the same time, our adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $122.6 million, driven by our mix of high-value waste streams and high utilization, augmented by projects and emergency response work.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 14.3%.
Looking at our segment results, beginning on Slide 5.
Environmental Services revenue grew 11% based by contributions from our facilities network and Field Services group and aided by warmer weather nearly all quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% was driven by business mix, disposal volumes, and emergency response revenue.
Emergency response work totaled $21 million, representing COVID-19 de-con work and a cleanup of a chemical plant fire.
Our disposal facilities saw impressive volumes this quarter...
...the professionals, especially healthcare workers, who put themselves at risk every day to help those in need.
Turning to Slide 9 and our income statement.
As Alan indicated, we delivered record first quarter results.
Revenue grew nearly $78 million, while adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly $21 million.
This reflects the mix of business we achieved in the quarter, project work and favorable weather.
From a gross profit perspective, we saw a sharp increase in both absolute dollars and on a percentage basis due to higher utilization, pricing, and a favorable comp with prior year.
Our gross margin increased by 160 basis points from a year ago.
SG&A expenses were up $14.5 million in the quarter due to the higher revenue, investments in our employees, and some onetime expenses from last year -- onetime items from last year.
As we move forward, we are focusing much of our cost reduction efforts in this area to bring expenses in line with our revenue.
Depreciation and amortization in Q1 was down slightly to $47.5 million.
We completed two small bolt-on acquisitions in 2019, while also divesting several businesses.
For 2020, we expect depreciation and amortization in the range of $285 million to $295 million, which is a little lower than last year.
Income from operations increased 92% to $45.5 million, a first-quarter record, reflecting the combination of our revenue growth and improved gross profit.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.21 in Q1 versus $0.02 a year ago.
Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.28.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10.
As Alan mentioned, we drew $150 million on our revolver during the first quarter which increased our cash and short-term marketable securities to $494.3 million at quarter end.
We saw reasonable AR collection late in March, which led to a healthy cash balance.
Our strong liquidity position further protects our company and adds financial flexibility should we need it.
Our balance sheet remains in good shape.
Current and long-term debt obligations at quarter end rose to $1.7 billion, reflecting the drawdown on our revolver.
Our weighted average cost of debt is now 4.3% with a healthy mix of fixed and variable debt.
Leverage on a net debt basis was 2.2x for the trailing 12 months ended March 31.
Looking at our most recent cash balance from yesterday, our cash remains essentially flat from where we ended Q1.
The team has done a nice job maintaining its focus on collections and managing our spend.
Turning to cash flows on Slide 11.
Cash from operations in Q1 was up slightly at -- to $33.7 million.
CapEx, net of disposals and the purchase of our headquarters, was $59.9 million, up from a year ago, resulting in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of a negative $26.2 million, which is consistent with prior year and our expectations.
For the year, we are now targeting CapEx, net of disposals and purchase of our headquarters in a range of $140 million to $160 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $57.41 a share for a total of $17.3 million.
As Alan mentioned, we'll be cautious in our approach to buybacks until we see evidence that markets are well into their recovery stage.
As Alan also noted, given the uncertain market environment, we would -- we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance.
We're hopeful we'll be able to reinstate guidance with our Q2 earnings announcement, provided markets have stabilized.
In summary, Q1 was a strong quarter, highlighted by several financial records, including adjusted EBITDA.
If it were not for COVID-19, our Q1 results would have positioned us for the fourth straight year of profitable growth.
We have taken significant actions in response to the pandemic and are prepared to take additional steps in the event of a prolonged recovery.
We are focused on things we can control, carefully -- including carefully managing our costs, and pursuing new waste streams to feed our landfills and incinerators.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate you joining us.
First, I'm going to discuss the details behind our third quarter 2020 financial results.
Paul will then comment on the key drivers behind our Q3 results, our outlook for the remainder of 2020 and some general comments on 2021.
I will return to provide our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and an update to the full year 2020 guidance.
We'll then end the call with a question-and-answer session.
In addition, some of our discussion may include non-GAAP financial measures.
Now, let's discuss our third quarter results in which we achieved $0.91 in adjusted earnings per share, a 21% increase over Q3 of 2019 and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase.
These results reflect outperformance in worksite employee growth and pricing relative to our expectations in this uncertain and challenging business environment and upside in our direct cost programs brought about by the dynamics of the pandemic and the structure and ongoing management of these programs.
As for our growth metric, the average number of paid worksite employees in Q3 of 2020 increased by 1.7% sequentially over the Q2 period to 231,750, which was above the high-end of our expected range.
Now you may recall that employee layoffs in our client base drove a 6% reduction in paid worksite employees from the outset of the pandemic in March through the low point in May of this year.
Since then, worksite employees have grown sequentially as employees returning to work and being hired by our clients have outpaced any further layoffs.
Additionally, client retention for both Q2 and Q3 has remained at our historical level of 99% and worksite employees continue to be added from new client sales.
Given these recent positive trends, we now expect paid worksite employees to return to near pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year.
Now let's move on to gross profit, which increased by 8% over Q3 of 2019.
Worksite employee volume and pricing above target levels, combined with upside in our benefit and workers' compensation programs, resulted in significantly higher-than-expected gross profit.
This quarter's benefit costs included some favorable development from Q2, a period of highly unusual claim activity due to the impact of the shutdown orders.
In addition, healthcare utilization began trending toward more normalized levels in the third quarter, although not to the degree of our expectations.
Going forward, we expect further normalization along with the resumption of some deferred care in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, the extent and timing of which is still uncertain.
Our workers' compensation program continues to perform well due to ongoing management of safety practices and claims.
Recent favorable claims development has been associated primarily with periods prior to the pandemic.
And any favorable impact from the reduction in severity of workers' compensation claims associated with the work-from-home status of many of our clients' employees would likely favorably impact our costs in future periods as this claim experience develops over time.
As for our pricing, we charge our clients a comprehensive service fee, inclusive of our HR services and direct cost programs.
We entered 2020 with certain pricing targets set prior to the offset of the pandemic.
And we continued to manage toward these budgeted targets.
As you may recall, certain savings resulting from the disruption caused by the pandemic were negotiated with our vendors and were passed along to our clients in the form of a comprehensive service fee credit as reflected in our Q2 financials.
Now turning to operating expenses, Q3 operating expenses included continued investment in our growth, including costs associated with a 10% increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors.
Other corporate employee head count has remained level over the past three quarters due to the effort and effectiveness of our staff in the face of increased HR service demands fro...
...a better understanding of the factors driving our business model during a pandemic, what does that mean as we look ahead to 2021?
Well, first, it means planning will be dependent on these factors and drivers that are likely to ebb and flow based upon the state of the pandemic.
We will be monitoring these new inputs very closely and we'll finalize a budget later than usual to include the most recent information.
Making estimates at an early stage makes little sense in view of the number and range of possibilities, especially when considering the timing and degree of severity of the pandemic or the actions that may occur to mitigate its effects.
For example, COVID cases are on the rise now, but one or more vaccines may be available by 2021 or an anticipated economic downturn from additional lockdowns may occur.
Additionally, small businesses may be bolstered by additional fiscal stimulus.
What we have learned is there are many moving parts and offsets in our business model in this environment.
If the pandemic intensifies, our direct costs may be below our historical trends as we experienced this year, but growth may suffer.
Conversely, if the pandemic is mitigated or under control, direct costs may be elevated, but growth may accelerate as an offset.
What I do know with the degree of certainty today is, we have an amazing organization with the necessary curiosity and brainpower to provide the agility and capability to manage through a crisis and come out with impressive results for shareholders clients and other stakeholders.
This year we have demonstrated the depth and breadth of our competence and level of care for our clients to execute on matters within our control, along with inspiring ingenuity and resourcefulness to respond to unexpected events.
We are certainly pleased with our 2020 results today and our outlook for the balance of the year and we look ahead with confidence in the future whatever we face next year.
At this time, I'd like to pass the call back to Doug.
Now let me provide our guidance for the fourth quarter and an update for the full year of 2020.
As you're aware, there continues to be uncertainty as to duration and the conditions of the pandemic and the trajectory of the economy.
The current political environment and the timing and details of any further government stimulus add to this uncertainty.
We have taken this into account when providing our financial guidance over the remainder of 2020 and we will be considering these factors in our budgeting process for the upcoming year.
We typically do not provide formal guidance for the upcoming year at this time and, therefore, we'll consider any further developments in these areas and the outcome of our year-end selling and renewal season [Phonetic] when providing 2021 guidance in our next earnings call.
Now based upon the details that Paul just shared, we continue to expect sequential worksite employee growth over the remainder of 2020.
For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting average paid worksite employees in a range of 236,500 to 238,500, a sequential increase of 2% to 3% over Q3 of 2020.
This equates to an expected decrease in average paid worksite employees of only 1% for the full year 2020 in the face of significant challenges for the small business community caused by the pandemic and its impact on the economy.
With an improved outlook for Q4 worksite employee growth, our current pricing strength and a range around expectations in our direct cost programs, particularly our benefits program, we're now forecasting Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $30 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.38.
When combined with our Q3 outperformance, we're raising our full year 2020 earnings guidance and now forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $271 million to $281 million, an increase of 8% to 12% when compared to 2019.
As for full year 2020 adjusted EPS, we are now forecasting a range of $4.35 to $4.53, up from our previous guidance of $3.67 to $4.04.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On our call today, we have Andy Rose, Worthington's President and Chief Executive Officer and Joe Hayek, Worthington's Chief Financial Officer.
Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later on our worthingtonindustries.com website.
Today we'll be sharing our results consistent with our new reporting segments for the first time.
We believe the new structure will provide greater insights into the underlying performance of our businesses.
We had a strong start to our fiscal year, reporting earnings of $2.55 a share in Q1 versus $11.22 in the prior-year quarter.
Excluding restructuring and one-time items, we generated a record $2.46 per share in earnings in Q1 compared to $0.64 in the prior-year quarter.
During the quarter, we recognized a net after-tax restructuring gain of $5 million or $0.09 a share primarily related to the sale of a shuttered facility owned by our WSP joint venture.
That compares to restructuring and impairment charges of $0.16 a share a year ago.
In addition, the prior-year results included a net benefit of $10.74 per share related to our investment in Nikola Corporation.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.1 billion were up significantly compared to $703 million in Q1 of last year.
The improvement was primarily due to higher steel prices combined with increased volumes across most of our segments.
Gross profit for the quarter increased to $219 million from $113 million a year ago and our gross margin increased to 19.7% from 16.1%.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 was a record $196 million, up from $75 million in Q1 of last year and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is now $604 million.
In Steel Processing net sales of $823 million nearly doubled from $431 million in Q1 of last year due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes.
Total shipped tons were up 14% from last year's first quarter when demand was just beginning to recover from COVID-related shutdowns, particularly at our automotive customers.
Direct tons in Q1 were 49% of mix, which was consistent with the prior-year quarter.
We continue to see solid demand across nearly all of our major end markets, including automotive, construction, heavy truck and agriculture.
Despite the solid demand and year-over-year growth, automotive shipments could have been better, if not for the continuing semiconductor-related slowdowns.
Everything we see suggest that while consumer and fleet demand for new cars remain strong, chip shortages will persist for the next several quarters and our automotive demand will be subject to some uncertainty as a result.
The demand is clearly there.
It would likely just take some time for the semiconductor shortage to resolve itself.
Our teams continue to do a terrific job navigating unprecedented market conditions while remaining laser-focused on the needs of our customers.
In the current quarter, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $108 million and adjusted EBIT margin of 13% compared to $14 million and 3% in Q1 of last year.
The large year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased demand, higher spreads and arbitrage gains.
In the quarter, we had pre-tax inventory holding gains estimated to be $47 million or $0.68 per share compared to holding losses of $7 million or $0.09 a share in Q1 of last year.
Based on current steel prices, we expect inventory holding gains again in Q2, but we will also continue to see the impact of the widening scrap gap.
In Consumer Products, net sales in Q1 were $148 million, up 10.6% from the prior-year quarter.
Legacy consumer products revenues were up slightly and the inclusion of sales from GTI, which was acquired in January, drove the balance of the growth.
EBIT for the consumer business was $21 million and EBIT margin was 14%, down from $24 million and 18% in the prior-year quarter.
The decrease in EBIT was due to higher labor and input costs.
Our consumer business has some longer fixed-price contracts with customers, which can create a short-term dra...
...rogen ecosystem and adjacent sustainable energies like compressed natural gas.
With respect to cash flows in our balance sheet, operations used cash of $50 million in the quarter, which was driven by $149 million increase in working capital, primarily associated with higher steel prices along with annual accrued compensation being paid out during the quarter.
Absent further increases in steel prices, we would expect the significant working capital increases to subside in the next quarter or two.
During the quarter, we received $20 million in dividends from our unconsolidated JVs, received $27 million in proceeds from asset sales, completed one acquisition for $105 million, invested $24 million in capital projects, paid $15 million in dividends and spent $61 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our common stock.
Following the Q1 purchases, we have 8.3 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
Looking at our balance sheet and our liquidity position.
Funded debt at quarter end of $706 million was relatively flat sequentially and interest expense of $8 million was in line with the prior-year quarter.
Ended Q1 with $399 million in cash and we continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation focused on growth and on returning capital to shareholders.
Earlier today, the Board declared a $0.28 per share dividend for the quarter, which is payable in December 2021.
It's great to start fiscal '22 with another record performance.
However, the operating environment remains quite challenging with the continued rise in steel prices, supply chain issues in steel and other components and the continuing labor shortage.
Our people continue to showcase their commitment by going the extra mile to ensure that we are working safe and doing their best to meet our customers' needs.
Demand levels are good across almost all of our end markets and backlogs remain at elevated levels.
We continue to raise prices in many of our product lines to offset rising input costs, particularly steel.
Higher working capital needs had a meaningful impact on free cash flow this quarter, but this will reverse if steel prices begin to decline as we expect in coming quarters.
This is the first quarter reporting our three new operating segments, Consumer Products, Building Products, and Sustainable Energy Solutions.
Hopefully you will find, as we believe, that each of these segments is an attractive business with unique advantages and compelling strategies to grow for years to come.
We will continue to leverage our transformation playbook, new product development and innovation and M&A to drive above-market growth and higher returns on capital.
While our innovation and M&A growth initiatives continue across the portfolio, the M&A environment is proving challenging with elevated purchase multiples and difficult earnings analysis due to the unpredictability of the COVID environment.
To the extent we do find compelling targets, our balance sheet remains strong with significant cash and borrowing capacity.
Finally, we just published our second corporate citizenship and sustainability report.
Since our inception, we have worked hard to be a good corporate citizen for all of our constituencies and in our communities, as well as to minimize our environmental footprint.
While we are a relatively clean manufacturing operation overall, in 2012 we started our successful GreenStar initiative that aims to recognize our manufacturing facilities for environmental conservation and stewardship.
In fiscal '21, 64% of our facilities achieved a four or five star performance rating.
We are working toward an even more robust approach to reducing our environmental footprint and expect to have more details in the future regarding our goals.
It is often difficult to follow a record year but we were off to a fast start and our teams remain focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and creating value for our shareholders.
We'll now take any questions.

 Last night we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica McLaughlin will review the business segment and corporate financial details.
I want to begin by recognizing our employees around the world for their continued commitment to the Company, to our customers, and to their community.
Managing through this pandemic has challenged us on every front, and I have never been more proud of our team.
As we manage through this pandemic, we established a set of guiding principles here at Cabot to protect the house first and prepare ourselves to be ready to win as the recovery takes hold.
I believe our performance to date reflects that balance.
For the quarter, total segment EBIT was $84 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.75 on a sequential basis.
This result was driven principally by improved results in Reinforcement Materials, which recovered nicely as demand in our key end markets increased sharply as compared to the third quarter.
Performance Chemicals results also improved in the quarter, as automotive-related demand began a recovery and our self-help initiatives took hold.
In Purification Solutions, we took another step forward in our transformation plan with the sale of our mine and the structuring of a long-term supply agreement for activated carbon with ADES, which better positions us to serve the mercury removal market.
We continued our intense focus on cash generation, delivering $99 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and $248 million for the second half, well ahead of our previously communicated expectation of $200 million of operating cash flow in the back half of the year.
Erica will go into more detail on the segment results a bit later in the call.
I would first like to share my perspective on the full fiscal year 2020 results.
There is no doubt this fiscal 2020 was the year unlike any other we've experienced, as we battle the global public health crisis and the associated economic fallout.
The global pandemic severely affected demand from our key tire and automotive customers, especially in the third fiscal quarter and that impact was reflected in our full-year results.
On the performance front, we delivered adjusted earnings per share $2.08.
While this result was well below prior levels and the earnings potential of the Company, I am very pleased with how we managed through the crisis and I believe the strength of Cabot was revealed.
Our strong balance sheet and cash generation power and our experienced management team allowed us to navigate the pandemic, while remaining focused on our advancing the core strategy.
As you know, our strategy is built on three pillars: first, investing for growth in our core businesses; second, driving application innovation with our customers; and finally, generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization.
In the Reinforcement Materials segment, the team did a great job delivering necessary price increases in our calendar year 2020 customer agreements, implementing new commercial terms to manage feedstock volatility and delivering cost reductions to partially offset the pandemic-driven demand reduction.
In the Performance Chemicals segment, the team was focused on self-help measures and laying the groundwork to restore profitability to historical levels.
In the year, we successfully implemented price increases in specialty carbons to offset the impact of higher MARPOL-related feedstock costs.
The segment also executed on a number of strategic priorities during the year.
We closed on the acquisition of Shenzhen Sanshun Nano, a leading producer of carbo...
...-19, we remain focused on executing our strategy and I would like to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.
First, we will stay close with our customers to support their evolving needs and continue to differentiate Cabot through our product quality, service reliability and commitment to sustainability.
Second, we will continue to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, particularly energy materials, E2C and inkjet for packaging.
We are excited about the growth potential of these businesses and we have sustained our investment throughout this downturn so that we can capitalize on their full potential in the coming years.
Third, we'll continue to drive efficiency and optimization across our operation.
During fiscal year '20, we established a global business services organization to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of those processes that power our way of doing business.
We will further leverage this investment through the deployment of digital tools to simplify and automate our ways of working and I'm excited about the potential here to complement our strategic growth efforts.
Fourth, the role of bolt-on M&A in our existing businesses remains an important part of our growth story.
Over the past few years, we have made very important strategic acquisitions in our core spaces, including extending our geographic presence in our specialty compounds business through acquisitions in Canada and Southeast Asia, and by expanding our product offering in energy materials to include CNTs through our acquisition of Sanshun.
We will continue to look for opportunities to build out our pipeline and execute on opportunities of these types.
Finally, in an uncertain and dynamic environment, it will be critical that we keep tight control of costs and working capital in 2021.
We feel good about the momentum into fiscal year '21, but we must remain vigilant on cost and working capital.
I hope this gives you some color on our 2021 priorities and how they will help Cabot to extend our leadership position.
I will close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook as we start fiscal year '21.
Clearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter of 2020 and we feel very good about how the first quarter is shaping up.
As Erica discussed, we expect a material step up in the Performance Chemicals segment and further strengthening in Reinforcement Materials, where performance is being driven by strong Asian spot pricing, the feedstock costs rise there and volume strength driven by stronger underlying demand and some level of inventory replenishments.
Based on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90.
On the cash side, we anticipate that operating cash flow will be strong as year-over-year earnings levels improve in fiscal '21, even though absolute net working capital levels will increase aligned with higher volumes.
Looking to the full-year of fiscal '21, there is still uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic that impacts our longer-term visibility.
Our results will be influenced by the sustainability of the economic recovery, the outcome of our tire customer agreements, the pace of costs returning to the business to support the recovery and how we manage pricing in this dynamic environment.
As the year unfolds, we will be managing these factors carefully to match the dynamic environment.
Overall, I feel very good about the way the team has performed and the progress we have made in this unprecedented environment.
I'm optimistic about the first quarter and remain confident that the team will respond to any challenges we may face throughout the year.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are robust, our market positions in global presence is unmatched, and our balance sheet and liquidity provide strength and flexibility.
I am confident in our growth opportunities ahead and our ability to deliver on our strategic objectives.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Well, we had an exciting quarter.
I'm not sure how else to describe it.
Among other accomplishments, we celebrated the addition of store 2000 to our portfolio.
We were recognized by Inside Self-Storage as the Best Third-Party Management company in the industry, and we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history.
Same-store occupancy once again reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower-than-historic levels.
Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power.
Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels.
In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continued to be lifted throughout the country.
Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter.
We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt.
These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4%, a 480 basis point acceleration from Q2.
And same-store NOI growth of 27.8%, an acceleration of 760 basis points.
In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%.
Turning to external growth.
The acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view.
Our investment team has never been busier, and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner.
While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites, the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year.
Also, our approach has resulted in better-than-market average yields.
But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume, and we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment.
We continue to look at all material transactions in the market and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores.
Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties.
It is worth mentioning that oftentimes, we are the buyer of these properties, and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another.
In the quarter, we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September.
Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint.
While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak.
Our revised guidance now assumes a 200 basis point moderation which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020.
We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.
As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.85 per share, a year-over-year increase of 41.2%.
Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees.
As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend.
We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals.
Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we've felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office.
Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time to fill -- and longer time required to fill vacant positions.
We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022 as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry.
This will also impact our G&A expense.
In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering.
And we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%.
We also refiled our ATM in the quarter, and we have $800 million in availability.
Our access to capital has never been stronger.
And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced.
Our quarter end net debt to EBITDA was 4.5 times, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions.
We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%.
Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to 0%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%.
These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense.
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share.
Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11, even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline.
We are excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio.
As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made.
I hope you and your families are all well.
2020 will be a year not soon forgotten.
The health and economic impacts from COVID-19 have been unprecedented.
Add to this, the social and political unrest our country has experienced, and 2020 will no doubt go down as one of the most historic and difficult years in our lifetime.
While the issues facing an open-air shopping center REIT are small in comparison to 2020's broader challenges, I am proud of RPT's response and execution this past year.
From our tenant assistance program and charitable donations to our property-level safety and curbside pickup initiatives, RPT demonstrated its commitment to our purpose of turning commercial ground into common ground.
We also took swift and decisive actions to shore up our liquidity and preserve our access to capital with our first-time investment-grade credit rating from Fitch.
In addition, I was very pleased with the team's tireless effort in pursuit of rent collections, which improved to 91% in the fourth quarter.
Following the payoff of our remaining $100 million balance on our revolver, we have over $100 million of cash and a fully undrawn $350 million revolver and are now positioned to take full advantage of our unique and valuable partnership with GIC and opportunistically execute on our external growth plans.
We continue to track a healthy pipeline of acquisitions and have started to see some improvement in activity in recent weeks.
Let me just reemphasize that the underlying real estate is the primary driver of our acquisition strategy.
What we then look for is growth.
That could come in a variety of ways from under-market rents and mismanaged assets to redevelopment opportunities.
It could also come in a variety of different retail formats from grocery anchored, lifestyle centers, power centers to community centers.
As previously reported, we had five deals in our GIC venture either signed or in negotiations in February of 2020.
Once the pandemic hit, we and our partners made the decision to get out of all of them.
We are now fortunate to have the liquidity and the deep pipeline within our core markets and believe the widening value gap between property types, tenant categories and markets is creating differentiated opportunities that we hope to take advantage of in 2021.
One thing we pride ourselves on is skating to where the puck is going, not to where it's been.
Last year, we entered the Austin market with our off-market acquisitions of Lakehills Plaza.
Since our acquisition, Tesla announced a new $1.1 billion assembly plant.
Google, Oracle and Digital Realty, to name a few, each announced relocation or expansion plans to Austin.
And Barshop & Oles announced plans for a new $1 billion mixed-use development directly across the highway from our property.
It's been a little over a year since our acquisition.
And we are more convinced than ever about this dynamic market that truly represents where the puck is going.
From a leasing perspective, we continue to make good progress on our grocery negotiations and are also in negotiations with tenant categories such as home improvement, wholesale club stores, off-price, QSR and medical-use tenants.
This quarter, we signed a total of 120,000 square feet, up 10% year-over-year.
Notable signings this quarter included two new deals with a modern, tech-enabled healthcare provider.
These deals exemplify our enhanced focus on health and wellness tenants.
We also have good activity on the two Stein Mart boxes that we took back in the quarter, where we have an opportunity to significantly improve the tenancies of both boxes.
At under $11.50 of ABR per square foot, we also see a solid mark-to-market opportunity upon release of these spaces.
One Stein Mart box is already in lease and the other has multiple LOIs that are being negotiated with some very strong national brands.
...
...important to note that the releasing spread is just one factor in the organic growth profile.
The other factor that we heavily weigh in lease negotiations are the annual contractual rent increases.
The leases that we signed during the quarter, annual contractual rent increases, were about 150 basis points, which is a key contributor to creating a long-term sustainable NOI growth profile.
As we have noted consistently, we expect some volatility in our quarterly statistics given the size of our portfolio but see a continued mark-to-market opportunity as we cycle legacy leases over the next few years.
And as Brian noted in his remarks regarding dividend policy, we have placed a premium on free cash flow, allowing us to utilize our cheapest form of capital to take advantage of these opportunities as we restabilize our portfolio to pre-COVID leased rate levels of nearly 95%.
We were very pleased with our first-ever investment-grade credit rating from Fitch, highlighting our balance sheet strength and flexibility.
Couple this distinction with an increased confidence in our business and in our access to low-cost debt capital, we no longer felt the need to maintain an outsized cash balance and repaid the remaining revolver balance of $100 million last week.
We will also continue to mine our portfolio for additional capital-raising opportunities to further bolster our liquidity position and fuel our external growth plans.
We ended the fourth quarter with trailing 12-month net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 7.4 times, up slightly from 7.2 times last quarter as another COVID-impacted quarter entered the calculation.
We remain committed to bringing leverage into our long-term target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times and expect to see steady improvement in EBITDA as we return to more normalized reserve levels and as our signed leasing backlog begins to kick in over the course of 2021.
We are establishing 2021 operating FFO per share guidance of $0.77 to $0.87, which is an expected improvement over the annualized 2020 fourth quarter operating FFO per share of $0.72.
Key drivers from there are a favorable impact of $0.03 from interest expense, primarily due to the repayment of our revolving line of credit, and $0.02 from our signed not open backlog that we expect the vast majority to open ratably in 2021.
Further upside is based on favorable bad debt reserves, which we expect to be heavily influenced by the reopening of our theaters, which is a function of the trajectory of the vaccine rollout and movie productions.
While our assumption is that these circumstances will improve over the course of '21, we felt establishing a wider range was appropriate given the potential varying outcomes for our theater exposure, which represent about $0.10 per share of earnings.
If our theaters remain closed and do not pay their contractual rent, our operating FFO could be at the low end of the range.
And conversely, if they are open and paying, we should be near the high end, all else equal.
It is important to note that our guidance does not include the net impact of changes to 2020 estimates for bad debt and straight-line rent reserves.
Also, while acquisitions are not assumed in our guidance range, we intend to redeploy $100 million of cash on the balance sheet into opportunistic acquisitions that meet our strict underwriting standards, representing upside to our range.
While the near-term COVID trajectory remains uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is now behind us.
As we move closer to a more normalized environment and given the conflicting impacts of permanent move-outs and rent collection statistics, we hope to return our focus to more traditional measures of REIT operating performance like occupancy, rent spreads and same-property NOI growth.
As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our disclosures, this quarter we added a net asset value page to our supplemental on page 14 to help facilitate your analysis of our real estate value.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On the call today are Tim Crew, Chief Executive Officer; John Kozlowski, the company's Chief Financial Officer, Maureen Cavanaugh, our Chief Commercial Operations Officer; and Steve Lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives.
A playback will be available for at least three months on Lannett's website.
In a moment, Tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and initiatives.
Then John will discuss the financial results in more detail.
We hope you remain safe and well as we all manage through the persistency of the pandemic.
I'll start today reviewing some of the highlights of the past year that are relevant to our future before turning to the key elements we see in that future.
First and foremost, in 2021, we continued to launch products and build our future portfolio.
We launched about a dozen new products, highlighted by a few significant contributors, including Levothyroxine tablets, Levothyroxine capsules and Clarithromycin.
The products we launched last year added new revenue streams and further diversified offerings, reducing our exposure and reliance on key products.
We also grew our base product pipeline with continued investment in a robust internal product development program.
For example, our recent Mycophenolate approval was achieved in just under 10 months, the third such product we developed to achieve so called first cycle approval in the past few years.
We have made great strides in our internal efforts including significant changes to our portfolio selection.
Such changes take time to be fully reflected in our financials, but we believe meaningful value is being built.
Further, we are working on our existing strategic alliance partners to expand our agreements to include new products.
For example, this past year Insulin Aspart was added to our HEC agreement, and more recently, generic Spiriva, Handihaler was added to our Respirent agreements.
Together these products represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few competitors expected.
We also formed a new strategic alliance partnership to launch Sevoflurane, a product with relatively few competitors and a market size of about $190 million based on IQVIA data.
We look to launch Sevoflurane in the back half of the fiscal year.
The second key accomplishment last year was even while we launched new products and grew our pipeline, we also maintained firm control over expenses and exhibited operating discipline.
We implemented and completed the cost reduction plan that included consolidating our R&D functions to a single location and lowered operating costs by approximately $15 million annually.
The third key accomplishment was that we significantly improved our capital structure.
This last year, we paid off our Term A loans with cash on hand and later successfully completed a full refinancing transaction of the Term B loans.
The refinancing transaction as we have often highlighted was significant for several reasons.
First, we extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more meaningful pipeline assets are expected to launch and contributed to a reduction in our debt.
Second, we upsize our credit facility and substantially freed up cash flow, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity.
Third, the new debt does not have any leverage covenants.
Fourth, as a result of this refinancing, in combination with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position.
Thus, we now have more ready resources to invest in growth opportunities.
Of course, another accomplishment to note was in our teams, particularly in our plants and labs, showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic and maintained a reliable supply of our affordable medicines.
This, of course, despite all the extra challenges we have been doing so this past year.
We are quite proud of all of these accomplishments.
Of course, there are ...
... a high quality and reliable manufacturer.
We point out these characteristics that make Lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers think of Lannett when they consider Made in America in various ESG related initiatives.
To sum-up today's remarks, our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 were significant.
We faced head on a highly competitive market environment.
We launched new products and made important advances in the development of key products in our pipeline.
We expanded existing agreements that added three large durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises.
We refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extended our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our large pipeline assets.
We continue to believe that the exciting products in our advancing and expanding pipeline still have the potential to transform our firm into $1 billion company by 2025.
I'll begin with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
For the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared with $137.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year.
Gross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared with $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year fourth quarter.
R&D expenses declined to $6.0 million from $6.6 million.
SG&A expenses declined to $15.5 million from $15.6 million.
Operating income was $4.9 million, compared with $26.7 million.
Interest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter.
Net loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share versus net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million.
Turning to our balance sheet.
At June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million at March 31.
Cash increased during the fourth quarter due to a few factors.
First, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt.
Second, relates to working capital improvements that continued from the third quarter.
And the third, was the receipt of income tax refunds.
Looking ahead, we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity.
Accordingly, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position throughout the year and end fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 plus million.
As for our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which today we have not drawn upon.
Turning to our guidance, which as Tim mentioned earlier, does not include sales of generic ADVAIR DISKUS or zolmitriptan.
For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $400 million to $440 million, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 23% to 25%, adjusted R&D expense in the range of $26 million to $29 million, adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $58 million to $61 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $55 million, and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $12 million to $18 million.
Regarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA in Q1 to be lower than Q4, ramping up slightly in Q2 and continue to ramp-up more in the second half of fiscal 2022.
The increase is related to expected new product launches.
Gross margin in the first half of the fiscal year to be in the lower range of our outlook, ramping up to the upper end of the range in the second half of fiscal 2022 and operating expenses to remain relatively consistent throughout the year, though, we expect Q1 to be slightly higher than the other quarters, as they include certain compensation related expenses that are only recorded at the beginning of our fiscal year.
With that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have.

I'm also proud to say that this quarter, we completed the rollout of our omnichannel offerings.
This has been years in the making and has required a remarkable level of focus and change across our entire organization.
During this time, we have evolved nearly every aspect of our business.
From how we support and interact with our customers to how we structure our staffing to how we buy, sell and deliver cars.
Our omnichannel experience is built to provide a personalized multichannel experience that empowers customers to buy a car on their terms.
It is designed as a world-class in-store experience, a world-class online experience and a seamless integration of the two, giving us the largest addressable market within the used car industry.
No other used car retailer is in the position to deliver this iconic customer experience the way we can.
Now turning to our results.
For the second quarter, we achieved a 3.9% increase in total used units sold and the used unit comp growth of 1.2%.
In June, we experienced a high single-digit negative used unit comp which was more than offset by positive comps in both July and August.
The improvement in sales was the result of a variety of factors, including solid execution in operations, finance and marketing in addition to a strengthening used car sales environment.
In the quarter, we saw solid growth in web traffic, averaging approximately 29 million visits per month to carmax.com.
During the second quarter, our saleable inventory was below our targeted level as we saw a rapid increase in demand from the first quarter.
For the past three months, our teams have done a phenomenal job buying and producing vehicles at record levels, increasing salable inventory by more than 50% in the quarter.
Today, I'm pleased to report that we've successfully ramped inventory to targeted levels, providing customers with more than 55,000 vehicles nationwide, the largest of any used car retailer.
We offer a broad selection of inventory with a focus on zero to 10-year-old vehicles.
This quarter, we saw five to 10-year-old vehicles increased to 27% compared with 22% last year as a percentage of our sales mix, reflecting customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles.
Gross profit per used unit for the quarter was $2,214 up $31 per unit from a year ago.
For wholesale, performance was supported by strong appreciation in the market and excellent execution by our teams.
Volume was up 5.1%, driven by one more auction date in the quarter and a record buy rate.
We also achieved record gross profit per wholesale unit of $1,086 in the quarter, the result of strong appreciation and operational execution.
By the end of the quarter, we saw depreciation return to the marketplace.
As a reminder, all auctions continue to run virtually throughout the quarter.
As our results show, we have achieved a substantial recovery in our business.
Over the past several months, our talented workforce has demonstrated incredible agility and ability to drive change in one of the most challenging environments that we've ever faced.
We are proud to say that by the end of July, our team was back together again, and we no longer had associates on furlough.
We are now actively hiring across the country as we continue to grow our core business, enhance our omnichannel o...
...combine them with the information in our customers' data mark, and provide a truly personalized experience that is much more effective in meeting the customer needs and improving our conversion rates.
We believe that we have an unmatched opportunity to create a superior customer experience by leveraging our data and technology advantages, both online and in-store.
Digital merchandising is another area of continuous improvement.
By the end of this year, we will have rolled out approximately 95% of our photo studios, which provide a more immersive experience with high-quality photos, 360-degree interior and exterior views, feature scoring hotspots and reconditioning with new part call outs.
We also continue to upgrade content on our website to help customers fully research a vehicle without ever having to leave carmax.com.
All this provides our customers more confidence as they progress online.
The other omni area of focus that I will highlight is our customer hub, which provides customers a means to track the progress they have made, both online and in-person.
It is here that customers can manage certain aspects of their car-buying journey.
They can book mark and save vehicles they've selected online.
They can submit financing pre-approval and compare their financing options.
They can also get an estimate or an actual offer for their trade-in.
And finally, they can complete the checkout process in the hub for the car they selected online or in-store and choose if they want a home delivery or a curbside pickup.
Our omnichannel experience has been well received.
Approximately 70% of our customers interacted with our CECs this quarter.
Additionally, approximately 50% of our customers progressed their sale remotely, up from about 42% pre-COVID.
Most of these customers still chose to come to the store to complete their transaction, and approximately 30% of our customers still opted for an in-store experience only.
Again, the advantage of our business model is that customers have the choice as to how they progress their experience.
This is what gives us the largest addressable market.
We are focused on driving customer engagement strategies to ensure we continue to remain top of mind and the first choice for car buyers and sellers.
We launched a national marketing campaign last year, which has reinforced the strength of our brand and established a solid platform for future campaigns.
We've now introduced our omnichannel offering nationwide.
Accordingly, as we go forward, our messaging will focus on clearly differentiating our brand from digital-only and traditional dealer brands by demonstrating the benefits of our omnichannel offering.
Additionally, we will be increasing our year-over-year marketing spend in the back half of the year to expand our teams and investments in areas such as SEO, SEM, messaging, content and social.
Our goal is to drive high ROI customers to our digital properties, while empowering us to create multichannel personalized campaigns.
We have a unique retail customer experience that we are continuing to evolve to exceed our customers' expectations.
At the same time, we are identifying and investing in new initiatives that we believe will also be solid contributors to our earnings growth.
All of this leads to a very exciting future, but none of this would be possible without our great associates.
I want to recognize all of them and the high-performance culture they maintain here at CarMax, a culture that values all individuals and perspectives.
Over the past several years, we have taken on the largest transformation in our company history, evolving nearly every aspect of our business.
We also accomplished all these great results in one of the most challenging environments we've ever faced.
And through it all, our associates have continued to live our values every day by putting people first and taking care of each other.
I am very proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On the call today, we have Brian Casey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Forbes, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you're keeping safe in what's a difficult circumstances for all of us.
As always, I'll discuss our quarterly earnings and we'll cover the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our company.
Looking back, the past quarter was one for the record books.
The global COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, sending liquidity and returns sharply lower with much of the pain felt in March.
The S&P 500 suffered the worst first quarter performance since 1928 while global equity and fixed income markets were equally battered.
Investors remain focused on when the number of new cases of the virus may peak for clues about the future, though the path to economic recovery is anything but clear.
In our U.S. Value Equity products, the unprecedented sell-off in equities was large in absolute terms, but higher quality companies up and down the market cap spectrum were the best relative performers.
Every single one of our U.S. Value strategies outperformed its passive benchmark, as the benefits of active management were clearly evident.
Our flagship LargeCap Value strategy showed resilience during the sell-off, capturing only about 85% of the downside and posting nearly 400 basis points of outperformance relative to the Russell 1000 Value Index.
LargeCap Value is ahead of the benchmark over multiple time periods, and its ranking among institutional LargeCap Value peers remains strong.
Through the first quarter, our LargeCap Value strategy was in the top-decile for the trailing three-year period and in the top-quartile for the trailing one-, five- and seven-year periods.
Our LargeCap Select strategy also finished the quarter ahead of the Russell 1000 Value benchmark and it now possesses a ranking in the top-decile among institutional peers in the eVestment large-cap value manager universe for the trailing three-year time period.
Our SMidCap strategy also beat the Russell 2500 Value Index by over 400 basis points and now has returns above the benchmark in most trailing year periods.
Rankings among institutional peers were also strong.
The strategy now ranks in the top half ranking for the trailing five and seven years and the top-quartile for the trailing one- and three-year time periods.
Our portfolio managers have worked hard to improve the track record and we are seeing growing interest in the strategy from the institutional channel.
SmallCap was the hardest hit sector of our U.S. Value strategies, but our portfolio managers continue to focus on finding companies with strong fundamental qualities and finished the quarter ahead of the Russell 2000 Value benchmark by approximately 260 basis points.
Our institutional strategy also maintained attractive peer rankings with a top one-third placement for the quarter and trailing one-year time period.
SmallCap's longer-term tracker record places it in the top-decile over the trailing seven-, 10- and since inception time periods.
As we work through the economic situation created by the COVID-19, market volatility will create an attractive investment opportunity for high-conviction, actively managed portfolios centered around quality and value.
While the value style, which emphasizes companies priced at low valuation levels has historically performed best coming out of a recession, today, many companies have higher debt levels than in past cycles and may find themselves with limited options.
Financial distress is particularly acute in the energy sector and we're already seeing several companies filing for bankruptcy protection.
As the market pays more attention at balance sheets, the cream will rise to the top and the debt-laden companies of the past cycle will falter.
Our investment process has always incorporated a fundamental understanding of a candidate's balance sheet and that has historically served our clients well in times of stress.
Many index funds hold more than one...
...educe our cost structure.
To-date, we've identified over 750,000 of cost reductions that are being implemented or in process over the balance of the year.
We've been researching the outsourcing of trading for the past six months and recently made the decision to move forward with this project.
We will move to an outsourced trading model later this summer and expect to save over $1 million per year beginning in 2021.
We will continue to utilize technology to define our future state to be more efficient wherever possible.
We will close or eliminate commercially unviable funds and put only our best products and people on the field.
Although, financial performance over the last year has been disappointing, we continue to execute on numerous initiatives to strengthen our foundation for the future.
Our partnership with InvestCloud continues to reap operational benefits.
The U.S. Value and Multi-Asset strategies are delivering alpha and we have commitments from private wealth clients for a new credit opportunities fund that we launched a few weeks ago.
We expect industrywide disruption to continue and the steps we've taken to reinvent ourselves have placed us in a position to survive and grow.
Finally, I want to emphasize that the health and safety of our employees and their families is our first priority.
All our employees are well, working remotely and completing their work in an efficient manner.
We understand that we have a business to run and we're working hard to balance the company's needs with the employees' personal needs.
And I'm really proud of everyone at Westwood and how well everyone is working together, yet apart, during this difficult time.
Our customers still have goals and priorities and we will continue to service them to the best of our ability.
Today, we reported total revenues of $16.7 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $23.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.
The decrease from the fourth quarter and the prior year's first quarter was primarily due to lower average assets under management.
First quarter net income was $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $2.5 million or $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The decrease primarily related to lower total revenues and unrealized losses on private investments, partially offset by lower operating expenses and income taxes.
Economic earnings, a non-GAAP metric, were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share in the current quarter versus $5.4 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
First quarter net income of $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $0.4 million or $0.05 per share in the prior year's first quarter.
The increase primarily related to lower operating expenses, particularly employee compensation and benefits, foreign currency transaction gains and income taxes, partially offset by lower revenues and unrealized losses on private investments.
Economic earnings for the quarter were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share compared to $4.1 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2019.
Firmwide assets under management totaled $11.6 billion at quarter end and consisted of institutional assets of $6.3 billion or 55% of the total, wealth management assets of $3.8 billion or 33% of the total and mutual fund assets of $1.5 billion or 12% of the total.
Over the quarter, we experienced market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $0.6 billion.
Our financial position continues to be very solid with cash and short-term investments at quarter end totaling $82.4 million and a debt free balance sheet.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 272,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4.9 million.
In April, we repurchased an additional 407,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.1 million.
This completed the amount authorized under our share repurchase program.
That brings our prepared comments to a close.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Ian Hudson, the Company's Chief Financial Officer.
Also with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
These documents are available on our website.
In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.
I'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our first quarter results, before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide her perspective on current market conditions, our progress against strategic initiatives, and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter with record orders and operating results, exceeding our expectations despite ongoing pandemic related disruptions.
We also had to navigate through the February ice storms in the south, which caused us to temporarily close our facilities in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.
Fortunately, we did not experience any significant damage, but we did lose several days of production.
Despite these challenges, the teams recovered well with both groups delivering adjusted EBITDA margins at or above levels achieved in the first quarter of last year.
That feed is even more impressive, given the strength of the prior year quarter, which included record production at our largest facility and minimal impact from the pandemic.
Turning now to the numbers where consolidated net sales for the quarter were $279 million compared to $286 million last year.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $27.8 million compared to $32.3 million last year.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $41.2 million compared to $43.9 million last year.
That translates to a margin of 14.8% in Q1 this year compared to 15.3% last year.
Net income for the quarter was $22.2 million compared to $23.4 million last year.
That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.36 per share compared to $0.38 per share last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38 per share, compared to $0.39 per share last year.
Order intake for the quarter was outstanding with orders of $384 million represent -- representing our highest quarterly orders on record and an increase of $80 million or 26% compared to Q1 last year.
Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter also set a new company record at $410 million that represents an increase of $9 million compared to Q1 last year and an increase of $106 million or 35% from the end of 2020.
In terms of our group results, ESG net sales for the quarter were $228 million compared to $233 million last year.
ESG's operating income for the quarter was $27.1 million compared to $29.4 million last year.
ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.3 million compared to $40 million in the prior year.
That translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% in line with last year.
EFC reported orders of $324 million in Q1 this year, an improvement of $87 million or 37% compared to last year.
SSG's net sales for the quarter were $51 million this year compared to $53 million last year.
Operating income for the quarter was $7.2 million dollars compared to $7.4 million last year.
SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was consistent with the prior year at around $8.2 million while its adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved to 16.2% of 80 basis points from Q1 last year.
SSG's orders for the quarter was $60 million compared to $66 million last year.
Corporate operating expenses for the quarter was $6.5 million, up from $4.5 million last year.
The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable year-over-year variance of $2.6 million associated with changes in mark-to-market adjustments of post-retirement reserves.
These market based adjustments benefited our earnings in Q1 last year by approximately $0.02 per share but were unfavorable in Q1 this year.
Turning now to the consolidated income statement where the decrease in sales contributed to a $6 million reduction in gross profit.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.7% compared to ...
...under way, and while it is still early days, OSW was off to a solid start in the first quarter.
Our M&A pipeline has been active to say the least.
And it's been exciting to be back on the road visiting potential targets.
As Ian noted in his comments, our financial position and liquidity are strong, enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions and there are a number of M&A opportunities our teams are currently reviewing.
We have also continued to make significant investments in our existing plans to add capacity to support our long-term growth and to gain operational efficiencies through automation.
As we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint, we are evaluating our long-term strategy with respect to our Elgin and University Park production facilities in Illinois.
Both properties are currently leased at above market rates with lease terms ending in 2023.
We are currently looking at opportunities and alternative facilities in the surrounding areas as we proactively plan for a potential move.
The American rescue plan, COVID release package, includes approximately 1.9 trillion of economic stimulus with approximately $350 billion going to state, local and territorial governments with the goal of keeping frontline workers employed, distributing the vaccine, increasing testing, reopening schools, and maintaining essential services.
We are actively educating our dealer channel about the stimulus program and have distributed the latest estimate allocation of the $350 billion of state and local government support by jurisdiction to our dealer channel to share with its customer base.
As a provider of equipment for -- used for essential services like sewer kitting and street sweeping, Federal Signal stands to benefit meaningfully from additional aid that may be provided to state local sources for these purposes.
As was evident with our first-quarter order intake, our dealer partners remain optimistic about market conditions in 2021, noting that both corporate and sales tax collections appear to have held up better than originally anticipated, which should add stability to their revenue sources.
We expect that our long-term infrastructure bill will provide visibility for project planning and could see capital equipment demand increases in areas such as roads, bridges, broadband, Clean Energy and public transportation buildup.
We anticipate that this will provide benefits for the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, Safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners and street sweepers.
We have positioned Federal Signal in a manner in which we fully participate in the post-pandemic recovery by increasing capacity within our facilities, reducing lead times to a level where we can better respond to customer needs, investing in new product development and gaining market share.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year.
Orders thus far this year have exceeded our expectations, fueled by a combination of new product launches ongoing execution against our strategic initiatives and strong recovery in our end markets.
With certain chassis manufacturers temporarily impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, we are currently encountering some short-term production challenges at our largest facility.
Our teams are working diligently to navigate through this disruption as they have in the past when faced with similar situation.
After factoring in the impact expected over the next couple of months, at this time, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year of $1.73 to $1.85.
With our recently completed capacity expansion at several facilities, we are well positioned once the current chassis uncertainty eases.
Demand for our products is at an all-time high, with the recent federal stimulus, and the possibility of infrastructure investment offering potential for further momentum, which we have not factored into our current outlook.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.
Actual results could differ materially from these statements.
I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full-year performance as well as our 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021.
We will then open it up for Q&A.
As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.
We finished 2020 in very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis.
Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance.
For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth, organic growth in all four of our categories: oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well.
Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement.
We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange.
Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter.
Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in prices.
The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind.
In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 100 basis points year over year and a base business basis where we were up 90 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin while raw materials were a 320 basis-point headwind driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 280 basis-point benefit.
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year.
On the base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis.
This was primarily driven by a 210 basis-point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation, and e-commerce.
Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S., and investments behind growth and innovation.
For the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points driven primarily by a 100 basis-point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics cost.
For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year over year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis.
Our earnings per share was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis.
For the full year, our earnings per share growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.
We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year.
As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Filorga transaction with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.
A few comments on our divisional performance.
North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic.
We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our skin health businesses in the quarter.
Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales.
N...
...evenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment.
For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management.
As I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products.
Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems, and innovation for new channels, all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently.
And given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth.
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth.
We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line.
We need to deliver profitable growth.
You can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings-per-share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization.
We're doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focus on all cost elements throughout the income statement.
Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in the transformation capabilities that we're deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.
The third reason is that we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people.
As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched.
In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth.
To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation, like the Optic White pen, the Miracle Repair serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities.
And all this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales.
And lastly, it's building out the right team.
You need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization.
We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation.
Like our transition SAP S/4HANA that's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions.
We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed, and capability building our ability now to develop applications must faster and realize the value of those applications much faster; and with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead.
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process.
You will remember that was called CBP that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management.
So to sum it up, when I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining us today are Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Holdings; and Jose Montero, our CFO.
First, Pedro will start by going over our third quarter highlights, followed by Jose, who will discuss our financial results.
Copa Holdings' financial reports have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
In today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures.
Many of these are discussed in our annual report filed with the SEC.
To them, as always, my utmost respect and admiration.
The increasing vaccination rates and reduced travel restrictions in Latin America are positively affecting air travel demand in the region, enabling us to grow capacity quarter-over-quarter, while improving load factors.
Since restarting operations in Q3 2020, we have increased flight from almost zero to nearly 70% of our pre-pandemic capacity in Q3 2021.
Going forward, we expect further relaxation of travel restrictions and a continued demand recovery, which should allow us to deploy additional capacity in the fourth quarter and 2022.
But of course, COVID has not gone away and we've seen in other parts of the world, additional waves of the virus could affect demand in the future.
So, we will remain focused and flexible in terms of capacity, adjusting our plans as needed.
Now, I'll highlight some of our third quarter results.
In terms of capacity, we reached almost 70% of third quarter 2019 ASMs compared to 48% of 2019 capacity in the second quarter.
Load factor came in at 79%, an improvement of two percentage points compared to the second quarter on an almost 50% quarter-over-quarter ASM growth.
Revenues increased by 46% over the previous quarter to $445 million.
Our ex-fuel CASM decreased from $0.76 in Q2 to $0.62 in Q3, reaching 2019 unit cost levels at 70% of 2019 capacity.
We reported an operating profit of $59 million and an operating margin of 13.3% in the quarter.
Excluding a $10.4 million passenger revenue adjustments, that Company would have reported an operating profit of $48.6 million and an operating margin of 11.2%.
We had a cash buildup of $54 million and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion and a total liquidity of over $1.6 billion.
On the operational front, the Company delivered an untimed performance of 89.4% and that completion factor of 99.8%, ONCE again among the best in the industry.
This results a true testament to our employees' continuous commitment to delivering a world-class product to our passengers.
With regards to our network, we're excited to start our first new destination since the beginning of the pandemic.
Beginning in December, we will offer service to three new cities, Armenia and Cucuta in Colombia and Atlanta in the US.
By the end of the year, Copa will provide service to 72 destinations in North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean.
And we expect to recover service to the rest of our pre-pandemic network during 2022, strengthening our position at the most complete and convenient hub in Latin America.
During the quarter, we agreed with Boeing to accelerate the delivery of 12 737 MAX 9 that were originally intended to be delivered starting in 2025.
We will receive two of these aircraft in 2022 for a total of seven MAX 9 deliveries next year and the other 10 aircrafts will be added to Copa's deliveries from 2023 through 2025.
As to Boeing, during the fourth quarter, it expects to receive two aircrafts from the Copa fleet to end the year with a total of eight 737-800.
In closing, I'd like to reaffirm that we have a proven and strong business model, which is based on operating the best and most convenient network for inter-Latin America travel from our hub of the America leveraging Panamax advantageous geographic position, with the region's lowest unit cost for a full service carrier, best on-time performance and strongest balance sheet.
Going forward, the Company expects that at top of the Americas will be an even more valuable source of strategic advantage.
Hope you're doing well.
I'd like to join Pedro and acknowledging our great corporate team for all their efforts and great spirit during these many months of the pandemic.
I will start by going over our third quarter results.
Our capacity came in at 4.4 billion available seat miles, which amounts to 69% of the capacity operated per quarter of 2019.
Load factor came in at an average of 79% for the quarter, an increase compared to Q2 while operating 49% more ASMs. We reported a net profit of $8.2 million or $0.19 per share.
Excluding special items, we would have reported a net profit of $29.9 million or $0.70 per share.
Special items for the quarter are comprised mainly of an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $32.1 million related to the Company's convertible notes issued in 2020 and $10.4 million in revenues related to unredeemed tickets, which we are not included in our underlying results as they correspond to sales made during 2019 and early in 2020.
We reported a quarterly operating profit which came in at $59 million.
Excluding the $10.4 million in unredeemed ticket revenues, we had an adjusted operating profit of $48.6 million for the quarter.
Our operating margin was 13.3%.
Excluding the passenger revenue adjustments, we would have reported an operating margin of 11.2%.
Unit cost excluding fuel were better than in the second quarter at $0.062 per ASM, driven by a quarter-over-quarter capacity growth of 49%.
We continue with our cost savings initiatives and we are now targeting to achieve the unit cost below $0.06 once we reach above 90% of our pre-COVID-19 capacity.
During the third quarter, we had a cash buildup of approximately $54 million, driven mainly by increased sales during the period.
As a reminder, for our cash build of measure, we exclude all extraordinary proceeds from asset sales, but include capex and the payment of our leases and other financial obligations.
I want to spend some time out discussing the balance sheet and liquidity.
As of the end of the third quarter, we had assets of close to $4.2 billion and our cash short and long-term investments ended at $1.3 billion.
We also ended the quarter with an aggregate amount of $345 million in unutilized committed credit facilities, which added to our cash, brought our total liquidity to more than $1.6 billion.
In terms of debt, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in debt and lease liabilities at similar levels to the ones reported for the end of the second quarter.
Turning now for fleet.
In July, we finalized the sale and delivery of our last Embraer 190 and during the quarter, we delivered two Boeing 737-700s to their new owner, the end of the third quarter with 87 aircraft; 68 737-800 70%, 13 737 MAX 9s, and six 737-700.
These figures, we include aircraft currently in temporary storage that we plan to reactivate in the upcoming months.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive two more 737 MAX 9s to end the year with a total of 89 aircraft.
As the remainder of the year, based on the current state of the demand environment and air travel restrictions, we can provide the following outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021.
We expect capacity to be approximately 83% of Q4 2019 levels at about 5.1 billion ASMs and we expect our operating margin to be approximately 4%.
Our Q4 2021 outlook is based on the following assumptions; revenues of approximately 80% of Q4 2019 levels at about $545 million, CASM ex-fuel of approximately $0.61, and oil price of $2.50 per gallon, an increment of approximately 17% quarter-over-quarter.
Given the uncertainty, it is still premature to give a full year 2022 guidance.
However, for the first half of the year, we preliminarily expect our capacity measuring ASMs to be approximately 92% of the capacity operated during the first half of 2019.
And with that, we'll open the call to some questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 My name is Kevin Maczka, I'm Belden's vice president of investor relations and treasurer.
Roel will provide a strategic overview of our business and then Henk will provide a detailed review of our financial and operating results, followed by Q&A.
Additionally, during today's call, management will reference adjusted or non-GAAP financial information.
As a reminder, I'll be referring to adjusted results today.
Demand trends improved in the fourth quarter, and I'm pleased to report that revenues, earnings and cash flow exceeded our initial expectations.
Fourth quarter revenues increased 5% sequentially to $498.5 million compared to our initial guidance range of $460 million to $485 million, and our revised guidance range of $494 million to $499 million.
The upside relative to our expectations was broad based, with contributions from both the Industrial Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments.
During the fourth quarter, our channel partners further reduced the inventory levels by approximately $22 million as expected, resulting in a reduction of approximately $70 million for the full year 2020.
Importantly, this is not expected to recur in 2021.
Incoming order rates were solid during the quarter, increasing 13% sequentially.
This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10 times, including a robust 1.16 times in the Industrial Solutions segment.
EPS increased 25% sequentially to $0.90, compared to our initial guidance range of $0.63 to $0.78, and our revised guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90.
Free cash flow generation was $101 million in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations by approximately $11 million.
As a result, we exited the fourth quarter with cash on hand of $502 million, which provides ample flexibility as we pursue our strategic initiatives.
2020 was a truly unprecedented year, with each of us facing significant challenges related to the global pandemic both personally and professionally.
I'm extremely proud of the way our global workforce responded to these challenges and maintained a sharp focus on supporting our customers, then executing our strategic plans, while maintaining the safest possible working conditions.
For the full year 2020, we delivered revenues of $1.863 billion and earnings per share of $2.75.
Free cash flow generation was $86 million compared to our expectation of approximately $75 million.
Beyond the initial response to the pandemic, the year was highlighted by the bold steps we took to position the company for substantially improved organic growth and margins.
This includes streamlining our cost structure, funding our compelling growth initiatives, and significantly improving our portfolio of businesses.
On the cost side, we delivered on our commitments by successfully reducing SG&A costs by $40 million for the full year 2020.
We exited the year with a quarterly run rate savings of $15 million in the fourth quarter, so we are prepared to deliver the full $60 million in savings in 2021 as planned.
This represents approximately 300 basis points of incremental EBITDA margin expansion on an annual basis.
These are permanent cost reductions that will not return as conditions normalize.
As we executed these cost reduction plans, we continue to make strategic investments to accelerate growth and capitalize on the opportunities in our key markets.
To that end, R&D spending increased 14% to $107 million in 2020, with approximately 65% of this investment dedicated to software development.
This includes stand-alone software and embedded software within various hardware products.
We are making targeted investments to support growth and innovation in Industrial Automation and enhance our best-in-class cybersecurity cloud platform.
These innovations are important to our customers and our shareholders, as they will further strengthen our product offering and enhance our competitive advantage.
We also maintained capex spending of approximately $70 million for the year, to ensure that we have the capabilitie...
...e debts, so are not a risk of a default in the unlikely event of significantly worsening economic conditions.
As I mentioned previously, we're comfortable with our liquidity position and the quality of our balance sheet.
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $134.7 million compared to $187.4 million in the prior year period.
Net capital expenditures were $33.3 million for the quarter compared to $35.9 million in the prior period.
For the full year 2020, we generated cash flow from operations of $173.4 million compared to $276.9 million in 2019.
The decline primarily reflects lower EBITDA during the year that resulted from the global pandemic.
The full year net capital expenditures were $87.1 million compared to $110 million in 2019.
The difference is primarily related to the timing of the Grass Valley divestiture, which we completed in July of 2020.
As a result, we generated free cash flow of $86.3 million in 2020 compared to $166.9 million in 2019.
2021 will be a year of recovery in most of our key markets.
During the year, we expect to complete our transformative portfolio actions and turn the focus to accelerating organic growth.
Our recent order rates are encouraging and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our financial goals and drive superior returns for our shareholders.
We anticipate first quarter 2021 revenues to be between $490 million and $505 million, and earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.70.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenues to be between $1.99 billion and $2.050 billion, and earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.30.
For financial modeling purposes, we recommend using interest expense of approximately $61 million for 2021, and then effective tax rate of 20% for each quarter and the full year.
This guidance includes the expected accretion from the OTN Systems acquisition.
It continues to include the contribution of our copper cable product lines that we are in the process of divesting, which contributed approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.20 in 0PS in 2020.
We will update our guidance accordingly as we complete these divestitures.
We expect current copper prices and foreign exchange rates to have a favorable impact on revenues of approximately $80 million in 2021, but a negligible impact on earnings.
We expect consolidated organic growth in the range of 1% to 4% or up to $70 million, with solid growth in our Industrial Solutions segment, partially offset by declines in the Smart Buildings markets within our Enterprise Solutions segment.
We anticipate an incremental $36 million in revenue and $0.11 in earnings per share from the OTN Systems acquisition.
Consistent with our commitment, we expect to realize the incremental $20 million in savings under our SG&A cost reduction program.
These savings represent $0.36 in EPS.
R&D investments are an important strategic initiative designed to drive growth in future periods.
But these investments will temporary pressure margins and earnings per share in 2021.
Finally, a normalized effective tax rate of 20% along with modestly higher interest expense and share count represent an earnings per share headwind of approximately $0.20 for the year.
For the full year 2021, the high-end of our guidance implies total revenue and earnings per share growth of 10% and 20% respectively.
Before we conclude, I would like to reiterate our investment thesis.
We view Belden as a very compelling investment opportunity, as we are taking bold steps to drive substantially improved business performance.
We are significantly improving our portfolio and aligning them on favorable secular trends in our key strategic markets, including Industrial Automation, Cybersecurity, Broadband and 5G, and Smart Buildings.
We continue to invest in our business to position the company for accelerating organic growth and robust margin expansion.
As we successfully execute our strategic plans and deliver on our goals, we would expect this to drive superior returns for our shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.
fortive.com, under the heading Investors Quarterly Results.
We completed the separation of our Industrial Technologies segment through the spin-off of Vontier Corporation on October 9, 2020, and have accordingly included the results of the Industrial Technologies segment as discontinued operations.
All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.
Starting on slide three.
Our first quarter performance continued to highlight the benefits of our efforts to enhance the growth and resilience of our portfolio, significantly expanding our positions in software and healthcare and adding substantial sources of higher growth recurring revenue.
As a result, our portfolio has been well positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement over the past few quarters as markets have begun to reopen.
In Q1, we continue to see significant improvement, not only across our short-cycle businesses, primarily Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also at many of the businesses that have faced COVID-related headwinds, such as Advanced Sterilization Products.
Turning to the results in the quarter.
We generated total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, above the high-end of our guidance.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year.
The combined outperformance on core growth and earnings helped drive another strong quarter of free cash flow.
Our SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint and Gordian continue to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with the current Gordian seeing better top line momentum overall.
These software offerings are an important part of our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions to address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities.
Despite the challenges of a COVID environment, we continue to leverage FBS tools to drive performance improvements across the portfolio.
ASP is advancing the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns as well as progress accelerating commercial efforts, as it delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base.
Intelex also continues to see success from the application of FBS tools to improve its sales process, driving better lead generation, improved customer win rates and stronger sales pipeline creation.
While these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses, in order to deliver accelerated growth, innovation and market share gains.
Relative to organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies as well as build additional capacity to drive future innovation.
With the FORT, we are continuing to scale our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications.
In 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting more than $250 million of potential revenue opportunity.
Our acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows as well as generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive.
We've also made a number of additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, with three start-up opportunities currently in different phases of incubation.
With these investments, we are enhancing our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition.
In terms of performance ac...
...ity, we are well positioned to pursue our key capital allocation priorities and are maintaining an active pipeline of deal cultivation efforts.
We continue to see a broad range of opportunities to deploy capital to build on our core hardware and instrumentation positions as we also leverage deep domain and workflow expertise into adjacent high value software data-driven opportunities.
Turning now to the guide on slide 11.
As a result of the strong first quarter performance and given some improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance.
For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.50 to $2.60, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 24% on a continuing operations basis.
This assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%.
It also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021.
We also continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year.
We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%.
This assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%.
For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income.
The full year guidance incorporates $35 million of additional investments that we are making to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities to support higher growth in the years ahead with $15 million in the second quarter.
This includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base as well as to accelerate the development of AI machine learning offerings for our customers.
It also includes funding for investments in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, where we have seen good early progress thus far.
With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks.
Before we move to questions on slide 13, I wanted to highlight the continued progress we're making with respect to our key sustainability goals.
In Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, yielding valuable insights that we use to define the new pillars of our sustainability strategy, which will guide our efforts going forward.
We've also made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to complete the collection of 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets.
We look forward to discussing our progress and our evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day.
The results that we announced today are a testament to the depth and dedication of our teams and the relentless focus on the continuous improvement principles that power our culture.
As we look forward, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of the market opportunities we address and the significant organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us.
As macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus will remain on driving strong core growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying our capital to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase the value we bring to customers.
We are also excited to share more details with you about our road ahead when we speak on May 19 at our Investor Day.
In the almost five years since our spin, we have positioned the portfolio to be higher growth, more profitable and a more powerful generator of free cash flow.
This sets us up well for accelerated compounding across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you.
That concludes our formal comments.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm William Prate, Senior Director of Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.
Our Chief Operating Officer, Dave Huml, is tending to a family matter today and is not able to join the call.
Chris will brief you on our operations and the progress we're making toward our enterprise strategy, then Andy will cover the financials.
After their remarks, we will open the call to questions.
These risks and uncertainties are described in today's news release and the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We encourage you to review those documents, particularly our safe harbor statement for a description of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results.
Additionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items.
We hope that you and your loved ones are managing to stay safe through this pandemic.
As you may have seen, in September, we celebrated Tennant's 150th anniversary.
While our current operating environment could not be more different than what our founder George Tennant encountered in 1870, the Company has always maintained a tradition of innovation and resilience, demonstrated by our ability to adapt and stay relevant to our customers.
When the pandemic started, we were quick to respond and established three guiding principles; to keep our employees and customer's safe, to manage our costs and cash flow, and to stay in a position to ramp up quickly when markets recover.
At the same time we honored our commitment to provide our customers with the innovative solutions they needed to keep their facilities clean and safe.
We continued with that approach in the third quarter and saw encouraging signs of recovery across all of our regions.
Our global teams have worked hard in overcoming the unprecedented sales and operational challenges resulting from the pandemic, and we work closely with our customers, supply chain partners, and carriers to avoid operational disruptions.
Furthermore, the execution of our Enterprise Strategy yielded improvements in our operating performance with third quarter EBITDA growth, despite a year-over-year COVID-19 related decline in organic sales.
While the pandemic continues to pose considerable macro level uncertainty, especially as some markets see spikes in COVID 19 cases, we have a high level of confidence in our near-term business outlook.
As Andy will speak to in a few moments, we are reinitiating our full year guidance for 2020 which not only reflects our revenue and profitability expectations, but also our commitment to investing in our business to support our long-term enterprise strategy.
That strategy includes, winning where we have competitive advantage, reducing complexity and building scalable processes, and innovating for profitable growth.
While the global pandemic impact or the economic impact of the pandemic is nothing anyone could have predicted a year ago, it has not diminished our ability to execute on our enterprise strategy because the key elements are all within our control.
For example, while innovating for profitable growth might sound like a lofty ideal; for Tennant it represents how we take customer insights and leverage our tremendous engineering capabilities to solve real world problems.
A recent illustration of this commitment is our October 1st introduction of our new T380AMR, which complements our current robotic offering by providing a smaller-sized machine that enhances maneuverability and navigation to help customers with smaller footprints.
This new product and our continued partnership with Brain Corporation enabled us to finalize agreements in the third quarter to provide two national retailers and a separate regional retailer with our full suite of autonomous floor scrubbers.
Additionally, we are starting to achieve wins in additional verticals like logistics, education and aviation.
Following our initial roll-out with Walmart earlier this year, wins like these d...
...erall, the Company's service and parts and consumables business trends continued to be a bright spot.
While equipment sales were down approximately 12% year-over-year for the quarter, aftermarket revenue was up 6% over the same period last year, reflecting our efforts in helping customers meet their rapidly evolving cleaning needs during the pandemic.
Adjusted gross margins during the third quarters of 2020 and 2019 were 40.2% and 40.8% respectively.
The year-over-year decrease reflects a number of strategic investments and deleverage on lower volume which were partially offset by cost out actions driven by strategic initiatives.
Turning to expenses, during the third quarter, our adjusted S&A expenses were 29.8% of net sales compared with 31.2% in the year ago period, mainly as a result of cost containment efforts and adjustments to management incentives.
This included a number of strategic investments that we made during the quarter.
Given the macroeconomic uncertainties created by the pandemic, careful S&A management continues to be an important part of our response.
Combining these results, our EBITDA in the third quarter of 2020 was $32.6 million or 12.4% of sales compared with $31.4 million or 11.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2019.
The increase as a percent of sales was attributed to adjustments to management incentives and reductions in discretionary spending that were implemented in the quarter.
As for our tax rate, in the third quarter, the Company had an adjusted effective tax rate of 11.3% compared to 16.1% in the year ago period.
The lower tax rate primarily resulted from an increase in discrete tax items in the quarter and a favorable mix of earnings.
Turning now to cash flow, capital allocation and balance sheet items.
In the third quarter of 2020, Tennant generated $48.9 million in cash flow from operations, primarily driven by business performance and improvements in working capital.
Also in the third quarter, we repaid an additional $17 million of debt.
As of September 30th, we had $124.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $172 million of undrawn funds on our revolver.
Lastly, turning to guidance.
As you may recall, in April, we withdrew the full-year guidance we had provided in February due to the uncertain nature of the pandemic.
While there is still uncertainty in the market, we do have a higher level of confidence in our near-term projections and we are reinitiating full-year guidance for 2020.
As included in today's earning announcement, our full year 2020 guidance is as follows; Net sales of $995 million to $1,005 million with organic sales declining 12.5% to 11.5%; GAAP earnings of $2.00 to $2.20 per share; adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.00 per share, which excludes certain non-operational items and amortization expense; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $116 million to $121 million; capital expenditures of approximately $35 million; and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.
It's worth mentioning that our guidance does include approximately $5 million to $8 million of government benefits, which is primarily driven by the wage subsidies we received and mentioned in our second quarter results.
Also, and as Chris noted, this guidance incorporates continued investing in our business to support our enterprise strategy.
At the same time, while we believe the underlying business performance is improving and we expect our revenue will continue to increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter, it's important to note that organic sales would reflect a difficult year-over-year comparison as Q4 2019 was Tennant's second highest revenue quarter ever.
As a result, we are anticipating that our implied fourth quarter organic decline will be greater than the third quarter; and due to the continued strategic investments that I just mentioned, our anticipated EBITDA dollar and percent of revenue will be lower than previous quarters.
With that, we will now open the call to questions.

[/INST] # Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Tennant celebrated its 150th anniversary this year, highlighting its resilience and commitment to innovation. The company has executed on its Enterprise Strategy, resulting in improved operating performance, with third-quarter EBITDA growth despite a decline in organic sales. The full year guidance for 2020 has been reinstated, reflecting continued investment in innovation and the expectation of sequential revenue increases quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $2.80 and $3.00, while GAAP earnings per share are estimated at $2.00 to $2.20. The company's aftermarket business saw a 6% increase in revenue, while equipment sales decreased by 12%. Adjusted gross margin decreased slightly due to strategic investments and lower volume, but cost-saving initiatives partially offset this decline. EBITDA increased as a percentage of sales driven by adjustments to management incentives and discretionary spending reductions. Tennant generated $48.9 million in cash flow from operations and repaid $17 million of debt, resulting in a strong balance sheet position. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million, reflecting the company's commitment to continued innovation and growth.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those discussed or anticipated.
Also, during the call certain financial numbers may be discussed that differ from comparable numbers obtained in our financial statements.
We believe these non-GAAP financial numbers assist in comparing period-to-period results in a more consistent manner.
And with that, I'll turn the time over to Ryan.
We really appreciate you joining the call today.
This is my first earnings call as Nu Skin's CEO, so I'd like to take a few minutes to share my perspectives on our business both historically and for the future.
As we work to further transform our business toward our vision of becoming the world's leading innovative beauty and wellness company powered by our dynamic affiliate opportunity platform.
Nu Skin has a rich heritage of building innovative beauty and wellness products for nearly four decades including billion dollar brands like Nu Skin, personal care, Pharmanex and ageLOC.
However, the value of our business has often been defined through the narrow lens of our historic direct selling distribution channel.
But when you examine our business for what it is becoming, we are better described as a beauty and wellness company that connects consumers to innovative products that help them look feel and live better through our trusted brand affiliates, via our socially enabled digital platform, affiliate powered direct to customer social commerce.
Nu Skin is fundamentally a beauty and wellness company, based on our global reputation for high quality, innovative products and deep consumer connections.
We provide a holistic inside outside approach backed by robust R&D and scientific rigor, which very few companies provide.
And we are a category leader for beauty device systems, according to Euro monitor for four years running, which provides a very unique opportunity for us as we expand our device ecosystem moving forward.
We're now engaged in transforming our business from a traditional direct selling company to becoming the world's leading beauty and wellness company powered by our dynamic affiliate opportunity platform.
There are three key strategic imperatives that will enable our next era of growth.
First, we will launch Empower Me, our personalized beauty and wellness strategy as we begin to connect our beauty device systems to our expanding digital ecosystem beginning in 2022.
Second, we'll continue to evolve our go-to-market approach from a traditional direct selling business model to an emerging affiliate powered social commerce business model around the globe.
And third, we'll expand our digital platform with an enhanced.com experience, as well as two new apps, Vera for our customers and Stella for our affiliates.
Let me give a bit more context on our work in each of these three strategic areas.
Building upon our leadership position as the world's number one beauty device systems brand, we will expand our device systems by introducing next generation connected devices beginning in 2022.
The beauty device category continues to be the highest growth sector in beauty and personal care, and we believe that our connected device strategy will further expand our share of that category.
Our products are loved by well more than a million registered customers today and many more unregistered customers around the globe, and through Empower Me personalized beauty and wellness.
We will be able to connect even more customers, nurture deeper engagement and build stronger community of brand lovers, which will result in greater lifestyle value.
We aspire to achieve what other great device companies like Apple, Amazon and Peloton have done making us the leader in connected beauty and wellness.
Next, social commerce is disrupting traditional e-commerce just as e-commerce disrupted retail more than 20 years ago.
Global research estimates the social commerce will expand from approximately $500 billion in 2020 to $3.4 t...
...ly encouraged with our Q3 results as we continue to improve in this important market.
The 10% revenue and 18% growth in sales leaders was driven by successful product promotions around our TR90 body shaping system.
Our focus for the balance of the year will be previewing ageLOC META and expanding leader training around social commerce.
And finally, Southeast Asian Pacific.
This segment has been perhaps the most impacted by COVID with deepening lockdowns in various markets and local market distribution challenges hindering our ability to fulfill orders in some markets.
For the balance of the year we are looking forward to the introduction of ageLOC META in the fourth quarter.
I look forward to further participating on these calls, and hopefully meeting some of you in person soon.
I'll provide a financial overview and then give Q4 and full year 2021 guidance.
For additional detail, please visit our Investor Relations website.
For the third quarter, our revenue was $641.2 million and benefited 2% due to foreign currency.
While this represents an 8.8% decline versus Q3 2020, it is growth of 8.7% on a two-year look back versus Q3 2019.
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.97 down 10% year-over-year, but up 22.8% versus the same period in 2019.
Gross margin for the quarter improved 130 basis points to 75.2%.
Gross margin for the core Nu Skin business was 78.6% compared to 76.3% driven by product mix, product cost reductions and supply chain efficiencies.
Selling expense as a percent of revenue remained consistent with the prior year at 39.9%.
For the Nu Skin core business selling expense was 42.7% compared to 42.4%.
General and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 25.1% compared to 23.5% in the prior year.
For the quarter G&A declined $3.9 million year-over-year, as we remain focused on carefully managing expenses.
Operating margin for the quarter was 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the prior year period, largely impacted by revenue.
We still anticipate an approximate 50 basis points year-over-year improvement in operating margin for 2021.
On our way to our stated midterm goal of 13%.
The other income expense line reflects a $2.8 million gain, compared to a $0.5 million gain in the prior year.
The benefit this quarter largely stems from unrealized gains and our rise investment holdings.
As our investments and rise increase, you can expect more variability in our other income expense line item.
Cash from operations was $30.2 million for the quarter, and was impacted by our continued strategic investment in inventory to meet customer demand for new products and build some protection from global supply chain construction.
We anticipate this elevated inventory level will decrease over the next few quarters.
We paid $19 million in dividends and repurchased $10 million of our stock with $255.4 million remaining in authorization.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 27% compared to 24.8% in the prior year period.
Our rise segment, which includes our manufacturing partners, grew 4% in the quarter.
These manufacturing entities continue to benefit our core business by helping shore up our supply chain and generate US profit that lowers our overall tax rate.
As Ryan mentioned, we also acquired an emerging social commerce technology company Mabelle.
And we continue to carefully seek investment opportunities.
Given our Q3 results, we are adjusting our annual guidance and now expect revenue of $2.67 billion to $2.70 billion, which is annual growth of 3% to 5% or growth of 10% to 11% versus 2019.
We anticipate earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.03, year-over-year improvement of 8% to 11% or 27% to 30% on a two-year look back.
This guidance assumes a positive foreign currency impact of 2% to 3% and a tax rate of 26% to 28%.
We are projecting fourth quarter revenue of $645 million to $675 million.
Assuming a foreign currency headwind of approximately 1%.
Q4 earnings per share guidance is $0.90 to $1 and assumed a tax rate of 25% to 29%.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These materials will be referenced during portions of today's call.
A detailed description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in AFG's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also available on our website.
We may include references to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure in our remarks or responses to questions.
This was an outstanding quarter.
We're extremely pleased with the company's performance and continued strong market conditions.
Third quarter pre-tax core operating earnings and AFG's Property and Casualty Insurance segment were 60% higher than the comparable prior year period, and each of our Specialty Property and Casualty groups reported healthy growth and excellent underwriting margins.
Results in our portfolio of alternative investments continue to exceed our expectations and produced strong investment returns in the quarter.
This year, market conditions in the Property and Casualty business remain among the best I've seen in my 40 plus year career.
We believe that our disciplined, yet opportunistic operating philosophy, a lower net catastrophe exposure than our peers and a continued economic recovery contributed to these outstanding results.
I'll now turn the discussion over to Craig to walk us through AFG's third quarter results, investment performance and our overall financial position at September 30th.
As you'll see on Slide 3, AFG reported core net operating earnings of $2.71 per share, an impressive 96% increase year-over-year.
The increase was primarily the result of substantially higher underwriting profit in our Specialty P&C insurance operations and significantly higher P&C net investment income due to the continued strong performance of AFG's $1.7 billion and alternative investments.
Annualized core operating return on equity in the third quarter was nearly 18%.
Turning to Slide 4, you'll see the third quarter 2021 net earnings per share of $2.56 included non-core after-tax realized losses on securities of $0.15 per share, most of which pertain to fair value adjustments on securities that we continue to hold at the end of the quarter.
Now I'd like to turn to an overview of AFG's investment performance, financial position and share a few comments about AFG's capital and liquidity.
The details surrounding our $16.4 billion investment portfolio are presented on Slides 5 and 6.
Pre-tax unrealized gains on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio were $225 million at the end of the third quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, P&C net investment income was approximately 66% higher than the comparable 2020 period and included significantly higher earnings from alternative investments.
We're especially pleased with the performance of our alternative investments during the quarter.
Earnings from these investments may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on reported results and valuation of the underlying investments and generally are reported on a quarter lag.
The annualized return on alternative investments reported in core operating earnings in the third quarter of 2021 was a very strong 20.3%.
The average annual return on these investments over the past five calendar years was approximately 10%.
Alternative investments with underlying real estate exposures have been a key contributor to the performance of this portfolio.
We view our investments in real estate and real estate related entities is a core competency.
In addition to our portfolio of directly owned properties and mortgage loans, our real estate related investments include real estate funds and real estate partnerships accounted for by the equity method.
We found great success in investing in multifamily properties and desirable communities where we continue to achieve very strong occupancy and collection rates and steady rate increases.
These multifamily properties represented over half of our alternative investment portfolio on September 30, 2021.
Due to the significant portion of our alt...
...tinue to enjoy robust survival ratios, which are well above industry averages in which our one measure of the strength of our A&E reserves.
Based on a relatively moderate payment patterns and the pace of new filings, we'll most likely continue to assess our reserves utilizing in-house resources next year.
We have also assessed the adequacy of our asbestos and environmental reserves for historic railroad and manufacturing operations.
Asbestos liabilities continue to be adequate, though we are making a small adjustment to our environmental liabilities based on slightly revised projections at three environmental sites.
Based on results for the first nine months of the year, we now expect AFG's core net operating earnings in 2021 to be in the range of $10.10 to $10.70, up significantly from our previous range of $8.40 to $9.20 per share.
We're obviously pleased once again to increase our 2021 core earnings per share guidance in a meaningful way.
This guidance reflects an assumed annualized return of approximately 10% on alternative investments in the fourth quarter of 2021, which would produce a return of approximately 20% on our $1.7 billion of alternative investments for the full year in 2021.
As we consider the outlook for our Specialty Property and Casualty operations based on results to the first nine months, we strengthened our guidance across the board, indicating higher expected 2021 net repayments and stronger underwriting profit.
We now expect the 2021 combined ratio for the Specialty Property and Casualty Group overall between 86% and 88%, an improvement of 2 points at the midpoint of the range of our previous estimate.
Net written premiums are now expected to be 11% to 14% higher than the $5 billion reported last year.
Growth in net written premiums excluding workers' comp is now expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, an increase from the range of 12% to 16% estimated previously.
And then looking at each sub segment.
We now expect the Property and Transportation group combined ratio to be in a range of 86% to 88%.
Our guidance assumes above average crop earnings for the year and we continue to expect growth in net written premiums for this group to be in the range of 15% to 19%.
Our Specialty Casualty Group is now expected to produce a combined ratio in the range of 85% to 87%.
Our guidance assumes continued strong renewal pricing in our E&S excess liability and several of our other longer-tail liability businesses.
We have raised our projection for growth in net written premiums to a range of 8% to 12% higher than 2020 results.
Premium growth will be tempered by rate decreases in our workers' compensation book, which are result of favorable loss experience in this line of business.
Excluding workers' comp, we now expect 2021 premiums in the Specialty and Casualty Group to grow in a range of 15% to 19%, an increase of 5 percentage points from the midpoint of our previous guidance.
And we now expect the Specialty Financial Group combined ratio to be in a range of 84% to 86%, reflecting strong underwriting results for the first nine months of the year.
We continue to expect growth in net written premiums for this group to be between 10% and 14% based on projected premium growth in our fidelity and crime and surety businesses.
And our expectations for overall renewal pricing are unchanged from last quarter, remaining in the range of 9% to 11% overall.
And excluding workers' comp, we expect renewal rate increases to be in the range of 11% to 13%.
Craig and are very pleased to report these exceptionally strong results and a significant increase in our earnings expectations for the full year.
We believe that our entrepreneurial opportunistic culture, combined with our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility position us very well as we close out the year and we look forward to the opportunities in 2022.
We'll now open the lines for the Q&A portion of today's call, and we'd all be happy to respond to any questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I will begin the call with brief remarks regarding our third-quarter performance before offering some perspective on the current market environment.
I will also provide an update on CMC's key strategic growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that CMC's third-quarter fiscal 2021 financial results were the best in our company's 106-year history.
Earnings from continuing operations were $130.4 million or $1.07 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion.
Excluding the impact of a gain on the sale of a small rail reclamation business, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $127.1 million or $1.04 per diluted share.
CMC reported a core EBITDA of $230.5 million, generating an annualized return on invested capital of 18%.
This level of performance underscores CMC's enhanced earnings capability following our multi-year strategic repositioning.
Third-quarter volumes were exceptionally strong in North America and Europe, and the ability of our commercial operational logistics and support teams to respond to the rise in customer demand generated our strong financial performance.
and Poland set monthly shipment production records during the quarter, enabling us to capitalize on market conditions.
During the quarter, we also continued to execute on our previously discussed in-flight strategic initiatives and growth projects.
We are expanding our capability to serve the merchant bar market.
Customers appreciate CMC's expanded product range and service capabilities, and we're seeing our recent investments in handling and storage capacity pay off in increased volumes.
We expect more growth in the future, especially once our state-of-the-art Arizona 2 micro mill starts up in early 2023.
We continue to execute on our network optimization efforts.
And with recent actions firmly entrenched in our financial performance, CMC is roughly halfway to our longer-term goal of $50 million in annual cost efficiencies.
You can see the benefit of these efforts in our controllable cost performance on a per-ton basis.
Despite well-publicized inflationary pressures across the global economy, we were able to reduce this metric modestly on a year-over-year basis.
In April, we received the required air permit for Arizona 2, CMC's planned state-of-the-art micro mill at our Mesa, Arizona site.
This was an important milestone, enabling us to begin construction and we continue to anticipate an early 2023 start-up.
As a reminder, this plant will be the first micro mill in the world capable of producing merchant bar as well as rebar.
It will also be the first in North America with the capability to connect directly to an onsite renewable energy source.
These capabilities, combined with a micro mill's inherent low-cost and low-carbon footprint will define a new level of operational and environmental excellence in long products steelmaking.
In May, our team in Europe began hot commissioning their plant's third rolling line.
The start-up process is going very well, and we expect to begin commercial production late in the fourth quarter.
This project was delivered on time and under budget, a testament to our Polish team's ability to execute.
We will be ramping operations within a very strong market environment, which will help shorten the time to achieve our targeted annual run rate incremental EBITDA of $20 million.
I'd now like to provide an update on market conditions.
The encouraging trends we discussed during our second-quarter call continued and strengthened in the third quarter.
As I will detail, project owners have grown more confident as the economy has recovered and states have reopened, and they are now more willing to contract new work.
This view is supported by the strong level of new awards booked in the quarter.
The strength and new project opportunities is occurring in both the private and public sectors.
On the private side, CMC is seeing work related to the hardening of supply chains, as well as the trend toward investments in e-commerce in...
...lable costs per ton of finished steel shipped compared to a year ago despite inflationary pressures in freight and certain other costs.
A quick glance at recent producer price index or manufacturing ISM reports should underscore the strength of this accomplishment.
The most significant benefit came from volume-driven efficiencies at our steel mills and recycling yards, as well as the impact of closing the former Steel California rolling operations.
Turning to Slide 9.
Our Europe segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $50 million in -- for the third quarter of 2021, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $14.3 million in the same period of the prior year.
The improvement was driven by expanded margins over scrap and strong volumes across all ranges of products.
Margins over scrap increased $90 per ton on a year-over-year basis and were up $84 per ton from the prior quarter.
Tight market conditions provided the backdrop to achieve the segment's higher -- highest average selling price in nine years, reaching $664 per ton during the third quarter.
This level represented an increase of $227 per ton compared to a year ago and $132 per ton sequentially.
Europe volumes increased 8% compared to the prior year and reached their highest third-quarter total in a decade.
The strength was driven primarily from the market for rebar.
Volumes of merchant and other products also grew on a year-over-year basis, supported by goods demand from industrial customers in Central Europe, as well as some opportunistic billet sales.
As Barbara mentioned, the demand environment during the quarter was robust, with indications that conditions should remain favorable in the near term.
Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity.
As of May 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $443 million.
In addition, we had approximately $639 million of availability under our credit and accounts receivable programs.
In March, we upsized our revolving credit facility to $400 million from $350 million and extended the maturity till 2026.
During the quarter, we generated $94 million of cash from operating activities despite a $79 million increase in working capital.
The rise in working capital was driven by the significant increase in both scrap input costs and average selling prices.
We expect working capital balances to increase modestly heading into the end of the fiscal year.
Our leverage metrics remain attractive, and we have improved significantly over the last two fiscal years.
As can be seen on Slide 12, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at 1.0 times, while our net debt to capitalization is just 20%.
We believe our robust balance sheet and overall financial strength provides us the flexibility to fund our strategic growth projects, navigate economic uncertainties, and pursue an opportunistic M&A.
CMC's effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, which was both below our full-year effective rate forecast to be around 25%.
Lastly, I would like to provide that our current outlook for capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 remains between 200 million and 225 million of which roughly 100 million will be used for the new micro mill.
For comparison purposes, we have previously stated that our typical capital spend averages around 150 million annually.
We expect a strong finish to fiscal 2021.
The summer construction season is under way, and demand is robust across each of our major product lines in both North America and Europe.
We anticipate margins over scrap on steel products in both segments to be consistent or up modestly compared to the third quarter.
Our internal indicators such as bidding activity and backlog level support continued strength.
The recent recovery of leading national construction indicators such as the Architectural Billing Index dodged momentum index and the Portland Cement Association forecast each mirror our view.
These external measures also point to good conditions in the calendar year 2022.
And at this time, we will now open the call to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to our investors.
These measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.
Please consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.
Barnes Group delivered a very good quarter to begin 2021, with the recovery we had anticipated to occur later in the year starting a little earlier than expected.
Strong order intake continuing sequential revenue growth now for the third consecutive quarter and better than expected earnings performance add confidence to our view that the second half of the year will show meaningful recovery progress.
For the first quarter, organic sales were down 10% compared to a year ago as a result of lower volumes at Aerospace.
However, our Industrial segment generated high single-digit organic growth, which was better than our February expectation given solid orders and sales in March.
While we previously envision business improving as the year progressed, now with the stronger momentum exiting the first quarter, we have increased our outlook for the year.
Earnings per share were $0.38, down 46% from last year's adjusted $0.71, so firmly exceeding the high end of our February expectation.
Moving now to a discussion of end market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.
Our Industrial segment had a strong first quarter, with each of our SBUs generating year-over-year organic sales and revenue growth.
For the segment, orders were up 25% organically, with a book to bill of approximately 1.1 times.
Sequential orders were up 7% further exemplifying the momentum we're seeing.
On a macro level, manufacturing PMIs in the US and eurozone remain particularly robust.
China, while a bit softer, remains an expansion territory.
And despite the semiconductor issue that's impacting automotive bills, IHS still predicts 2021 global production to be up 12% over last year.
Within the segment, our Molding Solutions business had strong orders across all brands, up 35% organically.
Our larger end markets, automotive, medical, packaging and personal care, each saw in excess of 25% orders growth, some well above that.
Sequentially, orders improved high single digits, marking the fourth quarter in a row of sequential growth.
Organic sales were up mid-single digits, while sequential sales were up low single digits.
Book-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times.
Backlog, which is predominantly our longer cycle mold systems, grew by approximately 25% year-over-year and low double digits from the fourth quarter of 2020.
There is definitely a lot to like about the activity of Molding Solutions and the business has been recently adding more talent to the sales and marketing team with a clear focus on driving long-term growth and margin expansion.
While near-term investments in such talent coupled with our innovation and digital initiatives, that I discussed last quarter, will hinder short-term margins.
We expect long-term performance to benefit [Phonetic].
Our 2021 expectation for Molding Solutions has improved, as we now forecast organic sales growth to be in the low teens.
Moving to Force & Motion Control.
Organic orders were up low double digits with organic sales up high single digits.
FMC via sheet metal forming end market is seeing the benefit of its automotive customers push to electric and hybrid vehicles.
Year-over-year orders are up across each of our primary geographic markets, North America, Europe and China.
Likewise, we're seeing good demand in our general industrial end markets, particularly heavy-duty truck and industrial equipment.
Our FMC sales growth expectation has likewise increased, as we now anticipate organic sales to be up in the mid-teens for 2021.
Engineered Components generated organic orders growth in excess of 25% and organic revenue growth in the low double digits.
Sequential...
...lity of supply and acknowledging the longer lead times required for some materials.
In the first quarter, we experienced approximately $1 million of combined freight and material inflation in the Industrial segment.
For the full year, we expect an impact of about $6 million, which is built into our outlook.
Our teams are working on [Phonetic] these issues, looking to decrease the risk exposure and to take actions to offset the inflation where appropriate.
Moving to Aerospace, sales were $82 million for the first quarter, down 38% from last year.
Operating profit of $11.1 million was down 65%, primarily driven by the lower sales volume.
Operating margin was 13.6%, versus a strong 23.9% a year ago.
You may recall, last year's margin was a high watermark, driven by the contributions of the aftermarket.
Aerospace OEM backlog ended the quarter at $600 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter and we expect to ship 45% of this backlog over the next 12 months.
First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $36 million, a decrease of $12 million versus a year ago, free cash flow was $28 million, versus $35 million last year, and capital expenditures of $8 million were down about $4 million from a year ago.
Regarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was 3.1 times at quarter end, essentially flat to the prior quarter result.
The Company is in full compliance with all covenants of our credit agreements and maintains adequate liquidity to fund operations.
While we anticipated the leverage ratio to peak with our first quarter 2021 results, we performed better than expected with the stronger financial results of the first quarter.
We see leverage further declining from this point absent any acquisition activity.
Our first quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 51 million shares.
We now expect to resume some share repurchase activity to offset equity compensation dilution, with respect to incremental share repurchases that will depend on a number of factors related to capital deployment and growth opportunities that are available to us.
Turning to Slide 5 of our supplement, let's discuss our updated financial outlook for 2021.
We now expect organic sales to be up 10% to 12% for the year, an increase from our prior view of up 6% to 8%, driven by stronger industrial growth.
FX is expected to have a 2% favorable impact on sales, while divested revenue -- divested Seeger revenues will have a small negative impact.
Operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 13%.
At this point, we're not anticipating significant residual restructuring charges to come through, so no forecasted adjustments to 2021 net income.
EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.98, up 9% to 21% from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64, that expectation is an increase from our prior view of $1.65 to $1.90, and we expect the first half of the year to contribute approximately 43% of 2021's earnings.
A few other outlook items.
Interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $16 million, while other expense is forecasted at [Phonetic] $8 million, both a bit better than our prior view.
We now expect capex to be approximately $50 million, down $5 million, average diluted shares of 51 million and cash conversion of over 100% are consistent with our prior outlook.
And lastly, we forecast a full year tax rate of approximately 30%.
However, we continue to analyze potential tax planning strategies to manage and reduce our overall tax cost.
To close, a very good start to 2021, supported by healthy orders for both segments.
With our focus on driving growth across the organization, we'll continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures and the funding of key strategic initiatives.
We believe that these investments will help us accelerate the recovery in our financial performance.
Leverage remains very manageable and should improve from this point, so the balance sheet can accommodate our approach.

[/INST] # Barnes Group reported impressive first-quarter results with organic sales down 10% year-over-year, primarily due to lower Aerospace volumes. However, strong Industrial segment growth (high single-digit organic growth) and better-than-expected earnings (EPS $0.38) boosted confidence. Orders surged across all segments, with Industrial (25%), Molding Solutions (35%), and Force & Motion Control (low double-digits) experiencing significant increases. The year's outlook has been revised upward, with organic sales growth now projected at 10-12%, reflecting stronger industrial performance. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.98, representing a 9-21% increase. Despite supply-related challenges and inflationary pressures, the company remains committed to growth-driving investments. The Aerospace segment continues to experience challenges, with sales down 38% and operating profit down 65%, but the backlog remains strong. With a manageable leverage ratio (3.1 times) and adequate liquidity, the company plans to resume share repurchases to offset equity dilution.</s>"

Below is an earnings call transcript.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined here today by Steve Westhoven, our President and CEO; Pat Migliaccio, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of our senior management team.
This could cause results to materially differ from our expectations, as found in slide one.
We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP measures such as net financial earnings or NFE.
We believe that NFE provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance.
However, it is not intended to be a substitute for GAAP.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed more fully in Item seven of our 10-K.
Our agenda for today is found on slide two.
Steve will begin today's call with highlights from the quarter, followed by Pat, who will review our financial results.
New Jersey Resources delivered strong performance in the first quarter.
And on slide three, I'll take you through the highlights.
We reported NFE of $0.46 per share, driven by the performance of our core business, New Jersey Natural Gas.
We are also reaffirming our NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and increasing our fiscal 2022 NFE guidance to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from prior guidance.
At New Jersey Natural Gas, we completed almost 90% of the Southern Reliability Link and expect to place the project into service this year.
We received approval to move forward with our infrastructure Investment Program, a 5-year, $150 million accelerated recovery program that will improve the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.
And we filed for SAVEGREEN 2020, a new energy efficiency program that is designed to help our customers reduce their energy consumption and save money.
At Clean Energy Ventures, we acquired the 2.9 megawatt Mt. Laurel Solar Facility, which is part of our plan to invest $165 million this year.
In our Storage & Transportation business, we've begun to construct -- to convert the Southern portion of Adelphia Gateway to natural gas and expect it to be in service later this calendar year.
And just yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted PennEast petition to hear its appeal.
But despite this positive news, we are still excluding PennEast for our long term projections until there's more clarity on the project.
And at NJR Energy Services we entered into an asset management agreements, which will result in contracted cash proceeds of $501 million over a 10-year period.
I'll take you through the transaction in more detail on the next slide.
Turning to slide four.
Energy Services entered into a series of AMAs with an investment-grade public utility.
These transactions illustrate the value of our portfolio of natural gas storage and transportation contracts that are a testament to the hard work of our talented team.
The transactions assist our counterparty in securing needed supply, while Energy Services monetizes the value of a portion of the assets it controls.
Let me walk you through some of the specifics.
Beginning in November of 2021, which is our fiscal year 2022, NJRES will begin to release portions of our pipeline capacity.
Under the terms of the agreements, NJRES will receive payments of $261 million over the first three years of the AMAs.
After FY 2024, NJRES will receive additional payments of approximately $34 million per year through 2031.
The benefits for NJRES include, extracting value from our assets without the need for weather-related price volatility and reducing operational risks associated with the direct management of these transportation assets.
The result will be more predictable earnings and cash flows and a lower risk Energy Services business.
These transactions also allow us to increase our fiscal 2022 guidance by $0.15 per share, as we'll see on the next slide.
And later in the call, Pat will take you through other financial impacts of these transactions.
Turning to our NFE guidance for fiscal 2022 on slide five, we are increasing our overall guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share...
...idance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share for fiscal 2021.
On slide 11, you can see the segment contributions with our core businesses, NJNG and CEV, accounting for 80% of total NFE.
To help understand the distribution of our net financial earnings by quarter, let me walk you through how we expect NJNG's utility gross margin and CEV's revenues will occur.
For NJNG, we expect to recognize approximately 70% of our utility gross margin in the first half of the year, in line with our historical trends.
At CEV, the majority of our revenue will come in the second half of the year, in particular the fourth quarter, when we expect to recognize the majority of our SREC revenue.
We expect the net financial earnings contributions of our Storage & Transportation business to be fairly consistent throughout the year, because of the fixed price contracts.
On slide 12, we've highlighted the details of our SREC hedging program.
We continue to actively hedge to ensure SREC revenues are largely unaffected by future changes in SREC prices.
Energy year 2023, we increased our hedge level to 75%.
Comparing year 2024, market fundamentals and pricing remained strong with SREC trading at over 85% of SACP.
And we now have 49% of our 2024 volumes hedged.
Turning to slide 13.
I'll explain some of the nuances to achieve the revenue recognition for the AMAs.
Under the terms of the agreements, NJR will initially release the transportation capacity to our counterparty, and later on, will permanently release the contracts to the utility.
The accounting standard requires to allocate revenue to both the initial and permanent release.
With the disproportionate amount of revenue signed to the permanent releases that occur in fiscal years 2024 and 2032.
Subsequently, this allocation will generate a mismatch between revenue and cash proceeds.
Finally, I will note that while the revenue provides some general indication of the NFE, it does not reflect the impact of taxes, demand charges and other items.
Importantly, though, the cash proceeds provides us with additional benefits that I'll detail shortly.
As you can see on slide 14, we now expect our cash flows from operations to grow the CAGR of approximately 25% from fiscal 2020 to 2024 compared to our previous estimate of 20%.
And as you can see from the chart on the right, the strength of our cash flows implies that our dividends are expected to become a smaller percentage, supporting our long term dividend growth rate of 6% to 10%.
Another benefit from the AMAs is the improvement to our credit metrics, which you can see on slide 15.
As we reported at our Analyst Day, our FFO to adjusted debt ratio is rising from fiscal 2022 to 2024.
And when you have the positive impact of the AMAs, our metrics are expected to increase to the high teens in fiscal 2022, and reach about 20% by fiscal 2024.
And because of these strong credit metrics, we will cash settle the equity forward we put in place during our December 2019 equity issuance.
At that time, we issued 5.3 million shares, and we entered into an equity forward to issue an additional 1.2 million shares at a later date, which we no longer need to do.
Also, as we mentioned during our Analyst Day, we have no block equity needs in foreseeable future.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter.
NJR is off to a good start for fiscal 2021 and on track to meet our NFEPS guidance for this fiscal year.
We increased our fiscal 2022 NFEPS guidance by $0.15 per share, and we expect strong cash flow to support our dividend growth.
Our key infrastructure projects, SRL and Adelphia Gateway, continue to make progress, and we expect both to be in service this calendar year.
Our improved credit metrics allow us to cash settle our equity forward.
And as we said in our Investor Day, we have no need for further block equity issuances.
And we've made substantial progress in our commitment to de-risk the Energy Services business by providing more stable fee based revenue.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, Chief Executive Officer; and Csaba Sverha, Chief Financial Officer.
We had an excellent fourth quarter to finish a strong fiscal year with robust demand trends continuing across our business combined with excellent execution by our team, we delivered a number of records in the quarter.
Revenue was well above our guidance range and for the first time exceeded $0.5 billion at $509.6 million.
In addition to record revenue, we also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 9.9%, resulting in an all-time high non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.31 in the fourth quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we produced record revenue of $1.88 billion, representing industry-leading growth of 14% from the prior year.
Non-GAAP net income was $4.67 per share.
Total operating cash flow for the year was $118.7 million and free cash flow was $76.1 million.
Looking at some of the highlights of the fourth quarter.
Optical communications revenue reached another new record, driven by strong telecom demand.
Non-optical communications revenue also reached another record in Q4.
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by healthy demand trends across all lines of business as we continue to successfully navigate and manage component supplies.
We estimate that the supply constraints we are experiencing impacted our fourth quarter revenue by approximately $25 million to $30 million, and we expect to see a similar impact in Q1.
Despite this headwind, we anticipate that revenue will continue to grow sequentially to a new record in Q1 as Csaba will outline in a moment.
We are also optimistic from a profitability standpoint.
That said, in Q1, we anticipate a small non-recurring headwinds to net income.
As you may have heard, Thailand, along with other countries in Southeast Asia has recently seen a rapidly growing number of COVID-19 cases.
In response, lockdowns and other measures have been imposed, which primarily impact social gatherings.
Our manufacturing facilities are fully operational, but we have implemented additional safeguards beyond what we have been doing for the past 1.5 years in order to protect our staff.
This includes increased testing and sending people home with pay, if they test positive for COVID-19.
In addition, we have been granted permission by the Thai government to vaccinate our employees and have been carrying out this initiative for the past several weeks at our expense.
We are very pleased that at this time the vast majority of our employees have already received their second doses, such that by the end of this month, approximately 90% of our employees in Thailand will be considered fully vaccinated.
We are proud to be able to carry out this effort that has both a very positive social impact, while also being good for our business, and we believe it will further enhance our very favorable reputation as an excellent employer in Thailand.
As we communicated earlier this year, we have broken ground on a new 1 million square foot building at our Chonburi campus.
Construction is progressing and we expect the building to be complete in about one year.
We also previously discussed our intention to add approximately 100,000 square feet of manufacturing space at our Pinehurst campus.
Just after the end of the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of 15 acres of land that had become available adjacent to our Pinehurst facility.
This size will enable us to relocate some non-manufacturing activities from the current campus, which will allow us to increase our manufacturing footprint within our existing buildings.
As a result, we are confident that we will continue to have ample capacity to satisfy the growing customer demand we are experiencing.
In summary, we had a very strong finish to a record year.
We are optimistic about demand trends from all the markets we serve and we are well positioned to continue to deliver excellent results over the longer term.
We had a strong finish to a record year with...
... this at $41.1 million, up 14% from the third quarter.
Sensor revenue was $3.6 million and other non-optical communications revenue was up 14% to $28.2 million [Phonetic].
Now turning to the details of our P&L.
Gross margin of 12.3%, up 10 basis points from Q3 and was at the highest level in four years.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $12 million or 2.4% of revenue, reflecting our operating leverage, resulting in operating income of $50.5 million or 9.9% of revenue, a record for the Company.
During the fourth quarter, we have recorded a tax benefit of $2.1 million.
This is primarily due to the reversal of evaluation allowance related to certain subsidiaries as a result of better operating performance and effective control of operating expenses.
We anticipate that our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 will be approximately 4%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record at $49.4 million or $1.39 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, net income was also a record at $42.4 million or $1.13 per diluted share.
For the full year, revenue was $1.88 billion, an increase of 14% from the prior year.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 12.1% and operating margins were 9.5% of revenue.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the year was $4.67, up a strong 25% from fiscal year 2020.
We report 10% customers annually and in fiscal year 2021, we had three 10% customers.
Cisco and Lumentum both represented 14% of revenue and the Infinera represented 12% of revenue for the year.
Note that the Cisco revenue contribution includes a partial year impact from Cisco's acquisition of Acacia.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition, Acacia would also have been a 10% customer in fiscal year 2021.
Our Top 10 customers represented 78% of revenue, compared to 79% in fiscal year 2020.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
At the end of the fourth quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $548.1 million, an increase of $39.2 million from the end of the third quarter.
Operating cash flow was $43.5 million with capex of $13.5 million; free cash flow was $30 million in the quarter.
In addition to expenses related to construction at our Chonburi campus, the recently purchased 15 acres of land, adjacent to our Pinehurst campus that will facilitate the manufacturing expansion we have in progress at that campus.
Of the $13.2 million purchase price, 10% was paid during the fourth quarter and the remainder was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
We remain active in our share repurchase plan, and during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 123,000 [Phonetic] shares at an average price of $85.88 for a total cash outlay of $10.5 million.
Approximately $81.2 million remains in our buyback authorization.
Now, I would like to turn to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
We are entering the year from a position of strength and remain optimistic about the markets we serve, and our ability to execute.
For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue in the range of $510-530 million, which will represent another record quarter for Fabrinet.
From a profitability perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.36 per diluted share.
I'd like to point out that this guidance includes the impact of our customary annual merit increases as well as approximately a $0.04 to $0.05 impact from the cost we are incurring in order to safeguard our employees through the vaccination program that Seamus described.
We believe this employee safety costs are non-reoccurring, and that this program benefits our employees and their families, as well as the continued operational success of our business.
If not for these non-recurring costs, our non-GAAP net income guidance for Q1 would have represented another quarterly record for the Company.
In summary, we are proud of our record fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 performances.
We are excited about the prospects ahead and look forward to continued success for all our stakeholders.

Below is an earnings call transcript.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me on the call today are Don Kimble, our chief financial officer, and Mark Midkiff, our chief risk officer.
I'm now moving to Slide 3.
We delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.72.
This is an increase of 18% from the first quarter and up significantly from the year-ago period.
Our results reflect our success in acquiring and deepening relationships across our franchise, further improvement in credit quality, and contributions from targeted investments.
We generated positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis and remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year.
We generated record second-quarter revenue, driven by an 8% year-over-year increase in noninterest income.
In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in new households in the first six months, in every one of our markets, and in every age group.
Importantly, some of our strongest growth has come from younger clients in the western part of our franchise.
Our new client growth over the past six months exceeds our growth in any full-year period over the last decade.
Additionally, our consumer business generated over 4 billion in loan originations for the quarter.
Mortgage originations reached another all-time high and we expect to exceed last year's record level of 8.3 billion for the full year.
Laurel Road also had another strong quarter despite the federal student loan holiday.
Since the launch of our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors, we have added over 2,500 new doctors and dentists.
The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together several critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, healthcare, and primacy.
Moving to our commercial businesses.
We had another strong quarter.
Our investment banking business generated fees of 217 million, a record second-quarter level and the second-highest quarterly level in our history.
We experienced growth across the entire platform.
We have grown this business consistently over the past decade, and we expect to grow it again in 2021.
Importantly, this is a business driven primarily by repeat clients.
Our pipelines are currently at record levels, supporting our strong growth outlook for the business.
This quarter, we raised $21 billion for our clients, of which we retained approximately 20% on our balance sheet.
Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make across our franchise, in digital, in analytics, and in our teammates.
Let me highlight just a few of these investments.
I've already mentioned Laurel Road and the launch of our National Digital Bank.
Not only have we accelerated client acquisition, but our new clients are doing more with us with approximately half of our new doctor and dentist using multiple products.
We also continued to build out our analytic capabilities, including our recent acquisition of AQN Strategies, we have doubled the size of our analytics team.
Year to date, we have increased our senior bankers by 5% and in our targeted growth areas.
This has resulted in a 21% increase in client pitches on a year-to-date basis.
We also consolidated 54 branches this quarter with an additional 14 planned for next quarter.
These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support our ongoing investments.
Shifting to credit quality.
Our trends remained positive this quarter.
Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were nine basis points.
We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles.
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%, which is above our targeted range of 9 to 9.5%.
Our ...
...tations.
For the second quarter, net charge-offs were $22 million or nine basis points of average loans.
Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $222 million.
This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics, as well as our outlook for the overall economy.
Nonperforming loans were $694 million this quarter or 69 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $34 million from the prior quarter.
Additionally, criticized loans declined and the over 90-day delinquencies improved quarter over quarter.
Now on to Slide 12.
Key's capital position remains an area of strength.
We ended the second quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, which places us above our targeted range of 9 to 9.5%.
This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.
Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities.
We repurchased $300 million of common shares during the quarter, and our board of directors authorized a second-quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share.
As Chris mentioned, combined, this return of capital represents $0.50 a share this quarter an annualized return of 11% of our current valuation.
Earlier this month, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continue through the third quarter of 2022.
The board will also evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.
On Slide 13, we provide our updated full-year 2021 outlook, which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage this year.
Average loans are still expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of the PPP program, and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this year.
We expect deposits to be up high single digits, reflecting the continued outperformance we have seen to date.
We will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base.
Net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable, reflecting a low-rate environment, as well as the slightly lower-than-expected loan balances.
Our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact of excess liquidity on our balance sheet.
Noninterest income should be now up in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, reflecting the broad-based growth in most of our core fee-based businesses, including what is expected to be another record year for our investment banking business.
Given the stronger revenue outlook, we now expect noninterest expense to be up low single digits, with the primary driver being higher production-related incentives.
As we identified on our expense side, we are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth, namely teammates, technology, and also rolling out new capabilities such as Laurel Road, does not change our focus on core expenses and driving further efficiencies, including our commitment to generate positive operating leverage for the year.
Moving to credit quality.
We have reduced our net charge-off guidance once again, which is now expected to be in the 20 to 30-basis-point range for the year.
This reflects the quality of our portfolio, our current outlook, and performance to date.
And our guidance for the GAAP tax rate has increased to 20% for the full year, reflecting the higher expected earnings for this year.
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged.
We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns.
Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We're well positioned to continue enhancing shareholder value as we look ahead to the balance of 2021 and beyond.
In July, we announced a roughly 2% increase in our common stock dividend effective later this month, thus making 2021 our 32nd consecutive year of annual dividend increases.
National Retail Properties is in the select company of only 85 U.S. public companies, including only two other REITs, which have achieved this impressive track record.
Based on our strong performance, we announced today a further increase in our 2021 guidance for core FFO per share to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 per share.
Our long-standing strategy is designed and executed to generate consistent per share growth on a multiyear basis.
And as the disruption caused by the pandemic and related store closures is easing, the value of this long-term approach is reflected in our second guidance increase this year.
Turning to the highlights of National Retail Properties second quarter financial results.
Our portfolio of 3,173 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continue to perform exceedingly well.
Occupancy was consistent with the prior quarter at 98.3%, which remains above our long-term average of 98%.
We also announced collection of 99% of rents due for the second quarter.
Collection of previously deferred rent remained at an equally high percentage and we forgave almost no rent during the quarter.
These impressive collection results compare very favorably to other retail real estate companies including those with a significantly higher percentage of investment-grade tenants.
Moreover, we believe that these results validate our strategy of doing direct sale leaseback transactions with large regional and national operators for well-located real estate parcels at low cost per property and reasonable rents.
And while we're on the topic of large tenants, I'm pleased to report that one of our top tenants, Mister Car Wash, recently completed its initial public offering.
Congratulations to John Lai and the entire management team at this impressive company.
Mister Car Wash was one of our first relationship tenants 15 years ago, and we're very proud of the role that National Retail Properties has played in that company's growth and success.
During the quarter, we invested just under $103 million in 29 new properties at an initial cash cap rate of 6.7% and with an average lease duration of over 17 years.
Almost all of our acquisitions were from relationship tenants with which we do repeat programmatic business.
Year-to-date, we've invested over $208 million in 58 new properties leased to 10 different relationship tenants at an initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and an average lease duration of 17.5 years.
In an environment where cap rates remain near all-time lows, we will continue to be very thoughtful in our underwriting and primarily pursue sale-leaseback transactions with our portfolio of relationship tenants.
Based on our pipeline and conversations with those relationship tenants, we remain comfortable with our ability to meet and hopefully exceed our 2021 acquisition guidance of $400 million to $500 million, primarily via direct sale-leaseback transactions with long duration leases.
During the second quarter, we also sold 15 properties, raising almost $23 million of proceeds to be reinvested in new acquisitions.
And year-to-date, we've now raised over $40 million from the sale of 26 properties, including 15 vacant properties.
Although job one is always to release vacancies and our leasing team does an excellent job of it.
We'll continue to sell nonperforming assets if we don't see a clear path to generating rental income within a reasonable time period.
Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in our sector.
In June, Kevin led the recast of our unsecured line of credit, increasing the capacity of our facility from $900 million to $1.1 billion.
Although our credit line has been upsized, the balance outstanding remains the same, 0, and we ended the quarter with approximately $250 million of cash on hand.
With no material debt maturities until 2024, we remain well positioned to fund our 2021 acquisition guidance without needing to tap the capital markets.
That's up $0.01 from the preceding first quarter, $0.69 per share, and it's up $0.05 from the prior year's $0.65.
Today, we also reported that AFFO per share was $0.77 per share for the second quarter and that's also up $0.01 from the preceding first quarter $0.76.
We did footnote this amount includes $8.3 million of deferred rent repayments and our accrued rental income adjustment in the second quarter AFFO number.
So without that, we would have produced AFFO of $0.72 per share.
So excluding those deferral repayments, our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the first six months was 72.7%, that's fairly consistent with prior year's levels.
Occupancy, as Jay mentioned, was 98.3% at quarter end.
That's been fairly flat compared to recent quarters.
G-and-A expense was $11.9 million for the second quarter.
The increase for the quarter and the six months was largely driven by incentive compensation.
Rent collections continue to remain strong in the second quarter.
As Jay mentioned, today, we reported rent collections of approximately 99% for the second quarter rent.
Collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent about 7% of our total annual base rent improved to approximately 92% for the second quarter rent, and that's up from 80% previously reported for that cohort in the first quarter of 2021.
As Jay noted, we increased our 2021 core FFO per share guidance from a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share to a new range of $2.75 to $2.80 per share.
This incorporates the better-than-expected rent collections and the actual results in the first half of 2021.
The driver for the increase in our full year guidance is the assumed higher rent collection rate more in line with our current collection rates.
So while we previously assumed 80% rent collection from the $50 million of cash basis tenant annual base rent, we are now assuming 90% rent collections that incremental 10% amounts to about $5 million on an annual basis.
And for the remainder of our tenants, we continue to assume 1% of potential rent loss.
And again, that's consistent with our prior guidance.
We ended the quarter with $250 million of cash on hand and no amounts outstanding on our newly recast $1.1 billion bank credit facility.
This bank line, as Jay noted, increased from $900 million in size to $1.1 billion.
The interest rate was reduced 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 77 basis points and maturity was extended to June of 2025.
Our liquidity is in excellent shape, our weighted average debt maturity is now 13 years with a 3.7% weighted average fixed interest rate.
Our next debt maturity is $350 million with a 3.9% coupon in mid-2024.
The very good liquidity and leverage position have no real need to raise any additional capital to meet 2021 acquisition guidance, and we're well positioned as we look forward to 2022.
A couple of numbers.
Net debt to gross book assets was 35%.
At quarter end, net debt to EBITDA was 5.0 times at June 30.
Interest coverage, 4.7 times and fixed charge coverage 4.2 times for the second quarter.
Only five of our 3,000-plus properties are encumbered by mortgages.
So 2021 is shaping up to be a very solid year for us as the economy and retailers capture the government stimulus, which feels like it will have some tailwinds in 2022.
Our focus remains over the long term as we continue to endeavor to give NNN the best opportunity to succeed in the coming years and, importantly, growing per share results.
And with that, Tom, we will open it up to any questions.
