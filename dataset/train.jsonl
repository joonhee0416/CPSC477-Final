You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n On the call are Jeff Mezger, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Matt Mandino, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Kaminski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hollinger, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Thad Johnson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.\r\nAnd with that, here is Jeff Mezger.\r\nWe delivered healthy results in the second quarter marked by one of the strongest quarters for both operating and gross margin performance in some time.\r\nOperationally, our divisions are doing an excellent job of navigating this environment of demand strength and well-publicized supply chain constraints as we effectively balance pace, price and starts to optimize our assets and manage our production.\r\nWith our full year coming into better view, we are poised for continued returns-focused growth expanding our scale to about $6 billion in revenues and generating a return on equity of roughly 20%.\r\nAs for the details of the quarter, we produced total revenues of $1.44 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.50.\r\nWe achieved an operating income margin of 11.3% driven by several factors.\r\nIn addition to strong market conditions, we are benefiting from solid performance in our newer communities, operating leverage from both the increase in our community absorption rate as well as overall higher revenues, disciplined management of our SG&A costs and the ongoing tailwind from lower interest amortization.\r\nOur profitability per unit grew meaningfully on a sequential basis to nearly $47,000.\r\nWe achieved or surpassed our expectations across our financial metrics, although deliveries were at the low end of our range as some of our deliveries shifted into the third quarter due to supply shortages and municipal delays.\r\nThat said, with the benefit of local scale in most of our divisions, we are relying on our long-standing relationships with subcontractors and trade partners to mitigate delays.\r\nWith the progression of our work in process and our success in accelerating starts, we are confident in our ability to achieve full-year deliveries of between 14,000 and 14,500 homes.\r\nOur balance sheet is solid.\r\nHaving worked through the bulk of our inactive assets, our inventory has rotated into a higher-quality portfolio of communities.\r\nWe have grown our equity while reducing our debt resulting in a significantly lower leverage ratio, which we expect will decline further by year-end.\r\nWe recently completed a $390 million debt offering, the net proceeds from which together with a portion of our existing cash will be used to retire our '21 maturity in full.\r\nUltimately the offering will contribute to a reduction of our debt levels and lower our average borrowing rate, providing an ongoing tailwind to our future margins.\r\nWe continue to allocate the substantial cash we are generating in a consistent manner prioritizing our future growth to drive greater earnings and returns.\r\nIn addition, our balanced approach includes returning cash to stockholders, primarily through our quarterly dividend, which we have raised in each of the past few years and reducing our debt, as I just mentioned.\r\nIn the second quarter, we invested $575 million in land acquisition and development, expanding our lot position sequentially by 7,800 lots to roughly 77,500 lots owned or controlled with 45% of the total optioned.\r\nThis growth in active inventory, together with improving margins, should help to drive further improvement in our return on equity.\r\nAs we discussed last quarter, we are assuming a lower monthly absorption in our underwriting as compared to our current pace and no inflation either in ASP or costs.\r\nIn addition, we are pursuing moderately sized deals in our preferred submarkets averaging between 100 and 150 lots and staying on strategy and positioning these new communities to be attainable near the median household income for that sub-market.\r\nWe believe using this disciplined approach helps to manage our risk as we acquire land throughout this cycle.\r\nWhile we expect our near-term growth to come primarily from our existing markets as we work to gain market share and expand our scale, we are also selectively entering new markets.\r\nAlong with our success in Seattle and recent reentry into Charlotte, we are announcing today that we have started up a division in Boise, Idaho, a top 25 housing market.\r\nWe see a meaningful opportunity in this fast-growing metro area to offer our personalized homes at affordable prices and we are excited about extending our market strategy to Boise.\r\nWe now have over 900 lots under control and anticipate our first land parcel closing in the third quarter.\r\nWe successfully opened 33 new communities in the second quarter.\r\nHowever, as a result of the heightened demand for our homes, we sold out more communities than we had projected and also experienced slippage in some community openings.\r\nJeff will provide more detail on our community count expectations for this year in a moment.\r\nLooking forward to 2022 with our strong lot pipeline, we remain on track for double-digit year-over-year community count growth.\r\nAs we prepare for the significant acceleration of new community openings over the next six quarters, we have also stayed focused on building our backlog to drive our revenues for the balance of this year and into 2022.\r\nOur monthly absorption rate rose to seven net orders per community during the second quarter, even as we managed sales primarily through price increases and secondarily through lot releases in order to balance pace, price and starts.\r\nWe are sensitive to affordability as we work to stay within appropriate range near the median household income of each submarket.\r\nOur order ASP has climbed in the past three months, reflecting a combination of mix as well as rising prices.\r\nOur largest sequential net order increase was in our West Coast region.\r\nAlthough this region carries our highest average selling price, it remains competitive with resales within our submarkets.\r\nOur Los Angeles/Ventura business provides a good example.\r\nThis division generated the strongest sequential order growth in the second quarter.\r\nAnd although it operates at a higher ASP, it is still below the median resale price of homes in its submarkets which are as much as $100,000 higher and selling within a few weeks of being listed.\r\nResale prices have moved significantly and our relative position has actually been enhanced.\r\nAs to lot releases, our approach is similar to how we gauge interest in a new community.\r\nHomebuyers complete an application and go through their initial credit process to join a list of qualified buyers.\r\nWe then work through that list as we release lots.\r\nWe are typically raising prices in conjunction with each lot release and have not seen a decrease in the conversion of qualified buyers even as base prices have risen.\r\nOur teams work hard to earn our place as the number one customer ranked national homebuilder in third party customer satisfaction surveys by prioritizing service and the relationships we have with our buyers and we're focused on continuing to do so during this time of limited supply.\r\nThe metrics that we monitor internally for shifts in affordability are stable.\r\nBuyers are not adjusting the size of the homes they are purchasing to stay in the market.\r\nAlthough we offer floor plans below 1,600 square feet in over 75% of our communities, buyers are still selecting homes averaging 2,100 feet, which is consistent with their choices over the past couple of years.\r\nAs is evident in our results, the desire for homeownership is strong and we believe will remain so for the foreseeable future.\r\nThere are two primary factors in forming our view.\r\nThe first is an acute shortage of supply stemming not only from limited resale inventory, but also from the under production of new homes over the past 15 years.\r\nThis deficit will take many years to correct and unti Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

which we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise.\r\nOur Chairman and CEO, Clarence Smith will now give you an update on our results.\r\nAnd then, our President, Steve Burdette will provide additional commentary about our business.\r\nWe're very pleased with the record results for the second quarter with sales of $250 million.\r\nWe've done a good job in our expense controls across the board, and combined with pricing disciplines from the merchandising teams and stores, we achieved solid gross margins and 11.7% pre-tax operating profits.\r\nOur ongoing objectives are to grow market share in our existing distribution footprint and maintain double-digit operating margins.\r\nWe believe that the increased importance of home that was jump-started with the impact of COVID last spring is a longer-term trend.\r\nWhile we don't expect the rush that impacted our industry to be at the elevated levels we experienced in recent quarters, we do believe that home is a priority and a sustainable trend for the near future.\r\nThe strong desire for homeownership, combined with Havertys strong positioning in Florida, Texas and the Southeast, puts us in an ideal position for today and for the future.\r\nOur supply merchandising and distribution teams are working with our factories and shippers to bring in product to fill orders and reduce our record backlog.\r\nThe shipping challenges that home-related industries are experiencing have caused major delays for furniture, which we believe will be problems until the spring of 2022.\r\nWe are working to increase our inventories as the production and product flow improves.\r\nWe're investing in our distribution capacity to support growth over $1 billion over our regions.\r\nWe just completed additional racking to our mothership, the Eastern Distribution Center in Braselton, Georgia, which adds 20% more storage capacity.\r\nWe will evaluate potential expansions to our network to better serve our planned growth.\r\nOur current focus is on building market share in our key markets with store positioning and target marketing to our core customer and new homeowners.\r\nExamples of this were the opening of Myrtle Beach earlier this year, the opening of a third store in Austin, in the fast-growing Pflugerville, Round Rock markets and a store opening tomorrow in the villages in Central Florida.\r\nWe're in a deep dive reviewing potential locations in our best markets, which will reach the fastest-growing areas and leverage our existing infrastructure.\r\nWe expect to announce several new fill-in locations for the 2022 openings.\r\nWe're very excited about the rollout of the WE FURNISH HAPPINESS marketing campaign, which we believe more clearly separates Havertys from our competitors and continues to raise the bar on service, quality, furniture and design.\r\nWe continue to be focused on our front door, havertys.com.\r\nWe've committed to significant investments in IT and state-of-the-art systems to better reach and appeal to our customers.\r\nWe've contracted with Adobe to bring on a collection of applications and services that will lay the foundation for unmatched customer experience.\r\nThe new foundation will improve functionality, help us create content easier and faster, provide better personalizations using AI-driven automation and enhance our analytics and reporting.\r\nOur goal is to have the best-in-class website experience.\r\nI'm very excited with our results for the second quarter.\r\nThis performance was due to the commitment, passion and determination of the store, distribution, home delivery, service and home office teams, whom I want to congratulate personally for their efforts.\r\nOur supply chain network has been able to increase the flow of products into our warehouses over the second quarter even with all the headwinds.\r\nContainer capacity continues to be under pressure with the continued increase in demand across all of retail.\r\nWe expect this to continue to be an issue for the remainder of the year, even if there is a softening in demand.\r\nAlso, container prices on the spot market continue to increase with prices varying between $12,000 and $22,000 a container.\r\nWe have been able to balance our shipping mix, so that no more than 20% to 30% is on the water at one-time at these increased rates.\r\nAs I stated last quarter, we finalized our contracts on May 1, which are significantly below the spot market rates.\r\nFoam continues to be an issue for some of our domestic vendors, however, their production has increased during the second quarter, but still not at 100%.\r\nOur import vendors are not having any foam issues.\r\nThe recent closures in Vietnam due to the increased spread of the Delta variant are not expected to have an impact on our customers, if the closures remain at the projected two weeks.\r\nThey are expected to open back up beginning the week of 8/2.\r\nHowever, if the closures are prolonged four to six weeks then there may be an impact to our customers, who already bought and future customer lead times.\r\nAlso, we are seeing port congestion in Vietnam and China, along with continued issues at the LA port and railyards.\r\nOur merchandising and supply chain teams are monitoring the situation very closely with our vendors.\r\nOur pool is now approximately 2 times larger than last year, with the average pool age stretching to approximately eight weeks from six weeks over the last 90 days.\r\nOur special order lead times have increased to 12 weeks to 20 weeks, depending on the vendor, causing some softening in our special order business.\r\nOur distribution, home delivery service network delivered a record quarter.\r\nOver 90% of our markets are delivering within a week to the customer's home once we have the product in our warehouses.\r\nStaffing continues to be our #1 concern in both distribution and home delivery.\r\nThe extra unemployment moneys that have stopped in most of the states we operate our warehouses, but there is still not enough people looking for work to fill the jobs available.\r\nHowever, we remain optimistic that we will see this improve during the third quarter.\r\nIn the second quarter of 2021, delivered sales were $250 million, a 127.3% increase over the prior year quarter.\r\nIf you recall, our retail operations were closed due to the pandemic in the month of April in 2020.\r\n103 stores reopened on May 1, 2020, and the remaining stores reopened by June 20th.\r\nTotal written sales for the second quarter of 2021 were up 67.5% over the prior year period.\r\nComparable store sales were up 46.9% over the prior year period.\r\nThis only include stores that were open for a full month in both periods.\r\nOur gross profit margin increased 240 basis points from 54.2% to 56.6% due to better merchandising, pricing and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.\r\nThese improvements were partially offset by an increase in our LIFO reserve as we continue to see increased freight and product cost.\r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $39.8 million or 54.7% to $112.4 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.\r\nHowever, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined over 2,000 basis points to 45% from 66.1%.\r\nAs demonstrated in the past three quarters, our financial model has substantial operating leverage at these sales levels.\r\nOther income in the second quarter of 2020 was $31.8 million, which included the gain on the sale-leaseback transaction of three distribution facilities in 2020.\r\nIf you recall, the gross proceeds from the sale was approximately $70 million.\r\nIncome before income taxes increased $10.5 million to $29.2 million.\r\nOur tax expense was $6.3 million during the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.6%.\r\nThe primary difference in the effective rate and statutory rate is

record operating income margin of 15.4%; and record free cash flow of $271 million, representing a growth of 77% or $118 million versus prior year.\r\nFrom an operational excellence standpoint, we continued our journey of betterment.\r\nOur productivity and cost actions helped to offset the impact of materially lower volumes.\r\nIn the third quarter, I was very fortunate, I was able to visit many of our sites in Europe and the U.S. Let me tell you, we have many opportunities, and we will go after them.\r\nI also experienced the progress made firsthand, progress that helped us to deliver 14.1% operating margin at IP.\r\nThis is the highest Industrial Process Q3 margin ever, and we continue to confidently progress toward our long-term 15% plus margin target.\r\nThe breadth of the operational improvements delivered by George and his team is impressive, not only because of the quality of execution, but also because of the care they put into structurally resetting IP for the long term.\r\nWe are actively shaping our manufacturing footprint and redesigning our product portfolio to establish a lasting competitive mode and superior margin performance for IP in the years to come.\r\nThis 14.1% margin performance represented 120 basis point expansion versus prior year, and 40 basis points higher than Q2 this year.\r\nOur progress was also evident when I was with the MT team in Barge.\r\nMotion Technologies delivered a strong operating margin at 18.5%, up 630 basis points versus Q2 and only 30 basis points below prior year.\r\nWe continue to drive productivities through our factories, and China and Mexico, in particular, keep on impressing with margins near all-time highs.\r\nAt CCT, I was encouraged by the many Kaizen events running in our Valencia site.\r\nAnd all across ITT, we drove high levels of productivity that produce significant segment margin expansion compared to Q2.\r\nThese operational excellence, combined with our speed and execution, enabled us to accelerate working capital reduction and post a year-over-year 180 basis points improvement.\r\nOn the customer front, our teams continue to focus on serving our customers with utmost dedication, showing through their actions that our customer-centric approach is a way of life at today's ITT.\r\nOur Friction OE sales grew 92% sequentially, and the momentum in shared gains continued with each one of our main regions outperforming global production year-to-date, including over 1,000 basis points of outperformance in North America and China.\r\nWhile we still experience inventory adjustment issues in Europe with certain customers in the first half of Q3, we saw encouraging signs in auto OE production, particularly in September and October.\r\nWe now expect Friction OE outperformance for the full year at the lower end of our expectations based on the timing of new platform ramps in the fourth quarter.\r\nIP grew organic short-cycle pump orders by 14% sequentially on the back of strong part, which improved gradually during the quarter and showed year-over-year growth in September.\r\nIP delivered a book-to-bill of 1.\r\nAnd as a result, our backlog at the end of Q3 was up 6%, excluding foreign exchange compared to the beginning of 2020.\r\nIP continues to lead in on-time delivery performance.\r\nToday, our customers know they can rely on us to deliver top-quality Goulds Pumps on time at a competitive price and consistently.\r\nThis is a key differentiator.\r\nWe've been talking a lot about Seneca Falls' 95% plus baseline pumps delivery performance for the last 12 months.\r\nAnd I want you to know that today, the rest of our facilities have been performing at an industry-leading level as well.\r\nFinally, at CCT, we have been busy playing offense and finding new ways to partner with our customers.\r\nOur elastomeric rotorcraft business has been nominated on the next U.S. military reconnaissance helicopter code named FARA.\r\nThis is a major recognition for our rotorcraft business, which we created organically just a few years ago.\r\nAnd our composites business is finalizing a strategic partnership with a large aircraft engine manufacturer that we propel our Matrix business to new top line heights.\r\nThe team at CCT has been working hard to adjust our cost structure to the new aero market conditions, and at the same time, looking for growth opportunities by showcasing our engineering prowess.\r\nI was at our Valencia facility last week, and I was impressed by our new state-of-the-art sound chamber capabilities as well as our new product Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

{"filename": "MFA_q3_2020.txt", "text": "<s>[INST] You are a financial advisor tasked with creating a short summary of an earnings call transcript. You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n These types of statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including those described in MFA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and other reports that it may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to again recognize our entire MFA team.\r\nThis has obviously been a very challenging year and despite what the world has thrown at us, our team continues to persevere regardless of the circumstances.\r\nTheir dedication and commitment has been extraordinary.\r\nFrom a financial-results standpoint, the third quarter of 2020 was unquestionably the most normal quarter of 2020, but that's not really saying very much.\r\nFinancial markets continue to be awash in liquidity and the interest rate environment continues to feature historically low rates and muted volatility.\r\nYet the third quarter of 2020 was also very much the story of market uncertainty.\r\nBetween the looming election still not decided, government stimulus measures or not, the second wave of COVID-19 diagnoses, and the possibility of future lockdowns, shutdowns, or other economically restrictive measures, it's clear that we are not out of the woods and it seems almost impossible to fathom what the upcoming holiday season will be like, given this backdrop.\r\nRecall that MFA entered the third quarter of 2020 only four days out of forbearance with a fortified balance sheet and substantial liquidity.\r\nGiven our experience over the prior four months, we were understandably not inclined to immediately and aggressively pursue new investments and to add leverage.\r\nBut that decision was even easier, given the investment environment, which was challenging both in terms of investment availability and relative cheapness.\r\nHowever, as we mentioned in our second-quarter earnings call, we saw significant opportunities to improve our earnings capability through liability management, and I'm happy to report that we have made substantial progress on this front.\r\nWhile the results of these efforts are largely absent from our third-quarter financial results, they will be somewhat in evidence in the fourth quarter and very much in evidence in 2021.\r\nWhat is apparent in our third-quarter financial results is the continued price appreciation of our whole loan portfolio that we fought so hard to retain through the crisis months earlier in the year, contributing to both material economic book value appreciation on carrying value assets and income on fair value assets.\r\nIn addition, our abilities to actively manage residential mortgage credit assets, a capability that we began to develop as early as 2013 has also been reflected in our financial results as we achieved better-than-expected results on credit-sensitive assets, resulting in reversals of prior credit reserves which flow through income.\r\nOverall, we are pleased with our progress since July 1 of this year.\r\nWe have taken definitive steps to enhance our go-forward earnings capability and have a clear path to continue this success over the next several quarters.\r\nOur asset-based liabilities are still largely of a very durable nature.\r\nWe continue to actively manage credit-sensitive assets to achieve good results, and we look forward to continuing to enhance shareholder value.\r\nPlease turn to Page 4.\r\nWe reported GAAP earnings of $0.17 per share for the third quarter.\r\nUnlike the prior two quarters of this year, our third-quarter income was influenced by more normal factors and less by one-time noisy elements.\r\nThese results were largely driven by unrealized gains on our whole loan assets, as well as the reversal in a credit loss provision on whole loans held at carrying value.\r\nGAAP book value was up modestly, but economic book value was up over 10% for the quarter as our carrying value whole loans continued to retrace the writedowns that began with the onset of the pandemic.\r\nOur leverage at September 30 was still quite low at 1.9 to 1 and two-thirds of our asset-based financing was non-mark-to-market.\r\nWe caught up on all preferred dividends in the third quarter and we paid a $0.05 common dividend on October 30.\r\nPlease turn to Page 5.\r\nOur portfolio, which is also shown in the appendix on Page 20, is primarily comprised of residential whole loans, which have experienced substantial value appreciation since the liquidity-induced sell-off in March and April.\r\nHousing prices are very strong, particularly, in suburban neighborhoods outside of major cities.\r\nThis is obviously a good trend for our credit-sensitive assets, but we've been able to take advantage of this in real time, recording over $90 million of REO sales during the third quarter, which is a record quarter for us.\r\nPlease turn to Page 6.\r\nWe have also taken advantage of, one, the extremely low-rate environment; two, the paucity of non-QM product available for securitization; and three, the demand for short, high-quality assets by executing two non-QM securitizations totaling approximately $960 million, one in early September and the other closing just last week.\r\nAs you can see on this page, AAA yields on bonds sold were 1.48% and 1.38%, respectively, and the blended cost of debt sold was between 165 and 180 basis points below the cost of borrowing we replaced.\r\nAlso noteworthy is that while some of this replaced financing was non-mark-to-market, the securitized debt is similarly non-mark-to-market, non-recourse, and term.\r\nSo we actually increased the amount of this more durable financing while substantially lowering the cost.\r\nBonds sold generated cash of approximately 94% and 95% of UPB on the two transactions, which produced a little over $200 million of additional liquidity.\r\nPlease turn to Page 7.\r\nWe are also happy to report that we have fully paid off the $500 million 11% senior secured term note from Apollo and Athene.\r\nThis so-called rescue financing was critical to our forbearance exit, negotiation of non-mark-to-market financing on our loan portfolio, and to fortify our balance sheet.\r\nObviously, this was high-cost debt, but critically, the loan terms permitted repayment without penalty or any yield maintenance provision.\r\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that we did not refund this debt with cheaper debt.\r\nThe liquidity generated by our portfolio was largely the source of these funds.\r\nAnd clearly, the ROE in this investment of paying down this debt was a compelling one.\r\nThe results of this paydown will be partially realized in the fourth quarter but will be fully reflected in financial results in subsequent quarters to the tune of approximately $0.03 per share per quarter.\r\nI can honestly tell you that when we closed on this loan on June 26, I did not expect that we would be announcing its full payoff on our third-quarter earnings call.\r\nPlease turn to Page 8.\r\nSo although we have made good progress on the securitization front, we still have additional wood to chop.\r\nA rated SFR securitization will transition current financing on these assets to cheaper debt while producing additional liquidity.\r\nSimilarly, we still have approximately $1.5 billion of non-QM loans that will hopefully lend themselves to similar securitization executions as we achieved on our first two deals.\r\nAnd finally, we have three outstanding nonrated NPL securitizations that can be called and relevered.\r\nAnd at current market levels, this would offer us additional liquidity while also lowering [Audio gap] Please turn to Page 9.\r\nWe announced today that our board has authorized a $250 million common stock repurchase program.\r\nThis authorization replaces a scale existing authorization for only about $20 million of stock.\r\nAs many of you likely recall, MFA has historically not pursued aggressive share repurchases.\r\nThis was primarily because even when our stock traded at a discount to book, it was rarely a considerable

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.\r\nActual results could differ materially from these statements.\r\nI will provide commentary on our Q1 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to discuss our 2021 priorities.\r\nWe will then open it up for Q&A.\r\nAs usual, we request that you limit yourselves to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.\r\nWe started 2021 in positive fashion with strong organic sales growth despite a very difficult comparison, which included some consumer pantry loading in March of last year.\r\nOur net sales grew 6% in the quarter, organic sales growth of 5% was driven by 0.5% organic volume growth and a 4.5% increase in pricing.\r\nForeign exchange was a 1% tailwind in the quarter.\r\nWhile the tough comparisons, particularly impacted our trends in developed markets, which were flat on an organic sales basis in the quarter, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets with volume up 5.5% and pricing up 6%.\r\nWe also delivered organic sales growth in three of our four categories; Oral Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition, while Personal Care organic sales declined due to difficult comparison.\r\nWe believe our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation, which Noel and Pat Verduin talked about at CAGNY, is bearing fruit, and we will continue to focus in this area to drive future growth.\r\nOur efforts on premiumization and pricing along with our focus on productivity, like our funding-the-growth initiatives, drove improvement year-over-year in our gross margin despite a worsening raw materials environment.\r\nThis gross margin expansion was a key factor in allowing us to deliver base business earnings-per-share growth in line with our full year guidance despite higher logistics costs, incremental advertising spending and investment to build capabilities.\r\nIn the first quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.7% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 50 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis where we were up 40 basis points.\r\nFor the first quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were 310 basis point headwind.\r\nThis is a large impact for the first quarter and it was driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like resins, fats and oils, agriculture-related costs and the transactional impact from foreign exchange.\r\nProductivity was a 180 basis point benefit.\r\nOur SG&A was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales for the first quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis.\r\nThis was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce.\r\nOur SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind growth and innovation.\r\nExcluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year.\r\nFor the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 5% on a base business basis.\r\nOur earnings per share was down 4% on a GAAP basis and up 7% on a base business basis.\r\nOur free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter against a very difficult comparison.\r\nThe decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of accounts payable and other liability, which was mostly due to changes in the timing of payables and income tax payments.\r\nA few comments on our divisional performance.\r\nOur volume declines in the quarter were primarily due to a combination of category deceleration in the face of difficult comparisons as we cycled last year's COVID pantry loading, logistics issues related to a warehouse transition on our U.S. business that impacted our shelf availability and our market shares and the winter storms in February.\r\nThough logistics issues lessened over the last month of the quarter, service levels improved, and we expect service levels to return to normal by the end of the second quarter.\r\nPricing grew mid-single-digits in the quarter as our efforts in revenue growth management for pricing growth across all our categories.\r\nThe combination of higher raw materials costs, higher underlying logistics costs and costs related to remediating the company's specific logistics issues, pressured margins in the North America division.\r\nDespite these headwinds, we continue to invest in advertising, particularly behind premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen and behind the continued strength of Colgate Optic White Renewal.\r\nLatin America net sales were up 2% as 9.5% organic sales growth was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.\r\nWe continue to deliver broad-based organic sales growth in Latin America with organic sales growth in all three categories and in every hub.\r\nAs we highlighted at CAGNY, our innovation in Latin America is driving growth in the premium segment of the toothpaste category.\r\nIn Brazil, Colgate Total is gaining share behind Colgate Total Anti-Tartar, and our Natural Extracts line is gaining share, particularly behind Charcoal.\r\nOur toothpaste value share is flat year-to-date in Brazil and measured channels and is up year-over-year in e-commerce.\r\nEurope net sales grew 6% in the quarter.\r\nOrganic sales were down 2%.\r\nVolume declined 3.5% in the quarter as we lap strong shipments in the year ago period, which was driven by COVID-related demand and pantry loading.\r\nPricing was plus 1.5% as we took pricing across all categories to help offset raw material inflation.\r\nWe're launching equity campaigns across our core oral care equity; Colgate, meridol and elmex, and we're excited about the launch of Sanex Microbiome, which Pat talked about at CAGNY.\r\nWe delivered 16.5% net sales and 11% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest markets; Greater China, India and the Philippines.\r\nWhile China and India benefited from comparisons that included COVID-related shutdowns in 2020, our innovation continues to drive improved underlying performance, particularly in e-commerce.\r\nOver the next several quarters, we will begin to rollout more premium innovation in brick and mortar in China like our Colgate Enzyme Whitening Toothpaste, leveraging the success we have had online in transforming our portfolio.\r\nAfrica/Eurasia net sales grew 8.5% as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division.\r\nVolume grew 5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 8%.\r\nForeign exchange was a 4.5% headwind.\r\nThis growth was led by our toothpaste and manual toothbrush businesses, although we also delivered organic sales growth in personal and home care.\r\nOur business in Turkey delivered strong sales and market share performance, and launched significant premium innovation in naturals, charcoal and whitening.\r\nHill's started the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite lapping significant growth in the year ago period.\r\nDeveloped markets led the growth, particularly the U.S., Canada and Europe led by e-commerce.\r\nEmerging markets grew organic sales greater than 20% in the quarter through a combination of volume and pricing growth.\r\nWe're very excited about our Hill's equity campaign addressing pet obesity.\r\nThis global campaign is leveraging digital, in-store, in-office and traditional media assets to drive growth in our weight control products across both our prescription and wellness businesses.\r\nAnd now for guidance.\r\nWe still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range.\r\nAs we think about our current organic growth assumptions versus where we were three months ago, we're probably a little more cautious on developed markets.\r\nAs you've seen from the scanner data, our categories moved negative more quickly than we had anticipated, and we expect that to continue in the short-term.\r\nHopefully, this allows fo Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.\r\nActual results may differ.\r\nBefore we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, despite the widespread surge in omicron variant cases, gasoline demand held up well.\r\nAnd on diesel, we're seeing highway trucking volumes continuing to meet or exceed seasonal records.\r\nWhile jet demand reached post-pandemic highs in the fourth quarter, it's still roughly 15% below 2019 levels as business travel remains suppressed, but we expect to see recovery in that this year as well.\r\nWhen we spoke with you in November, we were cautious about rising COVID cases this winter and the potential impact.\r\nBased on the trends over the last few months, we've become less concerned about the pace of recovery in transportation fuels demand.\r\ndemand continues to recover.\r\nWe believe that refining margins will be well-positioned for 2022.\r\nOn the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we made continued progress on our priorities.\r\nSince our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we've repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.\r\nThat puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion share repurchase program.\r\nFurther reinforcing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we obtained board approval for an additional $5 billion in share repurchase authorization.\r\nThis brings our total outstanding authorization to approximately $9.5 billion.\r\nToday, we announced our 2022 capital spending outlook.\r\nWe expect MPC will have approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, with approximately 50% of the $1.3 billion growth capital for our Martinez refinery conversion.\r\nTotal costs for the Martinez refinery conversion is estimated at $1.2 billion.\r\nApproximately $300 million has been spent to date, $700 million for 2022 and $200 million for 2023.\r\nThis competitive capital cost is driven by the fact that Martinez' assets are conducive to retrofit, and we can leverage existing infrastructure and logistics.\r\nAt Martinez, the project reached another milestone as a 60-day comment period for the Environmental Impact Report concluded on December 17, 2021.\r\nWe remain committed to progressing the conversion to a renewable fuels facility, engineering is complete and we're ready to begin construction.\r\nOur plan is to have the first phase start-up in the second half of '22.\r\nWe've already sourced some advantaged feedstocks for the Martinez facility and are engaged in negotiations with multiple parties for the balance.\r\nOur strategy is multifaceted, including long-term arrangements, joint ventures, and alliances, all of which are common in this space.\r\nA recent example of our success would be our joint venture with ADM.\r\nWe're also leveraging existing capabilities that are currently supporting Dickinson to optimize between the two facilities.\r\nWe remain confident in our progress and ability to secure feedstocks for Martinez.\r\nOn Kenai, we have been working at sales process since we last communicated.\r\nWe'll be back to you when we have additional details that we can share.\r\nIn 2021, we progressed all three of our strategic initiatives, and Slide 4 highlights this execution.\r\nOn the portfolio, we completed the Speedway sale, receiving $17.2 billion of proceeds from that transaction and securing the 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven.\r\nOur Dickinson renewable diesel facility started up, reached capacity, and we've been successfully optimizing the operation.\r\nWe made two strategic decisions to idle our Gallup refinery and to convert Martinez to a renewable fuels facility.\r\nAnd this year, MPLX produced exceptionally strong cash flow, which provided $2.2 billion of contributions to MPC.\r\nAs we look at cost reduction, what began as a $1.5 billion cost-reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization and now a low-cost culture is becoming embedded in how we conduct our business.\r\nWhile I've been reluctant to share too much, I wanted to highlight a few items that have commercial significance in our portfolio.\r\nIn March of 2021, we started up the Beatrice pretreatment facility, which processes about 3,000 barrels a day of advantaged feedstock for the Dickinson renewable diesel plan.\r\nIn December, we closed on a joint venture with ADM, which will provide approximately 5,000 barrels a day of logistically advantaged feedstock for Dickinson when the new soybean crush plant comes online in 2023.\r\nAnd in January of this year, we successfully started up our Cincinnati pretreatment facility, which will process about 2,000 barrels per day for our Dickinson renewable diesel plant.\r\nWe converted this facility from its original configuration as a biodiesel plant.\r\nOur team's execution on these three strategic priorities builds a foundation for continued value creation and we look forward to sharing updates each quarter as we continue to advance these initiatives.\r\nShifting to Slide 5.\r\nWe remain focused on challenging ourselves to leading in sustainable energy.\r\nWe have three companywide targets on GHG, methane and freshwater intensity than many of our investors and stakeholders know well.\r\nIn the coming weeks, we look forward to providing an update on our progress against these targets and some of our accomplishments in 2021.\r\nSlide 6 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results.\r\nAdjusted earnings exclude $132 million of pre-tax charges related to make-whole premiums for the $2.1 billion in senior notes we redeemed in December.\r\nAdditionally, the adjustments include an incremental $112 million of tax expense, which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.\r\nBeginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we will be reporting our effective tax rate on an actual basis and will no longer adjust our actual results to a 24% tax rate.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $400 million higher from the prior quarter.\r\nCash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion, which is an increase of almost $300 million from the prior quarter.\r\nFinally, during the quarter, we returned $354 million to shareholders through dividend payments and approximately $2.7 billion in share repurchases.\r\nIn the three months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.\r\nSlide 7 illustrates the progress we have made toward lowering our cost structure over the past two years.\r\nAs we think about our strategy on cost structure, I want to emphasize a few things.\r\nWe will never compromise the safety of employees or the integrity of our assets.\r\nAnd we are committed to ensure the current cost reductions are sustainable, even during periods of general cost pressures.\r\nSince the beginning of 2020, we have been able to maintain roughly $1.5 billion of cost reductions that have been taken out of the company's total cost.\r\nRefining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion.\r\nOur refining operating costs in 2020 began at $6 per barrel.\r\nWhile we were able to finish 2021 with a full year operating cost per barrel that was $5.\r\nAdditionally, midstream was reduced by $400 million and corporate cost by about $100 million.\r\nHowever, regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion.\r\nThis improvement is expected to make the company more resilient in future downcycles, while having more bottom-line profitability and upcycles.\r\nTurning to Slide 8.\r\nWe would like to highlight our financial priorities for 2022.\r\nFirst, sustaining capital as we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.\r\nSecond, we're committed to the dividend.\r\nAs we continue to purchase shares, we will reduce the share count and increase the potential of returnable cash flow.\r\nThird, we continue to believe this is bo Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The Refining & Marketing segment performed well, driven by higher refining margins and increased throughput, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions. MPC remains focused on cost reduction, with $1.5 billion in cost reductions since 2020. This includes $1 billion in refining cost reductions and $400 million in midstream cost reductions. The company is also committed to shareholder returns, and since November 2021, it has repurchased $3 billion of shares, representing 55% completion of its $10 billion share repurchase program. Additionally, MPC announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $15 billion. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and an investment-grade credit profile.

pleased to introduce David Simon.\r\nWe had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year.\r\nWe recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales, and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results.\r\nWe generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in '21 or $11.94 per share.\r\nThe $4.5 billion is a record amount for our company for the -- for a year.\r\nAnd coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments, coupled with coherent strategy.\r\nFourth-quarter funds from operations were 1.160 billion -- I'm sorry, $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share.\r\nIncluded in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest.\r\nOur domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year.\r\nOur international operations improved in the quarter.\r\nDomestic property NOI increased 22.4% year over year -- I'm sorry, for the quarter and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties, portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year.\r\nMall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year over year.\r\nAverage base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent.\r\nFor the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet.\r\nThis was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last six years.\r\nRetail sales, reported retail sales continued in the fourth quarter.\r\nMall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 34% year over year.\r\nReported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our Mall and Outlet Business and $645 for the Mills.\r\nThese results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for '21.\r\nOccupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they've been in five years at 12.6% year-end.\r\nand a premium outlet in South Korea.\r\nConstruction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie France opening the spring of '23.\r\nWe completed five significant redevelopments.\r\nWe added densification components with the opening of two hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility.\r\nProgress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall.\r\nWe have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow.\r\nLet me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG, and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe.\r\nJCPenney's results were impressive.\r\nTheir liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion.\r\nThe company de-levered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit.\r\nCEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer.\r\nRGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet, marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth.\r\nSPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There's a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise.\r\nThe Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach.\r\nTRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80% posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting.\r\nReported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year over year.\r\nOccupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year.\r\nNow, turning to the balance sheet.\r\nWe've been active in the debt markets.\r\nWe amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a lower pricing grid for five years.\r\nWe issued $2.75 billion of senior notes 750 million-euro notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%.\r\nWe paid more than $4 billion in debt and de-levered by $1.5 billion.\r\nAnd with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion.\r\nNow, just to turn to dividend.\r\nWe paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year.\r\nToday, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%.\r\nThis dividend is payable on March 31.\r\nNow, just to go through guidance for 2022.\r\nOur FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share.\r\nWhen looking at our '22 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to '21 actual results.\r\nApproximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands.\r\nThese gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for '21.\r\n'21 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average.\r\nOur guidance reflects the following assumptions: Domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney, and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to '21 levels and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition or disposition activity.\r\nAnd for bouncing back in '21 after a very difficult 2020.\r\nMake no mistake about it, '21 was a great year.\r\nAnd I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share.\r\nSo, that's a heck of a year.\r\nI'm

first ever 10-year plan back at our Analyst Day.\r\nWe expressed that and are reiterating today that we are a management team who can execute.\r\nWe believe we will continue to demonstrate that for you.\r\nThis marks my sixth quarter with CenterPoint and Jason's fifth.\r\nI'd like to first start by laying out how we are building a consistent track record of delivery.\r\nFirst, if you recall, the CenterPoint value proposition we laid out at our recent Analyst Day focused on our efforts to achieve sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities.\r\nI believe we are continuing down the path of achieving this value proposition.\r\nEach quarter under the new CenterPoint leadership, we have met or exceeded quarterly utility earnings per share and dividend expectations.\r\nWe have increased our annual utility earnings per share guidance for both 2020 and 2021.\r\nAnd as I will discuss shortly, today, we are increasing our 2021 utility earnings per share guidance once again.\r\nOur 2021 through 2024 annual utility earnings per share growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility earnings per share guidance range each year from 2025 to 2030.\r\nI am confident in our team's ability to achieve that growth.\r\nLast year, we had a $13 billion 5-year capital plan.\r\nWe increased that to $16 billion in our 2020 Analyst Day.\r\nIn this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus.\r\nWe introduced our first ever 10-year capital plan.\r\nCenterPoint remains ripe with opportunities across our footprint to expand and harden our system to benefit customers and shareholders.\r\nOur current 10-year plan contains no external equity issuances.\r\nWe will fund the equity portion of our capital needs to internally generated operating cash flows and our already announced strategic transactions.\r\nWe are also executing on our plan to become a pure-play regulated utility as we approach the closing of the Enable ET merger expected by the end of this year and then our subsequent sell-down of our midstream stake.\r\nWith the recent settlement agreement among the parties in Arkansas, we are also moving toward the completion of our LDC asset sale.\r\nThe remaining steps include the Oklahoma approval, which is anticipated to be received in November and the all-party settlement in Arkansas is expected to be approved by mid-December.\r\nAnd with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to executing our goals to be net 0 on direct emissions by 2035.\r\nWe continue to believe that this is an achievable path delivering for customers, regulators, investors and the environment.\r\nIn the third quarter of 2020, I said that I will not be satisfied until we are recognized as a premium utility.\r\nIn the theme of our Analyst Day was again establishing a path toward a premium.\r\nI believe we are making tremendous strides down that path.\r\nThe storm headwinds of up to 90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power.\r\nWithin three days, we had 95% of the power restored for those customers.\r\nAnd within five days, the whole system was back online.\r\nNow for this quarter's headlines.\r\nOur year-to-date financial progress has been strong.\r\nWe are reporting a utility earnings per share beat and are raising our full year outlook this quarter.\r\nFor the third time this year, we are increasing our 2021 utility earnings per share guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year.\r\nAnd for the first nine months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal.\r\nMore importantly, we are still targeting an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024.\r\nSo this raises our guidance for 2022 utility earnings per share to $1.36 to $1.38.\r\nFor the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the third quarter of 2020.\r\nIn the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our most recent Board implemented governance changes.\r\nJason will get into more detail on the variances shortly.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have increased our five-year capital plans to $18 billion plus over the next five years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years.\r\nThis is nearly a 40% increase in our five-year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020.\r\nThis includes new opportunities that stem from the latest legislative session in Texas.\r\nOne of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into rate base mobile generation units.\r\nWe move quickly on this opportunity and procured [Indecipherable] five-megawatt and 30-megawatt mobile generation units, some of which we were able to deploy during Hurricane Nicholas as backup while crews worked to repair our system.\r\nAnd recently, during an ERCOT forecasted Texas wide load-shedding event, the Texas PUC [Indecipherable] to make sure our units were ready to support customers.\r\nWe were the first the utility in the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law intended.\r\nWe look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the Texas legislature to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages.\r\nWe already have an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months.\r\nWe believe that with the deployment of these additional tools, we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers.\r\nDue to recent weather events in both Louisiana and Texas, we are running slightly behind on our capital spending plans on a year-to-date basis.\r\nThese weather events pulled away many of our contract crews, so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities, especially in Louisiana.\r\nTherefore, while deployed elsewhere, they cannot work on our capital projects, but we have a catch-up plan in place and anticipate making the short fall of.\r\nIn anticipation of continued labor shortages and as we ramp up our capital plans in the coming years, we have now moved to procure additional contractor resources from multiple suppliers.\r\nWe believe that this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years.\r\nWe remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions.\r\nWe've already realized the benefit of some of these improvements this year.\r\nWe stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately $20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources.\r\nSo far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our team's ability to continue to execute toward this goal for the balance of the year.\r\nThis allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs which helps to mitigate rate pressures whi Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I hope you, your colleagues and loved ones are staying safe and healthy.\r\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a global challenge, we remain dedicated to the safety of everyone in the entire Skechers organization and appreciate their ongoing efforts and resiliency during this difficult period.\r\nWhile many countries' restrictions are easing, our thoughts are with those regions facing another coronavirus wave.\r\nAs is the case with most businesses, the pandemic continued to impact Skechers but the high demand for our comfort technology product resulted in a strong beginning to 2021 and it feels reminiscent of 2019.\r\nIn the first quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 15% over the same period last year, which resulted in our first quarterly sales of more than $1.4 billion.\r\nThis was done while parts of the world remained closed due to the pandemic.\r\nThe $1.43 billion first quarter sales were also an 11.9% increase over first quarter 2019, which was then a record for the period.\r\nDriving the record sales was 20.2% increase in our international business and an 8.5% increase in our domestic business.\r\nThis double-digit growth drove international sales to 57.8% of total sales in the first quarter.\r\nThroughout the quarter, we focused on delivering our footwear and apparel to meet the needs of both our consumers and customers.\r\nOur sell-throughs across customer types and categories exceeded expectations in many markets and we were able to deliver double-digit growth.\r\nSkechers' mission of delivering comfort, style and quality and innovation at a value resonated with consumers prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the same is true now.\r\nConsumers are returning to a new normalcy, one that involves more walking, more comfort on the job and a casual lifestyle mindset.\r\nWe are a natural choice for any demographic worldwide with comfort technology at our core.\r\nThe record sales are a testament to the fact that consumers appreciate our product offerings, which we're seeing by the success across many divisions.\r\nOur International Wholesale business grew 23.8% for the first quarter last year and 13% from 2019.\r\nThe quarterly sales growth was driven by an increase of 174% in China, which was severely impacted by the pandemic in the prior year.\r\nHowever, even as compared to 2019, China grew 45.5%.\r\nThe International Wholesale growth was partially offset by decreases in our subsidiary and distributor businesses.\r\nSubsidiary sales decreased 4.8% from 2020 but improved 4.2% from 2019.\r\nThe first quarter 2021 decrease was due to temporary closures and reduced operating hours in Spain and Italy, and especially in the United Kingdom, where businesses were closed for the entire quarter.\r\nWhere markets were open, sales were strong, including in Germany, India and Canada.\r\nOur distributor business was down 6.5% from last year, yet several markets experienced growth in the quarter, specifically Russia, Taiwan, Turkey and Ukraine.\r\nWe believe we will continue to see improvements in our distributor business in the second quarter and the remainder of the year.\r\nSales in our Domestic Wholesale business decreased less than 1% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020 but improved 8.1% compared to the first quarter of 2019.\r\nWe believe sales in our Domestic Wholesale business were negatively impacted by logistical challenges, which caused slower replenishment and product shipments to some accounts.\r\nKey sales drivers came from multiple categories with the largest gains in our Women's Sport, Kids, Work and Men's Performance.\r\nAdditionally, the average selling price per pair increased 2.7%, reflecting the strength and appeal of new comfort products and technologies.\r\nSkechers direct-to-consumer business increased 18.1% over 2020 and 13.1% over 2019, despite the fact that domestic operating hours were reduced by approximately 15% during January and February, and 7% in March.\r\nIn our international company-owned stores, we lost 37% of the days available to sell during the quarter.\r\nOur domestic direct-to-consumer sales increased 28.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and 18% compared to 2019.\r\nThis improvement came from our domestic e-commerce channel, which grew by 143% and our brick and mortar stores, which grew by 13.6%.\r\nOur domestic direct-to-consumer average selling price per unit rose 10.9%, which speaks to the strength of our current product offering.\r\nWhile we expected our e-commerce business to continue to perform exceptionally well, we were pleased with the increased traffic and sales in our domestic retail stores, especially in March, which we believe improved as more people became comfortable shopping and we ramped up our marketing efforts.\r\nWe have now completed the update of our point-of-sale system, which further optimizes our domestic direct-to-consumer channels and will continue to improve our omnichannel capabilities.\r\nWe are now focused on rolling out this same platform worldwide.\r\nOur e-commerce channel remains a meaningful growth opportunity as sales increase significantly across the globe.\r\nWe plan to expand our e-commerce reach across Europe, beginning with a new site in Ireland and the revamp of our U.K. site this summer.\r\nOur international direct-to-consumer business increased 1.9% over the first quarter of 2020 and 4.4% over 2019.\r\nThe growth was largely attributable to our company-owned e-commerce sites and the strength of our sales in Korea, India and Thailand, partially offset by ongoing temporary store closures due to stay at home guidelines across many markets, most notably in the United Kingdom.\r\nWhile we are seeing some markets reopening this month, including England last week, other countries have extended or reinstated their lockdowns given the unpredictability of the coronavirus and its impact on many markets, we remain cautious about a return to normal traffic and sales in many international stores.\r\nIn the first quarter, we opened 12 company-owned Skechers stores, six of which are in international location, including our largest store in India.\r\nWe have opened seven stores to-date in the second quarter, including our first in Antwerp.\r\nWe closed 20 locations in the first quarter as we opted not to renew expiring leases, and we expect to close one additional store at the end of this month.\r\nAn additional net 106 third-party Skechers stores opened in the first quarter, bringing our total store count at quarter end to 3,989.\r\nThe stores that opened were across 16 countries with most located in China and India.\r\nTo support the open regions during the first quarter, we ramped up our marketing efforts to drive home our comfort message.\r\nThis included former professional quarterback and lead NFL commentator, Tony Romo in our Max Cushioning commercial during the Super Bowl and NFL coach, Jon Gruden and sports analyst, Howie Long in new commercials for Skechers Arch Fit, as well as Brooke Burke featured in Arch Fit and Skechers apparel commercials during the quarter.\r\nOur new campaign went on television as well as digital platforms to support key initiatives for men, women and kids.\r\nIn the first quarter, we were awarded Company of the Year by leading industry publication, Footwear Plus, for the ninth time in 15 years.\r\nThis was due to our efforts during the challenging 2020 year and our ability to deliver to consumers the comfort they wanted.\r\nWe are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, I think this was a solid beginning, especially given the ongoing pandemic-related difficulties most recently impacting our international business, which now represents 58% of our total sales.\r\nWhile many markets continue to face challenges, we are seeing strong signs of recovery and remain focused on delivering our comfort technology and managing the flow of our inventory to fulfill demand where we are open and drive sales where possible.\r\nThe Skechers brand performed exceptionally well this quarter, despite ongoing challenges po Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n On our call today is our CEO, Hikmet Ersek; our CFO, Raj Agrawal; and Head of Treasury and Investor Relations, Brad Windbigler.\r\nDuring the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\r\nWe have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.\r\nWe will also discuss certain adjusted metrics.\r\nThe expenses that have been excluded from adjusted metrics are specific to certain initiatives, but maybe similar to types of expenses that the company has previously occurred and can reasonably expect to occur in the future.\r\nWe weathered COVID-19 better than many companies in 2020, owing to our resilient fundamentals and the foresight behind our leading digital business that had us ready for accelerated demand for digital services.\r\nBefore I give you an update about the encouraging first quarter results and share my thoughts about the rest of the year, I would like to take a moment and mention that although we do see some modest economic improvement and there are signs of some COVID-19 recovery like in the US, parts of Europe and parts of Asia Pacific due to progress with vaccinations, at the same time, I am saddened by the hard breaking current situation in countries like India, Brazil and many others.\r\nOur thoughts are with all of the people who are currently navigating this challenging situation.\r\nThe recent outbreaks in many countries show us that as a global community, we still have work to do in the fight against the virus.\r\nHowever, at the same time, I am hopeful and I know that all my colleagues and all our partners in more than 200 countries, we will do their best to recover from the virus as soon as possible.\r\nBack to our business.\r\nThe conditions were fairly stable in the first quarter.\r\nI am pleased that trends for our business improved over the quarter and held up well in April, giving us confidence to push forward with an ambitious agenda and reaffirm 2021 financial targets on an adjusted basis.\r\nRaj will discuss our outlook in more detail in a few minutes.\r\nWith that, let's review business highlights for the quarter.\r\nStarting with the big picture, our cross-border consumer-to-consumer or C2C business grew principal 28%, which was the highest quarterly growth in years and the third consecutive quarter with growth over 20%.\r\nThis really shows the momentum we are seeing today, especially when compared to forecast from third parties projecting modest growth or even declines in principals for 2021.\r\nTotal company revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis, around a 300 basis points increase from declines in the third and fourth quarter of last year.\r\nC2C revenues and transactions grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and both digital and retail revenue trends improved sequentially.\r\nDigital performed exceptionally well again.\r\nRevenues were up from the fourth quarter and grew 45% year-over-year to over $240 million, putting us on target to exceed $1 billion in 2021.\r\nDigital comprised 34% of transactions and 23% of revenues for the C2C segment and was a key source of new customers and incremental profit.\r\nWu.com delivered impressive results and shows the potential we see as a foundation for a consumer ecosystem.\r\nThis is the fourth consecutive quarter of transaction growth of 50% or more and average monthly active users growth of over 40%.\r\nWu.com led money transfer peers in mobile app downloads by a wide margin and grew principal 78% off of an already large base, which we believe is well ahead of the market.\r\nOur customer engagement efforts also appear to be paying off with favorable trends in retention, transaction per customer and principal per customer.\r\nDigital partnerships revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and it has exceeded our expectation over the past 18 months since we announced it in late 2019.\r\nWe continue to have more encouraging developments in the pipeline.\r\nRetail trends improved sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, despite the effects of additional rates of COVID-19.\r\nWhile the business is not back to pre-pandemic levels yet, it has demonstrated resilience and we expect continued improvement to the rest of the year, assuming the pandemic and global economy doesn't worsen.\r\nOur business solution trends also improved.\r\nWe made progress on key initiatives, including launching our payment solutions in Spain and implementing technology upgrades that will allow us to add differentiated solutions and capabilities.\r\nWe are optimistic that the business will continue to rebound over the course of the year.\r\nShifting to an update on operating and strategic objectives during this quarter.\r\nStarting with wu.com, we continue to invest in consumer acquisition and marketing, which drove 46% growth in average monthly active users for the first quarter.\r\nOn the branding side, we launched one of our highest-rated television campaigns in recent years, send more than money, which future wu.com.\r\nWe also made progress on a number of product initiatives to improve our customer experience, faster registration, better web page performance and enhanced visibility into transaction status.\r\nWe achieved an important platform milestone by completing a major phase of our multiyear settlement transformation project.\r\nWe also advanced a number of initiatives that will make us more nimble and efficient like cloud migration and adding artificial intelligence and machine learning into processes to reduce project run times and enhance analytics.\r\nMoving on to our global network.\r\nThe team has done a great job optimizing commission costs while still enhancing the quality of our global payments distribution capabilities.\r\nDuring the quarter, we renewed agreements with 34 existing agents and added 41 new agents with favorable terms.\r\nOver 50% of our global account payout transaction volume was delivered real time.\r\nOur launch with Walmart is off to a good start, and we look forward to getting all 4,700 US locations up and running in the second quarter.\r\nTo wrap up the first quarter discussion, despite ongoing challenges from the pandemic, we are off to an encouraging start with financial and operating performance on course with our expectations for 2021.\r\nGiven the strong customer trends, we have seen over the last year in our C2C business, including almost 9 million wu.com annual active users in 2020, the agenda for the rest of 2021 is largely centered around enhancing the customer experience.\r\nConvenience, reliability and speed are fundamental for a good customer experience in payments, which makes a high-quality network important.\r\nOn the digital side, we can reach billions of accounts today, but we are expanding access to even more accounts with new partnerships.\r\nSpeed is increasingly valued by customers, and we already have one of the broadest real-time cross-border payment networks in the industry.\r\nSo the focus this year is making it more robust by adding additional direct third-party relationships and multiple partners in markets.\r\nOur retail distribution will continue to benefit from ongoing agent optimization, upgrading the caliber of agents and filling in gaps in distribution.\r\nPlatform initiatives for 2021 include upgrading and modernizing technology, incorporating cutting-edge solutions and bolstering our executive talent.\r\nThis will enhance customer experience in a number of ways, such as better processing speed and enabling more innovation.\r\nUltimately, we are working toward building a best-in-class tax stack that can support the range of cross-border use cases, including C2C, C2B, B2C and B2B and serve as a foundation for ecosystems.\r\nI'm really excited about the slate of product initiatives this year that can be impactful for customer experience.\r\nA few examples include improving

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We are off to a great start in 2020.\r\nThe strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we move through the first three months of the year.\r\nSame-store occupancy remained at all time highs for Extra Space with sequential growth in January and February at a time of the year when occupancy normally declines.\r\nOccupancy increased further in March, ending the quarter with the year-over-year positive delta of 480 basis points.\r\nOur elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which has also accelerated during the quarter with achieved rates increasing from 10% in January to well into the teens by the end of March.\r\nThese trends fueled same-store revenue growth of 4.6% despite a 110 basis point drag on revenue growth from lower year-over-year late fees.\r\nWe had excellent expense control with 0.2% decrease in same-store expenses.\r\nThe result with same-store NOI growth of 6.5% a sequential acceleration of 310 basis points from Q4 and year-over-year core FFO growth of 21%.\r\nWith fundamentals holding and performance comps becoming much easier in the upcoming months, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth through the second quarter.\r\nOur concern of a dramatic increase in vacates has not materialized and now we are into our busy leasing season when demand is typically strongest.\r\nWe believe that vacate risk to our elevated occupancy has likely been postponed until the end of the summer or even into the fall.\r\nTurning to external growth.\r\nThe acquisition market continues to be expensive and we remain disciplined but opportunistic.\r\nYear-to-date, we've been able to close or put under contract a little over $300 million in acquisitions.\r\nThese are primarily lease-up properties and several of the properties came from our bridge lending program.\r\nLooking forward, we anticipate the majority of additional acquisitions to be completed in joint ventures and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.\r\nWe were very active in Q1 on the third-party management front, adding 61 stores in the quarter, which includes the previously announced JCAP stores.\r\nOur growth was partially offset by dispositions.\r\nWe have only sold to other operators at prices we viewed as unattractive to the region.\r\nWhile this trend presents a headwind, we still expect solid growth in our third-party management platform for the year.\r\nAs I said on our last call, we are mindful of the risks we face.\r\nThese include difficult fourth quarter operational comp, a tight labor market and new supply and state of emergency orders in certain markets.\r\nThat said, current fundamentals are the strongest we have seen in some time.\r\nAnd our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance.\r\nOur first quarter outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improving 2021 outlook allow us to increase our industry-leading annual guidance $7.5 at the midpoint.\r\nI would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\r\nAs Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers.\r\nLate fees and other income continue to be down and partially offset rental income, but we will lap this comp in the second quarter, which will enhance same-store revenue growth.\r\nExisting customer rate increases will also provide a tailwind in the second quarter since they were paused during much of Q2 2020.\r\nWe delivered a reduction in same store expenses despite property tax increases of 6.9% and repairs and maintenance increases of 20% due to higher year-over-year snow removal costs.\r\nThese increases were up and were offset primarily by savings in payroll and marketing.\r\nWe believe payroll savings will continue throughout the year, albeit perhaps at lower levels due to wage pressure in certain markets.\r\nMarketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive topline revenue growth, but it should also remain down for the year.\r\nCore FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, a year-over-year increase of 21%.\r\nSame-store property performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees.\r\nAs we announced during the quarter, Moody's issued Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating, our second investment grade credit rating now providing us access to the public bond market.\r\nWe continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter through ATM activity and an overnight offering, which combined for net proceeds of $274 million.\r\nWe sold 16 stores into a joint venture and obtained debt for that venture, resulting in cash proceeds to Extra Space of $132 million and an ownership interest of 55%.\r\nWe plan to add a third partner to this venture in the second quarter, which will reduce our ownership interest to 16%.\r\nOur equity and disposition proceeds reduced revolving balances and we ended the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 5.1 times lower than our long-term debt target of 5.5 times to 6 times.\r\nLast night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions.\r\nWe raised our same-store revenue range to 5% to 6%.\r\nSame-store expense growth was reduced to 2% to 3%, resulting in

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Actual results may differ materially from such statements.\r\nPlease note that any reference to net sales today is being made on a constant-currency basis, which reflects the application of the current period foreign exchange rates to any prior period results enabling comparisons, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\r\nThis is our sixth quarter of consistent successful execution against our three-year turnaround plan.\r\nWe're now at the midway point and are building a solid foundation for sustained growth and expansion.\r\nLet me summarize our strategy for those of you who are new to the Tupperware turnaround story.\r\nOur strategy includes fixing our core direct selling business while building an omnichannel consumer product company.\r\nWe're doing that by creating sub-brands that will enable us to strategically merchandise and price our products to minimize channel content.\r\nThe idea is to increase consumer access to our iconic products wherever they choose to buy.\r\n2020 was a year of stabilization.\r\nThis year, 2021 is the foundation year where we continue to fix our core business and build the foundation to invest in the omnichannel opportunity.\r\nWe'll talk more about this opportunity today.\r\nNext year, 2022, will be the year of expansion where we really begin to enter new channels and product categories.\r\nAnd in 2023 and beyond, we will accelerate those efforts for long-term sustained growth.\r\nDuring the quarter, we executed on several high-priority strategic initiatives that will improve our capital structure and position us well for the future.\r\nWe will get into more detail on each of these later in the call, but at a high level, include, progressing on divesting our noncore assets, including our beauty businesses and excess property holdings, enabling us to focus more time and resources on growing our core Tupperware brands and utilizing the recently authorized share repurchase facility to buy back 1 million shares during the third quarter, accelerating returns to shareholders.\r\nThese actions support our turnaround plan and are important components that will enable us to grow, expand and ultimately achieve our long-term strategic goals.\r\nAs a result, our net sales of $377 million reflects our core Tupperware business, which declined 13%, primarily reflecting difficult comparisons from 2020, along with COVID-related market closures in 2021 and disruption in our US and Canada business due to the implementation of a new technology platform.\r\nFrom an earnings standpoint, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 reflects our improved cost structure and new tax strategy that Sandra will describe later on the call.\r\nAnd during the quarter, we knew we were up against tough year-over-year comps.\r\nRemember, we grew 21% in Q3 of 2020, yet our team executed well.\r\nThe prior year period benefited from an increase in demand from shift in consumer behavior as most of us were under lockdown and adjusting to working, learning, and eating from home.\r\nNow that several markets have begun to open up mostly the US and Europe, we've seen a reversal of that trend as consumers are excited to get out and go places again and shopping at more traditional retail channels.\r\nAnd we believe this trend will continue.\r\nWhile some of the markets have begun to open up, others have gone into strict or mandatory lockdown in response to COVID resurgence in many regions, especially in Asia Pacific and Latin America.\r\nThis has had a significant impact on recurring efforts and overall productivity given the restrictions of personal gatherings and opportunities to directly connect with the brand.\r\nThat said, we believe these headwinds are transitory in nature and will begin to normalize in the near to medium term.\r\nAs I will talk about later, we are working to reconnect with our sales force and give them tools and support they need to be successful in any market environment.\r\nAnd because these headwinds had the most impact on our direct selling business in the third quarter, we believe that our strategy to diversify into multiple channels as we roll our business is being directly validated.\r\nWe believe that our turnaround will not produce linear results as evidenced by the third quarter but that over time, both top and bottom line will improve as we implement our growth plans.\r\nNow that we are six quarters into our third year turnaround plan, this midway point feels like an appropriate time to summarize the progress we have made over the last 18 months.\r\nIn short, the company was in a very different place in April of 2020.\r\nQuite frankly, the business was not doing well, and we needed to make major changes to keep this iconic brand afloat.\r\nThe solution was to execute a full turnaround of entire business.\r\nWe did this by rightsizing our cost structure, delivering $192 million in savings in 2020.\r\nWe've created a global business services group to generate operational efficiencies, centralizing and optimizing many of our back-office functions with a mandate to improve service and reduce costs, refinancing our debt and improving liquidity.\r\nIn fact, our leverage ratio is a third of previous levels.\r\nOn capital structure, we made significant progress.\r\nAfter selling our Avroy Shlain Beauty business earlier this year, we're working diligently to sell our remaining beauty business and excess land on holdings.\r\nLastly, we repurchased shares of our common stock.\r\nAnd I should mention that this was the first time we bought back shares since 2018, reflecting our belief in a positive outlook of our share appreciation as we execute our turnaround plan, and restructuring the company from systems and processes to strategy and personnel.\r\nWe've made detailed investments to improve sales force productivity.\r\nWe implemented a new sales force system in the US during the second quarter.\r\nGiven that the legacy system was customized to the needs of our sales force for the last 20 years, the new technology solution caused disruption to our sales force in the past few months.\r\nWe've begun working closely with our sales force over the past several weeks and believe once fixed, the technology will be enabler for our sales force to grow their business.\r\nWe've increased our use of data to make better and smarter business decisions.\r\nWe've begun using more data-driven approach designed to identify best practices, improve our marketing communication, upgrade our business intelligence to make better decisions and ensure competitive service and costs.\r\nWe're also using data-driven approach to segment how we look at our sales force and customers to personalize the experience they have with Tupperware.\r\nThat means providing differentiated support, service and incentives to all of our sales force, our customers, ensuring we are adding value as a result, improving retention.\r\nTo that end, we've introduced preferred customer loyalty programs in some of our biggest markets such as Mexico and plan to roll out additional markets including the US soon.\r\nWe've continued to innovate and expand product lines, soon-be, sub-brands, and product categories beyond the kitchen.\r\nThis strategy will enable us not only to compete on price more effectively, but also to segregate which products are sold through which channels, helping us minimize channel conflict.\r\nOne of our first sub-brands is called Tupperware Essentials.\r\nAnd we've recently begun testing consumers' response in Europe through selected retailers.\r\nWe're also continuing the work of expanding our product line beyond the kitchen.\r\nFinally, we recently received a recognition from fast company for our product innovation and specifically for our Echo-plus to go coffee cup, which is made of our revolutionary Ecoplasmaterial and our solution for eliminating single-use coffee cups.\r\nWe're also working to improve our service level.\r\nService means serving both our sales force and the end consumer better, giving our sales force the tools they need to be successful an Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The Toro Company delivered record third quarter results.\r\nWe continue to benefit from robust demand in both our Professional and Residential segments and our operations team went above and beyond to execute even as global supply chain challenges affected availability.\r\nOur employees together with our channel partners, kept a sharp focus on serving the needs of our customers.\r\nAs a result, total net sales for the third quarter were up 16% year-over-year.\r\nProfessional segment net sales increased 15%, marking the second quarter in a row of double-digit growth for this segment.\r\nWe saw continued strength in landscape contractor and golf markets worldwide.\r\nHigher pre-season shipments of BOSS snow and ice management products, and strong demand for our rental and specialty construction equipment and Ventrac products.\r\nOur lineup of innovative products, combined with strong business confidence fueled robust demand.\r\nResidential segment net sales were up 23% and that comparison is on top of a 38% growth rate in the third quarter of last year.\r\nGrowth in the quarter was driven by strong retail demand for our zero-turn and walk power mowers.\r\nCustomers also continued to respond favorably to our all-season Flex-Force 60-volt product lineup, which offers power and durability with no compromise on performance.\r\nThe recent actions we've taken to introduce innovative new products, refresh marketing, and expand mass retail distribution continue to strengthen the Toro brand and drive positive results.\r\nAs noted last quarter, we expected supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures to escalate at a rate faster than could be fully offset in the near term, through pricing and other mitigating actions.\r\nDespite these challenges, both segments delivered solid earnings growth in the third quarter, Professional earnings up 7.6% and Residential earnings up 10.5%.\r\nI'll now touch on some of the key themes for the quarter.\r\nFirst is the robust and broad-based demand, we continue to see across our markets worldwide.\r\nThis has been driven by consumer and business confidence as well as customer investment priorities focused on outdoor environments.\r\nWe continue to capitalize on these drivers with our commitment to investing in new product development, our best-in-class distribution, and our talented teams.\r\nSecond, the continued escalation of global supply chain and inflationary challenges.\r\nThis included component availability constraints as well as material freight and wage related cost headwinds.\r\nOur operations team took extraordinary steps to enable us to source and produce as effectively as possible in this incredibly dynamic environment.\r\nWe also continue to execute on our productivity and synergy initiatives, demonstrated disciplined expense control and implemented market align pricing actions.\r\nRegardless of how long these pressures persist, we remain focused on managing the factors within our control.\r\nThird, in line with general economic trends we saw an increasingly challenging labor market, including wage pressures and workforce availability limitations in some of our manufacturing location.\r\nAcross the enterprise, we have talented and dedicated teams committed to serving our customers.\r\nWe're focused on having workforce and other resources in place to put ourselves in the best position to meet demand and deliver our products to the right places at the right time.\r\nOur innovative product portfolio, outstanding team, and deep relationships with our channel partners and end customers set us apart and position us well for the long term growth.\r\nWe have the financial capacity to invest in the future and we continue to allocate capital to best drive value for all stakeholders.\r\nThis fiscal year, we've made strategic investments in key technologies, both organically and through acquisitions to advance our priority areas of alternative power, smart, connected, and autonomous.\r\nOur healthy cash flow also has allowed us to return capital to shareholders while maintaining ample liquidity.\r\nLooking ahead, we will continue to execute against our enterprise strategic priorities of accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity, and operational excellence and empowering people.\r\nI'll discuss our outlook further following Renee's more detailed review of our financial results.\r\nAs Rick said, our record results for the third quarter were driven by robust demand in both our professional and residential segments.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of increasing supply chain, inflation and labor pressures.\r\nWe grew net sales for the quarter by 16.2% to $976.8 million.\r\nReported earnings per share was $0.89 per diluted share, up from $0.82 last year and adjusted earnings per share was $0.92 per diluted share, up 12.2% from $0.82 in the prior year.\r\nBoth of our segments delivered record top and bottom line third quarter results.\r\nProfessional segment net sales were up 15.2% to $718.5 million.\r\nThis increase was driven by broad-based demand in landscape contractor, golf, snow and ice management, rental and specialty construction, and Ventrac products.\r\nThis was slightly offset by lower sales of underground construction equipment due to supply chain disruptions that impacted product availability.\r\nProfessional segment earnings for the third quarter were up 7.6% to $122.3 million.\r\nAnd when expressed as a percent of net sales, decreased 120 basis points to 17%.\r\nThis decrease was largely due to higher material and freight cost, partially offset by net price realization and productivity improvements.\r\nResidential segment net sales for the third quarter were up 23% to $252.1 million.\r\nThis increase was primarily driven by strong retail demand for zero-turn and walk power mowers.\r\nResidential segment earnings for the quarter were up 10.5% to $31.5 million and when expressed as a percent of net sales, down 140 basis points to 12.5%.\r\nThis decrease was primarily driven by the same factors as in the Professional segment.\r\nTurning to our operating results for the quarter.\r\nWe reported gross margin of 33.9%, a decrease of 110 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year.\r\nAdjusted gross margin was 33.9%, down 130 basis points on a comparative basis.\r\nThese decreases were largely due to the same factors that affected Professional and Residential earnings.\r\nSG&A expense as a percent of net sales for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 21.4%.\r\nThis increase was primarily driven by more normalized spending compared to the third quarter of last year and a legal settlement in the third quarter this year.\r\nOperating earnings as a percent of net sales for the third quarter decreased 130 basis points to 12.5%.\r\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 13.1%.\r\nInterest expense was down $1.3 million for the quarter to $7 million, driven by lower debt levels and decreased interest rate.\r\nThe reported effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.3%.\r\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow.\r\nAccounts receivable totaled $301.2 million, down 2.2% from a year ago, primarily driven by channel mix.\r\nInventory was essentially flat to last year at $665.6 million.\r\nHowever, finished goods were significantly lower, driven by strong retail demand while working process was higher.\r\nThis was a reflection of the supply chain variability and our efforts to procure higher levels of key components when available.\r\nAccounts payable increased 53% from last year to $411.4 million.\r\nThis was primarily due to the timing of purchases as well as more normalized spending compared to last year.\r\nYear-to-date free cash flow was $429 million with the conversion ratio of 123%.\r\nThis positive performance was largely the result of higher earnings and lower working capital, primarily driven by higher payables.\r\nAt the end of the quarter, our liquidity remained at $1.1 million.\r\nThis included cash and cash equivalents of $535 milli Please summarize this transcript in exactly

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n American Vanguard will file our Form 10-Q with the SEC tomorrow.\r\nBefore beginning, we should take our moment for a usual cautionary reminder.\r\nSuch factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures and various other risks that are detailed in the company's SEC reports and filings.\r\nWe appreciate your continued support of American Vanguard.\r\nIn our last call, we gave you our first impression of the coronavirus pandemic, which had begun to spread into the United States partway through the first quarter.\r\nAs part of the critical infrastructure, we were permitted, indeed, expected to continue operating in the midst of a global pandemic, the likes of which we had not seen in over a century.\r\nIn order to operate without disruption during the first quarter, we had to adapt.\r\nWhere we could do so, we shifted from in-person to remote work.\r\nWhere we had to maintain physical operations as in our factories, we implemented COVID protocols to keep the workplace safe and healthy.\r\nAt the same time, we learned to do business remotely while constantly checking on supply chain stability, logistics and customer demand.\r\nFast forward to the second quarter, the pandemic has become the norm.\r\nWe, and our suppliers, peers and customers, have become more accustomed to doing business through Zoom meetings, webinars and email.\r\nWe continue our efforts to ensure that internal communication was frequent and continuous.\r\nIn fact, I continue to hold weekly 2-hour state of the company calls with over 40 of my key managers during which I solicit input on operational challenges, sales opportunities and regional developments to ensure that we are all moving in the same direction.\r\nIn addition, on a daily basis, our pandemic working group advises the workplace regarding COVID-related news, government orders, research and company protocols.\r\nDuring the second quarter, the pandemic shifted from Asia and Europe into the Americas, where we do most of our business.\r\nIn spite of that shift, I am pleased to report that we have had a low very low incident of coronavirus infection within our workforce.\r\nThat nearly all of the cases were community transmissions outside of our facilities and that our operations have not been adversely affected by the pandemic to date.\r\nAt this point, I want to pause to note that given the circumstances where so many businesses are struggling for survival, cutting workforces, taking federal loans or filing free organization, we are generating stronger returns than what we did while operating in the normal course of last year at this time.\r\nSpecifically, even while quarterly net sales declined by 8%, net income increased by 25% over the period.\r\nAt the same time, and I hate to steal David's thunder here, as of June 30, we have strengthened our balance sheet by reducing inventory even with expanded product offerings, reducing debt and improving cash from operations by $38 million so far this year.\r\nBefore turning the call over to David, let me take a moment to focus on the future.\r\nWe are still constrained from making specific forecast because we do not yet know how long the pandemic will last nor how it may affect our business or markets.\r\nNevertheless, we have adapted to the coronavirus with increasing success.\r\nAs we look forward to the balance of the year, we continue to believe that we are poised to perform in line with our peers.\r\nThis is so for a number of reasons, including favorable conditions for our mosquito control products, larger supply of Krovar and Hyvar herbicides for use on citrus, pineapple and McCabe and expansion of our Vapam fumigant business in Mexico, Central America and Australia.\r\nI will then return to give you an update on some exciting initiatives to grow our business through new products and technology innovation.\r\nAs Bill mentioned, we will be filing our Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, tomorrow.\r\nEverything I'm covering here is included in more detail in that document.\r\nAs Eric indicated, the company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate.\r\nAs a result, our customers and suppliers have all operated more or less without disruption during the pandemic.\r\nHaving said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways, including our ability to present new sales and marketing ideas, such as new products, face-to-face with customers in the field.\r\nOn the other hand, you will see in our financial statements the same restrictions have caused us to spend less on operating expenses.\r\nFurthermore, the company has been able to operate normally throughout the first half of 2020 without the need to apply for any COVID-related federal stimulus package loans.\r\nLooking forward to the balance of 2020, we do not expect to need to seek such loans resistance.\r\nWith regard to our financial performance for the three months ended June 30, 2020, the company's net sales decreased by 8% to $105 million as compared to sales of $113 million this time last year.\r\nWithin that overall decline, our U.S. sales were down about $6 million and our international sales were down about $2 million.\r\nInternational sales accounted for 44% of net sales as compared to 43% of net sales this time last year.\r\nEric has already discussed the main factors that have affected our second quarter sales performance.\r\nIn addition, the sales and expenses of our businesses in Mexico and Brazil were affected by the devaluation of the related currency exchange rates with the dollar, as compared to this time last year.\r\nWe believe these exchange rate devaluations were caused at least in part by the COVID pandemic.\r\nWithout the adverse currency translation effect on our Brazilian and Mexican sales, our second quarter consolidated sales would have been $3 million higher.\r\nFor the quarter, our manufacturing performance was strong, with factory operating costs well controlled and activity improved as compared to 2019.\r\nAs a result of these various dynamics, we improved our gross margin performance when expressed as a percentage of sales to 39% of sales in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to 37% in the same period of 2019.\r\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2020, our operating expenses decreased by $1.9 million or 5% as compared to the expenses incurred in the same period of the prior year.\r\nIn the prior year, however, we had a benefit of approximately $1.8 million, primarily associated with adjustments to deferred liabilities on a past acquisition.\r\nThat did not repeat in the current year.\r\nMaking adjustments for that item, our underlying reduction in recurring operating expenses is greater and amounted to approximately $3.7 million or about 10%.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we recorded reduced interest expense.\r\nOur average debt was a little higher because of all the acquisition activity during the last year, but we got a benefit from reduced borrowing rates in the United States.\r\nFinally, our effective tax rate remained approximately flat compared to the same period of 2019.\r\nIn summary, for the second quarter, though our sales were down, selling prices and overall mix of sales remain good, factory performance was improved compared to 2019 and gross margins as a percentage of sales increased from 37% to 39%.\r\nOur operating expenses and interest expenses were lower.\r\nAnd as a result, net income increased by 25% in comparison to 2019.\r\nNow let us turn to the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.\r\nSales were down about $12 million or 6% as compared to the prior year.\r\nWithin that performance, net sales of both our domestic and international businesses were down about $6 million each.\r\nThe devaluation in key currencies resulted in about $4 million lower sales when sales originally recorded in the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso were translated to dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.\r\nOur factory performan Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.\r\nI will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we'll take some questions.\r\nThe company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2.654 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.59 and $0.61, respectively.\r\nSales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020.\r\nSequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 7% organically.\r\nOrders for the quarter were a record $3.120 billion, which was up 58% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18:1.\r\nBreaking down sales into our two segments.\r\nThe interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year.\r\nOur cable segment, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year.\r\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\r\nGAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021.\r\nGAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other noncash costs related to the MTS acquisition.\r\nAnd the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes that in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter and therefore had no impact on the second quarter earnings.\r\nExcluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by a strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially.\r\nThe year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year's quarter.\r\nThe sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company's average operating margin.\r\nFrom a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially.\r\nIn the cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter.\r\nThese lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions.\r\nGiven the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company's performance.\r\nOur team's ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture.\r\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020.\r\nGAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to $0.42 in the prior year period.\r\nAnd adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nThe company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.\r\nOperating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter or 109% of adjusted net income.\r\nAnd net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income.\r\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days, respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range.\r\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million at an average price of approximately $67.\r\nAt the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion.\r\nTotal liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\r\nSecond quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times.\r\nOn a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS test and simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3 times.\r\nAs previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS test and simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation.\r\nAnd therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance.\r\nIn addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operations and therefore are not included in our guidance.\r\nAnd I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far.\r\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter.\r\nI'll then get into a discussion of the trends and our trends and progress across our served markets.\r\nOur results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\r\nCraig already mentioned, our sales grew a very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $2.654 billion.\r\nOn an organic basis, our sales increased by 22%, with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program.\r\nWe're very pleased to have booked record orders in the quarter of $3.120 billion and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18:1.\r\nDespite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, we were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20% in the quarter.\r\nThis was a 200 basis point increase from last year's levels and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share grew a very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61.\r\nAnd just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution.\r\nAnd finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million, respectively, in the second quarter.\r\nI just can't emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world.\r\nThese results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amid what is a very dynamic and challenging environment.\r\nVery pleased that in the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services.\r\nUnlimited is based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million.\r\nThis is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market, primarily with a particular focus on heavy vehicles.\r\nThe addition of

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We appreciate you joining us today for Piedmont's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call.\r\nAt this time, our president and chief executive officer, Brent Smith, will provide some opening comments and discuss our fourth quarter and annual results and accomplishments.\r\nOn the line with me is Eddie Guilbert, our executive vice president of finance and treasurer; George Wells, our chief operating officer; and Bobby Bowers, our chief financial officer; as well as other members of the senior management team.\r\nTheir tireless dedication continues to garner industry honors for operational excellence and sustainability, including our recognition as the 2021 ENERGY STAR partner of the year and achieving LEED status now on roughly half of the portfolio.\r\nToday, I'm going to cover Piedmont's operational success and leasing momentum along with an update on capital allocation activities across our markets.\r\nFocusing on the fourth quarter of 2021, our FFO per share was $0.51, in line with market consensus.\r\nPortfolio operating metrics were solid with same-store NOI on a cash basis increasing 5.8%.\r\nWe leased approximately 400,000 square feet, generated a 3% increase in second-generation cash rents and executed an average lease term of six and a half years, illustrating the longer-term view taken by most of our customers.\r\nMost notably, about half of the fourth quarter's leasing was related to new tenants, making this the second consecutive quarter Piedmont has achieved pre-pandemic levels of new leasing.\r\nOverall, leasing activity remained robust and well dispersed across the portfolio with over 40 leases and amendments executed during the fourth quarter.\r\nAnd while the omicron variant had a modestly negative impact on building utilization during December and January, the leasing pipeline has not dissipated and we expect the momentum from the second half of 2021 to continue.\r\nToday, our leasing pipeline stands at over 500,000 square feet of negotiations.\r\nAnd we're trading LOIs on an additional 1 million square feet, which positions Piedmont for space absorption in 2022 and with only about 1 million square feet of existing leases expiring or about 6% of the portfolio.\r\nBoston, Dallas and Atlanta remain our most active leasing markets, albeit for different reasons.\r\nThe Boston market continues to exhibit strong fundamentals led by business migration to the suburbs and reduced competitive Class A office stock as the insatiable demand from life science users continues to drive office to lab conversions.\r\nFor example, during the past year in our Burlington submarket, three competitive Class A buildings comprising over 400,000 square feet have been repurposed to labs, helping to push net effective rents for office space to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nAnd in Dallas and Atlanta, our two largest markets, we continue to see an increasing number of corporate relocations, resulting in meaningful job growth.\r\nAs an example, during the fourth quarter, we signed a 55,000 square foot lease at our Connection Drive property in Dallas to serve as the new corporate headquarters of an undisclosed Fortune 500 company.\r\nAnd in that same market during the second quarter, we signed a 44,000 square foot lease to serve as the corporate headquarters for a large national beverage distributor.\r\nIn both these markets, rents at our properties are now above pre-pandemic levels.\r\nHowever, net effective rents are approximately 2% to 5% lower.\r\nI would note a customer flight to quality is well underway, which is driving wider rent disparities between place-making versus commodity office product.\r\nFor example, JLL Research noted that 84% of Atlanta leasing activity in the fourth quarter was in Class A or trophy product.\r\nOrlando also continues to perform well with leasing and tour activity across all five of our downtown properties at pre-pandemic levels.\r\nThe downtown submarket continues to experience population inflows particularly for the millennial and Gen Z cohorts driven by a highly walkable environment with expanding retail, food and beverage options, along with entertainment amenities surrounding the University of Central Florida's Creative Village campus, Amway Center Arena and Camping World Stadium, along with a uniquely urban Lake Eola.\r\nIn Orlando, net effective rents are still trailing pre-pandemic levels by about 5% as a result of increased concessions.\r\nFinally, Minneapolis, the districts in Washington, D.C. and New York City, all experiencing increasing tour activity.\r\nHowever, leasing velocity and tenant demand still lag our Sunbelt markets.\r\nI would add, we are fortunate to have limited vacancy and near-term lease expirations at our 60 Broad Street property in Lower Manhattan and virtually no expirations at our Washington, D.C. properties for more than two years.\r\nLeasing across all our core markets contributed to the fourth quarter's totals.\r\nAnd our customer CEO and HR dialogue continues to show our portfolio is positioned to gain market share.\r\nUsers of office space are undertaking a flight to quality that focuses on new or newly renovated office buildings with unique environments and a vast set of amenities, owned and operated by responsive, sustainability-minded service-oriented landlords.\r\nAnd because of these demand drivers, Piedmont's portfolio is well positioned, supported by a concentration of newly renovated, well amenitized buildings located near housing communities and highly regarded education systems with easy accessibility to major highway thoroughfares and airports.\r\nBut today's tenants are not only focused solely on location and neighboring amenities.\r\nThe physical attributes of a building have never been more important.\r\nThe building's indoor air and light, HVAC, fresh air intake, elevator capacity and outdoor collaboration space are all critical.\r\nIn addition to high-quality building in a vibrant environment, customers are demanding a higher-quality landlord as well.\r\nAnd by that, we mean an attentive operator that focuses on sustainability initiatives and which has the capital base and scale to provide tenant offerings and engagement.\r\nOffice space is no longer just a real estate product.\r\nTaking a look back at the operational highlights for the 2021 fiscal year.\r\nPiedmont leased almost 2.3 million square feet, which was in line with our average pre-COVID annual leasing levels.\r\nIn addition, the increase in second-generation cash rents was seven and a half percent, which helped increase same-store cash NOI for the year by almost 7%.\r\nAnd finally, our tenant retention ratio was in line with prior years at approximately 70%.\r\nRecovery in leasing activity bolsters our optimism for the rebound of the office sector, and particularly for landlords such as ourselves who offer high-quality, modernized sustainability-focused amenity-rich environments.\r\nLooking ahead, approximately 750,000 square feet of tenant leasing has yet to commence as of this year-end or is in some form of abatement.\r\nThis backlog creates organic growth opportunities going into 2022 associated with approximately $26 million in future annualized cash rents.\r\nIn addition, approximately 60% of the portfolio's vacancy and 85% of 2022's lease expirations resided in our Sunbelt properties, where we are experiencing the greatest level of leasing velocity.\r\nA schedule of the larger upcoming lease commencements and abatements is included in our supplemental financial information, which was filed last night.\r\nPivoting now to capital allocation activities.\r\nDespite the disruption from the pandemic and more recently, the omicron variant, the office investment sales market has continued to unthaw.\r\nWe are currently in discussions on a pipeline of over $1 billion of high-quality assets primarily for properties in our Sunbelt markets.\r\nFurthermore, we are encouraged to hear of several targeted buildings that will be coming to market in the first half of 2022.\r\nOur principal and broker dialogue suggests insurance Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Piedmont reported in-line fourth-quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.51. Portfolio metrics remained solid, with a 5.8% increase in same-store NOI on a cash basis and a 3% increase in second-generation cash rents. Leasing activity was robust, with 400,000 square feet leased and half of the fourth quarter's leasing related to new tenants. The leasing pipeline stands at over 500,000 square feet, positioning Piedmont for space absorption in 2022. Boston, Dallas, and Atlanta remain Piedmont's most active leasing markets. Net effective rents are approximately 2%-5% lower than pre-pandemic levels, but a flight to quality is underway, leading to wider rent disparities. The company's core FFO for 2021 was $1.97 per diluted share, a 4% increase over 2020. The office investment sales market is gradually recovering, with Piedmont discussing a pipeline of over $1 billion of high-quality assets. Cap rates remain steady for high-quality assets. Construction starts have slowed due to the pandemic, with a 15%-20% increase in new construction costs. Piedmont acquired 999 Peachtree Street in Atlanta, marking its entry into the Midtown Atlanta submarket. The company also completed two non-core asset disposals and plans for more in 2022. Piedmont's pro forma lease percentage as of December 31 would have been 87%, with a goal of 70%-75% of annualized lease revenue generated by Sunbelt markets by the end of 2023. The company is also introducing 2022 annual financial guidance for core FFO in the range of $1.97 to $2.07 per diluted share, assuming gradual physical utilization of buildings, neutral asset recycling, and a dividend adjustment around midyear.</s>"}

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n With me on the call are Jeff Gennette, our Chairman and CEO; and Adrian Mitchell, our CFO.\r\nA detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nIn discussing the results of our operations, we will be providing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nOur Company delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations on both top and bottom lines, outperforming 2020 and notably 2019.\r\nWith strong cash generation year-to-date, we were able to execute on our capital allocation priorities including returning capital to shareholders.\r\nOur business has demonstrated resilience and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on Polaris strategy.\r\nAnd as a result, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2021 guidance.\r\nOur '21 results demonstrate the progress we've made with our Polaris strategy operating in a better economic environment as well as the strength of our digitally led omnichannel model.\r\nWe are poised for sustainable and profitable growth and we'll continue to build and invest in our retail ecosystem to both maximize and accelerate our opportunities.\r\nToday, I'm pleased to announce that we are making a significant investment to launch a curated digital marketplace platform to enhance the existing Macy's, Inc. business fuel customer acquisition and drive growth across all of our channels.\r\nWe will partner with the enterprise marketplace technology company, miracle to build the platform.\r\nThrough this new digital marketplace platform which we'll launch in the second half of 2022, we will connect carefully selected third-party sellers with our customers in a scalable way and provide even greater breadth of assortment of exciting products to deliver on our promise of style and curation.\r\nNow, I'll provide some highlights from the third quarter.\r\nComparable, owned plus licensed sales increased 8.7%, an improvement in trend from the 5.9% increase we saw in Q2, even after adjusting for changes in our marketing calendar.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.23, up significantly from Q3 2019 and adjusted EBITDA was more than 2 times better than 2019.\r\nGross margin for the quarter improved by approximately 100 basis points driven by stronger regular price selling, fewer markdowns due to leaner inventories and a number of pricing and promotion initiatives and offset by increased delivery expenses.\r\nGross margins and inventory are benefiting from the outstanding work that our supply chain teams have done in navigating the recent disruptions.\r\nWhen they first begin the fourth quarter of 2020, our teams activated plans to mitigate bottlenecks and since then stayed agile and flexible, leveraging our strong networks and relationships with international carriers and variants and diversifying how we move product both up and downstream.\r\nSignificantly, as a result, we don't expect to be materially impacted by supply chain issues during the critical holiday shopping season.\r\nTotal Company AUR was up more than 12% across our three nameplates.\r\nSG&A dollars were significantly lower driven by a combination of ongoing expense discipline and unfilled open positions.\r\nLooking at each of our nameplates, comparable sales for Macy's brand were up 8.4% on an owned plus licensed basis which represents a nearly 1 point improvement versus last quarter, when you take into consideration, the friends and family marketing shift.\r\nMacy's brand full price sell-through improved 610 basis points while full price AURs increased by 6.9% driven by high demand and our gross margin initiatives.\r\nOur Bloomingdale's business performed well with comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis up 11.2%, which was in line with the second quarter.\r\nResults were driven by strong sales of luxury handbags, fine jewelry, home, men's shoes in contemporary apparel and both stores and bloomingdales.com outperformed 2019.\r\nBluemercury continues to recover outperforming versus 2020, but was down 2.2% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\r\nWe see strong sales performance of private brands, home fragrance and treatment.\r\nTurning to the health of our customer base, we brought in 4.4 million new customers into the Macy's brand, a 28% increase compared to 2019.\r\nApproximately 30% of these new customers were dormant customers over the last 12 months who have now reengaged.\r\nIn addition to growth in new customers, customer loyalty has also increased.\r\nStar Rewards program numbers now make up nearly 70% of the total Macy's brand comparable owned plus-licensed sales, up approximately 10 percentage points compared to 2019.\r\nDuring the quarter, we saw Platinum, Gold and Silver customers reengage with average customer spend in these tiers up 16% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\r\nBronze members who represent our youngest and most diverse loyalty tier continued to grow with the addition of 2.3 million members during the quarter and we're seeing average spend per customer increased 13%.\r\nBronze is one of our best customer acquisition vehicles with approximately 35% of members under the age of 40% and 57% ethnically diverse.\r\nOur Star Rewards Loyalty customers have a more personalized and productive shopping experience with the most relevant offer presented to them, right down to the particular homepage they see.\r\nThis is leading to increased conversion, higher revenue per visit and a decreased rate of customers leading the site and through targeted personalization and pricing science, we've been able to reduce the number of raw based promotional days and increase AURs.\r\nHaving a strong integrated retail ecosystem that provides a seamless shopping journey enables us to successfully attract and retain our most productive omnichannel customers.\r\nThe growth of our omnichannel ecosystem is powered by our thriving online business, relevant full line brick and mortar stores and growing off-mall format stores, all soon to be further accelerated by the new digital marketplace platform.\r\nOur data validates that in markets where we have a physical presence, our online business is stronger.\r\nThe interplay between traditional and physical assets is more important than ever and we are focused on establishing an appropriate footprint in markets that drive our sustainable and profitable omnichannel growth.\r\nTurning to merchandising which we think about in three buckets.\r\nFirst, our products and categories were strong during the height of the pandemic such as fragrance, watches, jewelry, sleepwear and home continue to perform well during the third quarter.\r\nSecond, occasion based categories such as dresses and men's tailored and luggage are continuing to see renewed interest from our customers.\r\nAnd third, our emerging categories and new brands are expected to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the future.\r\nThese complement our core categories, while satisfying the customer shopping journey and we're seeing encouraging results.\r\nTo give you an example, since bringing the Toys \"R\" Us business to macys.com in August, our toys sales have more than doubled in stores and online compared to 2019 and we continue to expand on our assortment in these emerging categories.\r\nDuring the quarter, we had another important new brand partner, Fanatics which offers our customers, the largest selection of licensed sports products and increases our fan apparel offering 20 fold.\r\nThis expanded assortment drove a 22% AUR increase in sports apparel and head gear compared to 2019.\r\nUsing data and analytics, we continue to grow key brand partnerships with more vendors looking to us for expanded relationships.\r\nOne element of this is the B2B monetization of our advertising partnerships that we realized through our in-house media agency Macy's media network which continues to generate solid results and recently expanded the scope to include Bloomingdale's.\r\nWe see a lot of potential to further strengthen our relationships with vendor partners and cultivatin Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm pleased that you're joining us for DXC Technology's first-quarter 2022 earnings call.\r\nOur speakers on the call today will be Mike Salvino, our president and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our executive vice president and CFO.\r\nIn accordance with SEC rules, we provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most comparable GAAP measures.\r\nA discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\r\nToday's agenda will begin with a quick update on our solid Q1 performance, which continues to show that revenue, adjusted EBIT margin, book-to-bill and non-GAAP earnings per share all have a positive trajectory compared to past quarters.\r\nDuring our Investor Day in June, we gave you additional insights into the steps of our transformation journey, and those steps are: inspire and take care of our colleagues, focus on our customers, optimize costs, seize the market and build a strong financial foundation.\r\nI will give updates on each step, and then hand the call over to Ken to share our Q1 financial results, guidance and more details on how we are building a strong financial foundation.\r\nRegarding our Q1 performance, our revenues were $4.14 billion, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 8%.\r\nThis represents the fourth straight quarter of both revenue stabilization and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q2.\r\nBook-to-bill for the quarter was 1.12.\r\nThis is the fifth straight quarter that we delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill, and we expect our success of winning in the market to continue in Q2.\r\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 in the quarter, which is up 300%, as compared to $0.21 that we delivered in Q1 of FY '21.\r\nThe positive trajectory of all four of these numbers gives us confidence that our playbook is working.\r\nAs a refresher, our playbook has three phases.\r\nThe stabilization phase was completed in FY '21.\r\nThis phase enabled us to make great progress with our colleagues, customers, on revenue, margin, book-to-bill and reducing our debt.\r\nWe are now focused on the foundation phase.\r\nThis phase focuses on the steps that will allow us to deliver growth.\r\nThe goals of this phase are: first, continue to increase our employee engagement, all while we attract and retain highly talented colleagues; second, stabilize year-on-year organic revenue; third, expand adjusted EBIT margins; fourth, consistently deliver a book-to-bill number of 1.0 or greater, with a nice mix of new work and renewals; and finally, under Ken's leadership, deliver a financial foundation that increases discipline and improves our cash flow and earnings power.\r\nNow I will discuss the good progress we are making on each step of our transformation journey, beginning with inspire and take care of our colleagues.\r\nWe are executing a people-first strategy.\r\nAttracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth.\r\nOur refreshed leadership team has deep industry experience and is delivering.\r\nBrenda, who is our chief marketing officer, is our newest addition.\r\nBrenda is a strategic results-oriented leader who brings deep marketing experience to DXC.\r\n75% of our leadership team is now new to DXC and bringing in talent based on their personal credibility as talent follows talent.\r\nWhat the team is finding is that the new DXC story is resonating in the market, and new-hires are wanting to join DXC because they see the opportunity to progress their careers with a company that's on the right trajectory.\r\nWe mentioned during our investor call that nearly 50% of our vice presidents across the company are new to DXC within the last 22 months.\r\nAlso, we are investing in our people.\r\nThis quarter, we rewarded high performance by paying annual bonuses that benefited roughly 45,000 of our colleagues.\r\nIn Q2, we are planning merit increases that will benefit roughly 77,000 of our colleagues.\r\nIn addition to these investments, we are doing a great job of taking care of our colleagues and their families during the pandemic.\r\nThis focus on our colleagues is unique and builds trust with them, increases employee engagement, allows us to compete for talent and enables us to deliver for our customers.\r\nFocus on our customers is the second step of our transformation journey.\r\nOur investment in our customers is the primary driver of revenue stabilization.\r\nIt was clear from their comments that the new DXC story is resonating with them because we are delivering.\r\nThese are all large global companies, and they are saying that their IT estates are important.\r\nIn fact, they use the word critical.\r\nOur strategy of delivering ITO services builds customer intimacy and develops trust that when our customers want to further transform their business, they turn to us, and allows us to move them up the enterprise technology stack.\r\nAdditional evidence that our strategy is working is the nice progress we have made on our GBS business, along with the cloud and security layer of our GIS business.\r\nAll of this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our financial commitments.\r\nNow let me turn to our cost optimization program.\r\nWe continue to do well, optimizing our costs and delivering for our customers without disruption.\r\nThese levers have helped us expand our margin going from 7.5% last quarter to 8% this quarter.\r\nYou will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in Q2.\r\nNext, seize the market is where we are focused on cross-selling to our existing customers and winning new work.\r\nThe 1.12 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is evidence that our plan is working.\r\nIn Q1, 57% of our bookings were new work and 43% were renewals.\r\nYou will see that we are running specific sales campaigns.\r\nAn example of these campaigns is ITO modernization, which is focused on improving the performance of our customers' IT estates.\r\nAnother example is our campaign to show our customers how to think about cloud, which combines on-prem, private cloud and public cloud technology.\r\nOur ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of 1.0 in each of the last five quarters is evidence that these sales campaigns are working and that we can win in the IT services industry.\r\nThis momentum and success in the market gives us confidence that we will deliver another book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater in Q2.\r\nTurning to our financial performance on Slide 12.\r\nFor the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continued to deliver a strong book-to-bill.\r\nGAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher than the top end of our guidance range.\r\nAdjusted EBIT margin was 8% in the quarter, an improvement of 380 basis points as compared to the prior quarter.\r\nIn Q1, bookings were $4.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.12, the fifth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than one.\r\nMoving on to Slide 13.\r\nOur Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 or $0.08 higher than the top end of our guidance, benefiting $0.05 from a lower tax rate.\r\nRestructuring and TSI expenses were $76 million, down 58% from prior year.\r\nFree cash flow was a use of cash of $304 million, as compared to a use of cash of $106 million in the prior year.\r\nWe expect free cash flow to improve significantly as the year progresses.\r\nAs the next slide shows, our Q1 FY '22 performance continues our trajectory as we deliver on our transformation journey.\r\nStarting with organic growth progression, we went from approximately 10% decline in the first three quarters of FY '21 to down 6.5% in the fourth quarter and now down to a decline of 3.7%.\r\nThis is a 40% improvement from the prior quarter.\r\nOur previous organic revenue growth calculation was not performed in this manner.\r\nAs a result, we have revised the organic growth rates for the prior-year periods in our earnings deck and have further supplemented our organic calculation to include all the information to support the calculation, providing you complete transp Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Joining me are our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Steers; our President, Joe Harvey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Stadler.\r\nFurther, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.\r\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.\r\nYesterday, we reported record earnings of $0.76 per share compared with $0.74 in the prior year's quarter and $0.67 sequentially.\r\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation to revenue ratio and effective tax rate, respectively.\r\nRevenue was a record $116.6 million for the quarter compared with $109.8 million in the prior year's quarter and $111.4 million sequentially.\r\nThe increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management, partially offset by lower performance fees when compared with the third quarter.\r\nOur implied effective fee rate was 57 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 59 basis points in the third quarter.\r\nExcluding performance fees, our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 56.3 basis points, and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been five point -- 56 basis points.\r\nOperating income was a record $49.4 million in the quarter compared with $47.4 million in the prior year's quarter and $44.2 million sequentially.\r\nOur operating margin increased to 42.4% from 39.6% last quarter.\r\nExpenses were essentially flat compared with the third quarter as lower G&A was offset by higher expenses related to distribution and service fees as well as compensation and benefits.\r\nThe decrease in G&A was primarily due to lower professional fees and a reduction in virtually hosted conferences.\r\nThe increase in distribution and service fee expense, which as noted earlier, excludes the cost of our new closed-end fund, is primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds.\r\nAnd the compensation to revenue ratio for the fourth quarter was 35% lower than the guidance we provided on our last call.\r\nThe decrease was primarily due to an adjustment to reflect actual incentive compensation to be paid.\r\nFor the year, the compensation to revenue ratio was 36.1%.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 25.8% for the fourth quarter, which included an adjustment to bring the full year rate to 26.65%.\r\nThe lower full year tax rate was primarily due to the relationship between a consistent amount of permanent differences relative to higher-than-forecasted pre-tax income.\r\nOur firm liquidity totaled $143 million at quarter end compared with $201.9 million last quarter.\r\nFirm liquidity as of December 31 reflected the payment of approximately $60.2 million for costs associated with our new closed-end fund and a special cash dividend in December of approximately $47 million or $1 per share.\r\nOver the past 11 years, we have paid a total of $14 per share in special dividends.\r\nAnd we remain debt-free.\r\nAssets under management totaled a record $79.9 billion at December 31, an increase of $9.4 billion or 13% from September 30.\r\nThe increase was due to net inflows of $3.9 billion and market appreciation of $6.4 billion, partially offset by distributions of $859 million.\r\nBob Steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.\r\nNow I'd like to briefly discuss a few items to consider as we begin the new year.\r\nWith respect to compensation and benefits, we expect to balance anticipated revenue growth from year-end assets under management that exceeded our 2020 full year average assets under management by about 15%, with our focus on controlled investment in order to maintain our industry-leading performance, broaden our product offerings and expand our distribution efforts.\r\nAs a result, we expect that our compensation to revenue ratio will decline to 35.5% from the 36.1% recorded in 2020.\r\nContinuing with the theme of investing in our business, we expect G&A to increase by about 6% from the $42.6 million we recorded in 2020.\r\nAfter finishing last year 8% below 2019, which was largely driven by lower travel and entertainment and a reduction in hosted and sponsored conference costs as a result of COVID conditions, we intend to make incremental investments this year in technology, including the implementation of new systems, cloud migration and upgrades to our infrastructure and security as well as in global marketing, focused on hosting virtual conferences and expanding our digital footprint.\r\nWe also expect that travel and entertainment costs will increase as conditions begin to return to normal.\r\nWe expect that our effective tax rate will be 27.25% in 2021.\r\nAnd finally, we will have earned a full quarter and full year of fees from our new closed-end fund.\r\nAnd so all things being equal, we expect our implied effective fee rate, excluding performance fees, will increase by about one basis point.\r\nToday, I will review our investment performance and provide some perspective on how our largest asset classes are positioned for 2021.\r\nThe markets were ebullient in the fourth quarter as investors continued to look beyond the valley of the pandemic, encouraged by progress with the vaccine and anticipating a potential economic recovery, relieved by clarity on our new administration and government and supported by record monetary and fiscal stimulus.\r\nThe macro environment in 2020 was unprecedented with the Fed's balance sheet increasing by over 75%, the budget deficit reaching the highest level since World War II, money supply growing 25% and negative yielding debt reaching $18 trillion globally.\r\nAlthough we had some of the best relative performance ever in 2020, our asset classes, except for preferreds, lagged their market counterparts meaningfully.\r\nSummarizing our performance at a high level, preferreds performed competitively within fixed income.\r\nU.S. and Global REITs and infrastructure significantly trailed the technology-led performance in stocks.\r\nAnd certain of our strategies with energy allocations underperformed due to concerns about the secular decline in the demand for oil, considering the growing focus on renewables.\r\nLooking at our performance scorecard, in the fourth quarter, five of nine core strategies outperformed their benchmarks.\r\nFor the last 12 months, six of nine core strategies outperformed.\r\nAs measured by AUM, 84% of our portfolios are outperforming on a 1-year basis, an improvement from 70% last quarter, mostly due to our preferred portfolios.\r\nOn a 1- and 3-year basis, 99% are outperforming, which was consistent with last quarter.\r\nPreferreds returned 4.6% in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe outperformed in both our core and low-duration preferred strategies.\r\nAfter a brief stretch of underperformance, we've now outperformed for three consecutive quarters.\r\nOur 12-month figures are beginning to turn positive across our accounts, which led to the improvement in our 12-month outperforming AUM.\r\nWhile our relative performance was mixed in 2020, we outperformed all peers.\r\nTaking stock of the critical factors for preferreds, unprecedented monetary stimulus has helped to compress credit spreads to near record low levels.\r\nCredit quality should benefit as the recovery progresses.\r\nWith 2020 elections over, the expectation for more fiscal stimulus, and potentially, with the bottoming of inflation, treasury yields may be transitioning from declining to rising.\r\nAs a result, companies are taking their queue from markets and issuing significant amounts of preferreds at a very low cost of capital.\r\nTaken together, these factors lead us to expect lower returns from preferreds, and we are currently suggesting that investors consider our low-duration strategy.\r\nWith that as a starting point, we believe that conditions later in 2021 and 2022 may create good entry points for thes Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n In addition, a slide deck providing detailed financial results for the quarter is also posted on our website.\r\nThis quarter e-commerce data is not included in our category overview as the data is not currently available.\r\nIt is uncertain when that data will become available in the future.\r\nToday, I am pleased to share our second quarter 2021 results, which build on the momentum from our first quarter as we benefited from elevated demand, expanded distribution and strong execution, all of which led to robust earnings growth.\r\nAs we look specifically at the results for the quarter, we maintained top line momentum with organic sales of 12.7% with strong sales across categories and markets around the globe.\r\nWe were able to meet that demand while also demonstrating improved cost control and delivering synergies, which partially offset the inflationary headwinds from transportation, tariffs and product input costs.\r\nOur adjusted earnings per share were $0.77, more than double the prior-year, driven by strong organic sales growth, synergy realization, favorable currencies and lower interest expense.\r\nGiven our performance in the first half, we are increasing our full fiscal year outlook to the following.\r\nNet sales growth to 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share to a new range of $3.30 to $3.50 and adjusted EBITDA to a new range of $620 million to $640 million.\r\nTim will provide more information on both the quarterly results and the revised outlook in a moment.\r\nTurning to category trends.\r\nConsumer demand in our categories remains elevated.\r\nAs a reminder, the category data I'm about to provide does not include e-commerce, as Jackie indicated in our opening comments.\r\nStarting with batteries, few changes in consumer behavior that have emerged since the beginning of COVID drove the battery category globally.\r\nFirst, an increase in the number of devices on per household; and second, an increase in the amount of time devices are being used, which has led to more frequent battery replacement.\r\nDuring the three months ending February, our brands grew faster than the category and we gained 2.1 share points globally as we benefited from the previously discussed distribution gains.\r\nIn the most recent four weeks through March, in markets like the U.S., Australia and the UK, the category experienced year-over-year declines as we lapped the initial spike in COVID related buy.\r\nWe anticipated these year-over-year declines, including a 13.9% decline in the U.S. during that four-week timeframe.\r\nHowever, if you look at those same markets on a two-year basis, there is robust growth when compared to the pre-pandemic levels.\r\nIn the U.S., for example, the category was up 14.1% for that four-week period when you compare 2019 to 2021.\r\nAcross both the most recent four weeks and the two-year basis, Energizer significantly outpaced the category.\r\nLooking at the U.S. AutoCare category, in the 13 weeks through February, we saw a healthy category growth of 7.4% as the category experienced both an increase in household penetration and existing consumer spending more on cleaning and maintaining their cars.\r\nGiven the seasonality of our portfolio, the cold weather and the short-term constraints on our wipes supply which have recently been resolved, Energizer lag category growth in the U.S. Similar to batteries, we are seeing category growth in the latest four weeks and on a two-year basis with Energizer outpacing the category.\r\nFinally, while we don't have e-commerce category data this quarter, our net sales have increased 70% across our combined portfolio, a reflection of our investments and ongoing focus which are paying off and positioning us to lead well into the future.\r\nThe environment remains dynamic and we can't predict the impact of vaccines, the virus variance or the resulting consumer habits.\r\nHowever, in surveys with consumers, many expect their pandemic influence habits to continue, including the increased use of devices such as home health and home office equipment as well as increased focus on their auto cleaning habits.\r\nDuring the quarter, we faced inflationary headwinds from transportation, tariffs and input costs.\r\nHowever, we were able to offset a significant portion of these through the delivery of synergies.\r\nAs we look to the future, we do not believe that these costs are transitory and have initiated productivity and revenue management efforts to offset them.\r\nOur revenue management efforts are focused in three main areas.\r\nChannel and mix management across our markets, brands and pack sizes, including leveraging the breadth of our strong battery brands from premium to value.\r\nResetting our promotional framework, including the frequency and depth of promotion and price increases based on a longer-term outlook of product input costs, our innovation pipeline and currency impacts.\r\nAs an example of this work, we've recently announced price increases in the U.S. in our AutoCare portfolio to offset the headwinds we are experiencing.\r\nGoing forward, we will evaluate a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions, product input costs, transportation costs, market dynamics, innovation and currency to assess the need for additional pricing actions across the balance of our portfolio.\r\nOur internal initiatives designed to reshape our organization and to ensure we are poised for future growth are all progressing well.\r\nSpecifically, we are on track to deliver over $120 million in synergies by the end of fiscal 2021, a portion of which is being reinvested in the business through innovation and brand building activities.\r\nWe have significantly increased production in the Indonesian plant that we acquired in the first quarter, which provides us with a source of high-quality products at lower costs.\r\nWe have built an impressive innovation pipeline for our AutoCare business and have advanced our international growth plans with International AutoCare organic growth for the second quarter at 24%.\r\nOur global product supply team has made significant strides in reshaping our network, which we expect will result in greater efficiency, effectiveness and supply chain resiliency.\r\nAnd finally, we have launched project to advance our organization's data and analytics capabilities, creating a seamless data flow which starts with the consumer and ease its way through our organization in a more automated manner, will ensure that we are positioned to meet the demands of consumers in a rapidly changing operating environment.\r\nWith that, I will now turn things over to Tim who will dive deeper into our financial performance for the quarter and provide more details about our updated outlook for the fiscal year.\r\nAs Mark touched on, as we crossed the halfway mark for the fiscal year, we are pleased with our continued momentum.\r\nOur organic revenue growth of 12.7% combined with synergy realization, cost controls, lower interest expense and favorable currency headwinds resulted in strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.77, up more than double the prior-year second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $148 million, up 20% compared to the prior year.\r\nTaking a deeper look at the organic revenue growth.\r\nWe maintained our top line momentum with strong sales across all of our categories and geographies.\r\nBoth of our segments showed organic growth with the Americas up nearly 16% and International up 6%, and our Battery and Auto Care businesses grew benefiting from elevated demand and distribution gains that began last summer.\r\nAdjusted gross margin decreased 110 basis points versus the prior year to 40.5% in line with our adjusted gross margin reported in the first quarter.\r\nThis was impacted primarily by increased operating costs that resulted from higher tariffs associated with source product to meet elevated demand, transportation, labor and product input cost, all consistent with inflationary trends in the global market.\r\nAdditionally, our gross margin was negatively impacted by the lower Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

volume decreased with a negative impact of $4 million, equivalent to a 1.3% decrease in volume.\r\nVariable costs increased with a negative impact of $12 million, primarily due to increases in metal prices as well as materials and services and not completely offset by cost reductions.\r\nFixed costs decreased with a positive impact of $4 million, in line with our guidance.\r\nReconciling versus prior year, operating income quarter three 2021 compared to adjusted operating income in quarter three 2020, based on $174 million higher sales, or $172 million excluding exchange rate impacts, adjusted operating income increased by $62 million to $124 million in Q3 2021, from $61 million in Q3 2020.\r\nThe main elements were: Average selling prices had a positive impact of $18 million, representing a 2.2% ASP increase; volume increased with a positive impact of $70 million, representing a 23.2% increase.\r\nVariable costs increased with a negative impact of $8 million.\r\nVolume-related manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction efforts did not completely offset higher metal prices, annual wage increases and higher tariffs.\r\nFixed cost increased with a negative impact of $17 million, primarily due to annual wage increases and higher incentive compensation costs, only partially offset by our restructuring programs.\r\nInventory impacts had a positive impact of $9 million.\r\nExchange rates had a negative effect of $9 million.\r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $102 million, in line with our guidance, excluding exchange rate impacts.\r\nFor quarter four 2021, our expectations are approximately $104 million of SG&A expenses at current exchange rates.\r\nThe debt shown on the face of our balance sheet at quarter end is comprised of the convertible notes due 2025 net of debt issuance costs.\r\nThere were no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter.\r\nHowever, we did use the revolver from time to time during Q3 to meet short-term financing needs and expect to continue to do so in the future.\r\nNo principal payments are due until 2025, and the revolving credit facility expires in June 2024.\r\nWe had total liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end.\r\nCash and short-term investments comprised $916 million, and there are no amounts outstanding on our $750 million credit facility.\r\nTotal shares outstanding at quarter end were 145 million.\r\nThe expected share count for earnings per share purposes for the fourth quarter 2021 is approximately 145.6 million.\r\nOur convertible debt repurchase activity over the past three years, together with the adoption of the new convertible debt standard significantly reduces the variability of our earnings per share to share count.\r\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate year-to-date was approximately 18%, which mathematically yields a rate of 17% for quarter three.\r\nIn quarter three, we recorded a tax benefit of $5.7 million due to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions.\r\nWe also recorded benefits of $8.3 million year-to-date due to changes in tax regulations.\r\nOur normalized effective tax rate, which excludes the unusual tax items, was approximately 22% for the quarter, and 23% for the year-to-date period.\r\nWe expect our normalized effective tax rate for full year 2021 to be between 22% and 24%.\r\nOur consolidated effective tax rate is based on an assumed level and mix of income among our various taxing jurisdictions.\r\nA shift in income could result in significantly different results.\r\nAlso a significant change in U.S. tax laws or regulations could result in significantly different results.\r\nCash from operations for the quarter was $136 million.\r\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million.\r\nFree cash for the quarter was $79 million.\r\nFor the trailing 12 months, cash from operations was $436 million, capital expenditures were $171 million, split approximately for expansion, $113 million;

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.\r\ndicks.com for approximately 12 months.\r\nAnd finally, a few admin items.\r\nFirst, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices.\r\nOur consolidated same-store sales calculation includes stores that we chose to temporarily close last year as a result of COVID-19.\r\nThe method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19.\r\nAccordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers.\r\nNext, as a reminder, due to uneven nature of 2020, we plan 2021 off of 2019 baseline.\r\nAccordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020.\r\nWe are extremely pleased to announce yet another quarter of record results as we continued to execute at a very high level and capitalize on incredibly strong consumer demand.\r\nWe're in a great lane right now, and 2021 will be our boldest and most transformational year in the company's history.\r\nWe believe the future of retail is experiential, powered by technology and a world-class omnichannel operating model.\r\nImportantly, we are reimagining the athlete experience, both across our core business and through new concepts that we have been working on for the past several years, which will collectively propel our growth in the future.\r\nWe've recently debuted DICK's House of Sport in Rochester, New York.\r\nIt's off to a great start and is on track to become among our highest volume stores in the chain.\r\nWe've reimagined virtually everything in the store and believe it sets the standard for sport retailing and athlete engagement.\r\nOur partners who have visited the store all agree there is nothing like it, and we hope everyone has the opportunity to see it in person.\r\nNext we are completely reengineering our Golf Galaxy business.\r\nThe game of golf is in great shape.\r\nOur golf business has been tremendous.\r\nWith Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters, we're leaning into this straight by investing in our Golf Galaxy business and adding TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience.\r\nWe are also investing in talent to elevate the in-store service model and are remodeling 18 stores this year.\r\nThe new stores we've remodeled are showing promising results.\r\nLooking ahead, we expect golf to have a long runway, and we are committed to leveraging this momentum for future growth within our business.\r\nWe've been working on Public Lands for several years and look forward to opening our first two stores later this year.\r\nBased on our research, we think there is an opportunity in the marketplace and believe this new concept will be a great growth vehicle for us.\r\nImportantly, conservation will play a prominent role in our new Public Lands concept.\r\nAnd we will champion environmental issues as we speak up to protect the planet and our Public Lands.\r\nAs a member of the outdoor industry, we have also joined forces with other retailers to advocate for conserving 30% of the U.S. lands and waters by 2030.\r\nWe expect to have the same voice and as much impact on these issues as we've had inside the DICK's business, highlighting the youth sports crisis and sensible gun legislation.\r\nWe'll be sharing more details about our plans for Public Lands in the weeks and months ahead.\r\nIn closing, you can see DICK's is a growth company, and we will continue to invest in our business to grow our lead as the nation's largest sport retailer.\r\nWe see significant growth opportunities within DICK's and Golf Galaxy as well as with House of Sport and Public Lands.\r\nWe will continue to invest in our vertical brands.\r\nAnd with our key partners, including Nike, North Face, Callaway, TaylorMade and others, to elevate the athlete experience across the stores and online.\r\nOur Q1 consolidated same-store sales increased 115% as we anniversaried the majority of our temporary store closures from last year.\r\nThe strength of our diverse category portfolio, supply chain, technology capabilities and omnichannel execution helped us continue to capitalize on strong consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle.\r\nWe also saw a resurgence in our team sports business as kids began to get back out on the field after a year in which many youth sports activities were delayed or canceled.\r\nOur strong comps were supported by sales growth of over 100% within each of our three primary categories; the hardlines, apparel and footwear as well as increases in both average ticket and transactions.\r\nLike others, we also benefited from the recent stimulus checks.\r\nThese results combined translate to a 52% sales increase when combined -- sorry, when compared to the first quarter of 2019.\r\nFrom a channel standpoint, our brick and mortar stores generated significant triple-digit comps, and importantly, delivered an approximate 40% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage.\r\nOur eCommerce sales increased 14%, which was on top of our 110% online sales increase in the same period last year when the vast majority of our stores were closed for over six weeks.\r\nThis represented nearly a 140% increase when compared to 2019.\r\nWithin eCommerce, in-store pickup and curbside continued to be a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering, increasing approximately 500% when compared to BOPIS sales during the first quarter of 2019.\r\nAnd as a percent of online sales, we saw sequential growth compared to the second half of last year.\r\nThese same-day services along with ship from store are fully enabled by our stores which are the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment.\r\nDuring Q1, our stores enabled approximately 90% of our total sales and fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales through either ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside.\r\nThroughout the quarter, we remained disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained.\r\nAs a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 787 basis points versus 2020 and 312 basis points versus 2019.\r\nThis merchandise margin expansion, along with substantial leverage on fixed costs, drove a significant improvement in gross margin.\r\nIn total, our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79 not only represented a 511% increase over Q1 2019, but eclipse our full year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.59.\r\nDuring the first quarter last year, we recorded a net loss per share of $1.71 as we temporarily closed our stores to promote the safety of our teammates, athletes and communities.\r\nLooking ahead, we remain very enthusiastic about our business and we're raising our full year sales and earnings guidance.\r\nOur financial outlook balances this enthusiasm with the uncertainties that still exist, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year.\r\nLee will address our outlook in greater detail within his remarks.\r\nNow let me provide a few updates on our strategic growth drivers.\r\nFirst, within merchandising, our well defined brand strategy drive differentiation and exclusivity within our assortments as we leverage both our key national brand partnerships and our highly profitable and growing vertical brand portfolio.\r\nDuring the quarter, our vertical brands continue to be a significant source of strength, posting triple-digit comps with merchandise margin rate expansion that outperformed the company average.\r\nWe saw sustained success in DSG, our largest vertical brand as well as in CALIA, our second largest women's athletic apparel brand.\r\nThis year we are investing to make our vertical brands even stronger through improved space in-store and increased marketing.\r\nIn March, we  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that Earl joined less than a month ago after the fiscal year end; and although quickly acclimating himself to the business, should you have any questions after today's call, please follow-up with Investor Relations accordingly.\r\nIt's hard to believe we're already at the close of 2020 and covering our fourth quarter results.\r\nOn the other hand, we're about to discuss only the second full quarter of COVID-19's impact on our financials.\r\nIn Q4, we reported revenues of approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter.\r\nThis represents a 9.9% decline versus last year and a considerable sequential improvement when comparing to our more than 15% decline in Q3.\r\nOnce again, our diversified client base demonstrates the resilience of our business.\r\nOur Technology & Manufacturing industry group grew almost 7% and Business & Industry as well as Education posted revenue results that were only slightly down.\r\nAs one would expect, our Aviation segment drove the majority of our organic decline versus last year.\r\nTechnical Solutions also saw a large revenue decline and continued to see challenges in site access, which affected churn rates.\r\nPositively, the backlog of committed work in Technical Solutions is healthy and the pipeline for '21 is robust.\r\nSo all things considered, it was a good revenue story for the quarter.\r\nFrom a profit perspective, there was sustained demand for higher margin COVID-related work orders and our enhanced cleaning program, particularly in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing.\r\nOur financial performance was protected by our variable labor model and our ability to dynamically adjust staffing based on demand, and we continue to see profit arbitrage by efficiently managing labor as we scaled and consolidated staff during the quarter.\r\nThis has been one of the key contributors of our financial performance through the pandemic.\r\nAs a result of all of these factors, we grew earnings on both the GAAP and an adjusted basis versus last year.\r\nIncome from continued operations grew to $53.1 million or $0.78 per share.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, we delivered $46.7 million or $0.69 per share.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2% versus 5.6% last year.\r\nEven more compelling, these results incorporate a non-cash reserve we took for an entertainment-related project within our Technical Solutions segment.\r\nThis was a unique circumstance in client, and not a reflection of our broader project portfolio within Technical Solutions.\r\nThis had 120 basis point impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin as well as our earnings.\r\nSo even when including this distinctive event, quarter-after-quarter, our performance continues to demonstrate consistent strength and execution.\r\nIn so many ways, 2020 will stand out as a pivotal year for ABM.\r\nThe pandemic has created a shift in the public mindset as professional Class A janitorial services are now unquestionably viewed as an essential and non-discretionary service.\r\nFacility owners must demonstrate that they are providing clean, healthy and safe spaces that their occupants can trust.\r\nNot only will this be required, but it will be a reflection of their brand.\r\nOur response with our EnhancedClean service, gives our clients the peace of mind that comes with studied protocols and practices that keep facilities safe, and this offering creates even more distance between us and our competitors.\r\nAs a company that's been around for more than 110 years, ABM has withstood and grown during many global events.\r\nBut 2020 tested us in historic ways and I've never been more inspired by our organization.\r\nI want to take a moment to recap some of our team's accomplishments more specifically.\r\nSince March, we have been on the frontlines battling a pandemic that has disrupted nearly every industry.\r\nWhile navigating a constantly evolving environment as we learn more about the virus, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees and our clients above all.\r\nAnd when it came to PPE and our global supply chain, our procurement team did not disappoint when others in our space did, as they couldn't accommodate surging demands.\r\nAlso, we partnered with large cleaning contractors to form the Cleaning Coalition of America to represent our industry which played a critical role in restoring our country.\r\nThe Coalition plans to press for vaccine priority for our industry and developed a focused campaign on awareness around what differentiates best-in-class providers.\r\nAt ABM, we were particularly proud of how we proactively developed our own expert-backed certified programs to answer our client's needs with disinfection protocols, such as specialized training and signage, electrostatic spraying of disinfectant and air filtration.\r\nAnd all of this is being supported by one of the most comprehensive marketing campaigns we've ever developed.\r\nWhat shouldn't be minimized is the fact that we mobilized multiple cross-functional task forces across all the critical areas of our business that elevated our adeptness and will endure long past the pandemic.\r\nThese task forces led to improved operating procedures for labor management, sales and financial activities.\r\nAs an example, our approach to collections led us to generate more than $450 million in cash flow from operations and $420 million in free cash flow, both records for the firm.\r\nThis translates to nearly $1 billion of liquidity, including $400 million of cash, which is an extremely powerful position to be in during still uncertain times.\r\nAs we move into 2021, our intention is to capitalize on the momentum and shift from defense to offense.\r\nBeginning with our executive team, we recently announced several appointments to further align our internal organizational structure to our business strategies.\r\nEarl is a seasoned finance executive joining us from Best Buy, a leading Fortune 500 provider of consumer technology products and services with 125,000 employees in North America.\r\nEarl held several executive positions across finance and most recently he was responsible for leading enterprise capital project planning plus transformation and procurement as well as supporting digital and technology and global real estate.\r\nDuring his tenure at Best Buy, Earl also spearheaded several strategic initiatives targeting labor and logistics.\r\nEarl joined less than three weeks ago but is quickly immersing himself in our business.\r\nI'm also excited that Rene Jacobsen has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer and will lead all of our client-facing industry groups.\r\nSince joining ABM eight years ago, Rene has consistently driven our operational performance and service excellence and his leadership was unquestionably instrumental in our successful navigation of 2020.\r\nAs COO, he will provide strategic guidance for our operations and drive our financial results across all of our platforms.\r\nRene will also continue to work with Sean Mahoney our new President of Sales and Marketing.\r\nSince Sean's arrival in ABM in 2017, we've broken sales records each succeeding year and we achieved another record in 2020 with new sales at $1.2 billion, an amazing accomplishment for any year but especially in a year when so much of the economy was paused.\r\nWith both Rene and Sean's leadership, our operations and sales teams proved to be a powerful combination in 2020 and will undoubtedly exceed our expectations in 2021.\r\nSpeaking of 2021, later in the year, we will be sharing our refresh business strategy which builds on the positive changes and the acceleration we saw with our 2020 vision.\r\nAt that time, we will be reviewing our technology plan and path toward a digital platform for our employees and clients.\r\nIn fact, just as I discussed last quarter, some of our near-term investments are reengagements of IT projects that were put on hold due to the pandemic, like our ERP system and data management roadmap.\r\nOther investments will be new given the opportunities that arose as a r Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # ABM reported a 9.9% revenue decline to $1.5 billion in Q4, primarily due to the COVID-19 impact on Aviation and Technical Solutions segments. However, Technology & Manufacturing and Business & Industry saw growth. Despite the pandemic, earnings on both GAAP and adjusted basis increased year-over-year, driven by higher margin COVID-related work orders and effective labor management. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2%, demonstrating consistent strength even with a non-cash reserve taken for a Technical Solutions project. ABM's EnhancedClean service, introduced during the pandemic, generated over $300 million in sales, creating a competitive advantage. The company plans to invest in the first quarter, including IT projects and operational initiatives. For Q1, ABM forecasts adjusted EPS between $0.60 and $0.65 and GAAP EPS between $0.53 and $0.58. The company anticipates organic growth to be similar to Q4, with continued demand for higher margin work orders. Despite economic uncertainty, ABM remains optimistic and plans to provide full-year guidance in Q2 if visibility improves.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Patrick Burke, the company's head of investor relations.\r\nWe are pleased to be with you today to discuss our Q3 results, results that have exceeded our expectations, and strengthened our confidence in the future.\r\nWith recently announced plans to merge with Topgolf, we are naturally anticipating further questions on that subject as well.\r\nHaving said this, and turning to Page 6, let's now jump into our results.\r\nWe were pleased with our results in virtually all markets and business segments.\r\nOur golf equipment segment has been experiencing unprecedented demand globally as interest in the sport and participation has surged.\r\nWe saw strong market conditions in all markets globally.\r\nAccording to Golf Datatech, U.S. retail sales of golf equipment were up 42% during Q3, the highest Q3 on record.\r\nU.S. rounds were up 25% in September, and are now showing full-year growth despite the shutdowns earlier this year.\r\nWe also believe there will be a long-term benefit from the increased participation as we are welcoming both new entrants and returning golfers back to our sport.\r\nGolf retail, outside of resort locations, remains very strong at present and barring a shutdown situation has not been sensitive to the upticks in COVID cases.\r\nInventory at golf retail is at all-time lows and is likely these low inventory levels will continue into next year.\r\nCallaway's global hard goods market shares remained strong during the quarter.\r\nWe estimate our U.S. market share is roughly flat year over year.\r\nOur share in Japan is up slightly, and our share in Europe is down slightly.\r\nOn a global basis, I believe we remain the leading golf company in terms of market share and total revenues, and the No.\r\nIn the U.S., third-party research showed our brand to once again be the #1 club brand in overall brand rating as well as the leader in innovation and technology.\r\nOver the last several years, we have shown resilience with these important brand positions.\r\nWe have also started to show our 2021 product range to key customers and are receiving strong feedback.\r\nTurning to our soft goods and apparel segment, with total revenue only down 3.4% year over year, the segment also experienced a rapid recovery in demand during the quarter.\r\nThe speed and magnitude of the recovery exceeded our expectations.\r\nLike our golf equipment business, this segment appears to be well-positioned for both the months and years ahead, both during the pandemic and after.\r\nLooking at individual businesses in this segment, both our TravisMathew and Callaway branded businesses experienced significant year-over-year growth during the quarter.\r\nJack Wolfskin was down year over year but only 16% on a revenue basis with improved trends continuing into October.\r\nThe hero of the soft goods and apparel segment is certainly e-com, a channel that was strengthened by investments we've made over the last several years.\r\nAs a result of these investments, we were able to deliver a 108% year-over-year growth in this channel during the quarter.\r\nE-com is now a significant portion of the channel mix of this segment.\r\nWe believe our expanded capabilities and strength here will bolster this business growth prospects and profitability going forward.\r\nLong term, we continue to expect our apparel and soft goods segment to grow faster than our overall business, and with that growth to deliver operating leverage and enhance profitability.\r\nAnd although the pandemic delayed our efforts, we still believe we'll be able to deliver $15 million of synergies in this segment over the coming years.\r\nDuring the quarter, we also made good progress on key initiatives, including the transition to our new 800,000 square-foot Superhub distribution center located just outside of Fort Worth, Texas.\r\nWe are now completely consolidated into this new facility.\r\nWe also made further progress in our Chicopee golf ball facility modernization with productivity rates in this plant ramping positively during the quarter.\r\nThe primary investment phase on both of these significant projects is behind us now.\r\nLooking forward, we are in a strong financial position and are pleased with the pace of our recovery and the business trends we have seen.\r\nWith the resurgence in the virus, there clearly could be some volatility over the next few months.\r\nPortions of Q4 are likely to be at least partially impacted by the increase in restrictions being put into place globally.\r\nFortunately, for us, either low impact months for our golf equipment business, and we currently expect to continue to benefit from increased year-over-year demand.\r\nIn our apparel and soft goods segment, the impact will be larger than our golf equipment business.\r\nBut these businesses, too, are fortunate to be well-positioned in this environment and also benefit from strong e-com capabilities, which should offset some portion of any potential negative impacts in markets where in-store shopping might be constrained.\r\nWe also benefit from global scale and diversity across all of our segments.\r\nAs demonstrated by our Q3 results, we are fortunate in that our principal business segments are well-positioned for consumer needs and trends, both during the pandemic and afterward.\r\nIn addition, we are confident that we have both brands, human capital, and financial strength necessary to not only weather this storm but to also perform well during it and to emerge stronger than when we entered the crisis.\r\nIn closing, while we are pleased with our recent results and outlook, the safety and health of the company's employees, customers, and partners continue to be paramount in our minds.\r\nAs we operate our businesses, we are careful to follow appropriate protocols for social distancing, in-office capacity management, personal protective equipment, and other safety precautions.\r\nIn addition, our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to those directly impacted by the virus and those diligently working on the front line to protect, serve, and care for the rest of us.\r\nBrian, over to you.\r\nWe are happy to report record net sales and earnings for the third quarter of 2020.\r\nWe feel fortunate that both our golf equipment and soft goods businesses are recovering faster than expected as both businesses support healthy, active outdoor lifestyles and activities that are compatible with social distancing.\r\nThis faster-than-expected recovery has placed us in a position of strength.\r\nOur available liquidity, which includes cash on hand plus availability under our credit facilities increased to $630 million on September 30, 2020, compared to $340 million on September 30, 2019.\r\nWe are also excited about our prospective merger with Topgolf, which also provides a healthy, active, outdoor activity that is compatible with social distancing.\r\nAnd Callaway Topgolf merger is a natural fit.\r\nWith the significant overlap in golf consumers, there should be significant advantages to both businesses through increased consumer engagement, marketing, and sales opportunities and faster growth than could be achieved on a stand-alone basis.\r\nAnd the best part is that these synergies provide upside to the financial model we provided.\r\nThe financial returns of this transaction are so compelling, we did not need the synergies to justify the transaction.\r\nGrowing the Topgolf Venue and Toptracer businesses alone will create significant shareholder value.\r\nWe look forward to discussing the Topgolf business further during the virtual investor conference on Thursday.\r\nIn evaluating our results for the third quarter, you should keep in mind some specific factors that affect year-over-year comparisons.\r\nFirst, as a result of the Jack Wolfskin acquisition in January 2019, we incurred nonrecurring transaction and transition-related expenses in 2019.\r\nSecond, as a result of the OGIO, TravisMathew, and Jack Wolfskin acquisition, we incurred non-cash amortization in 2020 and 2019, including amortization of the Jack Wolfskin inventory step-up in t Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Joining me on the call today are Tim Gokey, our Chief Executive Officer; and our Chief Financial Officer, Edmund Reese.\r\nA summary of these risks can be found on the second and third page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.\r\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results.\r\nI'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives.\r\nIt's an exciting time to be at Broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started.\r\nI'm pleased to share that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results.\r\nRecurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%.\r\nOur results in both ICS and GTO are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization, mutualization and the democratization of investing.\r\nThese trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes.\r\nWe're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management.\r\nI'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes.\r\nA combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business.\r\nWe've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti.\r\nWe're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line.\r\nWe now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%.\r\nWhile the new guidance reflects the impact of Itiviti, the bulk of this raise is organic, as Edmund will discuss.\r\nThe net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and M&A investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.\r\nWe remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns.\r\nBroadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan.\r\nSo let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on Slide five.\r\nI'll start with ICS.\r\nRecurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth.\r\nThe biggest driver of ICS' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and I'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results.\r\nLet me share two examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth.\r\nThe first is the Shareholder Rights Directive II.\r\nOver the past two years, we've created a shareholder communications hub, linking millions of investors across the EU and with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way.\r\nNow as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business.\r\nVirtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues.\r\nOver the past year, we've upgraded our VSM capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting.\r\nThose upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth.\r\nWe are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring.\r\nThe second factor driving ICS was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter.\r\nIt's clear, the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth.\r\nThat strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients but has been most pronounced at the online brokers.\r\nIt has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases.\r\nWe did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called meme stocks like GameStop.\r\nBut those increases only contributed one point of the overall growth.\r\nCommission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend.\r\nIt includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade.\r\nBroadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments.\r\nLooking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4.\r\nTo close off on governance.\r\nLet me touch briefly on regulatory.\r\nI want to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman.\r\nAs we have with every chair and administration of both parties

must a bad connection.\r\nI'm David Smith, the Company's CEO.\r\nJoining me on the call today is our President, Mr. Jeff Dyke; our CFO, Mr. Heath Byrd; our Executive Vice President of Operations, Mr. Tim Keen; our Chief Digital Retail Officer, Mr. Steve Wittman; and our Vice President of Investor Relations, Danny Wieland.\r\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we continue to build on our strong momentum coming off record adjusted earnings in 2020.\r\nWe generated record first quarter total revenues of $2.8 billion, up 21% on a year-over-year basis and record first quarter earnings per share of $1.23 per share, tripling our adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 per share in the first quarter of last year.\r\nThese results were driven by strong performance in our franchise dealerships, and another all-time record quarter for our EchoPark business, reflecting increasing consumer demand and continued execution by our team.\r\nI'm pleased to report positive trends in the first quarter have continued into the second quarter, and we continue to see strength in all facets of our business.\r\nWe remain extremely confident in our long-term growth targets based on our current results and near-term outlook and the increasing number of Americans that are receiving vaccinations and beginning a return toward normalcy.\r\nGiven these trends in our progress to date, we are confident we can attain our goal of more than doubling total revenues to $25 billion by 2025.\r\nAnd significantly increasing profitability going forward.\r\nIn our core franchise dealership segment, first quarter revenues were $2.3 billion, a 15% increase from last year.\r\nTotal franchise pre-tax income was $70.5 million, an increase of $47.9 million or 211% compared to last year.\r\nOn a two-year comparison compared to the first quarter of 2019, same-store franchise dealership revenues increased 14% and pre-tax income increased by $49.8 million, which is a 240% increase, reflecting the impact of our lower expense structure as a result of strategic actions that was taken last year.\r\nTurning now to EchoPark.\r\nWe continue to experience rapid growth during the first quarter, achieving all time record quarterly revenues of $507 million, which is up 53% compared to the same period last year.\r\nWe also achieved record quarterly retail sales volume of nearly 19,700 units, which is up 41% year-over-year and ahead of 18,000 to 19,000 units we guided to on our February call.\r\nIn addition to top line growth, we have to -- build of our EchoPark model that currently use vehicle pricing environment during the total gross profit per unit of $2,339 and above our target of $2,150.\r\nOur first active part delivery center in Greenville, South Carolina continues to outperform our model selling 160 vehicles in March at nearly $1,750 in total gross profit per unit.\r\nGenerally $100,000 and store level profit for the month.\r\nOur outlook in the EchoPark stores and delivery centers also continue to ramp aggressively.\r\nWith our Phoenix hub selling 228 vehicles in its full month in March, driving $125,000 of store level profit.\r\nThe unit ratio of December's used car acquisition is already ramping up nicely selling 300 plus in total gross profit per unit.\r\nAnd we continue to apply our learnings to each new EchoPark store we opened or acquired.\r\nAnd results are proving the scalability and momentum of the EchoPark model.\r\nWe believe these results showcase the flexibility, value proposition and consumer demand or EchoPark's unique pre-owned vehicle shopping concept as more guests choose to visit our stores and or shop echopark.com for the incredible inventory selection on diesel pricing and a unique guest experience that we offer.\r\nAs an update on our expansion of EchoPark's nationwide distribution network and omnichannel retailing platform, we opened five new locations in the first quarter.\r\nIn April, we opened our latest retail hub in Birmingham, Alabama and our third delivery center in Charleston, South Carolina.\r\nWe remain committed to opening 25 new EchoPark locations in 2021 and we're on track for our 140 plus point nationwide distribution network by 2025, which we expect to retail over 0.5 million pre-owned vehicles annually by that time.\r\nWith our progress to-date and the continuing development of our omnichannel retailing platform, we are confident that we can reach $14 billion in EchoPark revenue by 2025.\r\nIt's important to recall that Sonic actually grew earnings per share in the first quarter of last year compared to 2019 due to the strength of our January and February results despite the initial impact of the pandemic in March of 2020.\r\nSince that time, we have substantially improved our expense structure, which was reflected in the current quarter's profitability and operating margins and our expectations for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\r\nIn the first quarter of 2021, total SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit were 72.2% representing a 830 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of last year and 790 basis points better than the first quarter of 2019 which in dollar terms, while same store franchise gross profit increased 34.5 [Phonetic] last year, same-store franchise SG&A expenses decreased $7.5 million, demonstrating the permanent expense reductions we had previously [Technical Issues].\r\nTurning now to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $435 million in available liquidity and set an all time high liquidity mark in April at $570 million which included over $300 million in cash on hand.\r\nMore recently, the Company closed a new four-year $1.8 billion credit facility.\r\nThe credit facility was substantially oversubscribed with strong support from both new and incumbent financial partners.\r\nWe are very pleased with this transaction which has extended our debt maturities, improved our borrowing costs and raised our total available liquidity and fore-playing capacity to facilitate our growth plans.\r\nReflecting our current business momentum, expansion of liquidity resources, I'm very pleased to report that our Board of Directors recently approved 20% increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.12 per share payable on July 15, 2021 to all shareholders of record on June 15, 2021.\r\nAdditionally, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $250 million, bringing our total remaining authorization to $277 million.\r\nIn summary, our record first quarter performance reflects steadily increasing automotive retail demand as well as constantly improving operating conditions.\r\nEchoPark has rapidly become one of the leading success stories in the pre-owned automotive retail industry, and we look forward to continuing its rapid expansion in 2021.\r\nWe expect to see continued strong demand for both new and pre-owned vehicles in the near term, which should drive further growth for our franchise dealerships and the EchoPark brand.\r\nAt the same time, our efficiency improvements have enabled us and had enabled us to operate in a much leaner more profitable manner.\r\nDespite the challenges we all faced in the last year during this global pandemic, Sonic and EchoPark has emerged as much stronger, more efficient organization.\r\nWe are encouraged by our successes to-date and remain confident in our long-term strategic plans.\r\n Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash flow.\r\nWhether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date, or our projections for the full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow.\r\nIt's also apparent that we continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.\r\nThe question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash.\r\nWe have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.\r\nThis quarter, we announced two fairly significant acquisitions.\r\nThe first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion.\r\nThese assets expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas.\r\nThe acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.\r\nOur second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million.\r\nSteve will talk about this acquisition in detail.\r\nWe believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy transition businesses; that we are exploring.\r\nNow, let me conclude with two important points.\r\nBoth of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash.\r\nI believe both fit within the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our board looks at all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.\r\nOn the Stagecoach, storage and transportation assets drew $1.2 billion.\r\nWe closed that transaction earlier this month.\r\nIt adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline.\r\nWe're excited about this transaction for several reasons.\r\nAs we discussed on the first-quarter call, we think storage value is going to increase over time.\r\nIts value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions.\r\nStorage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the grid.\r\nThe Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system, as well as other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint, and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built.\r\nWe're excited about this transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.\r\nThe second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly formed Energy Transition Ventures Group.\r\nWe put that together in the first quarter of this year.\r\nWe're acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other closing conditions.\r\nAt signing, Kinetrex had secured three new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than six times EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023.\r\nWith Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market.\r\nIt gives us a nice head start on working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project candidates in the U.S. A few more points on this deal.\r\nAs several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the value is dependent on RINs value.\r\nYou don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception that I'll get to in a minute.\r\nImportantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs, which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well.\r\nD3s are for advanced biofuels and promoting more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from the environmental community than conventional ethanol.\r\nHaving said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility.\r\nBased on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called voluntary market.\r\nThese are customers who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.\r\nThere are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value.\r\nSo we will look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.\r\nWhen we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on attractive returns for our shareholders, not loss leaders and not doing things for show.\r\nThis deal is a great example of that.\r\nIn the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities.\r\nSo very good progress in a short period of time.\r\nThese two deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business.\r\nThe larger deal, Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest transportation and storage network in the country.\r\nThat reflects our view that our existing business will be needed for decades to come.\r\nHydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world.\r\nThat's something we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.\r\nAt the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and we're positioning ourselves there as well.\r\nWe're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries.\r\nWe're doing it in responsibly sourced, that is low methane emissions, natural gas.\r\nWe had our second such transaction this quarter.\r\nWe're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as well.\r\nThe Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start.\r\nThe takeaway from all of this is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.\r\nFirst, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.\r\nStarting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter.\r\nTransport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020.\r\nAnd that was driven primarily by LNG, Mexico exports, and power demand on TGP, the PHP in-service, higher industrial and LNG demand on our Texas intrastate system, and then higher deliveries to our Elba Express LNG facility.\r\nThese increases were partially offset by lower volumes on CIG.\r\nAnd that's due to declines in Rockies production and Fayetteville E Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Kinder Morgan, characterized by strong cash flow generation, has announced two strategic acquisitions: Stagecoach, expanding its natural gas storage and pipeline network, and Kinetrex, marking its entry into the renewable natural gas (RNG) market. Both acquisitions meet the company's investment criteria and leverage internally generated cash. The Stagecoach acquisition is particularly promising due to the increasing value of storage and transportation assets in light of intermittent renewable energy sources. The Kinetrex acquisition provides a platform for exploring the rapidly growing RNG market, mitigating price volatility through potential partnerships and long-term contracts. Despite an impairment charge, Kinder Morgan's second-quarter financial performance was solid. Overall, the company experienced increased demand in its natural gas, refined products, terminals, and steel businesses. Higher commodity prices and better volumes contributed to its strong performance. Projected 2021 DCF reached $5.4 billion, exceeding previous estimates. Kinder Morgan remains committed to dividend growth and expects to end 2021 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.\r\nThese risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports.\r\nI look forward to speaking with you today about PulteGroup's third quarter operating and financial results.\r\nIn combination, top line growth and margin expansion helped drive higher earnings per share of $1.82.\r\nThis is an increase of 36% over the prior year's third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share.\r\nInclusive of these strong third quarter numbers through the first 9 months of 2021, our home sale revenues were up 22% to $9.2 billion while our reported earnings per share are up 36% to $4.85.\r\nThe resulting strong cash flow being generated by our operations continues to put our company in an enviable position in which we can invest in our business, return funds to shareholders and still maintain outstanding balance sheet strength and overall liquidity.\r\nMore specifically, consistent with our constructive view on the housing market, we have invested $2.9 billion in land acquisition and development so far this year.\r\nOur $2.9 billion of land spend is comparable to what we invested for the full year in both 2020 and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, and we remain fully on track to invest approximately $4 billion in total for the full year of 2021.\r\nI would highlight that while we are investing more into the business, we remain disciplined and focused on building a more efficient and lower-risk land pipeline.\r\nAt the end of the third quarter, our lots under option had grown to 54% of our total controlled lot position compared to when I set the initial 50% option target, we have over 65,000 more lots under option and now view 50% as the floor rather than the ceiling in terms of how we control our land assets.\r\nConsistent with our capital allocation priorities, along with investing $948 million more in land acquisition and development through the first 9 months of 2021 compared with last year, we have also returned $726 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have paid off nearly $800 million in debt this year, leaving us with a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 5.7%.\r\nFinally, consistent with our strategic focus, our operating and financial performance has helped drive a return on equity of 26% for the trailing 12 months.\r\nJust like the broader economy, our operations continue to be impacted by the pandemic.\r\nOn one hand, we are managing through the disruptions COVID-19 and the Delta variant have inflicted on our workforce, our trade partners and the global supply chain.\r\nOn the other hand, our results have certainly benefited from the remarkable demand and pricing environment the homebuilding industry has experienced over the past 18 months.\r\nEither way, to deliver our third quarter numbers during the global pandemic and with a supply chain that is clearly struggling reflects the commitment and tireless efforts of the entire PulteGroup team.\r\nSince we updated our production guidance in early September, broader industry comments have validated the challenges within the construction supply chain are significant and don't have any quick fixes.\r\nBased on a myriad of calls and questions we have received, I think it's hard for everyone to appreciate the full magnitude of the issues we're facing when you're not dealing with them on a day-to-day basis.\r\nFor some products, it's simply the materials aren't available.\r\nSometimes you can switch to an alternative.\r\nBut when you can, you wait.\r\nFor others, it's changing lead times where order fulfillment has gone from 6 weeks to 16 weeks, back to 11 weeks and then back to 16 weeks.\r\nAnd for others, it's seeing allocations being imposed as manufacturers and distributors do their best to keep their major customers, which I would note we are one, at least partially satisfied.\r\nOur local divisions may not get much advanced notice of the shortage resulting allocations so we have to adjust on the fly.\r\nIn other cases, it's logistics.\r\nWhen you're forced to ship materials to solve near-term issues, this might be shipping siding from the Southeast to the Southwest or our trades driving across the state for paint.\r\nIn one form or another, these issues impacted our third quarter results and, as Bob will detail, will put additional pressure on our deliveries and margins in the fourth quarter.\r\nAs difficult and frustrating as this is, I can say that our suppliers have been outstanding partners and routinely bend over backwards to get us the materials we need to solve our issues.\r\nI can say that we've been clear with our teams that we have to be -- that we have to overcommunicate with customers to keep them informed of any schedule changes.\r\nWe also have to be flexible and creative in sourcing materials even if this means spending additional dollars to acquire needed resources.\r\nAnd finally, we must maintain our standards on the quality and completeness of each home that we deliver.\r\nGiven the very problems impacting the supply chain, we would expect a solution that -- we would expect that solutions will be found over different time lines, depending on the suppliers' underlying issue.\r\nIn the interim, we will adjust our production estimates for the fourth quarter and work to position the business for more consistent cadence in the year ahead.\r\nWe will also continue to work in close partnership with our suppliers to manage through the supply chain issues as quickly and as intelligently as possible.\r\nOur teams have done an outstanding job navigating through the challenging production environment, which can be seen in the exceptional operating and financial results we delivered in the quarter.\r\nStarting with our income statement.\r\nOur home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 18% over last year to $3.3 billion.\r\nThe increase in revenues was driven by a 9% increase in closings to 7,007 homes in combination with an 8% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $474,000.\r\nThe higher average sales price realized in the third quarter reflects meaningful price increases we've realized across all buyer groups, with first-time up 8%, move-up up 10% and active adult up 8%.\r\nThe mix of homes we delivered in the third quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 44% from move-up buyers and 24% from active adult buyers.\r\nIn last year's third quarter, 30% of homes delivered were first-time, 45% were move-up and 25% were active adult.\r\nOur net new orders for the third quarter were 6,796 homes, which represents a 17% decrease from last year that was driven primarily by a 14% decline in year-over-year community count.\r\nIn addition to fewer open communities, orders for the period were impacted by ongoing actions to manage sales paces to better align with current production volumes.\r\nThe actions to manage sales pace and outright restrict sales were more frequently targeted toward our first-time buyer communities as we strategically work to build up spec inventory within our Centex branded communities.\r\nLooking at our third quarter orders in a little more detail.\r\nOur orders from first-time buyers decreased 20% compared with last year.\r\nThis decrease was driven primarily by our actions to restrict sales as our first-time community count was only down 6% compared with last year.\r\nIn contrast, our orders from move-up and active adult buyers decreased 22% and 4%, respectively, which was driven by comparable 22% and 5% decreases in community count, respectively.\r\nIn the third quarter, we operated from an average of 768 communities.\r\nConsistent with the guide in our recent market update, this is down 14% from last year's average of 892 communities.\r\nOur Q3 community count should be the low watermark for the year as we expect our fourth quarter community count to increase to approximately 775 active communities.\r\nFurther, our existing land pipeline should allow us to realize a meaningful ramp-up in c Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

means adjusted EBITDA.\r\nUnless specifically described otherwise, margin refers to value-add adjusted EBITDA margin.\r\nIn the near term, we're looking forward to participating in the virtual Barclays Global Automotive Conference on November 17th and speaking with many of you there.\r\nOur agenda for today we'll start with CEO, Brian Kesseler, giving an overview of the third quarter and our COO, Kevin Baird will provide more details on our performance at the segment level.\r\nOur CFO, Matti Masanovich will discuss our balance sheet progress and provide an updated outlook for 2021.\r\nBrian will then wrap up our prepared comments before we move into the question-and-answer session.\r\nPlease turn to Page 4 for a review of the key themes from our third quarter.\r\nAs we're all aware, the operating conditions in the end-to-end supply chain environment are unprecedented from semiconductor shortages affecting our OE customer bill rates, the freight and labor availability to escalating raw material and component costs, we are managing through a unique operating landscape and are planning for more of the same through the end of 2021 and into 2022.\r\nMore specifically, in the very near term, we are planning for Q4 global light vehicle production to be about the same as Q3.\r\nWith that as a backdrop, it's important to note that our global scale and market mix and structural cost improvement actions helped us mitigate the impact of the challenging operating environment.\r\nOn a year-over-year basis, our volume and mix was down only 5% compared to a 20% decline in global light vehicle unit production.\r\nOn a constant currency basis, our light vehicle value-add revenues outperformed global light vehicle production and our position in various commercial truck, off-highway and industrial end markets and the aftermarket, help support our revenue performance.\r\nMaterial cost recovery actions with our customer base are on track and contributed to revenues in the quarter, but with no margin.\r\nImportantly, our Accelerate+ structural cost actions more than neutralized the effects of unanticipated manufacturing inefficiencies related to the light vehicle semiconductor shortages during the quarter.\r\nPlanning ahead, we have initiated new structural cost actions that will add to the $35 million benefit from the Accelerate+ program that are expected to carry over in 2022.\r\nWe are well positioned to benefit from the eventual recovery of light vehicle production volumes.\r\nLastly, our core growth drivers, continue to build momentum.\r\nMotor Parts and the commercial truck off-highway and industrial space delivered revenue growth year-over-year.\r\nOur Performance Solutions segment is launching 34 BEV and hybrid programs expected to yield annualized revenues of $200 million.\r\nKevin will add more color on the launches later in the call, but in addition, our advanced suspension technologies or AST business within Performance Solutions were supply advanced, passive and semi active suspension for light vehicle and specialty markets, received very positive reviews in the automotive press for our innovative suspension technologies equips on new BEVs from Rivian and Geely.\r\nTurning to Page 5.\r\nLet's take a look at an overview of our third quarter results.\r\nRevenue was $4.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by our diversified end market mix and includes $1 billion of pass-through substrate sales.\r\nAs a reminder, substrate sales are only in our Clean Air segment and are passed through to the customer at cost plus the small handling fee.\r\nExcluding substrates, our value add revenue was $3.3 billion, down 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\r\nAs I highlighted on the previous page, this compares favorably to the industry light vehicle production decline of 20% and includes material cost recovery of $110 million.\r\nThe scale and diversification in our regions and markets served are evident in the charts on the right.\r\nIn the third quarter, just over 50% of our business was generated from aftermarket and commercial truck off-highway and industrial applications.\r\nAdding the light vehicle portion of our Performance Solutions business, which is agnostic to the vehicles powertrain, 65% of our value-add revenue is unrelated to OE light vehicle ICE technologies.\r\nWe expect this mix to expand to 80% plus by the end of the decade.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA was $279 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.5%.\r\nDespite the volatile production environment, we maintained strong liquidity and our third quarter net leverage ratio improved 1.1 times since the end of 2020.\r\nOn Page 6, we show our enterprise performance.\r\nOn the left side of the slide, light vehicle production declines due to the semiconductor and supply chain shortages negatively impacted our volume.\r\nWe estimate the value-add revenue impact of the semiconductor shutdowns during the quarter was approximately $400 million and our most important geographies experienced the largest adjustment.\r\nIn a normal operating environment, we would have expected to produce a low 20s incremental EBITDA margin on that revenue contribution.\r\nAlso, our third quarter value-add revenues included $110 million of material cost recovery via price in the quarter, although no margin dollars came with that contribution.\r\nOn the right side of the page, adjusted EBITDA was $279 million at a value-add margin rate of 8.5%, down 330 basis points with almost half of the year-over-year margin rate decline due to temporary cost actions put in place last year that were not expected to repeat this quarter.\r\nMaterial cost recovery lag also represented a significant margin headwind compared to Q3 2020.\r\nWe remain on our plan to recover the higher commodity costs, but there is a lag.\r\nIn each of our business segments, our recovery arrangements vary based on region and customer, which creates timing differences on a comparative basis.\r\nIn the box on the right, you can see our Accelerate+ restructuring savings more than offset manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain shortages, which resulted in positive other operating performance of 60 basis points versus the prior year.\r\nOverall, solid performance by the operating teams in the quarter, we value their resilience and fortitude in a difficult operating environment.\r\nLet's turn to our motor parts business performance on Page 8.\r\nAftermarket revenue was $769 million, up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis on continued strong demand and relative to the second quarter, it is in line with normal seasonality.\r\nWe saw revenue growth in all three regions, including Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific in spite of the lengthening supply chain lead times that are having an effect on our component and finished goods availability.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $115 million, delivering a 15% EBITDA margin.\r\nCompared to the prior year, margin was impacted by non-recurring temporary cost actions taken in the third quarter of 2020, as well as higher commodity price recoveries in the quarter that dilute margins.\r\nBefore I discuss the OE segments, you will hear some common themes across all three, including the impact of non-recurring temporary cost actions on margins in the state of our net material cost recovery.\r\nAs Brian mentioned earlier, our commodity recovery agreements differ by product, region and customer.\r\nSteel is our most important raw material input and it's used by all three OE segments.\r\nAlso Clean Air and Powertrain have differing commodity exposures, which I'll touch on shortly.\r\nIn addition, the late notice on OE customer production schedule changes, trapped inventory of approximately $250 million as of quarter end.\r\nLet's turn to our Performance Solutions segment on Page 9.\r\nThird quarter revenue was $686 million, down slightly year-over-year in constant curre Please summarize this transcript in exactly

[/INST] # Despite the unprecedented supply chain challenges, including semiconductor shortages and rising costs, the company reported a modest 2% revenue increase to $4.3 billion in the third quarter. The company's global scale and market mix helped mitigate the impact of these challenges, with volume and mix down only 5% compared to a 20% decline in global light vehicle production. Material cost recovery actions contributed to revenues but had no margin impact. The Accelerate+ structural cost program neutralized the effects of light vehicle semiconductor shortages. The company expects to continue structural cost actions and benefit from the eventual recovery of light vehicle production volumes. Core growth drivers, such as motor parts, commercial truck, off-highway, and industrial applications, delivered year-over-year revenue growth. Looking ahead, the company has revised its fiscal 2021 guidance, assuming flat Q4 global light vehicle production volumes due to semiconductor shortages. This has led to a revised value-add revenue guidance of $13.55 billion to $13.65 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion. The company remains focused on cost reduction and improving free cash flow conversion, including reducing its capital intensity and working capital returns.</s>"}

until midnight on June 2.\r\nAdditionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events.\r\nAll references will be on an organic or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated.\r\nThese statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including in our Form 10-Q to report results for the ended -- the period ending March 31, 2021.\r\nIn the appendix, we have also provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.\r\nThe quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies.\r\nOur momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets.\r\nOrders were up double digits in all three of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically.\r\nBoth Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year on year and with momentum up strong sequentially.\r\ndemand also continued to recover with orders up 18%.\r\nAlongside top-line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion.\r\nI credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020.\r\nOur financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion.\r\nLooking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\r\nTherefore, we are raising our full-year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS.\r\nI'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team.\r\nBut first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter.\r\nThe first quarter was clearly a meaningful step forward.\r\nThe team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets.\r\nRevenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year with performance better than our expectations across the board.\r\nStrong double-digit revenue growth in wastewater utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery.\r\nGeographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%.\r\nI'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments.\r\nBut in short, utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial, up 5%; and residential was up 31%.\r\nOrganic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all three business segments contributed double-digit order gains.\r\nImportantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement.\r\nLooking at the key financial metrics.\r\nMargins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%.\r\nThe 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation.\r\nEarnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%.\r\nWater infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%.\r\nGeographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year.\r\nThe U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance.\r\nEBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation.\r\nIn the applied water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe.\r\nRevenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies.\r\nResidential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%.\r\nGeographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets.\r\nBy contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential.\r\nEmerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior-year COVID shutdowns, as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa.\r\nSegment EBITDA margin and operating margins grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively.\r\nThe expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity.\r\nIn M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects.\r\nSegment backlog is up 29%.\r\nAs anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement but finished flat year on year.\r\nWater applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business.\r\nIn energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year.\r\nGeographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half.\r\nEmerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business.\r\nSegment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively.\r\nModest price realization and strong productivity savings, as well as a prior year warranty charge, more than offset inflation.\r\nOur balance sheet continues to be very strong.\r\nWe closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash.\r\nFree cash flow was in line with our expectations, as well as our historical seasonality patterns.\r\nManaging working capital remains an enterprisewide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance.\r\nNet debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6 times at the end of the quarter.\r\nI'd like to revisit the three focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability.\r\nTurning first to our growth platforms.\r\nYou've already heard about our emerging markets team's exceptional first-quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively.\r\nUp until now, China and India have taken the spotlight.\r\nIn both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth.\r\nBut of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us.\r\nMany countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in water infrastructure.\r\nAnd in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher-growth nations continue to urbanize.\r\nWe expect emerging markets, overall, will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future.\r\nThe second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy.\r\nOur broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated end points.\r\nThose capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic.\r\nWe've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio.\r\nIn Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks.\r\nAll of these  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

[/INST] # In its first quarter, Xylem witnessed exceptional growth, surpassing expectations with organic revenue growth of 8%. The quarter was marked by strong performance in both wastewater utilities and industrial demand, resulting in double-digit order gains across all business segments. Backlog also grew significantly by 23%. Geographically, Western Europe and emerging markets exhibited exceptional growth, with double-digit organic revenue increases, while the U.S. experienced modest growth. All end markets and geographies contributed to the overall revenue increase, with particularly strong growth in residential and industrial sectors. Margins expanded considerably due to volume effects and cost actions, leading to an EBITDA margin of 17.1%. The company anticipates continued revenue growth in the mid to high single digits for the full year and has raised its guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin to 17.2% to 17.7%, as well as adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.50 to $2.70.</s>"}

factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.\r\nAdditionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nA reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our investor relations website.\r\nOur results once again beat expectations this quarter, with comparable sales up 5% for the total company and 5.1% for the U.S. on top of over 28% growth last year.\r\non a two-year basis.\r\nThese results capped of outstanding financial results for fiscal 2021 with sales of $96.3 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable basis and earnings per share of $12.04, up 36% on an adjusted basis.\r\nWith these outstanding results, 100% of our stores earned a quarterly Winning Together profit-sharing bonus.\r\nThis $94 million payout is $24 million above the target payment level.\r\nAnd in recognition for their hard work throughout the pandemic in 2021, we are awarding an incremental discretionary bonus of $265 million to our frontline associates.\r\nAltogether, we rewarded our frontline associates with bonuses of over $350 million in the fourth quarter.\r\nAs Joe will discuss later in the call, financial support of our frontline associates is consistent with our commitment to being an employer of choice in the retail industry.\r\nOur Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum, as we grow our share of wallet with both Pro and DIY as they increasingly rely on Lowe's as a one-stop solution for all their project needs.\r\nIn looking at our results this quarter, I'm particularly encouraged that our growth was broad based and balanced across product categories, across both DIY and Pro, both online and in-store.\r\nIn Pro, we delivered growth of 23% and 54% on a two-year basis.\r\nAnd we are building on our momentum with the Pro with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program, MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program.\r\nWe redesigned our loyalty program based on feedback from our Pro customers who expressed a desire for a business partnership rather than a series of stand-alone transactions.\r\nOur data shows that Pros who leverage our loyalty and credit offering spend 300% more than Pros not engaged in these programs.\r\nOur Pro business is off to a strong start this year, and we're excited about the national launch of our MVPs Pro loyalty program.\r\nI look forward to providing updates on this critical initiative throughout the year.\r\nNow turning to our DIY customer, where we delivered growth on top of exceptionally strong demand last year.\r\nLater in the call, Bill will discuss how we continue to grow our DIY market share by elevating our private brands product assortments in our home decor category.\r\nOn Lowes.com, sales grew 11.5% on top of 121% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a two-year comp of 147% and nearly 11% sales penetration.\r\nOur intuitive online shopping experience and expanded on-trend assortments are resonating with our customers.\r\nAnd while we're pleased that our online sales have more than doubled over the past two years, we still have tremendous growth opportunity in front of us.\r\nAnd as part of our efforts to enhance our omnichannel experience, we are expanding our same-day and next-day fulfillment capabilities.\r\nWith that in mind, we're actively piloting several gig network solutions, including partnering with Instacart in several markets with same-day DIY home delivery.\r\nAnd building on the success we gained in the Florida and Ohio Valley regions with our market delivery strategy, we completed the conversion of our third geographic area, the Carolina region, during the fourth quarter.\r\nBy way of reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes.\r\nThis replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products.\r\nAs we continue to expand our market-based delivery model, we're freeing up space in our 10,000 square foot store back rooms, which on average are considerably larger than our competition.\r\nAnd we are testing out different options to drive both greater in-store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both Pro and DIY customers.\r\nIn a few minutes, Bill will discuss our continued investments in online as we create a best-in-class integrated omnichannel shopping experience.\r\nDuring the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 115 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $1.78, which is a 34% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year.\r\nThese results reflect our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI, as well as the ongoing benefits of our new pricing strategies.\r\nJoe and Dave will discuss these initiatives in further detail later in the call.\r\nThe Canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the U.S. Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market, as well as our opportunity to continue to win share.\r\nOur outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong, supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheet, especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation.\r\nPersistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment.\r\nIn fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.\r\nOther trends remain favorable, including baby boomers' increasing preference to-age-in-place.\r\nAnd with the extension of remote work for some employees, we're expecting a permanent step-up

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n As always, we appreciate your interest in Central Pacific Financial Corp.\r\nLet me start first with some positive updates on the Hawaii economic recovery.\r\nVisitor arrivals from the U.S. Mainland to Hawaii have returned much quicker than anticipated, a good sign for economic recovery.\r\nThe daily arrival count have averaged about 30,000 per day since June, which is nearly at pre-pandemic level.\r\nIn early July, the state of Hawaii began allowing arriving passengers to skip pre-testing and quarantining with proof of full vaccination against COVID in the U.S. Although we are not immune to the spike caused by the Delta variant, Hawaii's COVID infection rates continue to be at very low level, with our infection rates currently at the lowest in the nation.\r\nNearly 60% of our state population is fully vaccinated as of July 21, 2021.\r\nThe state of Hawaii's unemployment rate declined to 7.7% in the month of June and is forecasted by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization to decline to 4.8% in 2022.\r\nThe housing market in Hawaii remains hot with the median single-family home price at $979,000 in the month of June.\r\nOur financial results for the second quarter were very strong, with quarterly pre-tax income reaching a new record high.\r\nWith increased confidence in the Hawaii economic recovery and our continued solid asset quality, liquidity, and capital, we resumed share repurchases during the second quarter and continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we are very optimistic about our future business profit.\r\nDigital continues to be a key strategic priority for us.\r\nEnhancements to our online and mobile banking platforms are being made on a continual basis.\r\nAdditionally, in the second quarter, we issued new contactless debit cards to all of our customers and increased mobile deposit adoption among our customer base.\r\nFurther, online chat is now available and online appointment schedule is coming soon to make banking easier and more convenient for our customers.\r\nWe continue to work diligently on our product and service development in the digital area.\r\nFirst, I'd like to provide an update on the credit area.\r\nWe are pleased that our clients have weathered through the challenges of the pandemic.\r\nNearly all of the loans we granted, COVID-related payment deferrals have returned to pay status.\r\nAs of June 30, we have just $3.5 million in loans remaining on deferral, the majority of which are residential mortgages.\r\nAdditionally, our classified assets declined during the quarter to $42 million, and our nonperforming assets remain near historic lows at just nine basis points of assets.\r\nI'd also like to share about a recent developments in the environmental, social, and governance or ESG area.\r\nIn the second quarter, we were pleased to publish our first annual 2020 ESG report.\r\nWe continue to develop our ESG reporting and look forward to providing further updates in the future.\r\nCPB's legacy in helping the small business community is one of the pillars of our ESG program and remains a key priority for us.\r\nLast week, we were pleased to announce the new program run by our CPB foundation call We, that is W-E By Rising Tide.\r\nThis program supports women entrepreneurs as we believe they are key to building a strong and resilient economy.\r\nAs part of this program, we selected our first cohort of 20 women entrepreneurs from seven different business sectors that will participate in a 10-week series of workshop on financial management, marketing, and leadership and receive free advertising and networking benefits.\r\nSupport of our employees is another color of our ESG program.\r\nWe believe that investing in our employees is critical to our success.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we had our annual merit increases and we made a few key strategic new hires.\r\nWe also continue to prioritize the health and well-being of our employees and therefore, continue to allow flexible work schedule while developing our hybrid return-to-office plan.\r\nFinally, we are pleased that the second and final phase of our Central Pacific Plaza revitalization was completed last month.\r\nWe expect smaller office projects to continue as we create collaborative, refreshed, and sustainable workplaces for our employees.\r\nWe also continue to refresh our branches and evaluate our branch network to meet the changing needs of our customers.\r\nIn the second quarter, our core loan portfolio decreased by $103 million or 2.3% sequential quarter, which was offset by PPP paydown of $163 million.\r\nYear-over-year, our core loan portfolio increased by 3.7%.\r\nThe core loan growth was broad-based across all loan categories, except C&I, which as everyone knows, was because Customer segment most impacted by the pandemic and now in recovery.\r\nOur residential mortgage production continues to be very strong, with total production in the second quarter of nearly $280 million and total net portfolio growth in residential mortgage and home equity of $48 million from the previous quarter.\r\nWe ramped up 2021 new PPP originations during the second quarter with over 4,600 loans totaling more than $321 million.\r\nI am proud of our team for maintaining a leadership role in supporting our small business customers and the broader business community.\r\nPPP forgiveness is also progressing well with 70% of the loans originated in 2020 already forgiven and paid down through June 30.\r\nAssisting our customers with the forgiveness process has been a key priority for the bank as the local economy begins to recover and our business customers begin to pivot from surviving to thriving in.\r\nDuring the second quarter, with confidence that the national economic recovery was gaining strength and the local economy was on its way to recovery, we resumed our consumer lending programs on the Mainland and in Hawaii.\r\nDuring the quarter, we purchased an auto loan portfolio from one of our established partners and also restarted other consumer programs on an ongoing full basis for consumer direct and indirect loans on the Mainland and in Hawaii.\r\nWhile it was a prudent process to span our consumer programs last year despite what we experienced in the economic downturn, both our Mainland and Hawaii consumer portfolios performed well, augmented by the support from federal stimulus programs.\r\nWith Hawaii's economic recovery expected to take traction, combined with our healthy loan pipeline, we anticipate strong loan growth for the second half of the year.\r\nOn the deposit front, we saw a strong inflow of deposits with total core deposits increasing by $279 million or about 5% sequential quarter growth.\r\nOn a year-over-year basis, total core deposits increased by $705 million or 13.8%.\r\nAdditionally, our average cost of total deposits outweigh the second quarter by just six basis points.\r\nFinally, I want to mention that the Hawaii economy is recovering and consumer confidence is increasing.\r\nWe are seeing positive trends in transactional fee income recovery, including investment services fees.\r\nNet income for the second quarter was $18.7 million or $0.66 per diluted share.\r\nReturn on average assets

healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests; the pandemic's impact on the US healthcare system and the US economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control.\r\nAny references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing.\r\nGrowth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.\r\nFinally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business.\r\nNow, here is Steve Rusckowski.\r\nWell, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer.\r\nWhile our base business continued to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year and 2019.\r\nIn late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound in September.\r\nImportantly, our base business continued to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery.\r\nWe have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher than anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures.\r\nThe momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day.\r\nBut before turning to our results into the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our progress we've made in our Quest for Health Equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods.\r\nSince we've established just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing of vaccination events, to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico.\r\nRecently, we announced a collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for Black and Hispanic scholars and drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief.\r\nWe're off to a good start and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year.\r\nNow turning to our results for the third quarter.\r\nTotal revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year.\r\nThe revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business.\r\nCash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September to approximately $1.75 billion.\r\nNow, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer.\r\nTesting began to increase meaningfully in mid-July and peaked in early mid-September.\r\nOur observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks.\r\nWe performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests today in the third quarter and maintain strong average turnaround times of approximately one day for most specimens throughout the surge.\r\nAs clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our non-clinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel and entertainment.\r\nWe're making testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country.\r\nWe are currently performing K through 12 school testing in approximately 20 states with five additional states ready to come online.\r\nWe're testing passengers on Carnival Cruise Lines and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month.\r\nIn the base business, we continue to make progress on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.\r\nNow, here are some highlights from the third quarter.\r\nOur M&A pipeline remained strong.\r\nIn the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida.\r\nWe continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially insured lives in the United States.\r\nAt our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life.\r\nSo here is a couple of examples.\r\nWe are working with National Health Plans to help their self-insured employers, employer customers improve quality outcomes and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees.\r\nAlso, effective October 1, we gained access to 1 billion Managed Medicaid members in Florida as their coverage transitions to Centene's Sunshine Health Plan.\r\nWe're getting good feedback from the provider community in our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity.\r\nOur hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts.\r\nAs we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from two of our largest PLS contracts to-date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann.\r\nAltogether, our PLS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year.\r\nTrends in our hospital reference business also remained steady with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels.\r\nWe also generated record consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter.\r\nWhile COVID testing has been the strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing revenue to more than double this year.\r\nRecently, we soft-launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers.\r\nThis expanded health plan panel offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile with a battery of test and biometric measurements to provide a personalized Health Quotient Score that can be used to track health progress over time.\r\nAnd then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users.\r\nIn advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers.\r\nWe're seeing strong growth in non-invasive prenatal testing significantly above 2019 levels and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics.\r\nWe continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emerging variants, expanding the -- of the work that we performed in the quarter.\r\nAnd then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic from Agilent for a the Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Quest Diagnostics reported a solid Q3 with total revenue of $2.77 billion, a slight decrease from the previous year. The decline was attributed to lower COVID-19 testing revenue, offset by continued recovery in the base business. Despite the COVID-19 decline, base revenue grew 6% compared to Q3 2019, and volume increased 5.3% year-over-year. Notably, the base business rebounded in September following a slowdown in August. COVID-19 testing volumes increased in Q3 due to the Delta variant, averaging 83,000 molecular tests daily. Quest anticipates a decline in COVID-19 volumes but expects base business to continue growing. As a result, the company raised its full-year outlook, expecting revenue between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $13.50 and $13.90.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Although we believe these estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved.\r\nWell, first and foremost, we hope that you and yours, continue to be safe, happy, healthy and engaged; and I think, looking at our business despite reopening delays related to the delta variant, the office market continues to improve, tour activity, lease negotiations and deal executions, remain on a positive trend line.\r\nOur portfolio occupancy has increased to approximately 35%, the predominance of tenants returning has though expanded beyond just small employers, as occupancy for tenants 50,000 square feet and below is now over 50%.\r\nDuring our prepared comments we'll review our third quarter results, discuss progress in our business plan and update you on our recent capital and development activity.\r\nTom will then also provide a financial overview and after that Dan, George, Tom and I are available to answer any questions you may have.\r\nFrom a portfolio management standpoint, we remain focused on reducing forward rollover and providing a solid platform for growth.\r\nThese efforts have been successful.\r\nWe have reduced our forward rollover exposure through 2024 to an average of 6.8%, a slight improvement over last quarter.\r\nOur forecasted rollover exposure is now below 10% annually, through 2026.\r\nRevenue and earnings growth remain a top priority.\r\nKey near-term earnings drivers for us are, as you all know, we have several key vacancies, that upon lease-up will generate between $0.07 and $0.10 per share of growth and we're delighted to report that we have now leased about 46% of that targeted square footage and achieved about 45% of that forward revenue growth, at an average mark to market of 12% cash and 19% GAAP and that income will be substantially in place by the third quarter of 2022, which can create a good growth opportunity for us.\r\nSome notable components of that during the quarter, the last 38,000 square feet vacated by [Indecipherable] in Austin has been leased and we've also signed a replacement lease for the 42,000 square foot tenant in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\r\nAnd lastly we did sign three new leases at Commerce Square, totaling just shy of 29,000 square feet.\r\nWe do see clear trend lines of tenants requiring higher quality space, which we do think positions our portfolio extremely well.\r\nFrom a financial standpoint, for the third quarter, we posted FFO of $0.35 per share, which is 1% per share above consensus estimates, which Tom will walk you through.\r\nWe've also made excellent progress in all the other components of our 2021 business plan.\r\nWe do anticipate about a 100,000 square feet of positive absorption during the fourth quarter, and we will achieve our year-end occupancy and lease percentage guidance ranges.\r\nAnd to reinforce our leasing progress to date, we are increasing our speculative revenue target by $500,000 from our mid-point range of $25.5 million to $21 million and we are over 99% complete on that revised target.\r\nIt's important to note that that $21 million target that we're now circling is about 15% above the bottom end of our original range and it does reflect ever improving office market conditions.\r\nLooking at some other operating statistics.\r\nWe've also posted great results there for the quarter as well, tenant retention was above our 2021 business plan range.\r\nOf the 59 new deals that we signed this year, the weighted average lease term is 7.8 years, 68% of those lease terms are longer than four years and our medium lease term has remained fairly consistent with what we are able to achieve in 2018, '19, and in 2020.\r\nThird quarter capital cost came in below 8% of generated revenue, so well within our business plan range.\r\nCash mark to market was a positive 12% and our GAAP mark to market was a positive 16%.\r\nOur year-to-date mark to market results are above our full year ranges.\r\nHowever, as we noted on last quarter's call, based on leases already executed and commencing this in the fourth quarter, with lower mark to market results, we will finish the year within our business plan ranges.\r\nWe also expect that every region will post positive mark to market results on both a cash and GAAP basis this year.\r\nOur third quarter GAAP same store NOI was 2% and year-to-date results were within our '21 range.\r\nOur third quarter cash same store NOI was 5.5% and above our 2021 range of 3% to 5%.\r\nBut again, similar to our mark to market dynamic, tenants scheduled to take occupancy later this year will accelerate same-store growth, will enable us to achieve our 2021 business plan ranges.\r\nWe are still forecasting a 21 year end debt to EBITDA in the range of 6.3 times to 6.5 times.\r\nAnd looking at leasing velocity we know that everyone is keenly focused on recovery data points and we have several encouraging signs to report.\r\nThe Philadelphia suburban market produced more than 350,000 square feet of leasing activity in the second quarter, it was at 42.7% increase quarter-over-quarter.\r\nThe CBD market also posted 181,000 square feet of leasing activity, and Philadelphia generally is making a strong recovery from the pandemic in comparison to a number of other major American cities.\r\nOur vacancy rate is lower than the national average and based upon a major brokerage report Philadelphia is in the top 10 of all American cities for pandemic recovery, as measured by recovery rates and employment, vaccination and leasing activity.\r\nDuring the quarter, we had a total of over 1,500 virtual tours and inspected over 758,000 square feet in line with second quarter results.\r\nPhysical tours were down slightly over the second -- from the second quarter and we attribute this really more to the summer months as third quarter physical tours outpaced first quarter tours by over 13%.\r\nOur overall pipeline stands at 1.6 million square feet, which increased by about 600,000 square feet during the quarter.\r\nAnother good sign of more tenants entering the marketplace.\r\nAnd while these recovery data points are encouraging.\r\nThey also do compare favorably to the pre-pandemic leasing trends.\r\nSo our pipeline today is 7% better than our third quarter '19 results.\r\nDeal conversion rate was on par with previous quarter results as well.\r\nNow as you might expect and we've reported last quarter, median deal cycle time continues to trail pre-pandemic levels by approximately 30 days.\r\nBut on a very positive note, during the quarter, we executed 464,000 square feet of leases, including 347,000 square feet of new leasing activity.\r\nWe also continue to see two favorable trends that we think positively impact our portfolio.\r\nFirst, quality product does matter, since the beginning of the pandemic approximately 100,000 square feet of deals have moved up in the Brandywine buildings versus lower quality competitors.\r\nSecondly, we have seen approximately 20 tenants expand their premises by approximately 122,000 square feet since the beginning of the pandemic.\r\nIn looking at our liquidity and dividend coverages, as Tom will report, we have excellent liquidity and anticipate having approximately $515 million available on our line of credit by the end of the year.\r\nWe have no unsecured bond maturities until 2023, have a weighted average effective rate of 3.73% as a fully unencumbered wholly owned asset base.\r\nOur dividend remains extremely well covered with a 54% FFO and 81% CAD payout ratio and as we noted, our five year dividend growth rate has been 5.3% while our five year CAD growth rate has been just shy of 8%, well in excess of our core peer averages.\r\nFrom a capital allocation standpoint, it was frankly another quiet quarter, but we continue to make progress on many other fronts.\r\nAs part of our land recycling program we did sell three non-core land parcels, generating just shy of $11 million of proceeds and at a $900,000 gain.\r\nAlso, as we noted in our supplemental package, during the quart Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The portfolio occupancy rate increased to approximately 35%, with tenant return expanding beyond small employers. The company has reduced its forward rollover exposure to an average of 6.8% through 2024. Revenue and earnings growth remain a priority, with several key vacancies targeted for lease-up that could generate significant growth. The company has leased approximately 46% of its targeted vacancy, resulting in a cash mark-to-market of 12% and a GAAP mark-to-market of 19%. Same-store NOI was positive for both the quarter and year-to-date, with tenants scheduled to take occupancy later this year expected to accelerate growth. The company expects to achieve its year-end debt-to-EBITDA target of 6.3 to 6.5 times. Leasing velocity metrics are encouraging, with a growing pipeline and a conversion rate on par with previous quarters. The company continues to see favorable trends, such as demand for higher-quality space and tenants expanding their premises. Brandywine maintains excellent liquidity, with approximately $515 million expected to be available on its line of credit by year-end. The dividend remains well-covered, with a 54% FFO payout ratio and an 81% CAD payout ratio. The company's development pipeline continues to progress, with several projects underway, including 250 King of Prussia Road, Schuylkill Yards, 405 Colorado in Austin, 3000 Market Street in Philadelphia, and Cira Labs. Brandywine anticipates further compression of decision timelines and continued positive mark-to-markets driven by improving market conditions and the necessity of higher rents.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n In particular, we expect that the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain at this time.\r\nDuring today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nAs for the content of today's call, Lewis will begin with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our first and second quarter 2021 outlook, and Kevin will finish with a discussion of the business.\r\nI hope everyone is doing well.\r\nOur Q4 revenue was above our guidance, but we are still down on a year-over-year basis and that reflects the ongoing impact of the pandemic.\r\nSo let's go through the numbers.\r\nFourth quarter revenue was $271 million, compared to $247 million in Q3 and $299 million in Q4 of last year.\r\nOur revenue guidance coming into the fourth quarter was a range of $225 million to $255 million.\r\nSo compared to guidance, revenues were better than what we projected as we had a true-up of about $25 million in the quarter related to Q3 shipments, which was about $15 million higher than the true-up that we had last quarter, and with most of that improvement coming from TVs and set-top boxes, and PCs.\r\nTotal company revenue in Q4 increased sequentially by $24 million compared to Q3, as we benefited from higher unit volumes in TVs, set-top boxes, DMAs and PCs, along with the higher true-up that I just discussed.\r\nAnd all of this was partially offset by lower revenue from mobile due to timing under contracts, and I will discuss that in a second.\r\nNow looking at Q4 on a year-over-year basis, total company revenue is down by $28 million from last year's Q4 and we can attribute that mainly to COVID-19, especially in products and services, which were down by about $20 million or nearly 60% below last year.\r\nThe composition of Q4 revenue was $257 million in licensing and $14 million in products and services.\r\nSo let's break down licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast.\r\nBroadcast represented about 47% of total licensing in the fourth quarter.\r\nBroadcast revenues increased by about 2% year-over-year, helped by the higher true-up related to the Q3 shipments and also driven by higher adoption in TVs and set-top boxes.\r\nAnd then this was then offset partially by lower recoveries in the quarter.\r\nOn a sequential basis, broadcast was up by about 35% due to higher volume in TVs and set-top boxes along with higher recoveries and the higher true-up.\r\nMobile represented approximately 15% of total licensing in Q4.\r\nMobile was down by about 13% over last year due to lower recoveries, but partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies.\r\nFor the sequential comparison, I should point out that last quarter Q3, Mobile was about 33% licensing, which was higher than normal, and that was due to timing of revenue under customer contracts, so we came into Q4 expecting Mobile revenue to decline this quarter and return to a more normalized percentage of revenue, which is what it did.\r\nSo accordingly Mobile revenue was down sequentially by about 50%, and that was primarily due to timing of revenue under customer contracts.\r\nConsumer electronics represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter.\r\nOn a year-over-year basis, CE licensing was down by about 8%, mainly due to lower recoveries.\r\nOn a sequential basis, CE was about 68% higher than Q3.\r\nAnd as a reminder, Q3 was lower than usual and only 9% of licensing because of timing under contract.\r\nAnd so, the sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 was mostly a return to a more normal level.\r\nPC represented about 12% of total licensing in Q4.\r\nPC was higher than last year by about 26%, helped by the higher true-up and also because of the increased adoption of Dolby Technologies.\r\nAnd sequentially, PC was up by about 32% that's for similar reasons.\r\nOther markets represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter and they were down by about 19% year-over-year due to significantly lower Dolby Cinema box office share and that's because of the COVID restrictions and lack of big titles, and also because of lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles and/or recoveries in automotive.\r\nOn a sequential basis, other markets was up by about 32%, driven by higher revenue from gaming and from via admin fees and that's the patent pool that we administered.\r\nBeyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $14.3 million in Q4, compared to $11.8 million in Q3 and $34 million in last year's Q4.\r\nOur guidance had anticipated the large year-over-year decrease because most of this revenue comes from equipment that we sell to cinema exhibitors and these customers continue to be negatively affected by the pandemic.\r\nAnd speaking of products and services revenue, going forward into Q1, we're winding down and exiting conferencing hardware sales, as we will now be fully focused on expanding the availability of the Dolby Voice experience through software solutions, such as interactivity APIs on our developer platform.\r\nSo later on, when I cover the outlook for FY '21, my comments on products and services revenue and gross margin will reflect the fact that we are exiting the conferencing hardware arena.\r\nNow I'd like to discuss Q4 margins and operating expenses.\r\nTotal gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis.\r\nProducts and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter and a large portion of that consisted of charges for excess and obsolete inventory associated with conferencing hardware and that relates back to what I just said a minute ago, about our plans in that space.\r\nGoing forward into Q1, we anticipate that products and services margin will still be negative, but more along the lines of around minus $3 million or minus $4 million.\r\nI'll cover this again in the outlook section in a few minutes.\r\nProducts and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $14.1 million in the fourth quarter, and my comments here are similar to what I just said for GAAP gross margins.\r\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were slightly above the high-end of the range that we had guided, coming in at a $198.7 million, compared to $182.9 million in Q3.\r\nAnd remember that Q3 was particularly low for us, because that was the first full quarter of reacting to COVID-19 and lots of our activities have been temporarily halted or pushed out.\r\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $176.5 million, which is within our range and that was compared to $159.2 million in the third quarter, and basically the same comments that I made in GAAP apply here as well.\r\nOperating income in the fourth quarter was $30.1 million on a GAAP basis or 11.1% of revenue, compared to $51.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q4 of last year.\r\nOperating income in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $54.3 million or 20% of revenue, compared to $77.6 million or 26% of revenue in Q4 of last year.\r\nIncome tax in Q4 was 21.8% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\r\nThe effective tax rate was slightly higher than guidance, and that was due mainly to the mix of our income between different tax jurisdictions.\r\nNet income on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $26.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $43.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share in last year's Q4.\r\nNet income on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $45.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $67.6 million or $0.66 per diluted share in Q4 of last year.\r\nFor both GAAP and non-GAAP, net income in Q4 was above the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the quarter, and that was primarily due to revenue being above the high-end of our range, offset partially by the lower product and services gross margin that I mentioned a minute ago.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we generated about $113 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $130 million generated in last year's fourth quarter.\r\nWe ended the fourth quarter  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

in many of our neighborhoods.\r\nThat same day, Avista experienced a major increase in customer usage, which resulted in the highest energy usage in our company's 132-year history.\r\nThe intense temperatures, combined with record high usage, strained parts of our electrical system and caused some of the equipment that runs our electric grid to overheat.\r\nSix of our 140 distribution substations were impacted.\r\nTo prevent the equipment from overloading and to avoid extensive and costly damage to our electric system, we implemented protective outages for customers served by the equipment that was most impacted by the heat.\r\nOver the course of the event, we were able to reduce the impact to customers through system modifications.\r\nWe appreciate our customers' patience for those who experienced outages.\r\nHigher customer loads, related to the extended heat wave, were the primary driver for an increase in net power supply cost to serve our customers, which negatively affected the Energy Recovery Mechanism, or ERM.\r\nOverall, we've experienced hotter and drier-than-normal weather across the Pacific Northwest, which contributed to lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation and increased power prices.\r\nFor these reasons, we had to rely on thermal generation and purchased power at higher prices to serve those additional loads.\r\nAs a result, Avis Utilities' earnings were below expectations for the second quarter.\r\nAEL&P's earnings met expectations in the second quarter, and they are on track to meet the full year guidance.\r\nIt was a strong quarter for our other businesses, which exceeded expectations due to gains on our investments and the sale of certain subsidiary assets associated with Spokane steam plant.\r\nWildfire resiliency continues to be a focus for Avista.\r\nOur region has experienced extremely dry conditions all spring and summer.\r\nAnd combined with high temperatures, wildfire risk is high.\r\nIn response to these conditions, Avista has been operating in, what we call, dry land mode since late June, and dry land mode decreases the potential for wildfires that could occur when reenergizing a power line.\r\nNormally, under normal conditions, these lines, located in rural and/or forested areas, are generally reenergized automatically.\r\nHowever, during the current dry weather conditions, Avista's line personnel physically patrol in outage area before a line is placed back into service.\r\nThis can require more time to restore service, but it decreases a potential fire danger.\r\nThis practice is in line with Avista's wildfire resiliency plan, which was released last year, building on prevention and response strategies that have been in place for many years.\r\nAvista has committed to a comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that includes improved defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system.\r\nIn regards to regulatory matters, we are pleased to have reached an all-party settlement in our Idaho general rate case.\r\nThe new rates are fair and reasonable for our customers, the company and our shareholders and will allow Avista to continue receiving a fair return in Idaho.\r\nOur Washington general rate cases continue to work their way through the regulatory process.\r\nOur hearings have been held, and we expect a decision by the end of September.\r\nIn Oregon, we expect to file a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021.\r\nWe are confirming our 2021 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share.\r\nWhile we are confirming our consolidated range, we are adjusting our 2021 segment ranges to lower Avista Utilities by $0.10 per diluted share and raise other by $0.10 per diluted share.\r\nFor 2022, we are lowering consolidated earnings guidance by $0.15 per diluted share to a range of $2.03 to $2.23 per diluted share.\r\nFor 2023, we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $2.42 and to $2.62 per diluted share.\r\nAlthough we expect to experience headwinds in 2022 from regulatory lag, we are confident that we can meet our earnings guidance for 2023 and earn our allowed return.\r\nLooking ahead, we'll continue focusing on our utility operations, while prudently investing in the necessary capital to maintain and update our infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers and our communities.\r\nI know everybody is sitting on the edges or seat waiting for the Blackhawk's next acquisition, which is a Spokane native.\r\nWe got Tyler Johnson, a 2-time Stanley Cup Champion, who is a Spokane native.\r\nSo we're pretty excited about that.\r\nThere's your Hawks update.\r\nAs Dennis mentioned, we're confirming our 2021 earnings guidance, lowering our utility guidance for '21 and also '22 and confirming '23 consolidated guidance.\r\nOur guidance -- I'll spend a little time on that.\r\nOur guidance assume, among other things, a timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions.\r\nThat's very important as we need -- Dennis mentioned, we settled our Idaho case.\r\nWe're still awaiting approval from the commissions, which we expect before those rates go into effect September 1.\r\nFor 2021, we expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.83 to $1.97 per diluted share, and the lower end of our guidance in '21 and '22 for the Avista Utilities is primarily due to increased regulatory lag.\r\nThat's due to increase capital expenditures primarily due to growth and higher-than-expected depreciation expense.\r\nBut that is, we believe, all timing, and we begin -- as we begin to plan for our next Washington general rate case to be filed early in the first quarter of '22, we expect that to be a multiyear rate plan as required under the new law.\r\nWe will seek to include all capital investment through the end of the rate plan period in rates in an effort to earn our allowed return by 2023.\r\nIn addition, we have experienced an increase, as Dennis mentioned, in actual and forecasted net power supply cost.\r\nAlthough the midpoint of our guidance range does not include any benefit or expense under the ERM in Washington, the increase in power supply cost has reduced the opportunity for us to be in the upper half of the guidance range.\r\nAnd our current expectation for the ERM is a surcharge position within the 90-10 sharing -- company sharing band, which is expected to decrease earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.\r\nAnd recall, last quarter, our estimate for the ERM for the year was in a benefit position, which was expected to add $0.06 per diluted share.\r\nIn addition, we are also absorbing more net power supply cost under the PCA in Idaho.\r\nFor 2021, as Dennis mentioned, we expect AEL&P to contribute $0.08 to $0.11.\r\nAnd we increased the rang Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Relations section.\r\nThe company has explained some of these risks and uncertainties in its SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\r\nToday I'm joined by Ed Pesicka, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Long, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nI would like to start with a high-level recap of the strategic priorities that the Owens & Minor leadership team and I outlined during our Investor Day meeting in late May.\r\nI spoke about our transformation based on our business blueprint that focused on; one, our culture, a culture that is based on hard work, stellar execution and an unrelenting focus on our customer, while being anchored by our mission and our ideal values.\r\nNext our discipline, which is based upon the Owens & Minor business system that is laser focused on continuous improvement.\r\nAnd third, our investments, our investments that are implemented in a disciplined manner enabling us to achieve our strategic priorities.\r\nThese three elements are ingrained in our corporate DNA, have set the foundation of our business blueprint, and have enabled us to ignite long-term profitable growth.\r\nAs committed during the Investor Day meeting, I will provide periodic updates.\r\nToday let me start with an update on some of our investments, which we spent time at our Investor Day detailing.\r\nThese investments remain on track and are designed to provide attractive returns for our stakeholders.\r\nLet me remind you of a few; one, we continue to expand our own manufacturing capability for nitrile gloves in our existing facility in Thailand.\r\nThis will put us in an advantaged position allowing us to have greater control and improved cost structure.\r\nOur new capacity is expected to go live in early 2022.\r\nTwo, we remain focused on leveraging our manufacturing strength and brand value through the expansion of our product portfolio.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we doubled our wound care product line and we remain on track to expand our incontinence care portfolio later this year.\r\nFurthermore, we continue to identify additional product category opportunities to expand our proprietary product offering in the future.\r\nThree, we are also diversifying into new verticals to sell specialty higher-margin products into new end markets.\r\nFor instance, we expanded into cleanroom glove market space under the HALYARD PUREZERO brand.\r\nIn addition, we recently launched our Safeskin consumer brand of gloves.\r\nNext, we continue to invest in technology-based offerings that provide our customers with actionable data through our service solutions.\r\nAnd finally, we are focused on the balance between technology and touch in our distribution centers, with continued investment in automation, AI and human capital, all of which expand our leading ability to be flexible and scalable to provide best service for our changing customer demands.\r\nThese initiatives are just a few examples of how we are investing to generate long-term profitable growth, while providing significant benefits for our customers.\r\nIn addition to having the Owens & Minor business blueprint in place and the investments that I just discussed, I'm equally proud of our focus on corporate social responsibility.\r\nWe are committed to delivering on both our financial and our corporate social responsibility obligations.\r\nSo far this year, we have launched the Owens & Minor Foundation, which is committed to improving our communities in which we operate and live.\r\nTwo, we released our first sustainability report, detailing the advancement that Owens & Minor has made in ESG.\r\nAnd three, we undertook a first step in reducing our carbon footprint, with our electric fleet pilot initiative.\r\nOur ESG efforts, just like our business blueprint, are part of who we are and that good corporate citizenship is fundamental to our mission and values.\r\nLet me now shift gears to our second quarter performance.\r\nI am extremely pleased to report another strong quarter that continues to build upon the solid performance from 2020.\r\nA year ago, we were in uncharted waters due to the pandemic, but our ability to be flexible and adjust to meet the critical needs of our customers and the nation help to establish momentum that is carried into the second quarter.\r\nAdditionally, we continue to find ways to keep driving efficiency and be more productive, as markets begin to return to pre-pandemic form.\r\nNow let me update you on the segments and I will start with our Global Solutions segment.\r\nWithin this segment, the medical distribution business performed well and posted much improved results.\r\nWe continue to bring in net positive wins, as a result of our market-leading service, combined with the trust we gained during the pandemic.\r\nIn addition, we saw volumes associated with elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels during the second quarter.\r\nRelated to our patient direct business, we continue to grow through new patient capture in this rapidly growing patient direct markets.\r\nAnd finally, our ongoing investments in our Global Solutions segment are expected to provide continued growth in an attractive long-term outlook.\r\nMoving on to the Global Products segment.\r\nThis segment produced significant top line growth, as sales of our surgical infection and prevention products, including PPE, remained strong.\r\nThe strong sales are a result of our increased output of previously added capacity to fulfill continued high usage, share gains made during the pandemic, stockpile fulfillment and increased elective procedures.\r\nIn addition, we saw favorable timing for cost pass-through on gloves adding to the top line growth.\r\nIn addition to the solid performance in our two reporting segments, our balance sheet remains strong, with net leverage at 1.8 times and total net debt of less than $1 billion.\r\nThis gives us the latitude to continue to make well thought-out investments to improve our operations and drive growth.\r\nMoving from the second quarter and looking to the rest of 2021 and beyond.\r\nWe are excited about the long-term future.\r\nWe expect the rest of the year to be driven by S&IP utilization, elective procedures, opportunity pipeline and continued strength of our patient direct business.\r\nIn addition to this, we will continue to have a tenacious focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements.\r\nAs we have said, we believe that the usage for S&IP products, including PPE, will be defined by the new normal; the new normal in the healthcare industry.\r\nWe continue to believe that usage for many PPE categories will settle somewhere below the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, but in excess of the pre-pandemic levels as a result of established healthcare protocols, stockpile requirements and our share gains obtained during the pandemic.\r\nIn addition, we expect the expansion of our PPE into new markets like clean room and consumer to provide incremental opportunity.\r\nHowever, as the year progresses, we expect moderation in both pricing and demand for PPE.\r\nBut let's not forget another factor to consider.\r\nThat is the elimination of PPE emergency use authorization which will create opportunity for our Americas-based, manufactured medical-grade PPE.\r\nLet me give you a few examples.\r\nFirst, most recently the FDA revoked emergency use authorization for non-NIOSH-approved disposable respirators, which will prohibit the use of these devices in the healthcare setting.\r\nSecond, the CDC has recommended that healthcare facilities return to conventional practices, and no longer use crisis capacity strategies like bringing in non-medical grade supplies.\r\nAnd third, the EUA for Decontamination and Bioburden Reduction System has been revoked.\r\nAll of these actions by the federal agencies bring to light the significance of authorized medi Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The company has reaffirmed its guidance for 2021 and 2022, with adjusted earnings per share expected to be between $3.75 and $4.25 for 2021. The company's strategic investments remain on track, with new manufacturing capacity for nitrile gloves expected to begin contributing to financial results in early 2022. Despite inflationary pressures and transportation costs, the company is seeing strong demand for its products and services.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to investors.\r\nThese measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.\r\nPlease consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.\r\nThe resiliency of Barnes Group was apparent once again this quarter as we grew sequential revenues for the second consecutive quarter and delivered adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our October outlook.\r\nGiven the historic challenges resulting from the global pandemic for most of 2020, I'm very proud of the many contributions of our 5,000 employees across the globe who stepped up to the challenge by going above and beyond to meet the needs of our customers and support our communities.\r\nAnd while I am happy with our performance, given the significance of the disruption, we at Barnes Group, remain mindful and respectful of the personal and social hardships caused by the pandemic across the world.\r\nFrom the onset, our response to the pandemic was structured around four phases.\r\nFirst and foremost, the health and safety of our employees.\r\nSecond, adjusting the business for the stark realities of lower demand.\r\nThird, anticipating and adapting to structural shifts in some of our end markets.\r\nAnd fourth, making key strategic investments to position Barnes Group for an economic recovery.\r\nWhile we moved our current -- while we have moved our current focus to Phase 4, we have not lost sight of the first three phases as they continue to be important.\r\nThrough 2020, one thing that has remained unchanged is our vision to be a leading global provider of highly engineered products, differentiated industrial technologies and innovative solutions serving our diversified end markets.\r\nFor the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 21%, primarily as a result of lower volumes given the pandemics' continuing impact on our end markets, especially at Aerospace.\r\nThe fourth quarter saw a 7% increase over the third quarter with both segments generating sequential sales improvement.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share were $0.36, down 58% from last year.\r\nThough, as mentioned, just above the high end of our October outlook.\r\nLooking at the full-year, organic sales were down 22%, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.64, down nearly 50% from a year ago.\r\nAs difficult as those numbers are, early cost actions and a focus on cash generation, allowed us to maintain double-digit margins, positive earnings and strong cash flow throughout the year.\r\nAs we turn the page on 2020, our mindset is shifting and our focus has returned to driving growth, both organically and through acquisitions.\r\nWith a keen focus on our strategic filters, we continue to explore enabling technologies and market-leading businesses that would complement our current portfolio with several potential targets in the pipeline being analyzed.\r\nWe remain enthusiastic in our pursuit of value adding transactions, that strategically advance our transformation.\r\nMore immediately, an emphasis on organic investments will target growth-orientated capital expenditures, research and development efforts and further build out of our newly established innovation hub capabilities.\r\nWhile these investments will influence margins in the short-term, they are instrumental to position the Company more favorably for the long run.\r\nIt's my expectation that we'll be talking frequently about our innovation and digital initiatives as we progress through 2021.\r\nMoving now to a discussion of end market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.\r\nAt Industrial, we see the continuation of favorable trends discussed on our last call.\r\nManufacturing PMIs in our major geographic markets remain strong and correspondingly, we've seen fourth quarter organic orders at Industrial grow 10% over a year ago.\r\nSequential Industrial orders were up 9% over the third quarter and segment book-to-bill was slightly better than 1 times.\r\nSo, as we think about our Industrial expectations for the upcoming year, we feel bullish about the prospects for this part of our business.\r\nMolding Solutions generated very strong orders in medical end markets, both year-over-year and sequentially, each with well over 50% growth.\r\nMedical sales lagged a bit in the quarter given a very challenging comparable and the timing of deliveries.\r\nWe see that is normal given the nature of this business and expect sales to bounce back by the second quarter.\r\nPackaging orders were very strong on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.\r\nSales were up over 20% from a year ago.\r\nMeanwhile, personal care orders took a dip in the quarter and sales were slightly down versus a year ago.\r\nHowever, sequential sales were strong increasing over 20%.\r\nOur Synventive business, which is predominantly automotive hot runners, saw a modest increase in orders, both year-over-year and sequentially.\r\nAlthough sales were relatively flat to a year ago, they were up 20% sequentially.\r\nAll-in, our expectations for 2021 is organic sales growth to be up in the low-double digits for Molding Solutions.\r\nSheet metal forming markets also continue to see a rebound, as Force & Motion Control orders were up high-single digits over last year and up high-teens over the third quarter.\r\nWhile sales were down modestly from a year ago, sequential sales were up in the high-single digits.\r\nWe forecast Force & Motion Control to generate organic sales growth in the low-double digits for 2021.\r\nAt Engineered Components, organic orders were up nearly 20% on a year-over-year basis, with organic sales up mid-single digits versus a year ago.\r\nTotal sales were up high-single digits sequentially, continuing a rebound that we've seen over the last couple of quarters.\r\nWith General Industrial Markets on the upswing and global automotive production forecasted to be up meaningfully in 2021, we anticipate Engineered Components to grow high-single digits organically.\r\nThat said, we are very mindful about the current impact semiconductor shortages are having on automotive production and we will monitor that situation carefully as it unfolds.\r\nLooking next at our Automation business.\r\nIt continues to demonstrate signs of a positive rebound as mid-single-digit orders growth over a year ago and third quarter were achieved.\r\nTotal sales growth was strong with both year-over-year and sequential growth of 20%.\r\nLike last quarter, demand for our end-of-arm tooling solutions in automotive, and medical and pharma applications remain solid.\r\nWe expect 2021 to deliver low-double-digit organic growth as these markets remain healthy and as we launch new innovative products.\r\nSpeaking of new products, as I mentioned earlier, our investments in innovation and R&D are aimed at providing a solid foundation for organic growth.\r\nAs an example, we recently launched our comprehensive vacuum solutions product line with complete gripping solutions, advanced control systems and high-quality components.\r\nThe vacuum product range consists of about 1,100 items, including high-performance suction cups, vacuum pumps, sensors and related accessories that allow our customers to handle different objects in various industrial sectors with low energy consumption and reduce downtime.\r\nOverall, for the Industrial segment, we see 2021 organic growth in the low-double-digit range with adjusted operating margins of 12% to 14%.\r\nMoving now to our Aerospace business.\r\nFor the fourth quarter, Barnes Aerospace sales were down nearly 40% at OEM and nearly 50% in the aftermarket from the prior year.\r\nNot surprising as commercial aviation remains significantly disrupted by the global pandemic, our outlook for Aerospace is certainly not as bullish as for our Industrial businesses.\r\nThat being said, we continue to believe the trough quarter of sales is behind us.\r\nWith OEM, production levels of narrow-b Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The company's Industrial segment saw strong growth in medical end markets, leading to full-year organic growth projections in the low-double digits.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Such statements are based upon current information and management's expectations as of this date and they are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nAs such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.\r\nYou can learn more about these risks in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings.\r\nRelieved that one of the most difficult years in the company's 100-year history is behind us and optimistic considering market share gains accomplished during the first fiscal quarter of 2021 and strengthening oil prices, which enhanced financial health of our customers.\r\nWe entered the new year, with 94 rigs running in U.S. land that's double the number we had in August, and the upward trend continues.\r\nAround this time last year VTI prices were trading in the low-50s there were approximately 800 rigs operating in the U.S. land market and H&P was operating in a 194 of those rigs.\r\nContrast that with today, where oil prices are up over 10%, up into the upper 50s and the industry rig count is approximately 415 rigs and H&P is running 103 FlexRigs.\r\nObviously, a lot of happened between these two data points, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the short and medium term activity outlook from E&P companies is taking a while to take shape.\r\nHowever, if market expectations for U.S. production levels continue to drop that should have a positive impact on oil prices, which further supports consensus of expectations for approximately 500 active rigs in the U.S. at year-end.\r\nTaking this a step further, by our count, there are approximately 630 super-spec rigs available in the U.S. market.\r\nLooking forward, we believe the vast majority of all working rigs drilling horizontal wells will continue to trend toward the super-spec classification and if activity does reach 500 rigs, the industry rig count would begin to approach utilization levels that have historically provided pricing power.\r\nToday, we are hopeful and encouraged by the recent worldwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.\r\nWe are encouraged with an improving crude oil price picture and we're encouraged by the progress we continue to make on strategic efforts to deploy additional digital technology solutions and to advance new commercial models.\r\nEven with the early success of vaccines for COVID-19, there remains a significant level of uncertainty regarding the global economic recovery as well as the changing political environment, and that certainly tempers our short-term optimism.\r\nWhile it's encouraging to see oil prices higher than expectations, we are cognizant that even in a stable or improving environment, there remain several challenges ahead for the industry.\r\nWe are encouraged seeing the industry rig count begin to recover, the customers are still in the budgeting process to determine their capital allocation and those levels will set the tone for activity during the remainder of 2021.\r\nWe do expect public E&Ps to maintain financial discipline, related to their announced budgets.\r\nWe also expect private E&Ps to add rigs, however, we don't expect an outsized increase in fiscal '21 rig count, even if oil prices reach $60 per barrel.\r\nA return-driven capital allocation strategy is in the best long-term interest of our industry, and that's what we're aiming to support with our solutions based offering.\r\nH&P has a differentiated customer-centric approach of combining our people, rigs and leading-edge automation technology, which enables us to deliver the highest value wells for our customers.\r\nAnd underlying principle of our performance contracts is the creation of a sustainable win-win scenario based not only on efficiency, but also by employing the advantages of automation related to wellbore quality and placement.\r\nOur patented drilling automation software is a key driver in improving well economics for the customer by enabling the drilling of consistently higher quality and better placed wellbores throughout the drilling program.\r\nTo-date our autonomous AutoSlide technology is deployed on 25% to 30% of our FlexRig fleet and we currently have similar percentages for performance-based contracts.\r\nAutomation solutions improve the drilling efficiency of the well, but it also has a significant influence on the lifetime value of the asset by delivering a better wellbore to the completion phase, which will ultimately enhance production economics.\r\nWhen successful, the combination of the FlexRig and digital technology solutions leads to superior well economics by lowering risk and increasing returns, for our customers, as well as for H&P.\r\nWe can't control the macro challenges, but we can remain laser focused on our technology solution deployment, our performance-based contracts and our value accretion for customers.\r\nWe're encouraged that several customers have adopted these new solutions, but we recognize that more work is ahead, an additional efforts aimed at change management must occur within the industry.\r\nAccordingly, improvements in technology solutions and performance-based contract adoptions are not likely to be linear and may not always correlate with our rig count.\r\nThat said, we're seeing remarkable progress as being made today and we're steadfast and confident in our ability to lead and effect change in our industry.\r\nI'm very pleased with our people's service attitude and the ability to quickly respond to customer demand and improve activity by roughly 35% during the first fiscal quarter.\r\nOur market share today is back to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nWe are adding back more rigs in the competition due to our proven ability to reactivate rig safely, efficiently and cost effectively.\r\nWe believe there is an opportunity to grow our market share above 25%.\r\nIf you look at previous downturns we have faced since the 2008 Financial Crisis, we have emerged stronger with greater capability as we differentiated our offerings and grew market share in the premium part of the market.\r\nGoing forward, in a structurally smaller U.S. market, we believe super-spec rigs combined with digital technology solutions that provide improved value through wellbore quality will prevail.\r\nRelative to the 800 rig drilling a year ago, many idle SCR and less-capable AC rigs may be permanently sidelined.\r\nFurther, not all of our competitors with super-spec rigs have the ability to enable firm coordination[Phonetic] features that many customers are beginning to require.\r\nIn the super-spec classification segment, we have approximately 37% of the U.S. capacity with 234 super-spec FlexRigs that are unique with their digital technology capability across our uniform fleet.\r\nAnother aspect of our asset deployment strategy, we plan to execute, will occur over the medium to long-term in international markets.\r\nThat strategy is to opportunistically reduce our U.S. super-spec concentration over time by deploying rigs internationally for appropriately scaled contracts.\r\nOur international business development team is seeing some bidding activity in Argentina, Colombia, the Middle East as well as other markets.\r\nAt this time, these prospects are in early stages, but we are encouraged by the customer interest in H&P FlexRigs due to a combination of our expertise and unconventional drilling.\r\nOur strong historical performance in these areas and

[/INST] # Helmerich & Payne reported a quarterly loss of $0.66 per share, with an adjusted loss per share of $0.82. The company attributes the loss to a rise in total direct operating costs and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The corresponding quarter the prior year saw a loss per share of $0.55. Despite the loss, Helmerich & Payne's revenues increased to $246 million due to the resumption of drilling activity in the North America Solutions segment. Notably, the company has 94 rigs contracted and running, with an estimated 630 super-spec rigs available in the U.S. market. With optimistic market expectations for U.S. production growth, the company anticipates the industry rig count to reach 500 active rigs by year-end. Helmerich & Payne remains focused on deploying technology solutions, implementing performance-based contracts, and reducing costs to enhance its long-term position.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow.\r\nTo ensure our disclosures are consistent, these slides provide the same details as they have historically, and as I've said, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\r\nWith these formalities out of the way, I'm joined today by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer.\r\nWell, I'm sure you've all noticed that it's the end of October and COVID is still with us.\r\nAnd I'm guessing that's just as troubling for you and as it is for me.\r\nI think most of us knew during the summer that the evidence suggested there would be a good chance that COVID would still be with us at this point.\r\nI don't think any of us really expected that it would be completely gone, but I guess it's -- that most of us secretly hoped it would, and at least had some expectations it would be better than it is today.\r\nOur company, as I'll talk about in a moment, we're in terrific shape.\r\nWe're not in perfect shape.\r\nThere's no company during COVID that's in perfect shape, but we are in terrific shape.\r\nAnd that has only been possible because of the extraordinary efforts by our people, efforts to support clients, to support each other from home, efforts that collectively have put us in a strong position not only to weather COVID, but in my view, to soar coming out of this.\r\nAnd today, as usual, I will let Ajay take you through the details of the quarter, but let me upfront share a couple of comments: one on the revision to guidance; and secondly, and at least as important, why I continue, notwithstanding that revision, to be so positive about this company's future.\r\nLet me start with the adjustment to guidance.\r\nIt is really essentially an adjustment to our expectations about the fourth quarter.\r\nThe third quarter, though different from expectations and some specifics, did not come out too different from what we expected in aggregate.\r\nBut at the end of the last quarter, we had hopes that the evolution of COVID will allow for a stronger fourth quarter than we do today.\r\nSo, let me go into that in a little more detail.\r\nAs you know, I think, our fourth quarter results are typically our weakest, considerably less strong than the prior three quarters.\r\nFor example, if you look at the last five years, our fourth quarter earnings per share is roughly two-thirds of our prior three quarters because of holidays and some end-of-year factors.\r\nThis year, we thought the evolution of COVID might allow for better.\r\nBack in July, we suspected that COVID would still be here in the fourth quarter.\r\nBut we, and I'm guessing most of you, did not believe it was going to be as present as it is today.\r\nAnd therefore, we hoped for a somewhat more rapid unfolding of the opening of courts, more rapid derejudification of the legal system, more of an opening of cross-border travel, all of which, of course, would allow a faster return to normal for some of the businesses that were hurt by COVID.\r\nWe also thought that if that didn't happen at the speed we hoped for, onto the other side, we would see a continuation of the extraordinary strength we had in our restructuring business in the second quarter.\r\nWhat has happened in reality is both of these, but unfortunately to a somewhat lesser extent than we had expected.\r\nFirst, in terms of just the businesses that were negatively affected by COVID, they are in large part starting to come back.\r\nWe have started to see some signs of improvement in FLC and in other parts of our business that have been affected by travel restrictions and court closures.\r\nBut that recovery is at a considerably slower pace than we had hoped.\r\nIt's just not the hockey stick we expected to see begin in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter.\r\nSecond, in terms of the restructurings and bankruptcies, last quarter, if you recall, we talked about the fact that there is uncertainty -- there was uncertainty around that.\r\nWe talked about how we could, at a scenario where the government actions caused a temporary pause on bankruptcies and restructurings, at least in some parts of our world.\r\nWe believe then and continue to believe now that the restructuring market is going to be here for a considerable amount of time.\r\nBut we also understood that there could be waves because of government policies.\r\nFor example, the aggressive monetary stimulus that we have seen can affect or at least seriously delay bankruptcies and restructuring activity.\r\nWhat has happened here recently is that market forces began to play out to be more in favor of loose money and against restructuring activity than we had expected, not extraordinarily worse, but around-the-edges worse.\r\nYou can see that in our third-quarter results, but you can also see it very vividly in external data.\r\nNotably, if you look at, for example, August and September Chapter 11 filings and defaults, they fell to just over half the level that they were between May and July.\r\nAnd I think the reason for that is essentially the loose money.\r\nThe loose money has allowed for an unprecedented issuance of speculative-grade bonds this year and at remarkably reasonable rates.\r\nIf you look at the rates right now, they are also not too different from where they were pre-COVID, and the spreads compared to March have halved.\r\nAnd that has made a difference in the third quarter, and it's obviously making a difference at this point in time.\r\nThe consequence of that is not that our restructuring business is doing poorly.\r\nTo the contrary, it is still experiencing considerably higher demand than it did pre-COVID, but it is just not as strong as we had hoped and expected back in July.\r\nAnd it is not as strong enough to offset the slower pace of recovery we are seeing in the other parts of our business.\r\nSo the combination of COVID being more significant and longer impact on parts of our business and the loose money have a slowing effect on the pace of bankruptcy filings and other restructuring activities, together, means that we just no longer feel confident in an anomalous fourth quarter, a fourth quarter that's higher or as high as the first three quarters of the year.\r\nAnd if you build in a more typical ratio of fourth quarters compared to prior quarters, you get to the $5.25 to $5.75 range for adjusted EPS, that Ajay will now talk about, as opposed to the $5.50 to $6 that we had before.\r\nSo we've moved our guidance there.\r\nThat's all I was going to say on guidance.\r\nLet me move on to what, I guess, is the next set of questions on many people's minds, which is, so what does that mean going forward?\r\nHow does that play out?\r\nAnd I'm guessing there are two versions of that question.\r\nOne is, how does that play out near term?\r\nAnd two, does that change the fundamental trajectory of the company longer term?\r\nLet me talk to both of those with a caveat that perhaps counter-intuitively, it is easier to predict the medium and long term than it is the short term.\r\nI'm sure that's also pretty counterintuitive, but that's my experience in this business.\r\nAnd the reason for that is, in the short term, we can be and are buffeted by factors such as those I just described, factors that are external to us, loose money, M&A trends, regulatory activity, etc.\r\nWhereas my view of our history is that over the long term in this business, over the long term whether we perform or not, is much more of a function to us, of what we do, which is ultimately in our control.\r\nIf we are well positioned around the core issues our clients are facing, if we have great people with great brands and if we are in the market in an effective way, my experience is, and I think the data show, we grow over any medium term.\r\nThe factors we can control over t Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # FTI Consulting reported solid third-quarter results despite COVID-19's ongoing impact. Revenue reached $622.2 million, driven by strong performance in Corporate Finance & Restructuring (CFR). CFR revenues increased 23.4% due to higher demand for restructuring services and acquisitions. However, FLC revenues declined 16.5% due to lower demand for investigations and disputes. Despite this, FLC saw an impressive rebound in EBITDA in Q3. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.54, slightly below the previous guidance range of $5.50 to $6. However, the company revised its FY2020 guidance to $5.25 to $5.75 due to expectations of a slower pace of bankruptcy filings and slower recovery in FLC in the fourth quarter. Despite these adjustments, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, citing its leading market position in restructuring, diversification of offerings, and continued investment in growth. FTI Consulting continues to attract top talent and generate strong free cash flow, enabling it to invest and return capital to shareholders.</s>"}

and a competitive solicitation incentive, which would apply to larger projects defined as five megawatts and above.\r\nIncentive levels for the administratively determined segment range from $90 per megawatt-hour for net-metered residential projects to $70 to $100 per megawatt-hour for the commercial and community solar segments and up to $120 per megawatt-hour for certain public entity projects.\r\nYou will recall that the prior program consisting of solar renewable energy credits or as we frequently refer to them as SRECs, average well above $200 per megawatt-hour over the past decade.\r\nAnd combined with net metering subsidies and federal tax credits provided later incentives topping $300 per megawatt-hour.\r\nSo this successor program is a positive step toward balancing the need for clean energy while recognizing the importance of affordability for our customers.\r\nPSEG's existing solar programs are essentially fully subscribed.\r\nWe'll continue to work with the state MBP on programs that can help meet the solar goals in the Energy Master Plan.\r\nPSEG continues to make tangible progress on our own decarbonization and ESG goals.\r\nIn the second quarter alone, we closed on our 25% equity stake in the 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project in New Jersey, that's the Ocean Wind one project, obviously.\r\nWe retired our last coal unit at Bridgeport Harbor in Connecticut, making our generating fleet coal-free, and moved up our net-zero vision by 20 years to 2030.\r\nBut not only do we accelerate the net-zero vision, we also expanded it to include Scope one direct greenhouse gas emissions, and Scope two indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations at both PSEG Power and PSE&G.\r\nExpanding the net-zero vision to include both the utility and power operations is a significant move forward in our decarbonization efforts and one that will both inspire and challenge us to do more and do it better.\r\nComing up, PSEG is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build Offshore Wind transmission infrastructure.\r\nThis solicitation is intended to procure transmission solutions to this important New Jersey 7,500-megawatt Offshore Wind target by 2035.\r\nThe potential projects can cover onshore upgrades, new onshore transmission connection facilities, new offshore transmission connection facilities, and a network to offshore transmission system.\r\nProposals may address any or all of these four components.\r\nThe decision-making criteria is expected to include, among other things: an evaluation of reliability and economic benefits; cost; constructability; environmental benefits; permitting risks; and other \"New Jersey benefits\".\r\nThis competitive transmission open window will be jointly conducted by PJM and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.\r\nPJM will lead the technical analysis of the proposed transmission solutions, and the BP will be the ultimate decision-maker.\r\nWe support the state's efforts to procure transmission in a manner that is most reliable, constructible, and cost-effective for our customers.\r\nAll of this is great progress on our decarbonization efforts and continues to demonstrate our alignment with the state's Clean Energy agenda and our industry leadership on environmental stewardship.\r\nNew Jersey's recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by our New Jersey nuclear plants through the second zero-emission certificates, I'll refer to that as ZEC for the rest of this conversation, extends the $10 per megawatt-hour carbon-free attribute recognition through May of 2025.\r\nThis extension will allow us, along with stakeholders in New Jersey and at the federal level, the time we need to work on a  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

joined by Gary Bisbee, who will assume the role of head of investor relations for Thomson Reuters on March 1, in advance of my retirement in July.\r\nI couldn't be more pleased to place the baton in the very capable hands of Gary, who many of you already know.\r\nGary has covered Thomson Reuters on the sell side of Bank of America Securities for the past three years, and I know will do a very terrific job.\r\nAfter 18 years at Thomson Reuters, including 71 earnings calls and eight investor days, it's time for my next adventure and to spend more time with my wife and family.\r\nI truly enjoyed my time at TR, having worked with four CEOs, three CFOs and hundreds of very talented colleagues over that time.\r\nI also will miss speaking with many of you.\r\nYou challenged me, informed me and even entertained me a bit of times, and helped me do this job better.\r\nAnd for that, I am grateful.\r\nLastly, I've watched Thomson Reuters evolve to become one of the preeminent business information services companies in the world.\r\nAnd under Steve and Mike's leadership, I'm confident TR will continue to build on its progress, further strengthening its position for the benefit of our investors, customers and employees.\r\nAnd now, to the results.\r\nA lot to share today, so to enable us to get to as many questions as possible, we'd appreciate if you would limit yourselves to one question each and one follow-up when we open the phone lines.\r\nWe believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business.\r\nFor comparability, we will revise our 2021 results and during when we report our first quarter 2022 results in May.\r\nThese changes will not have any impact on our consolidated results.\r\nFirst, we will record intercompany revenues for Reuters News for content-related services that it provides to our legal professionals, corporates and tax and accounting professionals businesses.\r\nPreviously, these services have been reported as a transfer of expense from Reuters to these businesses.\r\nSo there is no impact on any segment's adjusted EBITDA.\r\nTwo, we will transfer $9 million of revenue from the corporates business to our tax and accounting business, where it will be managed and where it fits better.\r\nI'd like to direct you to the investor relations section of our website, where we posted a schedule that reflects our revised full year 2019, 2020 and 2021 results, as well as our revised 2021 quarterly results in the manner we will begin reporting in 2022.\r\nActual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the COVID impact and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies.\r\nYou may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.\r\nI'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter.\r\nRevenue and sales growth were again strong, exceeded our expectations, and we closed out the year on a solid footing.\r\nThis performance has created momentum as we started 2022.\r\nAnd it has helped build our confidence as we work to achieve our 2022 and 2023 targets.\r\nWe are increasingly in a position of strength.\r\nSince March 2020, when COVID began to negatively impact the global economy, professional markets have remained resilient and continued to grow, helped by a significant global shift by our customers to upgrade legal, tax, and risk, fraud, and compliance products.\r\nCustomers also continued to exhibit more confidence in their own future prospects.\r\nAnd our products are proving well suited to enable our customers to effectively serve their clients, targeting investment in products that are driving faster growth and where we have strong positions in growing markets.\r\nThis dynamic enabled us to achieve 5% organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, the highest growth rate in over a decade, while also improving our underlying profitability and free cash flow.\r\nOur fourth quarter results reflect an improving performance.\r\nFour of our five business segments again recorded organic revenue growth of 6% or greater and total company organic revenues grew 6%.\r\nWe continue to make steady progress with our Change program as we transform to a content-driven technology company.\r\nAnd we have achieved over $200 million in savings thus far, one-third of our $600 million target.\r\nWe also achieved all of our 2021 guidance targets that we increased throughout the year.\r\nGiven the momentum in the business and our growing confidence, today, we increased our 2022 and 2023 guidance from what we provided at this time last year.\r\nNow, for the results for the quarter.\r\nFourth quarter reported and organic revenues were up 6%, attributable to strong results from the Big 3 businesses in Reuters.\r\nAnd similar to the last quarter, this performance included strong organic growth of more than 20% from our Latin American businesses and nearly 10% growth from our Asia and emerging markets businesses.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA declined 14% to $452 million due to cost related to the Change program, higher performance bonus expense and a discretionary investment of $25 million to better position the business for 2022, which Mike will discuss.\r\nThis resulted in a margin of 26.4%.\r\nExcluding Change program, Costs, adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1%.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.54 per share in the prior year period.\r\nThe additional $25 million we invested in the quarter lowered adjusted earnings per share by $0.04.\r\nTurning to fourth quarter results by segment.\r\nThe Big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, reflecting strength across each of the businesses.\r\nU.S. legal market was very healthy throughout 2021.\r\nAnd our performance benefited from that dynamic.\r\nLegal's fourth quarter performance was again impressive with organic revenue growth of 6%, the third consecutive quarter of 6% growth.\r\nFull year revenue growth was also 6%, the highest annual growth rate since 2008.\r\nSales was strong throughout the year, including Q4.\r\nWe exited the year in a good position, recording double-digit recurring sales growth in Q4, reflecting customers' willingness to invest in productivity-enhancing product.\r\nFor example, Westlaw Edge continued to achieve strong sales growth in the end of the quarter with an annual contract value, or ACV, penetration of 65%, achieving the top end of our guidance with more opportunity in 2022 with a target of 70% to 75% penetration and the expected launch of Edge 2.0.\r\nSecond, practical law, as reported in the Legal segment, had a terrific quarter and year, growing mid-teens in both periods.\r\nWe forecast another strong performance in 2022 for practical law as we continue to invest in this key legal workflow initiative.\r\nThird, our government business, which is managed within our Legal segment, grew 7% organically in Q4 and 9% for the year and achieved strong sales in Q4, setting it up well for strong growth in 2022.\r\nAnd fourth, our Legal businesses in Canada and Asia grew double digits in the quarter while Europe grew mid-single digits.\r\nTurning to the corporates business.\r\nOrganic revenue growth continued to accelerate and was up 7% from 6% in Q3 and 4% in the first half of the year.\r\nThis improvement came from increasing demand for customers for our legal, tax and risk products.\r\nAnd tax and accounting had a terrific quarter and year with organic revenue growth of 9% for both periods and strong Q4 sales.\r\nReuters News organic revenues increased 12% in Q4 with growth across all of the business lines, particularly the professional business, which includes digital advertising, custom content and Reuters Events, which continues to recover from the negative impact of COVID-19 in 2020.\r\nAnd finally, global print organic revenues declined Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

operations.\r\nNathan will go into a more detailed review of the numbers, and then I will have a short wrap up before we open it to questions.\r\nAs part of an essential industry, we had to jump through many hoops to stay operational so that people could come to work safely and I'm just so appreciative of everyone whose dedication, intelligence and skills lead us through this unprecedented experience.\r\nThese folks are the true heroes.\r\nOkay, so on to business.\r\nAs mentioned on our last call, we came out of the second quarter experiencing strong demand and I'm pleased to say that the trend continued throughout the third quarter.\r\nLet me discuss each of the divisions separately, starting with Engine Management.\r\nEngine Management sales were up 6.7% for the quarter, clawing back about a third of our sales shortfall in the first half.\r\nConsumer demand has been robust, which we believe reflects the deferred maintenance from the early days of the pandemic when costs were idled in driveways, but we're also experiencing a general surge in the aftermarket, the result of people staying at home and working on their vehicles.\r\nAnd we believe this has especially impacted the DIY segment.\r\nGood evidence of this is a strong performance of our wire and cable business.\r\nIt fits older vehicles and is relatively easy to install which are two hallmarks of DIY business, and while this line has recently been trending down 7% or so per year due to varied [Indecipherable] in lifecycle, it spiked up 10% in the quarter, which we have to assume is a temporary phenomenon.\r\nCustomer orders for all of Engine Management have been consistently solid and this has continued into October.\r\nThat said, our forecast remains low single-digit growth over the long term.\r\nOur Temperature Control Division was up 25% in the quarter driven by two dynamics.\r\nThe first was related to timing.\r\nIf you recall, pre-season orders from our last, from our customers were very light this year.\r\nIn fact, our first half was down almost 20%.\r\nAnd then it got hard out creating a surge in demand across the country.\r\nThese two factors combined for a very strong quarter, though year-to-date we are slightly behind last year.\r\nThis is why we always suggest looking at Temperature Control on a full year basis.\r\nThere are often quarterly anomalies but they typically balance themselves out.\r\nWe are pleased to report that the quarter set an all-time record for SMP.\r\nJim and Nathan will provide some detail on the drivers, so I just want to take a moment to speak to COVID-related savings.\r\nAs we have mentioned in the past, we put in place short-term cost reduction measures ratcheting back various discretionary expenses as well as cutting Executive and Board compensation.\r\nWe do plan to assess what we've learned and identify areas where we believe the savings can be sustained, however, we do recognize that many of these reductions will in fact be temporary.\r\nWe had also taken steps to conserve cash including suspensions of both our quarterly dividends and our share repurchase plan and we are pleased to reinstate both of these programs as they are core aspects of how we return value to our shareholders.\r\nSo in summary, needless to say, it's been a roller coaster of a year.\r\nAfter a mediocre first quarter and a truly difficult second quarter, we were able to make up much of the lost grounds with a very strong third quarter.\r\nWe always experienced a certain amount of volatility period to period, and while this year, it has been substantially more exaggerated, it does show that our business tends to balance over time, and we do expect that to continue going forward.\r\nBefore I hand this off, I would just like to make a few comments about the future.\r\nFirst, we were delighted, but not surprised to see our industry once again show its resilience.\r\nThe basic fundamentals are solid and there are many favorable trends taking us forward.\r\nAnd while the crisis is certainly not over, we are confident that we are smarter now than we were before, our team were stronger as a result of managing our way through it and we are well equipped to tackle whatever is thrown at us.\r\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jim who will talk about our operations.\r\nI will provide an overview of our business from an operational perspective.\r\nI plan to touch on the basics from supply chain manufacturing through distribution.\r\nAs we have all experienced, the past six months to seven months has been challenging and demanding.\r\nOur baseline was a 40% decrease in volume in April.\r\nThis was followed by a relatively quick rebound in customer POS numbers in May and June that turned into increased orders to us in June and July.\r\nThis momentum increased as we progressed through Q3 and remained steady.\r\nFrom a supply chain view, this meant working feverishly with our vendors to be able to meet our materials demand.\r\nOverall, with a few exceptions, our vendors and supply team have been able to keep supply flowing to our factories.\r\nTurning to our manufacturing base, we face surging demand with a significant mix shift toward older technology SKUs, driven by our customer sales in the DIY channel.\r\nEarly in the third quarter, we were hampered with a shortage of available labor, a combination of higher demand and the COVID impact with high risk employees out and disruptions from contact tracing.\r\nI'm happy to report that we have been able to secure additional manpower along with the return of our high-risk employees.\r\nWhat is the result of the surge in demand?\r\nProduction levels are significantly up in all our manufacturing facilities, generating favorable overhead absorption, which can be seen in our very strong Q3 gross margins.\r\nEngine Management was 31.5% and Temperature Control was 29.2%.\r\nThese higher margins were generated from the surge in production volume, which we expect to level off.\r\nWhile this favorable momentum should carry into Q4, we expect sales and production to return to normal in 2021.\r\nOur longer-term gross margin targets would be Engine Management, 30% plus and Temperature Control 26% plus.\r\nWe are fortunate to have a substantial manufacturing footprint in North America, including three low cost operations in Mexico, reducing our China exposure.\r\nI will also note on occasion, we have transferred production back to the U.S., the benefit of automating previous manual assembly processes.\r\nQuickly looking around the globe, our Poland operations, which is our coil manufacturing center of excellence, along with other switches and sensors has steadily grown in size and value.\r\nOver the past year, we have approved the added capacity for Poland to meet our increasing ignition coil demand.\r\nOur three China joint ventures, all in the Temperature Control product categories recovered very early from the pandemic at the start of the year.\r\nAll three JVs provide us a steady source of supply, whereby we can control costs, quality and lead times.\r\nFinally, our North American distribution centers are our last touch point with our products.\r\nOur Q3 surge in demand present the challenges for our DC shipping performance.\r\nSimilar to our manufacturing operations, we experienced the shortage of available labor to meet demand.\r\nThe impact from this was slower turnaround time in our DCs to ship orders.\r\nDuring this period, our DCs were working six and seven days per week to keep up.\r\nTremendous efforts were put forward by our DC employees to satisfy our customer needs.\r\nWe have made great strides securing additional head count and I'm happy to report that we are covering [Phonetic] again and meeting our shipping turnaround goals.\r\nIn summary, we are very fortunate to be a resilient industry that bounced back so quickly.\r\nUnfortunately, this is not the same for many other industries that have suffered dearly.\r\nI commend our frontline heroes that were on t Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Q2 increased 17.5% and 23%, respectively, over the prior year period, primarily as a result of continued improvement in solid waste pricing volume growth and strength in recovered commodity values.\r\nThese trends drove year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points and adjusted free cash flow of over $585 million, up 18.5% year-over-year, and given expected continuing momentum and margin expansion from these trends position us to raise our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted free cash flow.\r\n2021 also has the potential to be another outsized year of acquisition activity.\r\nYear-to-date, we have signed or closed 14 acquisitions with total annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, including $75 million of franchise operations in California, Nevada and Oregon expected to close later this year.\r\nWe continue to see record amounts of seller interest driving elevated acquisition dialogue, and as communicated throughout the year, expect closings related to most of this activity to be more weighted to the second half of the year, which will provide further upside to our increased outlook for the year and strong rollover growth into 2022.\r\nOn the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections on both a dollar basis and per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.\r\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations.\r\nOther companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently.\r\nIn the second quarter, solid waste price plus volume growth of 11.4% exceeded our expectations by almost 150 basis points, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected volumes as the recovery trends that began in Q1 continued throughout the quarter, with landfill tons and roll-off pulls returning to levels about in line with or above prepandemic levels.\r\nTotal price of 4.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, was above our outlook on higher core pricing of 4.7%, once again reflecting the strength of pricing retention we noted in Q1, plus about 20 basis points in fuel and material surcharges.\r\nOur Q2 pricing ranged from 2.6% in our mostly exclusive Western region to a range of about 4.5% to 7% in our more competitive regions.\r\nLooking ahead, we are positioned for higher sequential pricing growth during the second half of the year as a result of incremental price increases we have already put in place to offset certain cost pressures.\r\nReported volume growth of 6.5% in Q2 reflected sequential improvement of approximately 1,000 basis points from Q1 and was led by those regions where markets were hardest hit during the pandemic including the Northeast U.S. and Canada.\r\nAll regions showed sequential improvement from Q1 and all reported positive volumes in Q2.\r\nVolumes range from about 4% in our Central region, where comparisons to the prior year were tougher as many markets were relatively less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, to almost 10.5% in Canada, one of our most impacted regions where the volume recovery have been remarkably strong, arguably outpacing the reopening activity particularly when considering that many restrictions in Canada extended through Q2 of this year.\r\nAlso noteworthy is our Western region, where volumes led our other regions going into the pandemic and continue to be the strongest in the U.S. at about 8.5% in Q2.\r\nLooking at year-over-year results in the second quarter on a same-store basis, all lines of business increased by double digits Commercial collection revenue was up 16% year-over-year.\r\nRoll-off pulls increased by over 11% year-over-year, led by Canada, up almost 20% and back to above pre-COVID-19 levels.\r\nIn the U.S., pulls were up about 10%, and all regions showed year-over-year improvement, most notably in our more impacted markets, including in the Northeast.\r\nLandfill tons were up 17% year-over-year on MSW tons up 11%, C&D tons up 20% and special waste tons up 33%.\r\nAs a result, landfill tons have returned to above pre-pandemic levels in all of our regions, except the Eastern region, which was slightly below prior levels as a result of the delayed reopening activity in markets in the Northeast.\r\nLooking more closely at results.\r\nAs noted, all waste types were up double-digit percentages year-over-year.\r\nHowever, the outsized amount of special waste activity was particularly noteworthy as Q2 activity propelled tons back to 13% above pre-pandemic levels with all regions up year-over-year, perhaps due to a little pull forward from Q3.\r\nLooking at Q2 revenues from recovery commodities, that is recycled commodities, landfill gas and renewable energy credits, or RINs.\r\nExcluding acquisitions, collectively, they were up about 95% year-over-year resulting in a combined margin tailwind of about 130 basis points, 90 basis points of which was from recycling and 40 basis points from landfill gas and RINs.\r\nRecycling revenue increases were driven by both higher commodity values, including old corrugated containers or OCC, up 25%; and plastics and metals, both up over 100%.\r\nHigher volumes also contributed year-over-year, again, reflecting the pandemic impact.\r\nPrices for OCC averaged about $135 per ton in Q2 and our RIN pricing averaged about $2.72.\r\nAnd finally, on to E&P waste activity.\r\nWe reported $31.2 million of E&P waste revenue in the second quarter, up 26% sequentially from Q1, reflecting increased activity across multiple basins.\r\nLooking at acquisition activity.\r\nAs noted earlier, we've already signed or closed 14 acquisitions with annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, approaching what we would consider an average amount of activity for the full year.\r\nThese transactions include multiple West Coast franchise markets, which are core to our strategy and provide unique opportunities to expand our exclusive contract portfolio.\r\nMoreover, our pipeline still reflects record levels of seller interest driving the potential for outsized activity in 2021, primarily given tax-related considerations.\r\nThat said, we continue to be selective and disciplined in our approach to acquisitions as we recognize the importance of value creation for our shareholders as well as market selection and asset positioning.\r\nNow I'd like to pass the call to Mary Anne to review more in depth the financial highlights of the second quarter and our increased outlook for the year and to provide a detailed outlook for Q3.\r\nI will then wrap up before heading into Q&A.\r\nIn the second quarter, revenue was $1.534 billion, about $44 million above our outlook due primarily to higher-than-expected solid waste growth and recovered commodity values.\r\nRevenue on a reported basis was up $228 million or 17.5% year-over-year, including acquisitions completed since the year ago period which contributed about $47.6 million of revenue in the quarter or about $44.1 million net of divestitures.\r\nCommodity-driven impacts account for about 100 basis points of margin expansion, net of a 30 basis point impact from higher fuel on diesel rates up almost 20% year-over-year.\r\nEx fuel solid waste collection transfer and disposal margins expanded by 50 basis points as we more than offset a 60 basis points increase in incentive compensation costs, 50 basis points from higher medical and 50 basis points from increased discretionary expenses.\r\nAnd finally, acquisitions completed since the year ago period accounted for about 10 basis points of margin dilution.\r\nRegarding discretionary expenses, we've begun the process of returning to a more normalized operating environment, including in-person training, meetings and other activities we consider integral to sustaining our culture and expanding our bench strength ahead of future growth.\r\nGiven the challenging labor environment, we have also proactively implemented supplemental wage adjustments in many markets as  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period.\r\nWhen we refer to the base revenues, were referring to our total revenues less our COVID diagnostic testing revenues, which include COVID-related revenues from Veritor, BD MAX and swabs.\r\nWhen we refer to base margins, we are adjusting for estimated COVID diagnostic testing profitability and the related profit we have reinvested back into our business.\r\nWhen we refer to any given period referring to fiscal period, it must be noted as a calendar period.\r\nFinally, when we refer to NewCo during todays call, were referring to the planned spinout of our Diabetes Care business into an independently public traded company following the effective trade date of the spin, which was announced on the second quarter earnings call.\r\nRemainCo refers to BD post separation.\r\nAs a reminder, this transaction is subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by BDs Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC.\r\nOn todays call, I will provide highlights of the quarter and discuss the continued strong progress we have made on our BD 2025 strategy.\r\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, the leadership team and the company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service to BD.\r\nIm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless, and his leadership and experience will make him an excellent director for NewCos Board.\r\nNow lets jump into our results.\r\nWe were very pleased with our third quarter performance, powered by strong growth and momentum in our base business across all three segments.\r\nRevenues totaled $4.9 billion, and our adjusted earnings per share was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations.\r\nTotal revenues were up 26.9% on a reported basis and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis.\r\nResults included COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth.\r\nExcluding COVID testing revenues, our base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units.\r\nThe strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective procedures and its impact on medical device utilization in the year ago quarter.\r\nBut Q3s result also reflects the continued momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025 strategy.\r\nExcluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 fiscal 21 increased 3.9% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the impact of the Alaris ship hold.\r\nIf you exclude the U.S. infusion systems business, our total revenues would have increased 6.6% relative to our prepandemic third quarter fiscal 2019.\r\nOur Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology and Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers, where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively, over 2019 levels.\r\nBioscience revenues were up 9%.\r\nSurgery and Peripheral Intervention revenues are both up 8%.\r\nElsewhere, we see opportunities for improvement ahead in fiscal 22 and beyond.\r\nFor example, our MDS revenues are up about 2% versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-based purchasing.\r\nAs hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here.\r\nAlso, as I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues are impacted by the Alaris ship hold, and we expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.\r\nWhile Im pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, Im equally pleased with the process were making in improving our working capital and cash flows.\r\nCash flow performance has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics.\r\nYear-to-date, cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior year period.\r\nThis improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance our more balanced capital allocation strategy this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately $242.\r\nThis marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017 and the largest amount we have repurchased since 2012.\r\nEven with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4 times.\r\nOverall, Im really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive momentum in our base business.\r\nThis gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption.\r\nWe now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis.\r\nThis is higher than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth.\r\nWe continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated.\r\nWe now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%.\r\nOur positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 while continuing to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess and obsolete COVID testing inventory.\r\nWe now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share range to be $12.85 to $12.95.\r\nChris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call.\r\nNext, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my number one priority.\r\nLast week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts.\r\nWorking with the FDA, we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to version 12.1.\r\n2 following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version.\r\nThis new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020, recall notice and provide programming, operational and cybersecurity updates to affected devices.\r\nHowever, the software update has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.\r\nTo address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA.\r\nAs Chris will later discuss, we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY 22 outlook.\r\nWe believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance time lines.\r\nNext, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify and empower.\r\nFirst, Id like to focus on our growth pillar.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable core business while purposely investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead.\r\nIve spoken about these three innovation and growth focuses before.\r\nAnd weve been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%.\r\nThrough this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time.\r\nAnd this year, weve launched several innovative products

{"filename": "UAA_q4_2021.txt", "text": "<s>[INST] You are a financial advisor tasked with creating a short summary of an earnings call transcript. You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n It is important to note that the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its potential effects on the global retail environment could continue to impact our business results going forward.\r\nYou may also hear us refer to amounts under U.S. GAAP.\r\nAt the beginning of last year, we were confronted with significant uncertainty about our business due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nWith dynamic changes in purchase behavior and marketplace demand, we faced several obstacles as we worked through what we believe to be a recovery year following a difficult 2020.\r\nAt that point, it would have been easy to stay conservative and adopt a wait-and-see strategy, yet the tremendous progress we made following our multiyear transformation, including healthier demand for the Under Armour brand, and the passion that this team shows up with every day meant going on offense was the only path for 2021.\r\nAnd because we stayed on offense, Under Armour delivered a record year of financial results, a year that exemplifies the power of our long-term strategic plan and our ability to stay hyperfocused on execution while leveraging our core strengths to position us more strongly for our next chapter of growth.\r\nThroughout 2021, we worked methodically to expand our brand's awareness and engagement, ensuring we showed up more consistently, louder and with a sharper point of view about the distinct role we play in an athlete's journey to compete.\r\nWe underscored our commitment to performance by delivering some of the most innovative products that we've ever produced.\r\nWe forged deeper and more productive relationships with our key wholesale partners.\r\nWe saw significant progress in our largest long-term growth drivers, our international, direct-to-consumer, women's and footwear businesses.\r\nAnd we're stronger financially than we've ever been.\r\nIn this respect, looking at some of our highlights.\r\nWhile our year-over-year comparisons benefited from the significant COVID-19 impacts we experienced in 2020, we are equally pleased with our performance over the past two years.\r\nFor the full year 2021, revenue was up 27% to reach $5.7 billion, which is a record.\r\nVersus 2019, revenue is up 8%.\r\nSo solid progress from before the pandemic, and the result driven by several strategies that have lifted the quality and composition of our sales compared to a few years ago.\r\nWholesale revenue increased 36% to $3.2 billion in 2021.\r\nOn a two-year basis, wholesale is up 3%.\r\nAs detailed in previous calls, this performance has been tempered by the strategic decisions we've made to improve brand health by reducing our sales to the off-price channel and exiting approximately 2,500 undifferentiated retail doors in North America, an effort which is now concluded.\r\nOur direct-to-consumer business was up 26% to $2.3 billion in 2021.\r\nVersus 2019, direct-to-consumer is up 29%, with strong momentum in our owned and operated stores and our e-commerce business.\r\nFollowing a 40% increase in 2020, our e-commerce business was up 4% in 2021, equating to 45% growth on a two-year stack.\r\nThis result gives us confidence that this business is well-positioned following a prolonged period of elevated promotional activities.\r\n2021 gross margin was up 210 basis points to a record 50.3%.\r\nVersus 2019, gross margin is up 340 basis points, so excellent progress over two years, driven by benefits from pricing and a more favorable channel mix being offset by supply chain headwinds related to COVID-19 and the absence of MyFitnessPal, which we sold at the end of 2020.\r\nRounding out the P&L.\r\nOur full year operating income reached $486 million, net income was $360 million, and our diluted earnings per share was $0.77, all three of which are records.\r\nWe also realized strong balance sheet and cash flow performances with inventory down 9% to an absolute dollar value that is only slightly higher than in 2015 when we were a $4 billion business.\r\nAnd finally, one more record having ended the year with $1.7 billion in cash.\r\nAll in, what an incredible period for Under Armour.\r\nHaving operated for nearly two years amid a global pandemic, I am proud of the progress we've made, the resilience we've shown and the potential we have to do even better in the future.\r\nBy staying focused on our key strategies, we are competing and executing at progressively higher levels, helping us unlock value and returns for our shareholders.\r\nDriving us forward at the heart of why we exist is our purpose.\r\nWe empower those who strive for more.\r\nFor Under Armour, everything is about the journey.\r\nFrom an awful workout when you want to quit but don't, to pushing through that last rep and adding one more, to earning that PR because you put in the work, Under Armour makes you better.\r\nWe do this by delivering innovative products, experiences and styles influenced by athlete insight and real-world data.\r\nInnovations wrapped in our engineering to empower the journey to sport through training, competition and recovery, 2021 was an exceptional year for Under Armour products.\r\nThere are too many to list, but a few standouts on the apparel side include RUSH, Iso-Chill, Rival Fleece, Crossback, Infinity, Unstoppable and Meridian, all names that delivered a 33% increase in revenue we achieved.\r\nOn the footwear side, franchises like HOVR Sonic, Machina and Infinite; UA Flow Velociti Wind; Charged Pursuit, Assert, Aurora; Curry; and Project Rock contributed nicely to 35% growth, validating one of our largest long-term growth opportunities.\r\n2021 was also an exceptional year in Under Armour's progress to connect our brand even more deeply with consumers.\r\nFrom the optionality we created in our P&L, we were able to make incremental marketing investments, which we expect to fuel even stronger brand momentum in the years ahead.\r\nAt the center of these efforts, product, experience and inspiration fits The Only Way is Through.\r\nMore than a mantra, it's become an ethos, synonymous with the hard work necessary to power the journey, and it's always a journey.\r\nFrom an initial product drawing to shopping bag to the closet, we obsess athletes and those who strive for more.\r\nHowever, being purpose-led means that it's about more than just shirts and shoes.\r\nAnd sport is so much more than just a game.\r\nIt teaches us to push past our limits, to be collaborators, to be leaders.\r\nIt increases confidence, reduces stress and improves mental health.\r\nYet many young athletes face barriers that prevent them from starting their journey to sport.\r\nWith a lack of fields and courts, gaps in coaching, shrinking leagues and the shortage of gear to play, train and compete with, we recognize that not everyone has access to sport.\r\nAddressing this opportunity, a few weeks ago, we announced the long-term commitment of our resources, focus and energy to break down these barriers.\r\nAs we lay the foundation for our

[/INST] # Under Armour delivered record financial results in 2021, with revenue increasing 27% to $5.7 billion. This was driven by growth across all channels, including a strong performance in international markets. Gross margin improved to 50.3%, and net income reached $360 million. The company also made progress in its efforts to improve brand health by reducing sales to off-price channels and exiting undifferentiated retail doors. Despite ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver sustainable growth over the long term, driven by continued innovation, consumer connectivity, and the execution of its strategic plan. In its most recent quarter, revenue increased 9% to $1.5 billion, while gross margin expanded to 50.7%. The company expects to recognize $525-$550 million in charges related to a restructuring plan and projects a mid-single-digit revenue increase and diluted earnings per share of $0.02-$0.03 for the current transition quarter. While supply chain and inflationary pressures remain, the company's operational agility and strong demand for its brand provide confidence in its ability to navigate these challenges effectively.</s>"}

performance, but that do not solely relate to historical or current facts.\r\nPlease also note that we will present certain historical and forecasted non-GAAP financial measures in today's call, including adjusted diluted EPS, backlog, EBITDA and free cash flow.\r\nLastly, if you would like to be notified when Quanta publishes news releases and other information, please sign up for email alerts through the Investor Relations section of quantaservices.com.\r\nWe also encourage investors and others interested in our company to follow Quanta IR and Quanta Services on the social media channels listed on our website.\r\nWe will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations.\r\nAdditionally, total backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with the customers, favorable end market dynamics and continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies.\r\nAs many of you are aware, several weeks ago, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Blattner, which is a premier utility scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and a strong safety culture.\r\nWe believe the energy transition in North America is on the cusp of a significant acceleration, and at moving to a carbon-neutral economy will require sizable and decades-long investment in renewable generation and related infrastructure.\r\nWe believe this transaction puts Quanta in a unique position to enable the energy infrastructure for North America's energy transition.\r\nSince announcing our intention to acquire Blattner in early September, customer reactions and conversations across our customer base have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive.\r\nFurther, we previously commented about how remarkably similar Quanta and Blattner are operationally and culturally, which has become increasingly apparent to working with the Blattner management team on integration.\r\nWe were all excited about our combined growth opportunities when we first announced the transaction.\r\nAnd I can tell you that today, we are even more excited and increasingly confident in the value proposition, innovative solutions and growth synergy opportunities at Quanta and Blattner are positioned to provide existing and new customers.\r\nNow turning the call to our operating results.\r\nOur Electric Power Solutions operations continued to perform well with record revenues and strong margins driven by robust demand for our services, solid and safe execution, high utilization of our resources and operational excellence.\r\nWe are proud of our execution and confident that our strong market position will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities created by a favorable long-term trends driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions.\r\nDemand for grid modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnection services remain active, and discussions around opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities continue to advance.\r\nOur electric power backlog remains strong, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth we generated in the first half of this year.\r\nDuring the quarter, Hurricane Ida made landfall over Louisiana, which ultimately left 1.2 million customers across eight states without power, including one million outages in Louisiana alone.\r\nQuanta deployed significant resources to support utility customers through electric power infrastructure who was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 2,500 line workers and front-end support services and engineering staff.\r\nOur comprehensive response resulted in record emergency restoration revenue and highlights our ability to quickly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need.\r\nOur customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality over the coming decades, which is planned to be achieved in large part through increasing renewable generation investment.\r\nWe believe public policy and a positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly toward renewables over the near and longer term.\r\nBlattner's utility scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's complementary and holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives.\r\nFor example, Blattner is currently constructing more than 30 utility-scale renewable energy projects across the country, and another Quanta company is currently working on the largest solar-powered battery storage projects in North America.\r\nAdditionally, we are seeing accelerated demand for our services that enable renewal generation, including transmission interconnections and substations.\r\nWe continue to scale our communication operations and progress to our strategy.\r\nFor example, we have developed our wireless capabilities and are expanding our wireless services into certain markets.\r\nCommunications revenues grew significantly in the third quarter as compared to last year.\r\nAnd though we incurred higher costs on certain jobs due to descoping of certain contracts and project closeouts, which impacted profitability for these operations, these issues were not meaningful to the overall electric power segment or Quanta as a whole.\r\nNevertheless, demand for our communication services remains high and the majority of our communication operations are performing at or near our double-digit margin targets.\r\nOur underground utility in Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter despite being impacted by work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and work inefficiencies associated with the recent surge of the COVID-19 Delta variant in certain areas.\r\nWe continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability.\r\nWe expect our industrial services to strengthen through next year, along with the continued recovery of the global economy and demand for refined products as well as the return of our customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market.\r\nLooking to the coming years, we believe the opportunity Quanta has with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities may be underestimated.\r\nHere are several examples of such initiatives and project opportunities.\r\nGas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow.\r\nTo that end, Quanta is working with several gas utility customers on hydrogen pilot programs.\r\nCertain refiners are building renewable and biofuel processing facilities, which could create opportunities for our industrial services.\r\nNatural gas power plants are also exploring blending hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel source to power their turbines, which could create opportunities for our pipeline infrastructure services.\r\nLastly, we are actively pursuing carbon sequestration projects in the United States, which could utilize our engineering and pipeline construction services.\r\nIn Canada, Pembina Pipeline and TC Energy have proposed a plan to jointly develop a carbon transportation and sequestration system called the Alberta Carbon Grid, which is envisioned  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

as a matter of policy, disclose material that is not public information on our conference calls.\r\nThat's always been obvious investment strategy favored at the end of every cycle.\r\nThese are really just select the few dominant technology masters of the universe that everyone loves, sit back and enjoy the multiple expansion.\r\nMeantime, valuation spreads between cheap and expensive have reached all-time highs all over the world.\r\nFurther, the volume of questions about whether value will ever work again or whether there is a new definition of value have been -- have become commonplace.\r\nThis is reminiscent of the late 1990s Internet bubble, when Michael Lewis' 1999 book, The New New Thing, described it all you needed to know.\r\nInvestors then like investors today, were mesmerized.\r\nBut values day is coming, paying less than the present value of future cash flows remains a winning strategy for long-term investment success, and the environment today makes this path even more attractive than normal.\r\nWe would argue that the seeds for unwinding today's extremes are right in front of us, especially as our COVID dominated world has led us into a recession, that history shows it's the key marker for the shift.\r\nConsidering the following four possible catalysts that could already be signaling that a shift is upon us.\r\nFirst, the recession is in place and the path toward economic recovery is becoming clear.\r\nWe examined recessions in the U.S. over the last 100 years and in Japan over the last 45 years, and the evidence is compelling.\r\nThe U.S. experienced 14 recessions during the past century.\r\nI'm looking at the five year returns, measuring from the beginning of the recession, the value outperformed the broad market by an average of 5% per year.\r\nSecond, interest rates stop falling, bringing multiple expansion from growth stocks to an end.\r\nInterest rates have been in structural decline for the past 40 years.\r\nThe trend has led us to a world where you can buy value stocks at PEs of 10 just like at any time in the past 70 years, while average growth stock multiples have doubled from 30 times to 60 times earnings.\r\nEven if rates don't rise, the tailwind enjoyed by growth stocks should dissipate.\r\nExuberant growth expectations for the technology masters of the universe revert to normal.\r\nConsider the math using Microsoft as an example.\r\nMicrosoft's stock price is up ten-fold during the past 10 years.\r\nThat's 25% per year, helped by strong growth in cloud technology replacing on-premises hardware demand.\r\nThis has led to 8% annual growth in operating income.\r\nTo get an 8% annual stock price appreciation going forward given Microsoft's high multiple would now require 20 years of 10% operating income growth.\r\nBut considering that, market analysts estimate that public cloud penetration of data needs has reached 30% to 35%, and that the possible maximum penetration for the public cloud would be approximately 70%.\r\nWe're about halfway to saturation.\r\nSo where will 20 years of growth come from?\r\nWe have yet to see.\r\nAnd finally, the conventional wisdom that technological change comes entirely at the detriment of the existing franchises proves to be mistaken.\r\nLet's consider the case of electric cars and Tesla versus VW.\r\nConventional wisdom and stock price suggest that the answer is obvious, Tesla will win.\r\nBut even if Tesla grows, does it make sense that VW has to shrink?\r\nTesla's stock is one of the darlings rising over ten-fold during the past five years.\r\nVW's stock on the other hand has barely changed in the same period.\r\nBut there are ultimately only two ways to win an auto manufacturing.\r\nOne, charge higher prices.\r\nIn other words, maintain a brand premium or two, manufacture at lower costs.\r\nIt seems inevitable, but these truths will apply to electric vehicles and that VW will succeed importing their brands strengths, think Porsche and Audi and scale advantages into the electric vehicle competition.\r\nIn fact, VW leads all competitors in the number of new electric vehicles that will be introduced over the next several years.\r\nTurning to the business front, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net inflows.\r\nFor the previous 12 months, we had net positive flows of approximately $2.1 billion.\r\nIn fact, we have had positive net flows for each of the last three calendar years and six of the last eight years.\r\nNo small feat in a world questioning the efficacy of value investing.\r\nWe reported diluted earnings of $0.16 per share for the third quarter compared to $0.13 last quarter and $0.19 per share for the third quarter of last year.\r\nRevenues were $33.9 million for the quarter and operating income of $15 million.\r\nOur operating margin was 44.1% this quarter, increasing from 36.4% last quarter and decreasing from 46.3% in the third quarter of last year.\r\nTaking a closer look at our assets under management, we ended the quarter at $33.3 billion, up 5.7% from last quarter, which ended at $31.5 billion and down 7% from the third quarter of last year, which ended at $35.8 billion.\r\nThe increase in assets under management from last quarter was driven by net inflows of $1.1 billion, as I've just mentioned, and market appreciation including the impact of foreign exchange of $0.7 billion.\r\nA decrease from the third quarter of last year reflects $4.8 billion in market depreciation, including the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by net inflows of $2.1 billion.\r\nSeptember 30, 2020, our assets under management consisted of $13.3 billion and separately managed accounts, $18 billion in sub-advised accounts and $2 billion in our Pzena funds.\r\nCompared to last quarter, separately managed account assets increased, reflecting $0.4 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, partially offset by $0.1 billion in net outflows.\r\nSub-advised account assets increased, reflecting $1.3 billion in net inflows and $0.3 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, and assets in Pzena funds decreased slightly to $0.1 billion in net outflows.\r\nAverage assets under management for the third quarter of 2020 were $33.1 billion, an increase of 11.1% from last quarter and a decrease of 8.1% from the third quarter of last year.\r\nRevenues increased 12.7% from the last quarter and decreased 8.4% from the third quarter of last year.\r\nThe fluctuation in revenues primarily reflects severance [Phonetic] and average assets under management over the period as well as the impact to performance fees and fulcrum fees recognized.\r\nDuring the quarter we did not recognize any performance fees similar to last quarter when compared to $0.3 million recognized in the third quarter of last year.\r\nThe third quarter also reflects a reduction in the base fees of certain accounts related to the fulcrum fee arrangements of one client relationship.\r\nThese fee arrangements require a reduction in the base fee if the investment strategy underperforms its relevant benchmark or allows our performance fee if the strategy outperforms its benchmark.\r\nDuring the third and second quarters of 2020, we recognized $1 million reductions in base fees related to these accounts compared to $0.5 million reduction in base fees during the third quarter of 2019.\r\nThese fees are calculated quarterly and compare relative performance over a three year measurement period.\r\nTo the extent that three year performance record at this account fluctuate relative to its relevant benchmark, the amount of base fees recognized may vary.\r\nOur weighted average fee rate was 41 basis

[/INST] # Despite a surge in technology-focused investments in recent years, the transcript emphasizes that value investing remains a viable long-term strategy. The current economic recession, combined with the potential for interest rate stabilization, could lead to a shift away from growth stocks and towards value stocks. Historically, during recessions, value outperformed the broad market by an average of 5% annually over the next five years. Skepticism towards conventional wisdom that electric vehicles will eliminate traditional automakers is warranted, as companies like VW demonstrate potential for success in this evolving market. The company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.16, up from $0.13 last quarter, on revenues of $33.9 million. Net inflows reached $1.1 billion, resulting in positive net flows for three consecutive years.

follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of our business, an update on our M&A activity and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our end markets.\r\nBill will then discuss our first-quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the second and -- quarter and full-year 2021.\r\nFinally, Eric will conclude with an update on our sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\r\nBefore we begin, a brief reminder.\r\nWith that, I'll now the call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.\r\nOnce again, our teams across IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've achieved together.\r\nI don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago.\r\nOur diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve us well.\r\nWe're seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point.\r\nWe continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago.\r\nAlthough tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping a close eye on.\r\nOur day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward.\r\nCustomers are more confident in their outlook but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments.\r\nAs for COVID, the conditions vary widely around the world.\r\nIn the U.K. and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late.\r\nIn China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now.\r\nThe situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had in our businesses.\r\nThe quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles in a variety of staffing challenges, this was far from smooth sailing.\r\nI'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results.\r\nThe operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off.\r\nPivoting a moment to capital deployment.\r\nWith the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night, covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note.\r\nAnd we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities.\r\nWe recently allocated some of our most talented resources toward focused strategy and business development roles, and we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX.\r\nOur deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition.\r\nWe seek to both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses as well as established positions within new market niches where the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders.\r\nWe are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy toward these efforts.\r\nMoving on to Slide 7.\r\nYesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum Group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million.\r\nAirtech engineers and manufactures high-performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps.\r\nAirtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid-30s range in 2020.\r\nIt is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits.\r\nWithin the IDEX family of businesses, they complement and expand upon the solutions provided by Gast Manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower, air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems.\r\nWhile there are some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of Airtech's product lines will be complementary.\r\nThey will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation.\r\nThis deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter, will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health & Science Technology segment.\r\nTurning to our commercial results on Slide 8.\r\nThe positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter.\r\nMost of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels.\r\nI'll go into more details in a minute.\r\nOrganic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all-time high for us.\r\nQ1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019.\r\nAs we look across our segments, health and science technologies and fire and safety/diversified products delivered strong organic order growth, with fluid and metering technology slightly lagging.\r\nAs growth rates in HST and FSDP begin to naturally level off, we expect FMT will drive additional growth due to the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year.\r\nThese commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers.\r\nOn Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets.\r\nTo level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery.\r\nOur day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year, and we continue to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic.\r\nWe are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels.\r\nMany of our markets have fully recovered, and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets.\r\nIn our fluid and metering technologies segment, industrial day rates continued to increase throughout the quarter.\r\nAs I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large capex projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back toward 2019 levels.\r\nAgriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong.\r\nOur water business is stable.\r\nWe continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic on municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill.\r\nEnergy markets continue to lag 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector.\r\nMoving to the health and science technologies segment.\r\nWe experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets, semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings.\r\nThe overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance.\r\nOur AI and life science markets are on the rebound as the impact of the pandemic in the United States has improved.\r\nDay rates are improving, but projects are lacking.\r\nOne last item for HST. We do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been taking -- talking about in this segment, specifically around testing.\r\nThe end product application is yet to receive FDA approval which will impact volumes for this year.\r\nWe do believe that the strength in the rest of the  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before we get into the results for the quarter, I want to make some high level comments.\r\nThey continue to be laser focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers.\r\nOperating in the current environment is not easy, but our team finds creative ways to serve and support our existing customers engage with new prospects.\r\nI'm very impressed with how our teammates are leveraging the investments we've made in technology over the past few years to enhance our capabilities and customer interactions.\r\nThese include everyone from producers, service, marketing, brokers and underwriting teammates.\r\nAt this stage, we do not see face-to-face interactions returning to the pre-pandemic levels for quite some time and more than likely the new normal will be different than in the past.\r\nAs we navigate our way through the pandemic, I'm confident that we will continue to leverage innovation in our sales and service model to help further our growth and support our customers.\r\nWe've talked a lot in the past about how we're built for the long term and think about delivering shareholder value.\r\nOn Tuesday of last week, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 9%.\r\nWith this increase, we are now on our 27th year of consecutive increases, something we're very proud of.\r\nNow let's transition to the results of the quarter.\r\nI'm on slide number three.\r\nWe had a great quarter and I'm very pleased with our results.\r\nWe delivered $674 million of revenue, growing 8.9% in total and 4.3% organically.\r\nI'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.\r\nOur EBITDAC margin was 32.8%, which is up 130 basis points from the third quarter of 2019.\r\nOur net income per share for the third quarter was $0.47, increasing 14.6% on an as reported basis.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.52, an increase of 33.3% over the prior year.\r\nOur team has done an outstanding job of growing our revenue while managing our expense base in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19.\r\nDuring the quarter, we completed another six acquisitions with annual revenues of approximately $31 million.\r\nFrom a capital perspective, we issued $700 million of 10.5-year bonds in September.\r\nWe're very pleased with a coupon of 2.375%, particularly considering that we issued bonds in March of 2019 with a coupon of 4.5%.\r\nOur insurance was very well received by the debt markets, which we believe is a true reflection of Brown & Brown's credit quality.\r\nWith this capital and our cash flow generation, we're well positioned to further invest in a disciplined manner in our business and deliver future results.\r\nIn summary, we're very pleased with the strong performance for the quarter as the strength of our operating model continues to perform well through these unprecedented economic times.\r\nI'm on slide number four.\r\nAs you may remember, in April, we thought our third quarter would be the most challenging due to the expected decrease in exposure units for our customers.\r\nAnd then we performed slightly better than anticipated in the second quarter and during our second quarter earnings call, we indicated that third quarter would not be as low as originally anticipated.\r\nAs a result of good new business, higher retention and rate increases, we had a really good third quarter.\r\nWe saw companies doing their best to restart their businesses, which included some rehiring of employees or taking them off furloughed.\r\nWe saw employers and we saw individuals who start to lose employee benefits coverage through layoffs or reductions in force, which would also drive a decline in workers compensation coverage.\r\nWe saw this in certain industries.\r\nHowever, there are many industries that have been quite resilient or have even grown over the past six months.\r\nAs a result of our diversification across geography, customer size, industry lines of coverage and capabilities, we've continued to grow.\r\nPlease don't take my comments out of context.\r\nWe have customers that are struggling, and we're doing our best to help them.\r\nWe believe that there is going to be challenges over the coming quarters and consequently expect there will be ups and downs in the path to recovery.\r\nDuring the quarter we saw rate increases similar to the last few quarters and in some cases, they've increased slightly.\r\nFor the most part admitted market rates are up 3% to 7% across most lines.\r\nCommercial auto rates were the exception, as they remain up 10%.\r\nThere is a lot of talk about workers compensation rate starting to turn positive during the quarter.\r\nWe're not seeing this across the board.\r\nGenerally workers' compensation rate are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters.\r\nFrom an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%.\r\nCoastal property, both wind and quake are up 15% to 25%.\r\nProfessional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry.\r\nFor both of these lines there can be outliers.\r\nOne area where we're seeing the most pressure right now is personal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast States.\r\nThe continued reduction in carrier appetite has been caused by fires and tropical activity, resulting in a reevaluation of all CAT-exposed property.\r\nWe believe the reduction in personal lines capacity in CAT areas will continue to decrease in the near term.\r\nIn connection with the increasing rates, the placement of coverage for many lines, certain industries where customers with significant losses continues to be challenging.\r\nThis would include access or umbrella coverage where a carrier or carriers might want to reduce their limit by half, but keep the premium constant.\r\nJust to give an example.\r\nWe do not expect this trend to change for the next few quarters.\r\nWe've been active in the M&A space closing six transactions during the quarter with annual revenues of approximately $31 million.\r\nDuring the first three quarters, we closed 16 transactions with annualized revenues of approximately $117 million.\r\nAnd in addition, we've already closed a few deals for the fourth quarter.\r\nI'm now on slide number five.\r\nLet's discuss the performance of our four segments.\r\nOur retail segment, organic revenue grew by 4.1% in the third quarter.\r\nIt's a really strong performance recognized across substantially all lines of business, driven by a combination of good retention, improving new business wins and continued rate increases.\r\nWe're very pleased with how our team is prospecting new account in both the traditional face to face model, as well as virtually.\r\nOur National Programs segment grew 8.4% organically, delivering another impressive quarter.\r\nOur growth was driven by continued strong performance from many of our programs, including our lender place, our commercial and residential earthquake and our wind programs, just to name a few.\r\nOur Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 8.2% organically for the quarter.\r\nWe realized improving new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage.\r\nBrokerage was the fastest growing, while our binding authority business delivered modest growth as many main street businesses are not back to full operation and we experience continued headwinds in the personal line space.\r\nWe expect this rate pressure to continue for at least the next few quarters until carriers reevaluate the risk appetite or allocate more capacity to this challenged area.\r\nThe organic revenue for our services segment decreased 13.1% for the quarter.\r\nThe main drivers of the decline were lower claims volume for our social security advocacy businesses, a prior year terminated customer contract and lower claims for many of our other businesses related to COVID-19.\r\nWe expect organic revenue in the Services segment will be down in the low to mid single-digit range for the fourth quarter.\r\nLike previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and CEO.\r\nSir, the floor is yours.\r\nautozone.com under the Investor Relations link.\r\nPlease click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nAs we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well being of our customers and AutoZoners.\r\nEveryone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I am very proud of how our team has responded.\r\nSince the start of the pandemic, we have reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners.\r\nAs our sales volumes have remained at historic all time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing WOW Customer Service, regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way.\r\nThe Assistance Fund is an independent non-profit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to AutoZoners who find themselves in a very difficult place.\r\nWe are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way.\r\nTo me it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values.\r\nWe'll also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year.\r\nOn to our sales results.\r\nOur domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter on top of last year's very strong 12.3%.\r\nOur team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and delivered amazing results.\r\nCongratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere.\r\nOur growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%.\r\nCommercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales.\r\nAnd now we've delivered $900 million in sales in one quarter, an incredible accomplishment.\r\nOn a trailing four quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, up 27%.\r\nWe also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter, reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year.\r\nOn a two year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%.\r\nMany people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial.\r\nIn short, it is not one thing, and I want to repeat that.\r\nIt is not one thing.\r\nIt's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years.\r\nThose initiatives include improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub coverage and access, the continuing strength of the Duralast brand, leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver.\r\nWe continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance.\r\nWe're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY.\r\nWe ran a 9% comp this quarter on top of last year's 12.7%.\r\nWhile our DIY two year stack comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20% two year comp in this sector of our business.\r\nFrom the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains.\r\nOur performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long-term.\r\nNow let's focus on our sales cadence.\r\nSame-store sales increased sequentially from September through November.\r\nHowever, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed.\r\nGiven the dynamics of the past 20 months, we like others who benefited from the pandemic, believe it is more instructive to look at two year stacked comps.\r\nOn this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable.\r\nFor Q1, our two year comp was 25.8% and the four week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3%, 26% and 25.3% respectively.\r\nRegarding weather, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the Northeastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends.\r\nOverall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter.\r\nAs we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter.\r\nHistorically, extreme weather, be that hot or cold, helps drive parts failure.\r\nRegarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was up 1%, while our ticket was up 7.5%.\r\nThis low-single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year as expected due to the elimination of stimulus, the reduce -- the elimination of enhanced unemployment, stay at home orders and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year.\r\nIn our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers.\r\nIt was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong.\r\nAnd we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months.\r\nDuring the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are.\r\nWhile last quarter we saw roughly 400 basis point gap in comp performance between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country, we did not see that gap this quarter.\r\nIn fact, the Northeastern Midwestern markets slightly outperformed.\r\nThe market share data suggests that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country.\r\nNow let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter.\r\nOur same-store sales were up 13.6% versus last year's first quarter.\r\nOur net income was $555 million.\r\nAnd our earnings per share was $25.69 a share, increasing an impressive 38.1%.\r\nRegarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter.\r\nAs Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well.\r\nWe've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses, like batteries, that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year.\r\nWe believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more.\r\nLet me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing.\r\nThis quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was up about 2% on a like-for-like basis.\r\nWe believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system.\r\nWe could see mid-single-digit inflation in retails as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers.\r\nWe have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.\r\nWhile we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to mid-term sales.\r\nWhat I will say is that the past three quarter sales have all been consistent on a two year stack comp basis and both our DIY and commercial bus Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph

[/INST] # AutoZone experienced strong performance in Q1, with domestic same-store sales increasing by an impressive 13.6%. This led to a 38.1% surge in earnings per share to $25.69, a notable increase from the previous year. Commercial sales reached a record $900 million and delivered a 29% growth, while DIY retail sales grew by 9%. The company attributes this growth to various initiatives, including improved store availability, hub and mega hub coverage, and strong customer service. Despite inflationary pressures, AutoZone has been able to offset costs through pricing actions and maintained gross margins. Operating expenses increased by 10.4%, mainly due to customer service investments and technology upgrades. The company remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, having repurchased $900 million worth of shares during the quarter. AutoZone's long-term outlook remains positive, as it anticipates continued growth in both the retail and commercial sectors and plans to expand its supply chain and open more mega hubs throughout the fiscal year.</s>"}

than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent Board member for nine years.\r\nAs many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others.\r\nI know that the Agilent team is not alone and recognize that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed and we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family.\r\nNow, on to the third quarter review and our updated outlook for the year.\r\nIn Q3, the very strong broad based momentum in our business continues.\r\nThe Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations.\r\nQ3 revenue of $1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core.\r\nThis is against the mass decline of 3% in Q3 of last year, so we are well above fiscal year 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\r\nIn addition, as other positive sign of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter.\r\nOur growth is broad based across all business groups, markets and geographies.\r\nThe combination of strong top line performance and execution translated into excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share.\r\nOur Q3 operating margin is 26%, this is up 230 basis points from last year.\r\nEPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year.\r\nAgilent's success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess.\r\nWe are developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast growing businesses while delivering outstanding customer service and continue to drive profitability.\r\nSince the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerged even stronger as a company.\r\nWhile we have yet to leave COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results.\r\nBob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, but I want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, pharma and chemical energy.\r\nWe continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments.\r\nOur large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall pharma revenue, up from the mid 20s just a few years ago.\r\nIn chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter.\r\nThis is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half and our order funnel continues to strengthen.\r\nLooking at our performance by business unit, The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $680 million.\r\nLSAG is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core, off just a 4% decline last year.\r\nLSAG's growth is broad based across all end markets.\r\nOur performance is led by strength in pharma, which is up 22% and chemical energy up 31%.\r\nAll businesses delivered strong growth led by Cell Analysis at 38% growth and our LC and LCMS businesses, which grew 22%.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our position in the fast growing large molecule market segment.\r\nDuring the quarter, the LSAG team launched three InfinityLab Bio LC systems at the well attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June.\r\nThese new products further extend our LC leadership position.\r\nIn addition, building on our already strong pharma offerings, we launched new compliance ready LC/Q-TOF and LC/TOF solution to our portfolio in the quarter.\r\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $560 million, this is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis.\r\nThese results are on top of 1% growth last year.\r\nThe business is benefiting from increased activity and customer labs and instrument connect rates.\r\nThis is leading to more contracted services, on-demand services and consumables consumption across all end markets.\r\nAll end markets grew mid teens or higher with the exception of environmental and forensics, but still grew 9%.\r\nThe pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business, with ACG grown each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged.\r\nOur customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends.\r\nLooking forward, instrument placements and demand bode well with continued strong performance by ACG as we drive attachment rates and increased customer lifetime value.\r\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group produced revenue of $346 million, up 44% reported and up 37% core, compared to an 8% decline last year.\r\nThe growth was broad based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP oligo business.\r\nThe ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well.\r\nThe quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily surpassing the $30 million revenue milestone, while one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing the output in a high quality manner.\r\nThis gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate of revenue with existing capacity.\r\nIn addition, the Train B manufacturing line expansion is well underway and on schedule.\r\nOur genomics instrumentation and consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter as did our pathology-related businesses.\r\nFor the first time in several quarters, we saw a diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels.\r\nWhile we are watching Delta variant very closely, to date we have not seen a meaningful negative impact on testing volumes.\r\nI also want to highlight our performance in China.\r\nWhile still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter.\r\nWe continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position.\r\nIn Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China based biopharma company.\r\nEarlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line.\r\nWe are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG product and services offerings.\r\nIn addition, the integration of Resolution Bioscience team is going well and we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast growing NGS based cancer diagnostic market.\r\nIt was a busy quarter at Agilent.\r\nSo, I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you.\r\nLast month, we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report.\r\nAt a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a company.\r\nWe've been addressing these issues since our founding more than two decades ago.\r\nI would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website.\r\nWe're also very pleased to receive recognition of the Great Place to Work in United States by the Great Place to Work Institute.\r\nThis result is just one more example of Agilent having a highly engaged and energized team, and as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market.\r\nLooking ahead, building on another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be an outstanding fiscal year 2021.\r\nAs a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance.\r\nI will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth and earnings generation.\r\nWhile the world has yet to fully emerge from a global pandemic, Agilent is well positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter.\r\nI re Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

results.\r\nGiven the continued challenging operating environment as a result of COVID-19, we are very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020, 2021 North American ski season.\r\nResults continued to improve as the season progressed, primarily as a result of stronger destination visitation at our Colorado and Utah resorts, including improved lift ticket repurchases relative to the fiscal 2021 second-quarter results.\r\ndestination, mountain resorts and regional ski areas for the third quarter was only a down 3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\r\nWhistler Blackcomb's performance continued to be negatively impacted due to the continued closure of the Canadian border to international guests, including guests from the U.S., and was further impacted by the resort closing earlier than expected on March 30, 2021, following a provincial health order issued by the government of British Columbia.\r\nWhistler Blackcomb's total visitation for the third quarter declined nearly 60% to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\r\nWhile visitation and revenue trends improved throughout the quarter, our ancillary lines of business continue to be significantly and negatively impacted by COVID-19-related capacity constraints and limitations, particularly in food and beverage and ski school.\r\nWe maintained disciplined cost controls throughout the quarter and continue operating our ancillary lines of business at reduced capacity.\r\nAs Rob mentioned, we're very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020-2021 North American ski season.\r\nAs a reminder, in the prior year, we announced the early closure of the 2019-2020 North American ski season for our ski areas, lodging properties, and retail rental stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning on March 15, 2020.\r\nThese actions had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter of 2020.\r\nAdditionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limitations and restrictions on our operations continued to have an adverse impact on our results for the third fiscal quarter of 2021.\r\nNet income attributable to Vail Resorts was $274.6 million or $6.72 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $152.5 million or $3.74 per diluted share in the prior year.\r\nResort reported EBITDA was $462.2 million in the third fiscal quarter, which compares to resort reported EBITDA of $304.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\r\nski season in the current year with particularly strong demand at our Colorado and Utah destination resorts.\r\nResort-reported EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 52%, exceeding both the prior-year period of 43.9% and fiscal 2019 third quarter of 50.2%.\r\nThese results reflect our rigorous approach to cost management, as well as a higher proportion of lift revenue relative to ancillary lines of business compared to prior periods.\r\nNow, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2021.\r\nNet income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. is expected to be between $93 million and $139 million for fiscal 2021.\r\nWe expect the resort-reported EBITDA for fiscal 2021 will be between $530 million and $570 million, and we expect the resort-reported EBITDA margin for fiscal 2021 will be approximately 28.9% using the midpoint of the guidance range.\r\nOur guidance assumes all of our operations are open and aligned with current health and safety protocols and capacity restrictions.\r\nCurrent demand trends continue.\r\nWe experienced normal weather conditions throughout the Australia's East season and North American summer season, and there is no impact from potential COVID-19-related shutdowns or lockdowns.\r\nThe guidance specifically assumes no impact from potential demand or operational disruptions associated with the current lockdowns in Victoria, Australia.\r\nWe continue to maintain significant liquidity.\r\nOur total cash and revolver availability as of April 30, 2021, was approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of cash on hand, $419 million of U.S. revolver availability under the Vail Holdings credit agreement, and $203 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement.\r\nAs of April 30, 2021, our net debt was 2.8 times trailing 12 months total reported EBITDA.\r\nWe remain confident in the strong cash flow generation and stability of our business model, and we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital with a focus on high-return capital projects, continuous investment in our people, and strategic acquisition opportunities.\r\nWhile we are not reinstating the dividend this quarter, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and our board of directors will continue to closely monitor the economic and public health outlook on a quarterly basis to assess the appropriate time to reinstate the dividend.\r\nWe're very pleased with the results for our season pass sales to date with guests showing strong enthusiasm for the enhanced value proposition of our pass products, driven in part by the 20% reduction in all pass prices for the upcoming season.\r\npass product sales through June 1, 2021, for the upcoming 2021-2022 North American ski season increased very significantly as compared to the sales through June 2, 2020, for the 2020-2021 North American ski season due to lack of any spring sales deadlines in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, making the year-over-year comparison to the spring 2020 results not relevant for performance trends.\r\nCompared to sales for the 2019-2020 North American ski season through June 4, 2019, pass product sales for the 2021-2022 season to June 1, 2021, increased approximately 50% in units and 33% in sales dollars.\r\nPass product sales are adjusted to include Peak Resorts' pass sales in both periods and eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of $0.83 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar in both periods for Whistler Blackcomb.\r\nAs a reminder, pass product sales for the full selling season through December 6, 2020, as compared to the full selling season through December 8, 2019, increased approximately 20% in units and approximately 19% in sales dollars.\r\nRelative to season-to-date pass sale products -- relative to season-to-date, pass product sales for the 2019-2020 season through June 4, 2019, we saw very strong unit growth with our renewing passholders and even stronger unit growth in new passholders, which includes guests in our database, the previously purchased lift tickets or passes that did not buy a pass in the previous season and guests who are completely new to our database.\r\nWe saw our strongest unit growth in our destination markets, particularly in the Northeast, and also had very strong growth across our local markets.\r\nCompared to the period ended June 4, 2019, effective pass price decreased 10% as compared to the 20% price decrease we implemented this year.\r\nWe believe this highlights how our lower pricing has increased the propensity of passholders to spend a portion of the new discount to purchase higher-valued pass products.\r\nWe expected that the price reduction would result in higher pass renewal rates, increased trade up to higher-value passes, and drive incremental guests to our network.\r\nWe are encouraged that each of these trends is evident in the season-to-date pass sales results, which we believe supports our expected results for next year, as well as the expected long-term benefits of increasing guest lifetime value.\r\nThe pass results exceeded our original expectations to the impact of the 20% price reduction.\r\nHowever, we still have the majority of our pass selling season ahead of us, and it is not yet clear if these trends will continue through the fall.\r\nIn addition, we are very pleased that ongoing sales of the Epic Aus Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

moved past the peak holiday period, which was constrained by capacity limitations driven by both COVID-19 and below average snow conditions, we saw improved results in January, particularly with lift ticket sales.\r\nWhile visitation trends improved throughout the quarter, our ancillary lines of business continue to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 related capacity constraints and limitation, particularly in food and beverage and ski school.\r\nWe experienced strong results in the quarter from both our local and destination guests with local visitation up slightly compared to the same period in the prior year and destination visitation proving more stable than we expected.\r\ndestination Mountain Resorts skier visit, excluding complimentary access.\r\nDespite the travel challenges associated with COVID-19, which compares to 57% in the same period in the prior year.\r\nInternational visitation, as expected, decreased significantly due to COVID-19 related travel situation.\r\nwith destination guests, including international visitors, declining to 15% of Whistler Blackcomb visits, excluding complimentary access, which compares to 48% in the same period in the prior year.\r\nOur season pass unit sales growth of 20% for fiscal year 2021, created a strong baseline demand heading into the season across our local and destination audience and will be one of the most important drivers of our performance and relative stability for the season.\r\nFor the fiscal 2021 second quarter, 71% of our visitation came from season pass-holders compared to 59% of visitation in the same period in the prior year.\r\nOur growth in pass-holders this past year also positions us well as we head into the 2021/2022 season.\r\nWe remain even more committed to the benefits advanced commitment offers our company and intend to remain aggressive in providing the best value to skiers and riders who purchase in advance of the season and continuing our strategy to move lift ticket purchases into our Pass program.\r\nWe are excited to launch our 2021/2022 lineup of Epic Pass products on March 23, 2021.\r\nWe maintained disciplined cost control throughout the quarter as we operated the business at reduced capacity.\r\nResort reported EBITDA margin for the fiscal 2021 second quarter was 40.3% compared to the prior year period of 40.9%, while resort net revenue decreased $240.1 million over the same period.\r\nAs Rob mentioned, our results for the second quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting impacts to our North American mountain

period in the prior year.\r\nAnd the decrease was primarily a result of the negative impacts of COVID-19.\r\nTurning to our season-to-date metrics for the period from the beginning of this ski season through Sunday, March 7, 2021, and for the prior year period through Sunday, March 8, 2020.\r\nThe reported ski season metrics are for our North American destination mountain resorts in the most areas

period exchange rates to the prior period for Whistler Blackcomb results.\r\nThe data mentioned in this release is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter end review and adjustments.\r\nWe continue to be pleased with the positive momentum we are seeing in demand as we begin the third quarter with visitation continuing to improve throughout the North American ski season.\r\nSeason-to-date total skier visits were down 8.2% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.\r\nSeason-to-date total lift revenue, including an allocated portion of season pass

improvement in lift ticket purchases.\r\nOur ski school, food and beverage and retail/rental businesses continue to be more significantly impacted than visitation due to the significant capacity and operating restrictions associated with COVID-19.\r\nWhile our U.S. resorts saw a material improvements in financial performance since the peak holiday period, Whistler Blackcomb's financial

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Once again, this is John Bruno.\r\nJoining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, chairman and chief executive officer; and Vince Morales, senior vice president and chief financial officer.\r\nOur comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. markets closed on Thursday, January 20, 2022.\r\nFollowing management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.\r\nNow, let me introduce PPG chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.\r\nI hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.\r\nI will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening.\r\nFor the fourth quarter, we achieved record net sales of about $4.2 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for $1.26.\r\nTo quickly summarize that quarter, we had favorable sales versus our forecast that incurred significant manufacturing challenges due to COVID-related staffing shortages, intermittent customer order patterns, and raw material supply challenges.\r\nOur adjusted earnings were aided by a lower-than-expected tax rate in the fourth quarter, as we recognized more favorable discrete items.\r\nExcluding the favorable impact from the tax rate, our adjusted earnings per share was about 10% below the financial guidance we've provided in October.\r\nOur sales performance for the fourth quarter was solid as we achieved higher than sales in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected automotive OEM global production, higher selling price realization, and strong above-market sales volumes and several of our end-use markets.\r\nOverall demand remains robust.\r\nOur PPG-Comex business delivered yet again another excellent quarter and finished with 10% organic sales growth for the full year of 2021.\r\nThis business had record sales and earnings growth for 2021 and continued to expand its concessionaire network.\r\nAnd in January, we will have 5,000 concessionaire locations in our network.\r\nAnd we recently added our traffic solutions products to its portfolio.\r\nThe protective and marine business continued its trend of strong top line results, this time led by improvements in the marine coatings where industry builds are expected to grow for the next several years.\r\nWe also continue to grow our share in automotive refinish, where our full suite of advantaged products and services differentiate PPG from our competition.\r\nAnd in automotive OEM, we were awarded new 2022 business based upon our expanded mobility product offering.\r\nAnd finally, we realized higher increased selling prices globally.\r\nLastly, the recently acquired Tikkurila business delivered record sales and earnings for any fourth quarter despite the difficult operating environment.\r\nAs I mentioned, overall sales would have been better, but we experienced continuing supply chain disruptions and a significant increase in COVID cases that hampered our ability to fully and consistently operate and prevented us from fully meeting our strong customer order books.\r\nRecently, some of our manufacturing facilities have had up to 40% of their workforce out.\r\nIn several businesses, we continue to face certain raw material shortages with the biggest impacts in U.S. architectural coatings and traffic solutions.\r\nOverall, our sales backlog grew, and in total, was about $150 million exiting the quarter, most notably in our aerospace and automotive refinish and general industrial businesses.\r\nOur segment earnings did not meet our expectations.\r\nWhile we benefited from higher sales and increased selling prices, it was not sufficient to offset significant inflation, supply disruptions, and operational inefficiencies caused by the rapid increase in COVID cases within our employee base, and those of our customers and suppliers.\r\nRaw material cost inflation was up approximately 30% compared to prior year.\r\nAnd transportation costs spiked due to shortages of available trucks and drivers.\r\nIn addition, operating costs were progressively higher during the quarter due to manufacturing interruptions at both our facilities and our customers' operations stemming from COVID.\r\nThese increased operating costs impacted the quarter by $0.20 per share, and COVID-related absenteeism has continued in January.\r\nOnce we see some normalization, we are confident that we will quickly be able to return our legacy of strong manufacturing performance.\r\nWe've been taking actions to further diversify our supplier base and increase our internal resin manufacturing capability.\r\nPPG has in-house large-scale resin manufacturing in each major region.\r\nAnd we are expanding our capability in 2022 to mitigate future risks.\r\nAs one example, PPG-Comex sources a high percentage of its residents internally, which has resulted in minimal disruptions.\r\nIn addition to the historically high level of commodity raw material prices, we're also experiencing rising costs in other areas, such as labor and utilities.\r\nWe expect to continue to proactively work with our customers to implement additional selling price increases in the first quarter.\r\nIn aggregate, our selling price realization in the fourth quarter was about 8%, with a higher price realization in our industrial reporting segment.\r\nOur price capture remains broad, with good traction in all businesses and all regions.\r\nAnd the pace of price -- excuse me, the pace of price capture is much faster than the pace of prior inflationary cycles.\r\nReflecting back to 2021, we achieved all-time record sales of $16.8 billion led by strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth of 10% despite the various ongoing supply chain challenges we incurred.\r\nIn addition, we delivered record earnings per share growth of more than 10% even with raw material cost inflation of about 20% for the full year, the highest level of coatings industry inflation in recent memory.\r\nWe, once again, lowered our SG&A as a percentage of sales, decreasing by about 200 basis points, aided by delivering $135 million in restructuring savings in 2021.\r\nWe also advanced our digital capabilities in many businesses, most notably the architectural coatings business or sales transaction on a digital platform increased by 20% compared to 2020, as we see our customers' digital patterns become more ingrained.\r\nIn 2021, we had strong accretive cash deployment, including the funding of our acquisitions, share repurchases made in the fourth quarter, and increase in our quarterly dividend for the 50th consecutive year.\r\nWe're among a small number of companies that have achieved this milestone, along with even fewer companies paying a dividend for more than 120 consecutive years.\r\nOur working capital as a percent of sales remain at historically low levels and comparable to last year, even though we purchased more raw material than typical in the fourth quarter.\r\nFinally, we have lowered our net debt by about $350 million since funding Tikkurila in June and exited 2021 with a strong balance sheet and optionality for future accretive cash deployment.\r\nThroughout 2021, we took actions to bolster our ESG program.\r\nAs an example, in the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our overall ESG corporate governance structure.\r\nWe define accountability and oversight for all major elements of our ESG efforts under respective board committees.\r\nWe also redefined and renamed our Technology and Environmental Committee to the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, with a key focus on tracking our sustainability progress and defining climate-related risks and opportunities.\r\nLooking ahead, demand continues to be robust in most of our end-use markets.\r\nTightened supply and COVID-related disruptions evidenced in the fourth quarter are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2022 impacting our ability to manufacture and deliver product.\r\nWe expect economic activity to be soft in China during the first quarter as more severe operating restrictions have recently been imposed due to COVID and du Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # PPG reported record Q4 sales of $4.2 billion, surpassing forecasts. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.26, impacted by lower-than-expected tax rates. Despite high sales, earnings missed guidance due to significant inflation (30% raw material cost increase), supply disruptions, and operational inefficiencies from COVID-related absenteeism (up to 40% in some facilities). The company experienced strong growth in PPG-Comex, protective and marine coatings, and automotive refinish. The acquired Tikkurila business also delivered record results. Challenges remain with supply chain disruptions, COVID-related absenteeism, and elevated costs (raw materials, labor, utilities), which are expected to continue into Q1. PPG plans to implement additional price increases to offset inflation. Despite these challenges, demand remains robust, and the company expects a gradual easing of supply chain issues and economic recovery in the second half of 2022. Catalysts for future earnings growth include recovery in automotive-related businesses, cost normalization, synergy capture from acquisitions, and organic growth.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We'll start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter.\r\nThen Jack will go through the operating results in the segments, our balance sheet and cash flow and guidance for the first quarter.\r\nI will then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session.\r\nBut before we proceed, Jack will now cover the safe harbor language.\r\nThese statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs.\r\nDuring our earnings call in October, we talked about signs of recovery in the third quarter.\r\nPleased to say we saw this trend of slow and steady recovery continuing into the fourth quarter.\r\nDespite experiencing a series of new COVID-19-related restrictions around the world, our results reflect a stronger market environment than we had anticipated with revenue growth and new opportunities in select markets.\r\nWe're now seeing clear signs of a case shaped to speed recovery.\r\nThe bifurcation is evident between industries able to adjust to the uncertain environment than others like travel, hospitality and entertainment industries being significantly impacted by the lockdowns.\r\nThis is also reflected in the labor market divide where demand for workers has improved in some industries and in others remain stalled with high unemployment rates.\r\nOrganizations investing in digitization and automation are already emerging stronger.\r\nAnd that is driving an acceleration in the polarization of the workforce between the skilled and the unskilled, creating a risk of continued post-pandemic skills-based polarization of labor markets in many countries.\r\nThis is also captured in our recent Skills Revolution thought leadership series, Renew, Reskill and Redeploy, conducted across 26,000 employers in 40-plus countries.\r\nThose companies that plan to speed up the digitization plans as a result of the pandemic are maintaining or increasing their headcount in contrast to others who've put their plans on hold.\r\nMany of the trends we've been predicting have accelerated significantly.\r\nAdversity can often be a force for society to change at an accelerated pace.\r\nCompanies have digitized better speed and scale they could never have imagined and we expect these actions will continue into 2021.\r\nWith that context, I would now like to turn to our financial results.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue was $5.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year in constant currency, a significant improvement from the 14% decline in the third quarter on the same basis.\r\nOn a reported basis, we recorded an operating profit for the quarter of $138 million.\r\nExcluding restructuring charges, operating profit was $151 million, down 24% in constant currency.\r\nReported operating profit margin was 2.7%, down 100 basis points from the prior year.\r\nAnd after excluding restructuring, operating profit margin was 3%, down 70 basis points from the prior year.\r\nReported earnings per diluted share of $1.33 reflects the impact of restructuring charges.\r\nExcluding the restructuring charges, our earnings per diluted share was $1.48 for the quarter, representing a decrease of 39% in constant currency.\r\nTurning to the full year results for a moment.\r\nReported earnings per share for the year was $0.41.\r\nExcluding restructuring charges and special items, earnings per share was $3.67 and represented a constant currency decrease of 53% year-over-year.\r\nRevenues for the year decreased 14% in constant currency to $18 billion and reported operating profit was $188 million.\r\nExcluding restructuring and special items, operating profit was $377 million, which represented a 48% constant currency decline year-over-year.\r\nAlthough 2020 was one of the most challenging years in recent history, we were able to reduce operational SG&A to significantly offset gross profit declines while remaining committed to our strategic investments for digitization, diversification and innovation.\r\nIn our Manpower business, logistics demand was strong in the fourth quarter driven by the shift in how consumers are buying and an extended holiday delivery peak.\r\nWhile we are seeing increases -- increasing cases of COVID-19 in several places, we're also seeing strong safety protocols, increased

decline of 24% on a constant currency basis.\r\nThis resulted in an operating profit margin of 3% before restructuring charges, which was above the high end of our guidance.\r\nBreaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail.\r\nAfter adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 4%, our constant currency revenue declined about 6.5%, which rounds to 6% on a single-digit percentage basis.\r\nAs acquisition and billing days had no net effects, the organic days adjusted revenue decline was also about 6.5%.\r\nThis represented an improvement from the third quarter revenue decline of 15% on a similar basis and two consecutive quarters of significant improvement from the second quarter of 2020.\r\nTurning to the earnings per share bridge on slide five.\r\nOn a reported basis, earnings per share was $1.33, which included the restructuring charges of $12 million, which, including related tax impacts, represented a negative $0.15.\r\nExcluding the restructuring charges, earnings per share was $1.48, which exceeded our guidance range.\r\nIncluded within this result was improved operational performance of $0.38; better-than-expected foreign currency exchange rates, which added $0.03; a lower weighted average share count from share repurchases that added $0.02, offset by higher other expenses that had a negative impact of

Dave Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chemed; and Nick Westfall President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed's VITAS Healthcare Corporation subsidiary.\r\nSherri is retiring at the end of the year, and this is her last introduction to our quarterly conference call.\r\nI will begin with highlights for the quarter.\r\nAnd David and Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.\r\nOur third quarter 2021 operating results released last night, reflect very solid performance for both VITAS and Roto-Rooter.\r\nOn a go-forward basis, I would like to share with you some of the macro issues we are dealing with as we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic.\r\nFor VITAS, the most important issue, we are managing labor.\r\nStaffing of license professionals has been exceptionally challenging to ensure adequate mix of license healthcare workers on a market by market basis.\r\nThis is particularly challenging during the pandemic, as we deal with dynamic fluctuations in patient census in every market.\r\nTurnover within our license staff remains above our pre-pandemic rates, but we are seeing indications of normalization, as we continue to expand our hiring and retention initiatives in many markets.\r\nBeyond managing our staffing levels, we are observing increasing pressure on salaries and wages.\r\nTo date, we've managed these pressures with increased paid time off or PTO, we view it as inevitable that healthcare wages will increase if we continue to have a nationwide systemic imbalance in supply and demand for license healthcare professionals.\r\nFortunately, for VITAS and the hospice industry, there is a natural hedge against the inflationary pressures on costs, specifically labor.\r\nThe annual increase in the Medicare and Medicaid hospice reimbursement rates is based primarily on inflation in the hospital wage index basket, as measured by the federal government's Bureau of Labor Statistics.\r\nTypically, the annual inflation measured as of March 31 is used to determine the following October 1 reimbursement increase.\r\nThis should give the hospice industry reasonable stability in operating margins in an inflationary environment, albeit with a six month lag from the inflation measurement to the actual reimbursement increase.\r\nThe second critical challenge for VITAS is the continued disruption to senior housing occupancy and the latest hospice referrals.\r\nA recent admission data suggests senior housing is in the process of recovery pre-pandemic nursing home base patients represented 18% of our total average daily census or ADC.\r\nThe nursing of ADC ratio hit a low of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2021.\r\nIn the second quarter of 2021 nursing home base patients increased 60 basis points to 14.9%.\r\nAnd then, the third quarter of 2021, our nursing home patients represented 15.6% of our total ABC.\r\nOur updated 2021 guidance anticipates sequential improvement in senior housing base patients in the fourth quarter of 2021 with acceleration in senior housing admissions anticipated in 2022.\r\nFor Roto Rooter, our must significant challenge has been to increase manpower.\r\nWe've expanded technician manpower by 8% in 2021.\r\nHowever, based on our current demand levels, we continue to remain understaffed in many of our markets.\r\nTechnician compensation plays a role in recruiting new employees as well as retention of our existing employee base.\r\nOur average 2021 technician and field sales force compensation is over $81,000 per year.\r\nMost of our technicians are paid out on a commission basis of revenue generated.\r\nAs a result, pricing for our services is a critical component in increasing technician wages.\r\nWe're anticipating passing to inflationary price increases in all our markets in the fourth quarter of this year.\r\nDemand for plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, and water restoration services remain at record levels.\r\nI want to give additional color on the depth and breadth of this increase in demand.\r\nLet's compare Q3 2021 revenue to Q3 2019.\r\nExcluding the HSW acquisition, which was completed in September 2019, under this unit for unit comparison, residential services have experienced incredible growth.\r\nIn aggregate, residential branch revenue increased 46.2% over this two-year period.\r\nOn a service segment basis, residential plumbing revenue increased 37.1%; drain cleaning expanded 36%; excavation increased 65.6%; and water restoration increased 48.1%.\r\nCommercial demand has been more challenging, however, commercial revenue has experienced a significant recovery since the 40% decline in commercial demand noted in April 2020.\r\nOverall, commercial revenue declined 3.1% over this 2-year period.\r\nOn an individual service segment basis, commercial plumbing service declined 4.9%, drain cleaning expanded 1.8% excavation declined 10.2%, and water restoration increased 7%.\r\nWe anticipate continued strengthening in commercial demand in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as throughout 2022.\r\nOver the past 20 years, the country has faced 9/11, the Great Recession, and now a global pandemic.\r\nIn each of these crises, Roto-Rooter remained operating and materially increased market share revenue and operating margin.\r\nJust as important, post-crisis, Roto-Rooter held on to these increases in revenue market share and margins.\r\nRoto-Rooter is well positioned postpaid pandemic, and we anticipate continued expansion of market share, by pressing our core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time, 24-7 call centers and Internet presence.\r\nWith that, I would like to turn the teleconference over to David.\r\nVITAS's net revenue was $317 million in the third quarter of 2021, which is a decline of 5.8% when compared to the prior year period.\r\nThis revenue decline is comprised primarily of a 5.3% decline in days of care, partially offset by a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase, including the suspension of sequestration of approximately 1.2%.\r\nOur acuity mix shift had a net impact of reducing revenue approximately $3 million or nine-tenths of 1% in the quarter, when compared to the prior-year revenue and level of care mix.\r\nThe combination of Medicare Cap and other contra-revenue changes, negatively impacted revenue growth, an additional 80 basis points.\r\nVITAS accrued $100,000 in Medicare Cap billing limitations in the quarter.\r\nThis compares to $4.1 million reversal of Medicare Cap billing limitations in the third quarter of 2020.\r\nOf our 30 Medicare provider numbers, 27 of these provider numbers currently have a Medicare Cap cushion of 10% or greater.\r\nOne provider number has a cap cushion between 0% and 5%.\r\nAnd two of our provider numbers have a fiscal 2021 Medicare Cap billing limitation liability.\r\nRoto-Rooter, generated quarterly revenue of $221 million in the third quarter of 2021, which is an increase of $30.1 million or 15.7% when compared to the prior year quarter.\r\nRoto-Rooter's branch residential revenue in the quarter totaled $151 million, which is an increase of $22.2 million or 17.2% over our prior year period.\r\nThis aggregate residential revenue growth consisted of drain cleaning, increasing 11.7%, plumbing expanding 17.4%, excavation increasing 14.1%, and water restoration increasing 28%.\r\nRoto-Rooter branch commercial revenue in the quarter totaled $52.3 million, which is an increase of $4.7 million or 10% over the prior year.\r\nThe aggregate commercial revenue growth consisted of drain cleaning increasing 17.6%, plumbing increasing 9.3%, and commercial exc Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials to our website at allstateinvestors.com.\r\nOur management team is here to provide perspective on these results.\r\nLet's start on slide two.\r\nSo this is Allstate's strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before.\r\nWe have two components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand the protection solution.\r\nThose are the two ovals you see on the left with the intersection between them.\r\nThe key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel.\r\nProperty-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%.\r\nAllstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers.\r\nAs a result, we now have almost 192 million policies in force across the enterprise.\r\nFinancially, the results were more mixed.\r\nRevenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter.\r\nUnderwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs in settling auto insurance claims.\r\nWe've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss cost, and Transformative Growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes.\r\nThis was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return programs that include significant reinsurance recoverables.\r\nThey were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income.\r\nCapital deployment results were excellent, with $1.5 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter.\r\nWe also completed the divestitures of our two largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week.\r\nSo let's go to slide three.\r\nRevenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both the higher earned -- National General acquisition, Allstate brand, homeowners premium growth and higher net investment income.\r\nProperty-Liability premiums and policies in force increased 13.5% and 12.5%, respectively.\r\nNet investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost about $300 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio.\r\nNet income was $508 million in the quarter, and that's compared to $1 billion in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income.\r\nAdjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and it's decreased $683 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs.\r\nNet income for the first nine months of 2021 was below the prior year, and that's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business, which we reported earlier in the year.\r\nAdjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first nine months, and that was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses [Technical Issues] more than offset higher loss costs.\r\nWhat I would do is put the pandemic in a longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results, and it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do.\r\nBut before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruption, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic.\r\nSo in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from, really, governments around the world.\r\nThe impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents.\r\nAnd of course, due to this unprecedented driver in frequency, we proactively provided our customers with some money back, which increased customer retention.\r\nSince then, since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed and severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefit.\r\nNevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary Shelter-in-Place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction and took some modest overall reductions in rate levels.\r\nThis year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency with large percentage increases.\r\nAnd while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below prepandemic levels, the national and general nonstandard business is back to the levels before the pandemic.\r\nAuto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption, and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts, and Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides.\r\nFrom a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases in auto insurance prices.\r\nFrom a growth standpoint, at the onset of the pandemic, we began to see a material increase in the consumer acceptance telematics, and we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile, and that's led to substantial increase in our telematics product.\r\nNow the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio, and this is the tale of the beginning and the end as well.\r\nSo early in the crisis, equity valuations were down, and this had a negative impact on investment results.\r\nThen, of course, on -- and we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade really investing in these kinds of funds.\r\nAnd so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's three, five or 10 years.\r\nBut -- so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity valuations going up, and our returns have come back strongly.\r\nIn the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio.\r\nBut of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter.\r\nAnd many of our other businesses have been impacted some positively, some negatively, but it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder value.\r\nSo Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how Transformative Growth positions of Allstate for continued success.\r\nLet's move to slide five to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter.\r\nThe recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter.\r\nThis was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as well as higher catastrophe losses and non catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates.\r\nThe chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\r\nAs you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity.\r\nHigher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart had a negative 1.4 point impact on the combined ratio as favorable reserve reestimates recorded in 2020 from wildfire subrogation settlements positively impacted the prior year quarter.\r\nGross catastrophe losses were higher but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrating the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program.\r\nNoncatastrophe prior year reserve strengthening of $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points primar Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%, and Protection Plans saw a 12.5% growth. Net income, however, decreased from the previous year's quarter due to higher auto insurance loss costs, which were partly offset by increased investment income and reinsurance recoveries. The company implemented price increases to address the rising loss costs and continues to focus on expense reduction through its Transformative Growth initiative. Allstate Protection Services experienced revenue and profit growth, and net investment income was significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to strong performance-based income. The company's balance sheet remained strong, allowing for significant cash returns to shareholders and the acquisition of SafeAuto to further increase market share.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n On the call today are Signet's CEO, Gina Drosos; and chief financial and strategy officer, Joan Hilson.\r\nAny statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.\r\nDuring the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nFor further discussion of those as well as reconciliations of them to GAAP measures, investors should review the news release we posted on our site at signetjewelers.com/investors.\r\nFirst, let me begin by sending our thoughts and prayers to our colleagues and partners who were in the wake of Ida.\r\nWe hope you and your loved ones are all safe and sound.\r\nNow on the quarter.\r\nOur performance this quarter reflects continued momentum in our Inspiring Brilliance transformation to maximize jewelry category strength and capture market share over the last year.\r\nSpecifically, we are advancing and better integrating our banner value propositions, product newness, always on marketing and connected commerce experiences.\r\nOur team continues to accelerate our transformation and delight new and loyal customers through their passion, dedication and expanding capabilities and talents.\r\nIt's an honor to work alongside them.\r\nThere are three key messages that I'd like to leave you with today.\r\nFirst, we outperformed expectations and are raising our fiscal '22 guidance.\r\nData-driven insights and our bespoke research capabilities enabled our team to quickly identify and make the most of changing consumer trends.\r\nSecond, our Inspiring Brilliance strategies are working in an integrated manner.\r\nOur continued refinement of our banner value propositions are serving distinct customers with differentiated product assortments and experiences.\r\nOur Connected Commerce strategy is increasingly enabling more consumers to shop with us whenever, however and wherever they want.\r\nAnd third, we are continuing to strengthen our culture of innovation and agility.\r\nAnd our team members are embracing new capabilities with excellence.\r\nBy investing in our people and attracting the best talent across industries, our people and culture are becoming an even stronger competitive advantage.\r\nNow let me share some highlights from the second quarter.\r\nWe delivered total sales of $1.8 billion this quarter.\r\nThat's a same-store sales improvement of 97.4% compared to last year.\r\nWe're pleased with this performance but are also mindful that we didn't meaningfully reopen our stores until about two-thirds of the way through the second quarter last year.\r\nA better indicator of our performance is the comparison to two years ago, when our fleet was fully operational.\r\nOn that basis, this quarter represents same-store sales growth of 38.1%.\r\nTotal revenue was nearly $425 million higher than two years ago despite having roughly 450 fewer stores, a 16% reduction in store count.\r\nThis performance points to the importance of both Connected Commerce and our store footprint optimization.\r\nAs we continue to transform our operating model, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% this quarter, representing an 860 basis point improvement compared to this time two years ago.\r\nAs a result of this strong momentum, our view of the back half is more positive than it was a few months ago, particularly for the third quarter.\r\nWe are seeing a delay in the anticipated shift of spending toward travel and experiences, which we believe is primarily related to the COVID Delta variant.\r\nWhile we continue to put the health and safety of both our employees and customers first, we don't anticipate significant store closures in the back half of the fiscal year.\r\nThese factors are why we're raising our guidance today, reflecting second quarter outperformance and third quarter momentum while remaining cautious given potential macro headwinds.\r\nTo explain our second-quarter performance, it's important to point out how our Inspiring Brilliance strategies are enabling our team to stay agile and create competitive opportunities.\r\nWhile category tailwinds existed in Q2, it was our differentiated assortments that resonated with customers, our Connected Commerce capabilities that increased conversion and our always on targeted marketing that all worked in combination to deliver strong growth this quarter.\r\nRecall that the Inspiring Brilliance phase of our transformation is built on four where-to-play strategies: winning in our biggest businesses, accelerating services, expanding accessible luxury and value and leading in digital commerce.\r\nAs we aim to win in our big businesses, we focused on leaning into four consumer trends that our data identified early and our team worked to quickly execute against.\r\nThe first of these trends is strong consumer confidence.\r\nWhile this index took a step back in August, it was heightened throughout our second quarter and remains similar to levels earlier this year.\r\nConfidence is highest among millennials and higher-income customers.\r\nOur recent research also shows that 80% of U.S. consumers believe they are the same or better off economically today than they were before the pandemic.\r\nWe've responded by providing additions to our assortments that offer higher-quality pieces at higher price points.\r\nThe second trend is gifting at higher price points as customers continue to celebrate those closest to them.\r\nWe identified this trend early and leaned into it at Valentine's Day and again at Mother's Day.\r\nIn the week leading up to Mother's Day, we drove brick-and-mortar same-store sales growth of more than 30% to two years ago, with average transaction value up 18%.\r\nSimilarly, growth in eCommerce over the same time period was more than 90%, showing that our Connected Commerce experience is resonating, both in store and online.\r\nThe third trend is higher self-purchasing among both women and men.\r\nCustomers are seeking ways to express themselves by spending discretionary dollars on better quality pieces that both hold their value over time and reflect their personal style.\r\nopen and now available at sales.\r\nThis new 60-piece collection is a testament to Serena's self-love and strength and has been met with strong initial customer response.\r\nAnother good example is our decision to expand the fashion assortment available through James Allen.\r\nWhile still a relatively small portion of its overall sales, James Allen's second quarter fashion sales were up more than threefold to this time two years ago.\r\nThe fourth trend I'd like to highlight is the rising tide of engagements.\r\nOur research indicates 15% of committed couples or approximately 2.3 million couples plan to get engaged this calendar year, which is up high single digits to a typical prepandemic year.\r\nAs a company, we have tremendous expertise in providing customers with education and counsel, both in store and online, which builds trust on such an important decision.\r\nCustomers are responding as we saw total sales of our bridal category increased over $150 million or 25% this quarter to two years ago.\r\nWhile our strategies are working together to respond to these trends, I think the continued refinement of our banner differentiation shines brightest here.\r\nRecall that while our banners are well positioned to serve any customer journey, each of them is best positioned to serve a specific one.\r\nFor example, our data analytics on Kay shows that new customers are 700 basis points more likely to be on a milestone gifting and holiday or holiday purchase journey, aligning with Kay's target of the generous sentimentalist.\r\nMeanwhile, Zales continues to refine their approach to attract the bold statement maker, and we can measure our progress.\r\nZales' new customers in the first half of the year are 400 basis points more likely to be on a self-purchase journey than two years ago.\r\nOne of the ways that we've driven this differentiation is through the continued refinement of our assortment.\r\nThis includes engagement rings at Kay with the larger cen Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The company attributed its success to its Inspiring Brilliance strategy, which includes differentiating its banners, expanding its product offerings to meet changing consumer trends, and enhancing its Connected Commerce capabilities. Signet observed increased demand for higher-priced jewelry, self-purchasing, and engagement rings, driven by positive consumer confidence and a rise in the number of planned engagements. The company's Connected Commerce initiatives, such as online ordering with in-store pickup and virtual consulting, are gaining traction, particularly in the bridal category. Signet remains cautious about potential headwinds, including inflationary pressures and concerns over COVID-19 variants.

two, our connected commerce presence; three, data analytics capability; four, financial flexibility; and five, scale.\r\nWe've built these strategic advantages through a series of investments and innovation that we continue to build upon.\r\nFor example, we've made significant progress differentiating our banner value propositions with distinctive marketing campaigns and unique product assortments, delivering 14% sales growth in bridal and over 30% growth in fashion.\r\nWe've invested in connected commerce capabilities that now exist in virtually every part of our business.\r\nThis is reflected in capabilities such as seamless virtual and in-store consulting, asynchronous chat, product visualization, buy online pick up in store, ship from store, curbside delivery, same-day delivery, and more.\r\nWe've streamlined our fleet, enabling us to serve customers across channels, while also leveraging fixed costs as we drive the top line.\r\nWe've eliminated consumer credit risk from our balance sheet, enabling us to focus entirely on jewelry retail leadership, while offering a broader array of payment options that continue to gain traction.\r\nBy leveraging third-party expertise and focusing on what we do best, our financial services transformation is increasingly an enabler of customer acquisition and satisfaction.\r\nWe've also eliminated costs the customer doesn't see or care about.\r\nOur expected cumulative four-year savings is now over $400 million through the end of fiscal '22.\r\nOne example of how we're doing this is our data-driven labor model that enables us to dynamically plan staffing needs; store-by-store, hour-by-hour, delivering a 75% improvement in productivity compared to this time two years ago.\r\nAnd we've improved inventory turns 50% by defining our product assortment more precisely by banner and by providing a much broader range of fulfillment options.\r\nWe are becoming the consumer-inspired data-driven jewelry leader and innovator that we aim to be.\r\nGiven the very uncertain environment today, we are mindful of the challenges still ahead of us.\r\nThat said, Joan and I would like to use our review of Q3 and our look ahead at Q4 to show how the advantages we've created are driving our performance and growth and positioning us for a strong holiday this year and beyond within all the factors we can control.\r\nLet's look first at how we're leaning into holiday earlier than ever.\r\nOur research indicates that roughly 25% of shoppers finished their holiday shopping before Black Friday this year, up from 17% a year ago.\r\nThis trend is being driven by concerns about out of stocks, which we anticipated and planned for.\r\nWe took action months ago to ensure that our holiday assortment would be stronger and available earlier than ever before.\r\nWe pulled forward our premarket qualification of new merchandise, strengthened our core assortments, leaned into trends, identified in our research, and placed orders a month or more earlier than we typically do.\r\nWe also prepared for continuing increases in digital sales and connected commerce this holiday.\r\nAt this time last year, our jewelry consultants were providing new experiences like curbside pickup and virtual consultations to provide our customers a safe and convenient shopping experience.\r\nThis year, we've improved the customer experience, allowing customers to select curbside service online during checkout and stay connected to the store throughout the process from purchase to receipt to pick up.\r\nAnd we've expanded curbside delivery to more than 800 stores.\r\nWe're offering ship from store at 1,850 stores, five times more than last year.\r\nAnd we're offering buy online pick up in store at 2,100 locations.\r\nIn addition, we've enhanced our distribution capabilities particularly by building in a layer of surge capacity to fulfill customer e-commerce orders on our busiest days.\r\nThis is a good demonstration of the ongoing transformation at scale we're striving for.\r\nLast year, we increased our e-commerce supply chain capability fivefold.\r\nThis year, we're building on that foundation, increasing the capacity of our distribution centers again, nearly 25% more than last year, and adding a nationwide fleet of local distribution centers with our ship-from-store capability.\r\nWe're working to extend these distribution advantages even further in the coming year.\r\nWe're building an AI-driven digital simulation of our entire supply chain.\r\nThis digital twin will enhance our planning with scenarios that identify potential issues before they occur, giving us insights that enable us to provide faster delivery while driving cost efficiency.\r\nWe're also improving our employee experience to maximize our advantages in talent and staffing.\r\nWe increased our hourly wage this year, significantly expanded benefits to respond to the changing needs of our team members, and have continued to invest in training, development, and career growth.\r\nIn addition, we continue to leverage the power of our purpose, inspiring love and our innovative agile culture to strengthen our team's pride, motivation, and performance.\r\nThese and other efforts are making a difference.\r\nWe've seen a 60% decrease in new employee turnover during their first two months at a time when turnover continues to top the headlines across retail.\r\nThis is important because tenure matters in the jewelry category, where expertise and personal relationships lead to lifetime value.\r\nIn fact, a jewelry consultant with at least one year of tenure achieves on average, 60% more sales than a  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Signet delivered a record-breaking third quarter, with total sales of $1.5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.43. The company's strong performance was driven by increased connected commerce capabilities, improved advertising, and a more efficient operating model. Notably, the company saw a 19% increase in same-store sales compared to the previous year and anticipates continued growth in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales estimates ranging from 6% to 9%. Signet's financial strength has led to improved liquidity and working capital management, enabling it to invest in strategic initiatives and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company remains confident in the sustainability of its growth, citing fundamental changes in its operating model, including data analytics, banner portfolio differentiation, improved inventory management, and cost savings. Despite ongoing challenges, Signet believes it is well-positioned for a strong holiday season.</s>"}

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n President and CEO, Dennis Vermillion; Executive Vice President, Treasurer and CFO, Mark Thies; Senior Vice President, External Affairs and Chief Customer Officer, Kevin Christie; and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, Ryan Krasselt.\r\nOur consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter of 2019.\r\nFor the full year, consolidated earnings were $1.90 per diluted share for 2020 compared to $2.97 last year.\r\nNow, I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.\r\nAs we begin 2021 continuing to work through the COVID pandemic, we hope you're staying safe and healthy.\r\nLooking back on the last year, I'm just so proud of our employees for navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic, continuing to provide energy like they always do to our customers and progressing our business plans forward.\r\nWe continue to help those who are struggling and most in need in our communities.\r\nIn 2020, Avista and the Avista Foundation provided more than $4 million in charitable giving to support the increased need for services that community agencies are still experiencing throughout the areas we serve.\r\nFinancially, our earnings for 2020 were better than expectations, and Mark will provide further details here in just a few minutes.\r\nOperationally, we finished installing nearly all of our smart meters, electric smart meters and natural gas modules across Washington in one of the largest projects in our history.\r\nThe deployment of this infrastructure will provide customers with more real-time data, so they can better manage their energy use.\r\nThe technology enables us to proactively push high energy alerts to notify customers, if they could exceed their preset energy budgets, which of course, helps eliminate surprises when their bill arrives at the end of the month.\r\nBeyond generating bills, we're using the data from smart meters to run a more reliable and efficient power grid and to deliver a higher level of service for our customers.\r\nFor example, we now have more visibility into our system, which allows us to detect and restore power outages more quickly.\r\nWe also made strides to meeting our clean energy goals, as the Rattlesnake Flat Wind Farm went online last December.\r\nDuring its construction the project created clean energy jobs for our local communities and now that it's completed the project's 20 -- project's 57 wind turbines excuse me will provide 50 average megawatts of clean renewable energy for our customers at an affordable price.\r\nThat's enough energy to power 38,000 homes for years to come.\r\nAs wildfires continue to have an impact on our region we implemented a new comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that aims to improve defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system.\r\nWe expect to invest about $330 million implementing the components of this plan over the life of the plan, which as I said was 10 years.\r\nWe were proud to announce yesterday that Avista has been recognized again as one of the 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices.\r\nThis marks the second year in a row that Avista has achieved this distinction.\r\nWe are only one of nine honorees recognized in the energy and utilities industry based on their assessment.\r\nIn 2021, 135 honorees in total were recognized spanning 22 countries and 47 industries.\r\nIn January, we published Avista's 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report on our avistacorp.com website and I urge you to check it out when you have some time.\r\nThis content provides a broad look at our operations and how we're fulfilling our commitments to our people, our customers, our communities and our shareholders.\r\nThe website also provides links to Avista's reporting on a series of industry and financial ESG disclosures.\r\nThe updated content supports Avista's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility and sharing this information with our stakeholders.\r\nSwitching gears with respect to regulatory filings, in January we filed two-year general rate cases in Idaho.\r\nAnd as you know in 2020 we filed general rate cases in Washington.\r\nAnd we continue to work through the regulatory processes in both of these jurisdictions.\r\nWe take our responsibility to provide safe, reliable energy at an affordable price very seriously.\r\nAnd we work hard to make prudent financial investments in our infrastructure, manage our costs and identify ways to best serve our customers that contribute to keeping energy prices low.\r\nFor example, our proposed tax customer credit would completely offset an immediate increase in electric and natural gas bills for our Washington customers.\r\nIn Oregon new rates went into effect on January 16 of this year and we expect to file another rate case in the second half of 2021 in Oregon.\r\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on running a great utility and continue to invest prudent capital to maintain and update our infrastructure and provide reliable energy service to our customers.\r\nWe are initiating our 2021, 2022 and 2023 earnings guidance with consolidated ranges of a $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2021, $2.18 to $2.38 in 2022 and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share for 2023.\r\nThis puts us on track to earning our allowed return by 2023.\r\nLastly, earlier this month the board increased our dividend by 4.3% to an annual dividend of $1.69 per share and a dividend increase approved by the board marks the 19 consecutive year the board has raised the dividend for our shareholders, and I believe it demonstrates the board's commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\r\nWe had low expectations coming into this year.\r\nNo, not the company, the Blackhawks and the Blackhawks have really started off pretty good after a slow first four games.\r\nWe've had five rookies score their first goals ever in the NHL, so pretty exciting times for all you hockey fans out there.\r\nFor the company in the fourth quarter, Avista Utilities contributed $0.81 per diluted share compared to $0.67 last year.\r\nOur earnings increased primarily due to higher utility margin and customer growth.\r\nAlso in the fourth quarter, the Oregon and Washington Commissions joined the Idaho Commission to allow for the deferral of certain COVID-19 related expenses for future -- possible future recovery.\r\nAdditionally, Avista Utilities earnings were better than expectations due to higher utility margin and lower income taxes, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.\r\nWith respect to COVID-19, as I mentioned earlier, we have now received accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions to defer the costs and benefits associated with COVID-19.\r\nAnd those will be addressed in future proceedings with each of those commissions.\r\nWe expect a gradual economic recovery that will still have some depressed load and customer growth in '21.\r\nWe expect that to start improving in the second half of '21, our economy.\r\nWe do have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which mitigate the impacts of changes in load for our residential and certain commercial customers.\r\nOver 90% of our revenue, as you recall, is covered by regulatory mechanisms.\r\nAs Dennis mentioned, we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure.\r\nWe expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be about $415 million and at AEL&P we expect about $7 million and about $15 million in our other businesses.\r\nWith respect to our liquidity, as of December 31, we have $270 million of available liquidity under our committed credit line at Avista Utilities and in 2020 we issued about $72 million in stock in 2020.\r\nIn '21 we expect to issue about $75 million of equity or stock and up to $120 million of long-term debt.\r\nAs Dennis mentioned, we are initiating guidance not only for 2021 but also for 2022 and 2023.\r\nAnd as we mentioned those ranges, this is to get us back to Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n A copy of which is available on our Investor Relations website at www.\r\nDuring the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow.\r\nLastly, there are two items that have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website for your reference.\r\nTo ensure our disclosures are consistent, these slides provide the same details as they have historically, and as I have said, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\r\nWith these formalities out of the way, I'm joined by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer.\r\nMollie, can you hear me OK?\r\nLet me start with a couple of preliminary remarks before we get into it.\r\nSo I apologize for the inconvenience and want to express our appreciation for you all, juggling your calendars to be here.\r\nSecond, my second point was going to be, I thought a positive point.\r\nI was going to, maybe for the first time ever, begin to talk a little positively on the COVID situation.\r\nAnd I was going to express my hope that we are finally, in many places around the world and I hope where you are, starting to see some movement toward the normality.\r\nI still hope that, but I think the events in the Ukraine in the last little while, remind us that the hope to normality, unfortunately, is not just limited to COVID.\r\nSo I wish many good wishes to you and any colleagues, family, friends who are affected by that situation.\r\nLet me turn to what I think is a much more positive set of messages.\r\nAs I'm sure many of you have by now have already seen, 2021 was another terrific year in the face of the global pandemic, and as we'll talk about, the worst restructuring market in probably the last 15 years, we delivered another record year.\r\nAnd let me stress that word another.\r\nWe've now had 7 years in a row of adjusted earnings per share growth.\r\n7 years in a row in the face of COVID, fluctuating restructuring markets, turning around core strategies, expanding geographies, entering new adjacencies, lumpiness from big jobs coming or going, heightened competition, and attracting talent among lots of other challenges.\r\n7 years in a row of growth in adjusted EPS, which is the easiest thing to measure, but also, to me, far more important in the underlying drivers of those financial results.\r\nThe talent level of our organization, the ambition of it, the energy, the commitment of our people, the leadership, the number of great assignments we are working on, the client relationships we forged, and the enhancement of our reputation that all those factors have driven.\r\nWe don't have a single business that has guaranteed automatic growth every quarter.\r\nIn fact, if you look back over these several years, many of our teams in sub businesses during this period were down multiple quarters in a row, as they face difficult markets or made big investments, or had big jobs end.\r\nWhat I believe our results have shown is that over any extended period of time, those short-term factors don't matter.\r\nRather over any extended period of time when our teams do the right things, they control our destiny.\r\nWe create our own future.\r\nOver time, we have shown ourselves able to attract great talent to support the growth of that talent in our organization, to double down and reinforce core positions in core markets, to expand into new adjacencies, and as a consequence of all that, make ourselves ever better able to serve our clients, to build our businesses, to build our brand.\r\nIt is that commitment, those efforts by our leaders and our teams that have allowed us to grow seven years in a row.\r\nAnd over those last four years -- in the last four years of that, in the face of good markets and bad markets, to average double-digit organic top-line growth.\r\nTo me, that demonstrates something important.\r\nIt demonstrates that FTI is not the cork on the restructuring wave that some described us as when I joined.\r\nRather, I think our teams have shown that when we do the right things, we have multiple, multiple businesses that are each powerful growth engines, engines that, of course, can get buffeted by markets or other short-term factors over any extended period of time, engines that could plow through markets, plow through them and find their way toward success in attracting and developing talent, success in brand building assignments and success in financial results.\r\nOver the past several years, I believe we've seen examples of that in every business.\r\nThis year, in the resilience of CF, the comeback of FLC in some parts of Econ business, in the last several years, the extraordinary performance of our tech business following the strategic changes they made five years ago or the performance of our stratcom business over now seven years.\r\nAnd I think the story is similar, if you think about it instead of by segment but by geography.\r\nJust think about the challenges our teams had of taking on difficult positions in, say, Australia or LATAM.\r\nThey were not small, nor is the challenge of conquering new markets in Europe.\r\nBut that's why I think our teams very much deserve the sense of excitement and pride that they have when they turned those platforms positions into platforms for growth.\r\nFor the second point, let me pick up on that word platform.\r\nWhat I'd like to underscore is that to me, the successes we have been having are not the end, but rather the beginning.\r\nThe success we've had has left us with powerful platforms that we can leverage going forward to extend that growth, to build upon it.\r\nThe success we've had in stability now to bet boldly in Germany and France, in The Netherlands, in China, in the Middle East, and in other places in a way that we could never have done a few years ago.\r\nIt gives us the ability to invest behind that successful tech business and that successful Stratcom business to drive our investigations business, to grow all those non-restructuring services in CorpFin, and in the face of a slow restructuring market to commit to continue to grow that business, to extend that global leadership, confident that it will eventually pay off in a big way and brand assignments in leadership positions in attracting great talent.\r\nTo me, to my knowledge, this company has never had such a rich set of opportunities before it as we do today.\r\nAnd that brings me to the third point to preview something Ajay will discuss, which is there's always near-term risk in these sorts of investments.\r\nLet me spend a minute on that.\r\nAs you know, our investments are typically in hiring.\r\nIf one instead buys a company, the investment shows up in its capital.\r\nIf on the other hand, you hire a lot of people, it shows up in EBITDA.\r\nThis year, our ambition is to have the highest organic growth rate during my tenure and I guess is during the company's entire history, the highest organic growth rate.\r\nThere is no way to make those sorts of bold bets without facing some short-term financial risk.\r\nAnd if you want to underscore some of the negatives, we're making those bets at a time when our most profitable business, our restructuring business, is facing market demand that is lower than it's been in 15 years according to one measure and 20 years according to another measure.\r\nAnd we no longer have the rollover of the large restructuring jobs from the early parts of the 2020.\r\nAnd we're facing compensation pressure due to wage inflation in a tight talent market.\r\nAnd at the same time, we're expecting rising SG&A expenses due to a rebound in travel expenses post COVID, as well as investments in infrastructure, to support the growth.\r\nSo one can get worried about the number of bets we're making.\r\nOne could wonder in the face of that, could we cut back on our bets.\r\nOf course, we could.\r\nBut let me underscor Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We have posted to www.\r\nI hope you're staying safe and healthy.\r\nWe are pleased to kick off today's call by reporting that we've rounded the corner into positive growth.\r\nWe had extremely strong results top and bottom line and continue to make very good progress on several of our strategic initiatives.\r\nOrganic growth for the second quarter was a positive 24.4%.\r\nThis growth was broad based across our agencies, geographies, disciplines, and client sectors.\r\nWe experienced a significant increase in spend from existing clients as the effects of the pandemic subsided and we benefited from strong new business wins.\r\nEBIT was $568 million in the quarter, an increase of 67% versus the second quarter of 2020.\r\nQ2 2021 included a gain of $50.5 million from the sale of ICON International in early June.\r\nIn Q2 2020, EBIT included $278 million of charges related to the repositioning actions.\r\nExcluding gains and charges, EBIT margin was 14.5% in the quarter compared to 12.2% in Q2 2020.\r\nPhil will provide further details on expected impact of the sale of ICON on our results for the balance of the year.\r\nAs we stated on our last call, we view 2019 as a reasonable proxy for our ongoing margin expectations.\r\nExcluding the sale of ICON, our six months 2021 EBIT margin was 14% which is in line with our EBIT margin of 13.9% for the first six months of 2019.\r\nNet income was $348 million in the second quarter, an increase of 75% from the second quarter of 2020 and earnings per share was $1.60 per share, an increase of 74%.\r\nThe net impact on the gain on the sale of ICON, which was offset by an interest expense charge related to the early retirement of debt increased earnings per share in Q2 2021 by $0.14 per share.\r\nOur leaders took difficult and effective actions over the past year and a half.\r\nAt the same time, they remained laser-focused on the health of their teams, servicing our clients, winning new business, and managing their cost structures.\r\nOur ability to navigate in this environment and come out the other side with such strong results is a testament to their commitment as well as the dedication and tireless effort of our people around the world.\r\nTurning now to our performance by geography.\r\nEvery region had double-digit growth in the quarter.\r\nThe U.S. was up just shy of 20% in the quarter.\r\nAll U.S. disciplines had double-digit growth except for healthcare, which was up in the low-single digits.\r\nIt was the one discipline that grew in Q2 of 2020.\r\nOther North America was up 37.1%, the U.K. was up 23.8% with all disciplines in double-digits.\r\nOverall growth in the Euro and non-Euro region was 34.5%.\r\nIn Asia Pacific, we had 27.9% increase with all major countries experiencing double-digit growth.\r\nOur events business in China had another quarter of strong performance.\r\nLatin America was up 20.8% and the Middle East and Africa increased 42.8%.\r\nBy discipline, all areas were up year-over-year as follows: Advertising and media 29.8%; CRM Precision Marketing, 25%; CRM Commerce and Brand Consultancy 15.2%; CRM Experiential 53%; CRM Execution and Support 22.7%; PR 15.1% and Healthcare 4.5%.\r\nLooking forward, we expect to continue to see positive organic growth as client spend increases albeit at a slower pace than we experienced in Q2.\r\nOur management teams are continuing to align costs with our revenues as markets reopen around the world.\r\nMany of our companies are hiring staff to service an increasing client spend and the new business wins and we are seeing some pressure on our staff costs, particularly in the U.S. as the labor markets remain tight.\r\nWe are also beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend as government restrictions have eased.\r\nBased on our use of technology during the pandemic, we are developing practices, particularly with respect to travel that should allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in addressable spend.\r\nWe expect that the increase in addressable spend in the second half of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce.\r\nTurning to our cash flow, we again performed very strongly.\r\nFor the first half of the year, we generated approximately $800 million in free cash flow.\r\nAs we indicated last quarter, in addition to our dividend increase, in May, our Board approved the reinstatement of our share repurchase program.\r\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $102 million in shares.\r\nWe took further actions to reduce our debt during the quarter.\r\nIn late April, we issued $800 million of senior notes due in 2031.\r\nThe proceeds from this issuance together with cash on hand were used to repay $1.25 billion of senior notes due in 2022.\r\nAs a result of these actions, our balance sheet and credit ratings remain very strong.\r\nWhile we are very optimistic about our future prospects, we remain vigilant and are maintaining flexibility in our planning as conditions can quickly change.\r\nAs we recently experienced in markets like Brazil, India, and Japan, the pandemic remains a significant health risk.\r\nOverall, we are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and proud of how we've navigated through the pandemic.\r\nOur results reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to changes in the market and deliver through down economic cycles.\r\nLet me now turn to the progress on our strategic and operational initiatives.\r\nAs I mentioned in early June, we completed the sale of ICON International, our specialty media business.\r\nThe divestiture was part of our continuing realignment of portfolio of businesses and is consistent with our plan to dispose of companies that are no longer aligned with our long-term strategies and investment priorities.\r\nWith the closing of this transaction, we are substantially complete with disposals.\r\nWe expect our primary focus moving forward will be on pursuing accretive acquisitions in the areas of precision marketing, market [Phonetic] and digital transformation, commerce, media and healthcare.\r\nWe have ramped up our M&A efforts in these areas and are pleased with the opportunities we are seeing.\r\nWe remain disciplined with respect to our strategic approach and valuation parameters.\r\nOperationally, Omnicom continues to successfully deliver to our clients a comprehensive suite of marketing and communication services supported by technology and analytic capabilities around the world.\r\nThe leaders of our practice area agencies and global clients have used this formula to strengthen our relationships and grow with existing clients as well as pursue new business.\r\nImportantly, our organization allows our leadership teams to quickly mobilize our assets to deliver strategic solutions for our clients from across the group.\r\nWhether their need is for integrated services across regions or more bespoke individualized solutions in specific countries, we can simplify and organize our services in a manner that meets our clients' needs.\r\nFor example, we have a long history of providing integrated services to some of the world's largest brands such as Apple, AT&T, Nissan, and State Farm and we continue to be successful in winning new business.\r\nA good example of this is our win with Philips who named Omnicom as their global integrated service partner for creative, media and communications.\r\nOver months long and highly competitive pitch, we were able to demonstrate the strength of our agencies and the delivery model that connects creativity, culture, and technology to position Philips as a leader in the changing health industry.\r\nAnother example of our integrated creative, media and communications offerings is our recent win of the baby wipes brand WaterWipes.\r\nWe also serve clients and consistently win new business across dedicated service areas and geographies.\r\nFor example, some of the wins this quarter in addition to the ones mentioned above were BBDO being named global lead strategic and creative agency partner for the Fa Please summarize this transcript in

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to our investors.\r\nThese measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.\r\nPlease consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.\r\nContinuing with a clear focus on our business recovery, Barnes Group produced another solid quarter of year-over-year and sequential improvement in orders, organic sales, operating margins and earnings.\r\nWith total backlog at its highest point since the end of 2019, expanding revenue outlook, strengthening industrial end markets and the progressing aerospace environment, we feel confident about the prospects for the second half of the year.\r\nMore importantly, our improving financial results continue to be supported by significant investments in growth initiatives, that position us to sustain performance over the long-term.\r\nIn the second quarter, organic sales were up 31% with sizable gains in both our operating segments.\r\nIndustrial was particularly strong, while Aerospace continues to build momentum after the significant effects of the pandemic on that industry.\r\nSimilarly, orders were very good as we generated a book-to-bill of 1.3 times, with Aerospace driving that result.\r\nOur total backlog stands at $984 million at quarter-end, reflecting a 12% increase from the end of the first quarter.\r\nAdjusted operating income and margins were up 41% and 40 bps respectively.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share were $0.45, up 67% from last year.\r\nAgain, really great results by the team.\r\nMoving now to a discussion of end-market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.\r\nOur Industrial segment generated another strong quarter with each of our businesses generating excellent year-over-year organic orders and revenue growth.\r\nFor the segment, orders were up 37% organically with a book-to-bill of approximately 1 times.\r\nIndustrial sales grew 42% with organic sales growth of 35%.\r\nOf note, second quarter total industrial sales were ahead of pre-COVID second quarter of 2019.\r\nAs a macro level backdrop like last quarter manufacturing PMIs in the U.S. and Euro zone remains strong, with China in the expansion territory, though not as robust as the other regions.\r\nNow with expanding the ongoing semiconductor issue that's dampening automotive bills, IHS predicts -- still predicts 2021 global production to be up 10% over the last year and up an additional 11% in 2022.\r\nWith respect to new platform launches and major refresh programs of light vehicles, 2021, 2022 and 2023 are forecast to be sustained at a healthy level.\r\nWithin our Molding Solutions business, we saw a good orders quarter up 17% organically.\r\nAutomotive, Packaging and Personal Care, each saw double-digit orders growth, with Automotive being particularly strong.\r\nMedical mold orders took a dip in the quarter, not an unusual dynamic as these large ticket products can be somewhat lumpy.\r\nOrganic sales were up 22% year-over-year, while sequential sales were up 13%.\r\nOn many occasions, you've heard me talk about investments in growth that we're making across the businesses to drive our sales and marketing efforts, innovation, and new product development.\r\nRecently I discussed the launch of our new vacuum gripper technology in our Automation business.\r\nAt Molding Solutions, we are also working hard to expand our leading technology-based solutions across multiple end markets.\r\nA prime example relative to the public health crisis we've all experienced over the last year or so, is our mold technology serving the global medical market and our investment and development of a new product offering known as Pipette Tips.\r\nPipette tips are a high volume critical item used in the world of laboratory diagnostics for collecting a precise amount of liquid and transferring it to a test apparatus.\r\nThis market has expanded recently in order to meet the enormous demand brought on by the pandemic.\r\nOur customers require a technology-based solution that consistently delivers high output rates with extremely tight tolerances.\r\nThe pipette tip's geometry must be precise to ensure the test results are both accurate and reliable.\r\nOur Molding Solutions business has developed a mold concept, specifically for production of pipette tips, which not only meets strict technical requirements, but also focuses on superior reliability, and ease of maintenance.\r\nTo maximize up time in an operation that runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the configuration of the mold allows for required maintenance of worn parts to occur right on the machine to replaceable modular units or clusters allowing for minimum disruption and production to come quickly back online.\r\nDelivering leading technology-based solutions such as the pipette tip mold system, and focusing on customer success allows our Molding Solutions business to demonstrate extraordinary value.\r\nTo close my Molding Solutions comments, our sales outlook has improved once again, as we now forecast organic sales growth in the mid-teens, a bit better than our prior view.\r\nAt Force and Motion control organic orders were up over 50% with organic sales up double digits.\r\nFMC's two major end markets, sheet metal forming and general industrial, both saw robust orders and sales growth.\r\nOn a sequential basis, sales increased 6%.\r\nWe continue to see full-year 2021 organic sales growth to be up mid-teens.\r\nEngineered Components once again generated high double-digit organic orders and revenue growth on a year-over-year basis.\r\nSequentially, we saw a modest step in orders and sales as automotive semiconductor issues weigh on automotive end markets.\r\nAs a result of this issue, we saw our second quarter revenue impact of approximately $5 million, very much aligned with the exposure we disclosed in April.\r\nWe expect the third quarter semiconductor revenue impact of $3 million and another $1 million in the fourth quarter.\r\nOur general industrial markets remained very healthy and are helping to mitigate some of the impact.\r\nOur outlook for organic sales growth is now forecast to be up in high-teens, a step up from our prior view of mid-teens growth.\r\nAt Automation, as economies rebound, the migration toward industrial robotics, a more complex end-of-arm tooling solutions continues to be favorable.\r\nOn a year-over-year basis, organic orders and sales growth were well into the double digits.\r\nSequential growth in orders and sales also continues along a healthy trend.\r\nWe now expect 2021 to deliver organic growth of approximately 20%, better than our April expectation of mid-teens growth.\r\nTo wrap up on Industrial, clearly our year-over-year growth rates across the segment compared favorably to last year's second quarter, which was the trough quarter relative to the impact of the pandemic.\r\nComparables gets more difficult over the next few quarters, though we expect to perform well.\r\nAt Industrial, we see 2021 organic growth in the mid-teens with operating margins of 12% to 13%.\r\nOur margin expectation is down slightly as we continue to make strategic investments in our people, products and systems.\r\nHowever, we view these investments as critical to setting us up for long-term growth and profitability.\r\nAdditionally, in the near-term, we are managing supply chain challenges, which Julie will address in a moment.\r\nIt's fair to say that the environment continues to improve.\r\nAirbus and Boeing narrow-body production levels are anticipated to increase meaningfully, although wide-body recovery is still a way off.\r\nGlobal traffic and capacity trends are improving and that all bodes well for a strengthening aftermarket.\r\nAt the segment level we've been seeing good sequential sales growth and expect that trend to continue.\r\nAnd beginning this quarter, we'll see favorable year-over-year comparisons as we move through the year.\r\nAerospace sales improved  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Now, what a difference a year makes.\r\nLast April was rather dark I think for all of us and May, with the George Floyd tragedy, was hopeless and, boy, I'll tell you this -- the Company has rebounded tremendously.\r\nAnd in particular our colleagues have shown incredible resilience over the past year.\r\nI'm proud of our colleagues, I'm proud of our Company, what we've accomplished and our performance amid the continuing echo of change in this post-pandemic world.\r\nWe are the world's premier organizational consultancy.\r\nThere is no question about that.\r\nWe're meeting the key objectives that we discussed last quarter, which included diversifying our offerings, capitalizing on our leadership and relevant solutions, driving an integrated go-to-market strategy, advancing our position as a premier career destination and pursuing transformational opportunities at the intersection of talent and strategy.\r\nAnd all of this is translating to what I believe is outstanding performance.\r\nDuring the quarter we generated about $555 million in fee revenue.\r\nIt was an all-time high that was up 26% year-over-year.\r\nOur profitability was strong.\r\nWe had an adjusted EBITDA margin of a little over 20% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21.\r\nWe've clearly accelerated through the turn and it's a testament to the pivot we made and the agility of our colleagues over this past year.\r\nThe diversity and relevance of our offerings and our ability to deliver our consulting services in a virtual world have helped clients achieve organizational opportunities and our Company deliver strong financial results.\r\nIn this new world there is tangible opportunity for Korn Ferry.\r\nThe center of gravity for today's workforce is shifting from a place of work to a location for collaboration.\r\nIt's no longer about the where, it's all about the why and how work gets done differently.\r\nAlmost every company on the planet is reimagining and will have to continue to reimagine its business from its strategy to its people to its culture.\r\nQuite simply, companies are rethinking their organizational structure, roles and responsibilities, how they compensate, how they motivate, how they engage, how they develop their workforce, let alone the type of agile talent they hire and how they hire that talent and they're going to need to lead differently.\r\nGone are the days of vertical leadership that focuses on driving results up the chain.\r\nToday companies need more horizontal leadership.\r\nThat's all about leading across the enterprise.\r\nAnd these changes align with Korn Ferry's businesses.\r\nWhether it's M&A services, change management, virtual sales effectiveness or customer experience services, Korn Ferry is poised to seize this opportunity.\r\nWe've also used this time of change as an opportunity to reimagine our own business.\r\nIn a post-pandemic world and beyond, we're delivering an integrated value change, digitally enabled and delivered.\r\nTo deliver this at scale, we're bringing everything together in a digital framework.\r\nAll this makes our world-class IP even more relevant and unique.\r\nTo fulfill our vision and position our Company for long-term success, we remain relentlessly focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients.\r\nNumber one, we're driving an integrated solutions based go-to-market approach through our marquee and regional accounts.\r\nThat not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but it's also key to more scalable and durable revenues.\r\nWe have about 350 marquee and regional global accounts and they continue to demonstrate the power of this strategy.\r\nThe accounts, they generated about $640 million in fee revenue during the year and they sustainably utilize all of our global capabilities even during challenging economic periods.\r\nToday the fight for talent is more profound than ever.\r\nThe pandemic shakeout is driving a robust market for our talent acquisition expertise, capabilities and approach and we're helping companies find the right talent, fitting the right need, from senior level executives, the board members to professional level talent.\r\nAnd looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we've been actively marrying our capabilities with today's megatrends.\r\nThe result is larger projects with greater sustainability and more durable revenue.\r\nRight now, we're seeing high areas of demand in D&I and organizational transformation as well as our core solutions such as assessment, pay and governance and leadership and professional development.\r\nWe indeed have a lot of opportunity in front of us.\r\nWe've become a much different company with a broader and deeper mix of business.\r\nImportantly, we're translating the value we are creating for our clients and the returns for our shareholders.\r\nAs part of our balanced capital allocation framework, I'm pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share.\r\nLooking to the fiscal year ahead, I truly feel we have the right strategy with the right people at the right time to help our clients drive performance in this new world.\r\nBob, it's over to you.\r\nOur fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the relevance and importance of our human capital solutions in the rapidly evolving business environment that we find ourselves in.\r\nIt also validates our strategy and highlights the strength and durability of our business model.\r\nBy all measures, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter in our history with record revenue and profitability.\r\nOur new business in the fourth quarter was also a record and it actually accelerated throughout the quarter, leaving us well positioned for growth in fiscal '22.\r\nNow before I jump into the actual results for the quarter, I want to talk about a couple of proof points that we have shared with you in the past that really continue to demonstrate the success of our strategy.\r\nFirst, our overall business has demonstrated more resilience than at any other time in our history and just by way of example, in just three quarters from our COVID recession trough, we've achieved new all-time highs in new business revenue and profitability.\r\nIn contrast, coming out of the great recession, approximately 10 years ago, it took over 12 quarters for fee revenue to rebound past the prior pre-recession high.\r\nOur second marquee and regional account program that Gary talked about, really continues to add value, providing a steady, strong growing stream of fee revenue for our firm.\r\nFor all of fiscal year '21, 35.3% of our consolidated fee revenue was generated from these accounts.\r\nFurther, our year-over-year fee revenue on marquee and regional accounts was essentially flat, while the rest of the Company was down about 9%.\r\nFor new business, our marquee and regional accounts were actually up 11% year-over-year while the rest of the Company was flat.\r\nAnd finally, our success driving cross line of business referrals continues to grow.\r\nJust over three years ago cross line of business fee revenue referrals were approximately 15%.\r\nToday, fee revenue from cross line of business referral stands at almost 27% for all of fiscal '21 and almost 29% for the fourth quarter.\r\nNow let's turn to some important highlights of our fourth quarter.\r\nAs Gary mentioned, fee revenue in the fourth quarter was up $115 million year-over-year and $80 million sequentially, reaching an all-time high of $555 million.\r\nGrowth continued to be broad-based with fee revenue improving sequentially for the third consecutive quarter in each of our lines of business.\r\nRecent growth trends for our flagship talent acquisition businesses have been particularly strong.\r\nConsolidated fee revenue growth in the fourth quarter measured year-over-year was up 26% with Executive Search being up 20%, RPO and Pro Search up 46% and Consulting up 27%, all reaching new all-time quarterly fee revenue highs.\r\nNew business growth in the fourth quarter was also very strong with all business lines generating new busin Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm on the Slide 2 of the of the deck for those of you following along.\r\nSo, a couple of months ago, we held our first Investor Day as Raytheon Technologies and that day we laid out our 2025 goals to deliver strong top line growth, margin expansion and at least $10 billion in free cash flow by 2025, all while continuing to invest in our businesses and return significant cash to our shareowners.\r\nWe continue to be confident in the future because of our strong franchises, the resilient markets in which we operate, our innovative technologies, and our relentless focus on operational excellence and cost reduction, which will drive margin expansion and strong cash flows into the future.\r\nAnd we continue to see encouraging trends across our market.\r\nOur confidence in our ability to achieve these targets remain strong and as you saw at the end of May, the Department of Defense released the fiscal year '22 budget request, which was generally in line with our expectations with respect to our portfolio of products and the investments we're making in differentiated technologies, including missile defense, space-based systems, next-generation propulsion and hypersonics.\r\nMajor RTX programs fared well as -- overall as modernization funding remains at near historic highs.\r\nRequested funding for these programs is favorable to the overall DoD modernization request when compared to last year's plan for fiscal year '22.\r\nIt's also worth noting that the overall classified funding request, which supports a significant part of our Intelligence & Space portfolio was also very well supported.\r\nSo I'd say we're well positioned with the administration's priorities, driven by our innovative technologies and capabilities to address the evolving threat environment.\r\nThis is demonstrated of course by the significant awards we received this quarter, which included over $1 billion in classified bookings at RIS and two important franchise wins in our Missiles & Defense business where we were awarded almost $2 billion for the Long-Range Standoff weapon or LRSO, and $1.3 billion for the Next-Generation Interceptor.\r\nA thing also we should note that the Patriot franchise remains robust as evidenced by Switzerland becoming the 18th partner nation to select the Patriot air defense system.\r\nAt the same time, commercial air traffic demand continues to gain momentum across many of our domestic markets as global economies reopen and vaccinations increase.\r\nIn the U.S. daily travelers throughout the TSA checkpoints have averaged over $2 million per day in July, and that's more than doubled since January of this year.\r\nThat said, we are monitoring the COVID variants and the impact on travel and there's still work to do on global vaccinations and on international border reopenings.\r\nStrong execution against an increasingly favorable backdrop enabled us to deliver top and bottom line growth on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis.\r\nSo given our performance year-to-date and the recent trends across our end markets, we're going to raise the low end of our full year sales outlook by $500 million to a new range of $64.4 billion to $65.4 billion.\r\nAnd we're also going to raise and tighten our adjusted earnings per share outlook with a new range of $3.85 to $4 per share and we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to a range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion for the year.\r\nI'm pleased with the strong orders we saw in the quarter, which grew our company backlog to a record $152 billion and that's a 3% increase since the first quarter.\r\nOur defense book-to-bill was a strong 1.12 resulting in a defense backlog of over $66 billion and commercial backlog increased by $3.5 billion in the quarter.\r\nOn the capital allocation front, we repurchased $632 million on shares bringing us to over $1 billion in share repurchase year-to-date and we're on track to meet our commitment of buying back at least $2 billion of shares for the year.\r\nWe also continue to execute on the merger integration activities and given our substantial progress and the robust pipeline of opportunities, we're going to raise our gross cost synergy target by another $200 million to $1.5 billion and that $1.5 billion will be realized in the four -- first four years following the merger.\r\nThat's now 50% more than our original synergy commitment and there's great execution by the team but I would tell you, we're not done yet.\r\nLike everything, there's always more to do.\r\nIn addition to making good progress in our synergy targets, we're also making significant progress on our structural cost reduction projects, which you've heard about back in our May meeting.\r\nWe have a pipeline with hundreds of opportunities including the previously announced actions that we're working across the business.\r\nLet me just give you a couple of examples of what we are doing.\r\nAnd our Collins Aerostructures business has scheduled over 125 lean events this year, and they're focused on specifically reducing the takt time, labor time for the A320neo nacelle.\r\nWe've invested in lean events such as these throughout the pandemic because they've allowed the Aerostructures business to reduce nacelle manufacturing time by over 75%.\r\nOf course, though our normal goal here is about an 87% learning curve, these lean events allow us to exceed that in incredible ways.\r\nAt Pratt, we continue to build on the overhaul capability and drive turnaround time across the geared turbofan network.\r\nThe team has made good progress this year, demonstrated a 15% turnaround time, an improvement over the past year.\r\nBut importantly, they're on track to drive a 30% reduction by the end of this year.\r\nThese improvements are the direct result to repair infrastructure development and additional productivity improvements across the network, including the application of lean principles in their sharp design as well as automation.\r\nOur strong culture of operational excellence is enabled of course, by the core operating system and significant investments in digital technology and other strategic projects.\r\nAltogether, these initiatives will save over $5 billion in cost through 2025.\r\nSo you can see the market fundamentals are strong, we're laser focused on operational excellence and our key franchises are driving strong financial performance.\r\nI'm on Slide 4.\r\nAs you could expect, I'm pleased with where we landed for the quarter.\r\nWe exceeded our expectations for both adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.\r\nSales were $15.9 billion, which was at the high end of our outlook range and up 10% organically versus prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis and up 4% sequentially.\r\nOur strong performance was driven by the momentum in commercial aerospace and continued growth in defense.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.03 was ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by commercial aftermarket and contract-related settlements at Collins but also better than expected performance at Pratt, RIS and RMD.\r\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.69 per share and included $0.34 of acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or nonrecurring items.\r\nFree cash flow of $966 million exceeded our expectations primarily due to the continuation of better than expected collections and lower than expected capital expenditures.\r\nBefore I hand it over to Jennifer, let me give you a little color on our synergy progress.\r\nWe achieved $185 million of incremental gross cost synergies in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date savings to $390 million and given the pace that we realize these synergies on to-date, we're increasing our 2021 cost synergy target by $50 million, which brings our new target to the year -- for the year to $660 million.\r\nCollins also achieved nearly $50 million of further acquisition synergies in the quarter, bringing total Rockwell Collins acquisition-related savings to nearly $560 million since the deal closed in November of 2018, and we now ex Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Raytheon Technologies reported strong financial results for Q2 2021, exceeding expectations for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. The company's sales reached $15.9 billion, up 10% organically, driven by the resurgence in commercial aerospace and continued growth in defense. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 benefited from commercial aftermarket surge, contract-related settlements, and better-than-expected performance in several segments. Raytheon raised its full-year sales outlook to $64.4-$65.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share range to $3.85-$4.00, reflecting improved commercial aftermarket volumes, cost reductions, and a favorable tax optimization. The company also increased its synergy target to $1.5 billion and reported strong bookings and backlogs across its defense segments. Despite strong demand in domestic markets, international air traffic recovery remains slower than anticipated, impacting commercial aftermarket growth expectations. However, Raytheon remains optimistic about its ability to grow its defense businesses, capitalize on its strong franchises, and achieve operational excellence through cost reduction initiatives.</s>"}

increased operating income by 237%.\r\nThese outcomes are especially a reflection of the extraordinary Winnebago Industries team who continue to deliver time after time while leading with our values in all they do.\r\nOur teammates are truly our greatest asset, and we are very focused together as one enterprise organization on creating tremendous value for our end customers, channel partners, communities, and shareholders.\r\nIn addition to our employees and their impressive agility, Winnebago Industries continued growth and successful execution is attributable to three other key drivers: number one, our leading portfolio of premium outdoor brands, Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar and Chris-Craft; second, Winnebago Industries' ongoing commitment to operate with excellence and deliver exceptional quality, innovation and service in everything we do; and lastly, a win-win partnership mentality with our valued dealer network to create and sustain strong consumer demand for our leading portfolio of outdoor products.\r\nWhile we have undoubtedly been active via acquisitions in the last four-plus years, fiscal-year 2021 quarter 2 represents a truly organic year-over-year comparison in total performance.\r\nThe second quarter of fiscal-year 2020 was the first full quarter in which Newmar's luxury Motorhome line was included in our world-class portfolio.\r\nOne year later, we continue to nurture the tremendous appeal of Newmar's growing product lineup and its relentless focus on craftsmanship, quality, and customer care.\r\nOur collective enterprise results in the second quarter of fiscal-year 2021 validate a strong, complete, full-line RV strategy is now in place here at our company, and premium organic portfolio of RV brands are positioned to compete vigorously in the years ahead.\r\nNow, there is a distinct strategic cause-and-effect linkage between our premium brands, our golden threads of quality, innovation, and service, and the strong financial results that are being shared with all of you today.\r\nDifferentiation and strong value can drive sustained market and financial performance.\r\nThat is and will always be our goal.\r\nAdditionally, our team's ability to navigate constantly challenging environments related to component cost and availability is on display through our numbers as well.\r\nWe took and will take actions to ensure our pricing reflects both the surging demand for our premium brands, but also the input cost inflation that is expected in the coming quarters.\r\nOur ability to sell products at attractive margins and continued low levels of discounting seen across the RV industry contributed to our profitability performance in the quarter and continues to reinforce our brand strength with dealers and end consumers.\r\nAnd as importantly, our enterprisewide commitment to operational excellence, productivity, continuous improvement, strategic sourcing, etc.\r\n, was also a significant driver of our performance and resulted in strong second-quarter profitability.\r\nAs a result, our consolidated second-quarter gross margin of 18.6% represents an increase of 590 basis points versus last year.\r\nWe are passionate about driving operational leverage within the business and maximizing the return from our current assets.\r\nOur manufacturing processes are running daily at peak levels as the supply chain allows.\r\nAnd executing against an increasingly robust order backlog to replenish, as quickly as possible, inventories for our dealer partners.\r\nThe shift we made in the back half of fiscal-year 2020 to fully build to confirm dealer order production in our Winnebago-branded RV businesses continues to serve us well in terms of profitability and working capital management.\r\nWhile demand-driven supply chain challenges regularly impact our production, particularly in Class A Motorhomes, we will constantly work with our supply partners to manage any future disruptions as best we can.\r\nOur Q2 results demonstrate that supply network is assisting an incredible year-over-year production volume increase.\r\nAnd for that, we are appreciative, maintaining gratefulness in context.\r\nBut we also continue to be restrained from hitting full manufacturing potential given almost daily component availability challenges.\r\nQuarter 2 lost net sales due to sourcing constraints was easily eight figures across the portfolio.\r\nThat revenue opportunity remains inherent in our potential as we transition into quarter 3.\r\nThe third major driver of our fiscal-year 2021 second-quarter performance was sustained strong consumer demand for our products, both as wholesale appetite from our dealers, but especially at retail with end consumers.\r\nWe are not seeing any significant decline in retail momentum and outdoor product demand as we turn into the spring 2021 selling season.\r\nSSI results are often a lagging incomplete barometer of the retail health in the industry.\r\nAnd our company's retail numbers in the first two to three weeks of March have actually shown sustained strength and even an uptick in certain categories.\r\nThe RV and marine industry have succeeded in comping effectively over a somewhat normal pre-pandemic period in early calendar 2020.\r\nIn the next three months of 2021, March through May, which is our quarter 3, we'll see strong retail and wholesale comparisons versus a period of intense marketplace disruption a year ago.\r\nThroughout the pandemic, we have proven our resilience and ability to execute during difficult macroeconomic and large-scale health crisis conditions just as Winnebago Industries has continued to expand our reach during other challenging periods in our history.\r\nCurrently, we are experiencing a flattening of seasonality of wholesale and at retail.\r\nOur calendar 2021 January and February retail sales were similar to our November and December performance, underscoring that even through the typically slower winter months, consumers are excited about our brands and intent on securing the product they need to have extraordinary experiences with family and friends this summer.\r\nThe strong demand undercurrent we are seeing presently has meaningful implications on our business now, as well as over the long term.\r\nWelcoming new entrants to the outdoor lifestyle allows Winnebago Industries the opportunity to capture significant customer lifetime value that our portfolio provides.\r\nFirst-time buyers of both Motorhomes and Towables tend to gravitate toward value models.\r\nBy delivering our golden threads of quality, innovation, and service, as well as the breadth of premium products for families to grow into over time, we are cultivating a broad growing pipeline of Winnebago Industries consumers as they upgrade, on average, every three- to five-year-olds when staying within the lifestyle.\r\nAs we continue to persevere and grow our business, we have also made it a priority to enhance and advance our corporate respons Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

projections.\r\nTime-sensitive information provided during today's call, which is occurring on July 27, 2021, may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay.\r\nLast quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full-year guidance.\r\nNow more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations.\r\nIn the second quarter, we achieved an operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion.\r\nFirst and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model.\r\nIn addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work, and driving sustainability through our business model.\r\nOur very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model, led us to increase our full-year guidance once again.\r\nThe size of our revisions in each of these first two quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings-producing potential of our strategy.\r\nIn the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses.\r\nWith all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms.\r\nAt the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy.\r\nOur efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business' best ever financial performance by a considerable margin.\r\nWe've made substantial progress in derisking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model.\r\nWe've also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business.\r\nAt our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs.\r\nThese investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end-market demands.\r\nFor example, we're now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bales, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types.\r\nThe capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material.\r\nOverall, our investment in recycling technology -- our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns, and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network.\r\nSustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years, so I want to take some time to highlight how we're advancing our sustainability journey.\r\nAt the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as senior vice president and chief sustainability officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under one umbrella.\r\nWe believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework.\r\nOur supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations.\r\nNext month, we're hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for one or more of the 45 companies participating in the event.\r\nThis three-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers.\r\nAnd finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers' experience.\r\nIn the past, I've mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers' orders and reduces our cost to serve.\r\nThrough our advanced technology, we're eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer account, allowing the setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed.\r\nThis will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction.\r\nThis more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing.\r\nWe are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service.\r\nOur customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers while, at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs.\r\nWe expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come.\r\nIn conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling, and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year.\r\nOur focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen.\r\nAnd we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook.\r\nWe're pleased with the excellent second-quarter results we achieved across our business.\r\nWe produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic's steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nCollection and disposal volume climbed 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations.\r\nAnd our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second-quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%.\r\nTurning more specifically to our volume results.\r\nRobust recovery in our highest-margin businesses, commercial, industrial, and landfill, drove our very strong performance.\r\nIn the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels, and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic.\r\nWhile we're very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume impr Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

[/INST] # Waste Management's second quarter performance was exceptional, driven by strong volume growth (9.6%), yield (3.7%), and pricing that offset inflationary pressures. The company's collection and disposal business led the way, with 24% EBITDA growth, while the recycling business set records. Integration of the Advanced Disposal acquisition is progressing well, with $30 million of annual synergies captured so far. WM raised its full-year guidance once again, projecting revenue growth of 15.5%-16%, adjusted operating EBITDA of $5 billion to $5.1 billion (an increase of $225 million), and free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Despite elevated cost inflation, the company expects to overcome these pressures through increased operating efficiencies and pricing programs.

also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\r\nI'll make some brief comments about our third-quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities.\r\nLet me start with some third-quarter highlights.\r\nWe earned $5.1 billion or $1.17 per common share in the third quarter.\r\nThese results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to improve.\r\nRevenue declined on lower gains from equity securities, which were elevated in the second quarter, though still strong.\r\nExpenses continue to decline, reflecting progress on our efficiency initiatives and included $250 million associated with the September OCC enforcement action.\r\nAnd for the first time since first-quarter 2020, we grew both period-end loans and deposits in the third quarter.\r\nWe continue to see that our customers have significant liquidity and consumers are continuing to spend.\r\nWhile lower than the peak in March, our consumer customers' median deposit balances continued to remain above pre-pandemic levels, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus and 40 -- I'm sorry, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus and 40% higher for those who did not receive federal aid.\r\nWeekly debit card spend during the third quarter was up every week compared to 2019 and in the week ending October 1 was up 14% compared to 2020 and 26% compared to 2019.\r\nAreas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered, including travel, up 2%; entertainment, up 39%; and restaurant spending, up 20% during the week ending October 1 compared with 2019.\r\nConsumer credit card spending activity continued to increase, up 18% in the third quarter compared to 2019 and 24% compared to 2020.\r\nDuring the week ended October 1, travel-related spending, which was hardest hit during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020 but remains the only category that is not yet fully rebounded to 2019 levels, still down 8% compared to 2019.\r\nCommercial banking loans were up slightly at the end of the third quarter, while line utilization was stable at historic lows.\r\nSupply chain difficulties and labor shortages continue to represent significant challenges for our client base.\r\nAnd as I said earlier, overall credit performance continued to be strong.\r\nNow let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities.\r\nFirst, building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure has been and remains Wells Fargo's top priority.\r\nWe reached a significant milestone with the termination of the CFPB consent order issued in September 2016 regarding improper retail sales practices.\r\nIts expiration reflects years of hard work by employees across Wells Fargo, intended to ensure that the conduct at the core of the CFPB order will not recur.\r\nAs a reminder, this is the second important regulatory milestone we achieved this year with the OCC terminating a consent order related to our BSA/AML compliance program in January.\r\nBut the recent OCC actions are a reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when I arrived must remain our top priority.\r\nI believe we're making meaningful progress, and I remain confident in our ability to close the remaining gaps over the next several years.\r\nHaving said that, it continues to be the case that we are likely to have setbacks along the way.\r\nWe are a different bank today than we were several years ago.\r\nWe run the company with greater oversight, transparency, and operational disciplines.\r\nWe have a new leadership team.\r\n15 of 18 operating committee members are now new to their roles.\r\nI've spoken of our new leaders in many of our control functions, but we also have many new business leaders.\r\nThis includes new leaders in consumer banking, small business banking, auto lending, home lending, credit card, merchant services, retail services, and personal lending, digital, strategy, wealth and investment management, and commercial banking.\r\nOur control infrastructure is different, and we continue to invest in it.\r\nWe take a different approach to the consumer today.\r\nWe created a sales practice oversight and management function and an Office of Consumer Practices.\r\nOur approach to consumer remediation is dramatically different as we have meaningfully increased the amount paid to consumers and have accelerated payments to customers.\r\nWhile we are committed to devoting the resources necessary to our risk and regulatory work, we are also focused on improving the products and services we offer.\r\nWe're making investments in digital capabilities and making it easier for customers to do business with us.\r\nIn the third quarter, we announced our new long-term digital infrastructure strategy that will move us to a multi-cloud environment.\r\nThis is a critical step in our multiyear journey to be digital-first and offer easier-to-use products and services.\r\nWe also joined AutoFi's North American network to provide car buyers and dealers with fast and easy online sales and financing.\r\nAnd as I've spoken about previously, we're on track to roll out a new consumer mobile app at the beginning of next year.\r\nWe've also been making significant enhancements to our payments capabilities and are seeing that momentum pull through on our customers' Zelle usage, with Zelle users increasing 24%, transactions up 50%, and volumes are up 56% from a year ago.\r\nWe're executing on our work to simplify our products and build compelling offerings tailored to different customer segments.\r\nClear Access, our no-fee overdraft checking product now has over 1 million outstanding customer accounts.\r\nAs a reminder, this launched in September 2020.\r\nAnd all of our retail accounts, which receive ACH direct deposit have our Overdraft Rewind feature, which automatically reevaluates transactions from the prior business day that have incurred an overdraft.\r\nThis feature has helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft-related fees on 2.5 million transactions in the third quarter.\r\nFor the emerging affluent and affluent segments, we're making substantial changes to more consistently and intentionally serve these customers, including products, service, marketing, and management routines.\r\nYou'll hear us talk more about how we're executing on this in the coming quarters.\r\nAfter successfully launching Active Cash, our new cash-back credit card in July earlier this month, we launched the Reflect Card that rewards customers for making on-time payments.\r\nOur new Head of Small Business, Derek Ellington, will start in just a couple of days, and we believe this is another attractive growth segment for us.\r\nNext month, Paul Camp will be joining Wells Fargo as the Head of our Global Treasury Management businesses.\r\nThis new role brings together our treasury management and global payment solutions teams into one organization, which will enable us to be more efficient and leverage our capabilities more effectively to help clients manage their funds and process payments worldwide.\r\nWhile we've been focused on improving the products and services we offer to our customers, we've continued to support our communities.\r\nWe voluntarily committed to donate all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in 2020 and created the Open for Business Fund to support small businesses impacted by the pandemic.\r\nWe've now donated $305 million in support of small business recovery, including 215 CDFIs, which, in turn, is expected to help nearly 150,000 small business owners maintain more than 250,000 jobs.\r\nAdditionally, in the third quarter, we launched Connect to More, a resource hub for women-owned businesses and a mentoring program partnering with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to empower 500 women-owned businesses.\r\nWe committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low- and modera Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

[/INST] # Wells Fargo reported a solid third quarter with $5.1 billion in net income ($1.17 per share), driven by a $1.7 billion decrease in credit loss provisions due to improving credit quality. Although revenue declined year-over-year due to lower equity gains and interest income, expenses continued to decline, aided by efficiency initiatives and a one-time $250 million penalty related to a recent OCC enforcement action. Notably, the company saw growth in period-end loans and deposits for the first time since Q1 2020, with consumer spending remaining strong as indicated by increased debit card usage and credit card spending. Despite pandemic-related challenges, travel-related spending has significantly recovered, though it still trails 2019 levels. While commercial banking loans remained stable, line utilization continues to be historically low. Wells Fargo remains focused on risk management and regulatory compliance, with the recent termination of two consent orders signaling progress. The company is investing in digital capabilities, has launched new products and services, and is making enhancements to its payments capabilities and consumer protections. Despite challenges such as supply chain disruptions and inflation concerns, the economic outlook remains promising with strong consumer financial conditions and healthy corporate balance sheets. Wells Fargo remains on track to achieve a 10% sustainable ROTCE in the coming year and expects to continue increasing returns beyond that.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Jon Vander Ark, our CEO; and Brian DelGhiaccio, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance.\r\nThe material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.\r\nIf in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is July 29, 2021.\r\nI want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences.\r\nWe are very pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter.\r\nOur results reflect strong execution and continued momentum on our strategic priorities which are building capabilities to further differentiate us from competitors.\r\nThese capabilities include: driving growth and building customer loyalty through a maniacal focus on the customer, which we call Customer Zeal; leveraging digital tools to the experience for our customers and employees, which we believe drives growth and generates operational efficiencies; and prioritizing sustainability by offering environmentally responsible solutions to our customers while protecting the planet.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which represents a 36% increase over the prior year, expanded EBITDA margin of 110 basis points to 30.6%, and generated $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.\r\nWe continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\r\nYear-to-date, we invested $567 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow.\r\nOur pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust, with opportunities in both solid waste and the Environmental Solutions portion of our business.\r\nWe expect to invest well over $600 million in acquisitions for the full year.\r\nYear-to-date, we returned $363 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and our Board recently approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend.\r\nThe strength of the underlying business is irrefutable, and we continue to see the proof points that our strategy is working.\r\nRetention in our small and large container business remains at historically high levels at 94%.\r\nIf you further consider all permanent units of service, retention is even higher at 95%.\r\nAs anticipated, the pricing environment was strong in the second quarter.\r\nTotal core price was 5.2%, and average yield was 2.6%.\r\nThis level of core price matches the highest level in our company's history.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we delivered outsized growth in our business as the economy improved.\r\nSecond quarter volume increased 8.1% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations.\r\nThe outlook for growth in the remainder of the year, both organically and through acquisitions, is strong.\r\nWe continue to see the benefits of our investments in technology and are well underway on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform.\r\nThrough the second quarter, we implemented tablets in approximately 40% -- 47% of our large and small container fleet.\r\nWe expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year, with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2022.\r\nThe in-cab tablets enable automated customer notifications, which provides customers real-time information about their service.\r\nNext, we believe sustainability is more than environmental stewardship but also a platform for growth.\r\nWe recently published our new sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making in our most significant opportunities to positively impact our stakeholders and the environment.\r\nFor example, we are proud to report a 5% reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to the prior year.\r\nThis year, we expanded and converted a landfill gas energy plant to high BTU and have 15 additional projects in the pipeline.\r\nThese projects reduce landfill emissions, generate more renewable and improve our economics.\r\nWe are also making the communities in which we operate better places to live.\r\nSo far this year, we've supported more than 25 charitable efforts and neighborhood revitalization projects through financial contributions and volunteer efforts.\r\nThis is in addition to the ongoing support of our local divisions provide to their communities.\r\nIn recognition of our ESG performance and transparency, we were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the second consecutive year.\r\nFinally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year.\r\nWe expect continued strength in our business and to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter.\r\nAccordingly, we are updating full year financial guidance as follows.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $4 to $4.05, and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.475 billion.\r\nThis represents an increase of over 6% from the midpoint of the prior guidance.\r\nSecond quarter core price was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 3%.\r\nCore price in the open market was the highest level in company history.\r\nThe components of core price included small container of 7.9%, large container of 5.3% and residential of 5%.\r\nAverage yield was 2.6%, which increased 30 basis points from the first quarter.\r\nThis level of performance was in line with our expectations.\r\nSecond quarter volume increased 8.1%.\r\nWhile we expected second quarter to be the highest reported volume for the year, the 8.1% growth exceeded our expectations.\r\nThe components of volume included an increase in small container of 8.6%, an increase in large container of 13.7% and an increase in landfill of 12.6%.\r\nFor reference, second quarter volumes in our small and large container businesses were down less than 1% from a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, and MSW and C&D landfill volumes were both above the pre-pandemic baseline.\r\nMoving on to recycling.\r\nCommodity prices increased to $170 per ton in the second quarter.\r\nThis compared to $101 per ton in the prior year.\r\nRecycling processing and commodity sales contributed 100 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter.\r\nNext, turning to our Environmental Solutions business.\r\nSecond quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was essentially flat with the prior year.\r\nApproximately 30% of our Environmental Solutions business is in the upstream oil and gas sector, and 70% is in the downstream petrochemical and broader industrial manufacturing sectors.\r\nThe downstream petrochemical and industrial manufacturing portion of this business grew 8% compared to the prior year.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 30.6% and increased 110 basis points over the prior year.\r\nThis included 130 basis points, a 50 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel.\r\nThe margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation realizing operating leverage as volumes return, and continued effective cost management.\r\nSG&A was 10.7% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year.\r\nSG&A included higher levels of incentive compensation due to projected financial

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Today's discussion will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures such as operating income and accident year loss and combined ratios excluding catastrophes among others.\r\nI will begin by discussing our third quarter financial highlights in the context of the current business and economic environment.\r\nWe are pleased with our third quarter financial performance, especially given it was a particularly active catastrophe quarter across the industry.\r\nWe reported earnings per share of $2.46 and an operating return on equity of 13.8% for the quarter.\r\nOur results reflect strong execution on the strategic tenants that drive our business forward.\r\nOur company and earnings stream are well-diversified and position us well to withstand environmental challenges, including weather volatility and the ups and downs of the economy and market.\r\nWe remain steadfastly focused on the hallmarks of our company.\r\nOur unique distribution strategy and approach, broad-based profitability, disciplined underwriting, effective expense management and a thoughtful capital allocation strategy that includes returning excess capital to our shareholders.\r\nTurning to our third quarter highlights, first, we are very pleased with the trajectory of our growth and the consistent signs of building momentum in our top-line.\r\nWe achieved 2.1% growth in the third quarter, which represents a significant and expected recovery from the 2.3% premium decline we reported in the second quarter normalized for one-time premium returns.\r\nOur leading production indicators are quickly improving and we are encouraged by agency support and commitments, which once again validate the strength of our differentiated strategy and our broad and relevant product offering.\r\nLooking ahead, we are confident in our ability to drive growth across our portfolio and continue to build on the strong pre-pandemic momentum we had established.\r\nSecond, as noted in our pre-release on October 13th, our cat losses were slightly elevated in the quarter as a result of tropical storm systems, in particular, Hurricane Isaias and to a lesser extent, wildfires in California, and Oregon.\r\nOur ability to mitigate the impact of weather events in the quarter is a reflection of the concerted, proactive efforts we have made over the past decade to prudently refine our mix of business.\r\nTo this end, we have expanded our specialty capabilities and struck the right balance between property and liability risks, while continuing to diligently manage our geographic concentrations and proactively adjusting our business mix.\r\nWe counted the increasing frequency of weather losses, we reduced our exposures in vulnerable regions of the Southeast, Gulf Coast and West Coast, while reducing micro-concentrations and enhancing our reinsurance protections.\r\nThese and other actions have enabled us to address potentially increasing weather-related property risks as we grow.\r\nGoing forward, we are confident these actions along with our increasing use of advanced tools and analytics will position us to continue to deliver consistently strong results across our business.\r\nThird, we continue to benefit from lower claim frequency in the quarter, particularly in personal auto.\r\nWhile frequency declined year-over-year, it is beginning to trend toward pre-pandemic levels as the economy reopens.\r\nAt the same time, we also experienced several large property losses in commercial multi-peril, which occurred in our book of business from time-to-time.\r\nAfter carefully reviewing the causes of loss and related circumstances, we found no clear correlation between the losses themselves or the prevailing economic environment.\r\nGiven our strong underwriting guidelines and risk management practices, we have confidence in our ability to manage such risks while continuing to drive profitability through rate increases and prudent mix management.\r\nLastly, the third quarter was a very active one for us from a capital management perspective.\r\nAs announced last night, we entered into a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, reflecting the strong excess capital we have generated so far this year from earnings.\r\nThis decision further demonstrates our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and the confidence we have in our strong prospects moving forward.\r\nJeff will provide more details on these items shortly.\r\nMoving on to review our business highlights, starting with Personal Lines.\r\nWe delivered net written premium growth of 2.3% in the third quarter compared to a decline of 5.5% in the second quarter or flat excluding premium return.\r\nNew business submissions in the third quarter were consistent with the third quarter of last year across most territories.\r\nContributions from renewal premiums continued to fuel growth, although retention was somewhat impacted from the backlog created by the lifting of cancellation and non-renewal moratoriums over the summer.\r\nOur disciplined account strategy enabled us to effectively manage our business in a highly competitive environment and to drive profitability.\r\nOur performance reflects a focus on striking the right balance between rate and retention, while achieving price increases where we need them the most.\r\nOverall, Personal Lines rate increases of 4.7% in the quarter were fairly consistent with prior trends and we are satisfied with the underlying retention when adjusted for the temporary increase in cancellations and non-renewals, following the temporary second quarter increases.\r\nOur Personal Lines year-to-date retention of 82% is a more indicative measure of our persistency, and should move back to the mid-80s over time.\r\nAdditionally, we are encouraged by the continued success of our Prestige offering, which is adding 600 new accounts each month.\r\nBook consolidation activity also is continuing at an accelerated pace, with $71 million signed through the first nine months of the year, exceeding our expectations for the full year.\r\nThis level of activity further validates our unique approach to cultivating deep partnerships across the independent agency channel.\r\nWe continue to broaden and enhance those relationships by expanding our geographic reach and introducing product capabilities to address unmet customer needs across our footprint.\r\nFrom a strategic and operational standpoint, we made significant progress during the quarter.\r\nEarlier this week, we announced the expansion of our Personal Lines business in Maryland, further diversifying our book of business and expanding our Personal Lines presence to 20 states.\r\nWe also are expanding our product capabilities in Personal Lines.\r\nWe recently launched a new suite of products, home business solutions to cover home-based businesses.\r\nEntrepreneurs throughout the country are starting home-based businesses in record numbers, yet, nearly 60% of these businesses lack adequate insurance.\r\nTo address that gap, our product provides ala carte options that could be bundled with the existing homeowner policies, including our Prestige offering.\r\nAs importantly, our Personal Lines team continues to execute exceptionally well in a new regulatory environment in Michigan, following personal auto reform, which went into effect in July.\r\nAs a top insurer and an industry thought leader in Michigan with 12% of our overall premiums in Michigan personal auto, we advocated for auto reform for more than a decade and it was essential that we excel in our implementation.\r\nThe reform provides Michigan consumers with the ability to save money on premiums in exchange for a reduced personal injury protection limit.\r\nCost control measures such as fee schedules and utilization controls should substantially reduce the severity of claims and increase the efficiency of the system once implemented mid-next year.\r\nAt the beginning of last year, we laid the foundation for the transition with a proactive plan that included operational, educational and self-service tools for agents and consume Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I am joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nWe hope you're all healthy and safe amid the ongoing pandemic and recent surge of the delta variant.\r\nIt's because of you that we're reporting the positive growth in sales, profit and earnings per share we're reviewing today.\r\nIn Q2, we continued to deliver strong financial performance on both the one and two year stack, as we began lapping more difficult comparisons.\r\nIn the quarter, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 5.8% and adjusted operating income margin of 11.4%, an increase of 11 basis points versus 2020.\r\nAs a reminder, we lapped a highly unusual quarter from 2020 where we significantly reduced hours of operation and professional delivery expenses reflective of the channel shift from pro to DIY.\r\nAs we anticipated, the professional business accelerated in Q2 2021, and between our ongoing strategic initiatives and additional actions, we expanded margins.\r\nOur actions offset known headwinds within SG&A and an extremely competitive environment for talent.\r\nOn a two-year stack, our comp sales improved 13.3% and margins expanded 227 basis points compared to Q2 2019.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.40 increased 15.3% compared to Q2 2020 and 56.7% compared to 2019.\r\nYear-to-date, free cash flow more than doubled, which led to a higher than anticipated return of cash to shareholders in the first half of the year, returning $661.4 [Phonetic] million through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.\r\nOur sales growth and margin expansion were driven by a combination of industry-related factors as well as internal operational improvements.\r\nOn the industry side, the macroeconomic backdrop remained positive in the quarter as consumers benefited from the impact of government stimulus.\r\nMeanwhile, long-term industry drivers of demand continued to improve.\r\nThis includes a gradual recovery in miles driven along with an increase in used car sales, which contributes to an aging fleet.\r\nWhile we delivered positive comp sales in all three periods of Q2 our year-over-year growth slowed late in the quarter as we lapped some of our highest growth weeks of 2020.\r\nOur category growth was led by strength in brakes, motor oil and filters, with continued momentum in key hard part professional categories.\r\nRegionally, the West led our growth benefiting from an unusually hot summer, followed by the Southwest, Northeast and Florida.\r\nTo summarize channel performance, we saw double-digit growth in our professional business and a slight decline in our DIY omnichannel business.\r\nTo understand the shift in our channel mix, it's important to look back at 2020 to provide context.\r\nBeginning in Q2, we saw abrupt shifts in consumer behavior across our industry due to the pandemic, resulting from the implementation of stay-at-home orders.\r\nThis led to more consumers repairing their own vehicles, which drove DIY growth.\r\nIn addition, our DIY online business surged as many consumers chose to shop from home and leverage digital services.\r\nFinally, as we discussed last year, our research indicated that large box retailers temporarily deprioritized long tail items, such as auto parts, in response to the pandemic.\r\nThese and other factors resulted in robust sales growth and market share gains for our DIY business in 2020.\r\nContrary to historical trends, the confluence of these factors also led to a slight decline in our professional business in Q2 2020.\r\nAs we began to lap this highly unusual time, we leveraged our extensive research on customer decision journeys.\r\nThis enabled us move quickly as customer shifted how they repaired and maintained their vehicles.\r\nOur sales growth and margin expansion in Q2 demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified asset base as we adapted to a very different environment in 2021.\r\nSpecific to our professional business, we began to see improving demand late in Q1 2021, which continued into Q2, resulting in double-digit comp sales growth.\r\nThis is directly related to the factors just discussed, along with improved mobility trends as more people returned to work and miles driven increased versus the previous year.\r\nStrategic investments are strengthening our professional customer value proposition.\r\nIt starts with improved availability and getting parts closer to the customer as we leverage our dynamic assortment machine learning platform.\r\nWithin our Advance Pro catalog, we saw improved key performance indicators across the board including, more online traffic, increased assortment and conversion rates and ultimately growth in transaction counts and average ticket.\r\nWe also continued to invest in our technical training programs to help installers better serve their customers.\r\nOur TechNet program is also performing well as we continue to expand our North American TechNet members, providing them with a broad range of services.\r\nEach of these pro-focused initiatives have been a differentiator for Advance, enabling us to increase first call status with both national strategic accounts and local independent shops.\r\nFinally, we're pleased that through the first half of the year, we added 28 net new independent Carquest stores.\r\nWe also announced the planned conversion of an additional 29 locations in the West as Baxter Auto Parts joins the Carquest family.\r\nWe're excited to combine our differentiated pro customer value proposition with an extremely strong family business, highlighted by Baxter's excellent relationships with their customers in this growing market.\r\nIn summary, all of our professional banners performed at or above our expectations in Q2, including our Canadian business, despite stringent lockdowns.\r\nMoving to DIY omnichannel, our business performed in line with expectations, considering our strong double-digit increases in 2020.\r\nWhile Q2 DIY comp sales were down slightly, DIY omnichannel was still the larger contributor to our two-year growth.\r\nDIY growth versus a year ago gradually moderated throughout the quarter as some consumers returned to professional garages.\r\nWithin DIY omnichannel, we saw a shift in consumer behavior back to in-store purchases, consistent with broader retail.\r\nWe've also been working to optimize and reduce inefficient online discounts.\r\nThese factors along with highly effective advertising contributed to an increase in our DIY in-store mix and a significant increase in gross margins versus prior year.\r\nWe remain focused on improving the DIY experience to increase share of wallet through our Speed Perks loyalty platform.\r\nWe made several upgrades to our mobile app to make it easier for Speed Perks members to see their status and access rewards.\r\nWe continue to see positive graduation rates among our existing Speed Perks members.\r\nIn Q2, our VIP membership grew by 8% and our Elite members representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.\r\nShifting to operating income, we expanded margin in the quarter on top of significant margin expansion in Q2 2020.\r\nThis was led by our category management initiatives, which drove strong gross margin expansion in the quarter.\r\nFirst, our work on strategic sourcing remains a key focus as consistent sales growth over several quarters resulted in an increase in supplier incentives.\r\nSecondly, we've talked about growing own brands as a percent of our total sales.\r\nThis has been a thoughtful and gradual conversion and we began to see the benefits of several quarters of hard work in Q2.\r\nThis was highlighted by our first major category conversion with steering and suspension, where we saw extremely strong unit growth for our high margin Carquest premium products.\r\nIn addition, the CQ product is highly regarded by our professional installers.\r\nWith consistent high level of quality standards, they are now delivering lower defect rates and improved customer satisfaction.\r\nWe also recent Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph

Adjusted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40, surpassing analyst expectations. Sales grew 5.9% to $2.6 billion, with comparable store sales increasing 5.8%. The professional business outperformed the DIY omnichannel business, contributing to double-digit growth. Strategic initiatives in category management, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing, and own-brand expansion, led to gross margin expansion of 239 basis points. SG&A expenses increased due to higher incentive compensation, wage inflation, and normalized delivery expenses. However, these were partially offset by decreased COVID-19 expenses. Adjusted operating income grew to $302 million, resulting in an 11 basis point increase in operating income margin to 11.4%. Advance Auto Parts remains optimistic about the long-term outlook and has increased its guidance for full-year 2021, including net sales, comparable store sales, and free cash flow. The company plans to continue investing in strategic initiatives and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.</s>"}

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm joined today by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nAs always, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe.\r\nTheir continued dedication to provide outstanding service to our customers allowed us to deliver another quarter of top line sales growth, adjusted margin expansion and a double-digit increase in earnings per share.\r\nWe've been investing in both our team and our business over multiple years to transform and better leverage Advance's assets.\r\nIn Q3, this helped enable us to comp the comp on top of our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth of 2020.\r\nSpecifically, we delivered comp store sales growth of 3.1%, while sustaining an identical two-year stack of 13.3% compared with Q2.\r\nAs expected, this was led by the continued recovery of our professional business and a gradual improvement in key urban markets.\r\nBy putting DIY consumers and Pro customers at the center of every decision we make, we've been able to respond quickly to evolving needs.\r\nIn Q3, this was highlighted by an overall channel shift back to Professional and a return to stores for DIYers.\r\nWithin Professional, we're seeing increasing strength in certain geographies, which, like the rest of the country last year as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban markets, catches up with the rest of the country.\r\nOur diversified digital and physical asset base has enabled us to respond rapidly to these changing channel dynamics in the current environment.\r\nIn addition, we also delivered significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, led by our category management initiatives.\r\nOur adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we lapped a unique quarter in Q3 2020.\r\nAs we've discussed over the past year, our SG&A costs were much lower than normal in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.\r\nThis was due to an unusually high DIY sales mix and actions we took last year during the initial stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated.\r\nOverall, we delivered adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% versus Q3 2020.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.21 increased 21.6% compared with Q3 2020 and 31% compared with the same period of 2019.\r\nOur year-to-date adjusted earnings per share are up approximately 50% compared with 2020.\r\nYear-to-date, our balance sheet remains strong with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividend.\r\nConsistent with the front half of the year, there were several industry-related factors, coupled with operational improvements, contributing to our sales growth and margin expansion in Q3.\r\nThe car park continues to grow slightly.\r\nThe fleet is aging and perhaps most importantly vehicle miles driven continue to improve versus both 2020 and 2019.\r\nMore broadly, the chip shortage continues to impact availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales.\r\nThis benefits our industry as consumers are repairing and maintaining their vehicles longer.\r\nAs we all know, over the last 18 months, the pandemic changed consumer behavior across our industry, which led to a surge in DIY omnichannel growth in 2020, while the Professional business declined.\r\nHowever, as the economy continues to reopen, with miles driven steadily increasing, our Professional business is now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels as discussed last quarter.\r\nRegional performance was led by the Southwest and West.\r\nCategory growth was led by brakes, motor oil and filters as miles driven reliant categories improved versus the softer 2020.\r\nWe also saw continued strength in DieHard batteries, which led the way on a two-year stack basis.\r\nEach of these categories performed well as a result of the diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions.\r\nAt the same time, we experienced challenges in Q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management SKUs to own brand.\r\nImportantly, these in-stock positions are now significantly improved and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion.\r\nOverall, comp sales were positive in all three periods of Q3, led by Professional.\r\nDIY omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in Q3, while lapping high double-digit growth than the prior year.\r\nWithin Professional, we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to allow us to say yes to our customers.\r\nThe investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning and in our dynamic assortment tool help put us in a favorable position competitively.\r\nWe've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned US stores as well as over 800 independent locations.\r\nOur MyAdvance portal and embedded Advance Pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us, while driving online traffic.\r\nOur online sales to Professional customers continues to grow as we strengthen the speed and functionality of Advance Pro.\r\nWe remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all Professional customers.\r\nThis will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market.\r\nIn addition, we expanded DieHard to our Professional customers.\r\nFollowing a recent independent consumer survey, DieHard stake disclaims as America's most trusted auto battery.\r\nDuring Q3, we announced a multi-year agreement with our national customer Bridgestone to sell DieHard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the United States.\r\nWith this systemwide rollout during Q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all Bridgestone locations.\r\nIn terms of our independent business, we added 16 net new independent Carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year.\r\nWe continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our Carquest partners, including our new Carquest by Advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month.\r\nAs we continue to build and strengthen the Advance brand and our DIY business, Carquest by Advance adds DIY relevance for our Carquest-branded independent partners, while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities.\r\nWe've recently enrolled this new initiative out to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing Carquest independents.\r\nTransitioning to DIY omnichannel, comparable store sales were slightly positive in Q3.\r\nAs you'll recall, our DIY omnichannel business reported strong double-digit comp sales growth in Q3 2020.\r\nWe continue to enhance our offerings and execute our long-term strategy to differentiate our DIY business and increased market share.\r\nIn Q3, we continue to leverage our Speed Perks loyalty program as VIP membership grew by 13% and our number of ELITE members, representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.\r\nLast year, the launch of our Advance Same Day suite of services helped enable a huge surge in e-commerce growth.\r\nThis year, as DIYers return to our stores, in-store sales growth led our DIY sales growth.\r\nPart of this was expected due to a planned reduction in inefficient online discounts, which significantly increased gross margins.\r\nTurning to margin expansion.\r\nWe again increased our adjusted operating income margin in the quarter.\r\nLike Q2, this was driven by category management actions within gross margin, where our key initiatives played a role.\r\nFirst, we are realizing benefits from our new strategic pricing tools and capabilities.\r\nLike other companies, we're exp Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

earnings and non-GAAP EPS, which have been adjusted for certain items which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies.\r\nI'm very pleased with the strong start to 2021 and the positive momentum in revenue and margins we delivered in the first quarter, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business.\r\nConsolidated revenues increased 11.1% year-over-year in our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company.\r\nThe revenue increase included same-store revenue growth of 14.8% and we reported adjusted EBITDA margin that improved to 15.4% of revenues.\r\nThis is the first quarter in over a decade that the Company has delivered double-digit same-store revenue growth.\r\nOur teams in the field and our store support centers and Woodhaven are performing at a very high level and are energized and engaged.\r\nAs I visit Aaron's stores around the country to support our operations team, I'm seeing a strong sense of pride and optimism about our brand and our competitive position.\r\nOur team members and customers are embracing the innovation that we are delivering and the dynamic lease-to-own market.\r\nOver the last five years, we've significantly transformed the company for the goal of continuing to provide an exceptional customer and team member experience while also driving greater efficiencies in our operating model.\r\nI'm proud to say that as of today we have a centralized decisioning platform that provides greater control and predictability resulting in a higher quality lease portfolio.\r\nWe have enhanced digital payment platforms that are enabling over 75% of monthly customer payments to be made outside of our stores.\r\nWe have an industry-leading, fully transactional e-commerce platform that is attracting a new and younger customer, and we have a portfolio of 51 GenNext stores that is currently outperforming our expectations with many more store openings in the pipeline.\r\nAll of these initiatives are underpinned by the investments that we have made in enhanced analytics and when combined with our more efficient operations are enabling us to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.\r\nThese transformations to our business model are contributing to our outstanding performance in the first quarter of 2021.\r\nWe are encouraged by the continuing improvement and the quality and size of our same-store lease portfolio, which ended the quarter up 6.2% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.\r\nThis improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our products, few release merchandise returns, and lower inventory write-offs.\r\nIn addition, our customer continues to benefit from the ongoing government stimulus, one of the most meaningful contributors to our strong portfolio performance was centralized decisioning, which we implemented across all Company-operated stores in the U.S., in the spring of 2020.\r\nToday, nearly 70% of our portfolio is made up of lease agreements that were originated using this technology.\r\nCentralized decisioning delivers consistency and predictability in the performance of our lease portfolio.\r\nIt enables store managers the flexibility to focus their time on growth-oriented activities such as sales and lease servicing.\r\nWe believe our algorithms provide better outcomes for both the customer and Aaron's with the goal of having a greater number of customers achieve ownership while at the same time reducing our cost to serve.\r\nWe continue to refine this decisioning across our various channels, and we expect this will continue to drive greater productivity from our lease portfolio.\r\nAnother contributor to our strong performance in the quarter was our e-commerce channel, which represented more than 14% of lease revenues.\r\nOur e-commerce team has really delivered, driving traffic growth to aarons.com by 12.8% and increasing revenues by 42% in the first quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter.\r\nE-commerce lease originations increased as compared to the year-ago quarter despite the significant shift of customer activity through our online platform in March of 2020 as stores closed during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nIn addition, e-commerce write-offs improved by more than 50% compared to last year's quarter, primarily as a result of ongoing decisioning optimization, operational enhancements, and strong customer payment activity.\r\nOur e-commerce team continues to deliver ongoing improvements through our online customer acquisition, conversion, and servicing capabilities, which is leading to margin growth and continued positive momentum in this important channel.\r\nOur e-commerce growth in the quarter is enabled by our stores, which are not just showrooms and service centers but are also last-mile logistics hubs delivering an expanded assortment of products with same or next day delivery.\r\nFinally, our Real estate repositioning and reinvestment strategy is gaining momentum and we expect it will drive future growth.\r\nOur new GenNext stores have larger and more modern showrooms, expanded product assortment, and improved brand imaging and digital technologies.\r\nTo date, we have opened 51 new GenNext stores and have generated results that are meeting or exceeding our targeted internal rate of return equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in the first quarter.\r\nOur plan for 2021 is to plan to open in the second and third quarters.\r\nWhile we're excited about both the early financial results and the infrastructure we're building to accelerate our progress, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of this strategy.\r\nWe remain focused on our key strategic initiatives of simplifying and digitizing the customer experience, aligning our store footprint to our customer opportunity and promoting the Aaron's value proposition of low payments high approval rates and best-in-class service.\r\nFor the first quarter of 2021, revenues were $481.1 million compared to $432.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 11.1%.\r\nThe increase in revenues was primarily due to the improving quality and increased size of our lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity during the quarter, aided in part by government stimulus and partially offset by the net reduction of 166 Company-operated and franchised stores compared to the prior year.\r\nAs Douglas called out earlier, e-commerce revenues were up 42% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and represented 14.2% of overall lease revenues compared to 11.3% in 2020.\r\nOn a same-store revenue basis, revenues increased 14.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, the first double-digit, same-store revenue growth since 2009, and our fourth consecutive positive quarter.\r\nSame-store revenue growth was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity, including retail sales and early purchase option exercises.\r\nWe believe this growth is partially a result of the government stimulus programs passed in 2020 and 2021.\r\nAdditionally, the company ended the first quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company operated stores of $128.8 million, an increase of 3.6% compared to the lease portfolio size as of March 31, 2020.\r\nLease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements.\r\nOperating expenses excluding restructuring expenses, spin-related transaction costs and the impairment of goodwill and other expenses, which were both recorded in the first quarter of 2020 were down $1.5 million as compared to the first quarter of last year.\r\nThis decrease was primarily due to a reduction in write-offs, store closures and the impact of the COVID-related reserves recorded in 2020, partially

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before we begin, let me remind you that the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.\r\nIn addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\r\nI will begin with highlights for the quarter, and David and Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.\r\nFirst, let's start with the obvious.\r\nOperating two separate and distinct service business segments with 17,000 employees during a national pandemic brings unique, unpredictable and abrupt challenges.\r\nFortunately VITAS and Roto-Rooter have been classified as essential services allowing Chemed to operate during the pandemic.\r\nMaintaining operations in this environment is far from business as usual.\r\nFirst and foremost, our number one focus has been and will remain on the safety and well-being of our employees, patients and customers.\r\nWe will maintain this focus regardless of the cost to safely operate during the pandemic.\r\nApril 2020 was probably the most challenging month, we have ever seen significant operating issues emerge daily, triggered primarily from incredibly fast-moving and sometimes contradictory federal, state and local government regulations.\r\nLogistical operating issues were identified, analyzed and solutions for put in practice immediately.\r\nWe were able to develop and continuously refine effective work arounds on supply chain issues, labor and scheduling issues, patient access restrictions, employee safety, healthcare protocols, technology solutions as well as information security protocols allowing our employees to continuously serve our local communities in a safe agile manner.\r\nWe closely followed the myriad of federal, state and local regulations in the development and implementation of infrastructure necessary to safely allow our field, support and corporate support staff to safely limit as much as practical, physical interaction among our 17,000 employees.\r\nOn the VITAS segment, the federal government and specifically HHS and CMS have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth capabilities where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 plus patient census.\r\nAs most of you are aware on March 27, 2020 the CARES Act was signed in the law.\r\nThe CARES Act includes financial support for healthcare providers to maintain operational capacity as well as assist providers with issues caused by the coronavirus panic.\r\nOn April 10, 2020, VITAS without application received $80.2 million of CARES Act funds, that was formulaically determined by the federal government based on our 2019 Medicare fee-for-service revenue.\r\nThese CARES Act funds are specified to be used to prevent, prepare for and respond to the coronavirus, and shall reimburse the recipient for healthcare-related expenses or loss revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.\r\nThe ability of VITAS to retain and utilize the full $80.2 million from the relief fund will depend on the magnitude, timing and nature of the economic impact of COVID-19 within VITAS, as well as the guidelines and rules of the relief fund program.\r\nThis financial support is material for VITAS in maintaining its operational capacity at the safely care for our 19,000 patients.\r\nIn our first quarter earnings conference call, I stated we anticipated disruption within our patient referral and addition patterns due to significant healthcare system service restrictions in the coming quarter.\r\nThis disruption did materialize in our second quarter 2020 admissions declined 3.8% over the prior year.\r\nHowever, the admissions trend did materially improve throughout the quarter.\r\nOur April 2020 admissions were challenging and had a decline of 6.6%, may improve slightly with admission decline of 5.8%.\r\nJune showed significant improvement generated in admissions growth of 1.1%.\r\nRoto-Rooter operations were also severely impacted at the start of the pandemic.\r\nIn late March 2020, we observed significant disruption in our Roto-Rooter commercial business.\r\nAs a reminder, historically, commercial services represented approximately 28% of Roto-Rooters consolidated revenue.\r\nWe made the decision for Roto-Rooter to maintain full staffing and operating capacity with no employee layoffs, as we entered the second quarter.\r\nThis decision could maintain our full operating strength was potentially an expenses strategic move and we monitored our demand metrics daily.\r\nThe decision to operate at full capacity is a classic risk reward calculation weighing brand awareness, customer satisfaction and the financial needs of our employees.\r\nWe also wanted to positioned to capitalize on any potential snapback in commercial and residential demand, both to protect existing marketing share as well as maximize our opportunities to grow market share.\r\nI believe this is proven to be the correct strategic course.\r\nRoto-Rooter services demand began to show weekly improvement beginning in the later part of April, and had strengthened unabated throughout the remainder of the second quarter.\r\nThis is reflected in our monthly performance with Roto-Rooter and unit-for-unit commercial revenue declining 38.6% in April, improving slightly to 31.8% decline in May and declining 19.7% in June.\r\nOur residential services have proven to be exceptionally resilient, with our unit-for-unit residential revenue declining a modest 1.6% in April, increasing 11.7% in May and 18.7% in June.\r\nAll this translated into Roto-Rooter -- I mean unit-for-unit basis, having the second quarter 2020 commercial revenue declining 29.1%, residential revenue increasing 10.4% and Roto-Rooter consolidated unit-for-unit revenue declining a modest 1.6% when compared to the prior year quarter.\r\nAlthough, we did have a modest decline in unit-for-unit revenue in the second quarter.\r\nIncluding acquisitions Roto-Rooter generated consolidate revenue -- consolidated revenue growth of 8.6%.\r\nOverall Roto-Rooter solid revenue growth with excellent adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EBITDA growth.\r\nRoto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2020 totaled $46.8 million, an increase of 20.7%.\r\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, which is a 269 basis point increase when compared to, I'm sorry, excuse me.\r\nThe have increase in Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin is a contributed to our residential services, having a higher margin than commercial services, as well as increased residential excavation and water restoration services, which have a significantly higher direct contribution margin compared to commercial plumbing and drain cleaning services.\r\nI'm very appreciative of the hard work, creative solutions and willingness of our 7,000 employees to adjust our operational routines and embrace new procedures.\r\nWith that, I would like to turn the teleconference over to David.\r\nVITAS' net revenue was $327 million in the second quarter of 2020, which is an increase of 4.7% when compared to our prior year period.\r\nThis revenue increase is comprised primarily by 2.8% increase in days of care, a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase, including the suspension of sequestration on May 1 of 2020 of approximately 5.4% and acuity mix shift, which reduced the blended average Medicare rate increase by approximately 310 basis points.\r\nThe combination of increased Medicare Cap and a decrease in Medicaid net room and board pass-throughs, as well as reductions in other contra revenue activity, reduced total revenue growth in additional 42 basis points in the quarter.\r\nOur average revenue per patient per day in the second quarter of 2020 was $194.02, which including the impact from acuity mix shift is 2.3% above the prior year period.\r\nReimbursement for routine home care and high acuity care averaged $165.22 and $985.23, respecti Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.\r\nEOG is focused on improving returns.\r\nResults from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double-premium investment standard.\r\nOnce again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter.\r\nWe delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow, repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last quarter.\r\nOur outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per-unit operating costs were below expectations.\r\nWe are delivering exceptional well productivity that continues to improve.\r\nIn addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the company's unique ability to sustainably lower cost.\r\nOur performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.\r\nI'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow.\r\nAs double premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value.\r\nThe regular dividend, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks and small high-return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.\r\nIn the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by $750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of $1.5 billion in regular and special dividends.\r\nWe also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions in the Delaware Basin over the last 12 months.\r\nYear-to-date, we have committed $2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion of free cash flow we've generated.\r\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed.\r\nAs we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way.\r\nWe are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns.\r\nOver the last four years, we've made huge progress reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations.\r\nWe are focused on continued progress toward reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.\r\nThis quarter, we announced a carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net-zero ambition.\r\nKen will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments.\r\nDriven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest costs, highest return and lowest emission producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.\r\nNow, here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve.\r\nWhile we announced our shift to the double-premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well.\r\nIn the three years that followed, our premium drilling program drove a 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment nearly 40% lower compared to the three-year period prior to premium.\r\nIn addition, premium enabled this remarkable step change in our financial performance, while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow.\r\nThe impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck is now positioning EOG for a similar step change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, capital efficiency, and cash flow.\r\nDouble premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs, resulting in well payouts of approximately six months at current strip prices.\r\nThe increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these high-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow.\r\nThis year, we are averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost.\r\nAdding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company, and when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions is driving higher full-cycle returns.\r\nLooking back over the last four quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52.\r\nWe are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil, and it begins with disciplined reinvestment in high-return double-premium drilling.\r\nWhile EOG has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double-premium wells located across each of our core assets.\r\nWe are confident we can continue to grow our double-premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well cost and well productivity and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last five years.\r\nIn the past 12 months, through eight deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2,500 per acre.\r\nThese are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which, in some cases, receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure.\r\nPremium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory.\r\nExploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle.\r\nEOG's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory predominantly through organic exploration is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals.\r\n2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG.\r\nOur exceptional well level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns and our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation.\r\nHere's Billy with an update on our operational performance.\r\nOur operating teams continue to deliver strong results.\r\nOnce again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results.\r\nIn addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions.\r\nWe have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021.\r\nWe now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year.\r\nAs a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020.\r\nWe continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector.\r\nAverage drilling days are down 11%, and the feet of lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%.\r\nWe are utilizing our recently discussed super-zipper completions on about one third our well packages this year and expect that percentage to increase next year.\r\nIn addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date.\r\nWe have line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.\r\nWater reuse is another source of signific Please summarize this transcript in

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm joined today by our CEO, Steve Hasker, and our CFO, Mike Eastwood.\r\nWe believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business.\r\nActual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the COVID pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies.\r\nYou may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.\r\nI'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter.\r\nOur revenue and sales performance was strong, exceeded our expectations and position us well for Q4 and 2022.\r\nWe expect to close out the year on a strong footing and appreciate the efforts of our sales and our go-to-market teams.\r\nThis strong performance demonstrates our markets remain healthy and growing.\r\nAnd our products across legal, tax, corporates and risk, fraud, and compliance fit the needs of our customers.\r\nOur products enable them to effectively equip their professionals to better serve their clients.\r\nWe're also seeing improving customer engagement, including 8,000 registrations for our annual Legal, Tax and Corporates SYNERGY conferences around the world.\r\nThese conferences are our premier events for professionals who want to understand the future of their professions, learn the latest trends, and experience how tools and data-driven technology can transform their firms, organizations, agencies, and roles.\r\nOur leadership team, including the president of our Corporates business, Sunil Pandita; and the president of our Tax & Accounting Professionals business, Elizabeth Beastrom, will be joining nearly 2,000 of our customers for the upcoming SYNERGY conferences in November in Nashville.\r\nAnd as I mentioned last quarter, our customers continue to exhibit confidence in both an improving economic environment and in their own prospects.\r\nThis potent ecosystem plays to our advantage, and we will continue to capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing to drive growth and expand our positions.\r\nNow to the results.\r\nOur third quarter results reflected a standout performance.\r\nFour of our five business segments recorded organic revenue growth of 6%.\r\nThat performance resulted in total company organic revenue growth of 5%, putting us well above the 3.5% to 4% third quarter guidance provided in August.\r\nOur healthy markets are providing us with a tailwind.\r\nThat tailwind, coupled with our nine-month results, give us confidence in our prospects for the fourth quarter.\r\nAs a result, we've once again raised our full year revenue and free cash flow guidance.\r\nFull year total company organic revenue growth is now forecast to be between 4.5% and 5% and approximately 6% for the Big 3 businesses.\r\nFree cash flow for the year is now forecast to be approximately $1.2 billion.\r\nTurning to our Change Program.\r\nWe're making consistent progress as we work through -- as we work toward becoming an integrated operating company.\r\nAs of September 30, we recorded run rate savings of about $130 million, putting us on a path to achieve $200 million by year end.\r\nI'll remind you, our aggregate savings target is $600 million by the end of 2023, $200 million of which we plan to reinvest in the business.\r\nFinally, we were active during the quarter executing on the $1.2 billion share buyback program we announced in August.\r\nWe've already bought back $1.1 billion of stock, and we expect to complete the program before year end.\r\nSo given the progress we're making, we also reaffirmed our guidance for 2022 and 2023.\r\nNow to the results for the quarter.\r\nContributing to this performance was strong organic growth of more than 20% from our Latin American businesses and nearly 10% growth from our Asia and emerging markets businesses.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA declined 7% to $458 million due to costs related to the Change Program, resulting in a margin of 30%.\r\nExcluding Change Program costs, adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.5%.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, compared to $0.39 per share in the prior-year period.\r\nTurning to the results by segment.\r\nThe Big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 6% for the quarter.\r\nLegal's third quarter performance was again strong with organic revenue growth of 6%.\r\nThis was Legal's second consecutive quarter of 6% growth, its highest quarterly growth rate in over a decade.\r\nThe U.S. legal market continues to be very healthy across the board for small, mid, and large-sized firms, as well as for government and across geographies.\r\nFor example, Westlaw Edge continues to achieve strong sales growth and ended the quarter with an annual contract value or ACV penetration of 60%, achieving our full year ACV penetration guidance.\r\nSecond, Practical Law, as reported in the Legal segment, continues its strong performance, again growing double digits.\r\nWe forecast similar growth in 2022 and continue to invest in this key legal workflow initiative.\r\nThird, our Government business, which is managed within our Legal segment, continues to perform and grew 10% organically.\r\nAnd fourth, FindLaw grew over 10%, and our Legal businesses in Canada, Europe and Asia all grew mid-single-digit in the quarter.\r\nLegal again achieved strong sales for both the quarter and nine-month periods, recording double-digit recurring sales growth, reflecting customers' willingness and ability to invest in productivity-enhancing products.\r\nTurning to the Corporates business.\r\nOrganic revenue growth increased to 6% from 4% in the first half of the year.\r\nThis improvement came from increasing demand from customers for our legal, tax, and risk products.\r\nReuters News organic revenues also increased 6%, the second consecutive quarter of 6% growth.\r\nThis was driven by the Professional business, which includes Reuters Events, which grew over 60% and continues to recover from the negative impact of COVID-19 in 2020.\r\nFinally, Global Print organic revenues declined 5%, less than expected, due to a continued gradual return to office by our customers and higher third-party print revenues.\r\nIn summary, it was another strong quarter, but we're taking nothing for granted.\r\nWe continue to invest in the businesses to enable us to further support our customers and properly position us for 2022 and beyond.\r\nWe still have much work to do in executing our Change Program, and we've assembled a talented team over the past 18 months who are working well together and clearly understand our goals and our timelines.\r\nI'm very pleased with our progress to date.\r\nOne additional comment regarding growth.\r\nAs you can see on this slide, momentum has been building for our Big 3 businesses over the past 11 quarters, which we believe will continue in the fourth quarter and into next year.\r\nI know many investors have historically viewed our markets as slower growing and have perceived our Legal and Tax businesses in particular as low single-digit growers.\r\nWe firmly believe that's not the case and, in fact, think that with successful execution of the Change Program, combined with appropriate investments, we can improve growth on a sustainable basis.\r\nOur markets are broad and dynamic and we have strong positions in the right subsegments.\r\nAlso, we have numerous levers to pull across our businesses.\r\nAnd we're investing in our strategic seven initiatives, which are performing well, and we expect they will continue to do so.\r\nThis confluence of factors places us in a position where we believe we can grow mid-single digit on a consistent basis over the cycle.\r\nThese factors position us well to achieve the upper end of the range of our 2022 revenue guidance of 4% to 5%.\r\nWe'll discuss our 2022 guidance further when we report our fourth quarter and full year results in February.\r\nLet me share an example of products that we believe will contribute to sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth that I just referred to.\r\nFirst Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

encourage you to read Safeguard's filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K which describes in detail the risks and uncertainties associated with managing our business.\r\nWith that, here is Brian.\r\nWe continued to do in 2019 what we started to pursue early in 2018.\r\nWe continue to diligently pursue our goals to prudently manage and support our portfolio of private company ownership interests, to maximize the value of our interests and to monetize and return the value of the portfolio to you in the most efficient manner possible.\r\nToday, we want to reiterate our focus and convey to you the strong belief we have regarding the current and the anticipated exit values of our remaining portfolio of companies.\r\nWe believe 2019 was a year full of important milestones that we would like to revisit as we look forward to the opportunities in front of us.\r\nThe most significant milestone in 2019 was the return of capital dividend that we paid in December.\r\nThat dividend was made possible by the successful completion of the first stage of our return of capital strategy, accomplishing a series of successful exits, including Propeller and Transactis earlier in 2019 and the repayment of our $85 million in debt.\r\nThe six major exit transactions that we have executed since the beginning of 2018 have allowed us to not only repay our debt but also to continue to support our portfolio as and where appropriate as it has grown and matured.\r\nIn aggregate, to date, we have returned over $187 million to our balance sheet, including over $104 million in 2019 via exit transactions since we began our new strategic direction in 2018.\r\nThe disciplined approach to managing our portfolio and realizing exit proceeds has not only resulted in Safeguard being debt free and initiating our return of value transactions, but also provided us with $25 million of cash today that is sufficient to fund our scaled down operations and expected deployments.\r\nMost importantly, Safeguard continues to hold a valuable portfolio of ownership interests, representing approximately $230 million of deployed capital in 15 tech-enabled companies and our other ownership interests.\r\nOur companies as a whole are growing and are being positioned for exits.\r\nSix of our companies have run rates of between $5 million and $10 million of annual revenue.\r\nAnother six have run rates of over $10 million.\r\nAnd the average growth rate of the non-digital media companies is 54%.\r\nAs with all growth stage portfolios, there remain challenges and obstacles that we will need to overcome before exits occur, but we are encouraged by our group of entrepreneurial companies and the progress they are each making toward their strategic goals.\r\nSafeguard's return of value to shareholders plan going forward continues to be straightforward.\r\nWhenever we have cash and cash equivalents exceeding our minimum required capital, currently $25 million, we will evaluate a return of value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner in the form of either share repurchases and/or dividends.\r\nWe are also continually evaluating different opportunities to exit partner companies either through the sale of entire companies, the sale of SFE stakes, recapitalization and other methods.\r\nTo preserve cash and in a continuing effort to downsize all facets of our cost structure and to further align interest with our shareholders, our Board will be reduced from six to four directors as of our 2020 Annual Meeting, and director compensation is now being paid entirely in Safeguard equity.\r\nWhile we are pleased with what we've accomplished over the last two years, we realize that there is much work left to be done and significant value yet to be realized for our shareholders.\r\nWe remain committed to being good stewards of Safeguard's assets and continuing our pursuit of additional exit transactions that will monetize our ownership interests and return value to shareholders.\r\nWe continue the pursuit of individual company exits while considering all alternatives as circumstances dictate, including the sale of individual partner company interests in secondary market transactions, the sale of entire companies or a combination thereof.\r\nWe will also continue to consider financing transactions which could expedite the return of value to our shareholders.\r\nWe are constantly dialoging with our partner companies, other investors and board members of those companies concerning exit opportunities.\r\nA significant number of our companies have active bank relationships in place to assist in those discussions.\r\nWe remain bullish regarding our portfolio of companies, and we continue to believe that the current value of our ownership interests and our cash and cash equivalents significantly exceed our current share price.\r\nWe've accomplished a lot under our new strategy, including streamlining our internal operations to reduce costs, repaying our debt and moving forward with strategic transactions involving our companies that have returned significant capital back to Safeguard, which has also allowed us to retire our debt and implement our return of capital program.\r\nWe are pleased with what we have accomplished, but much work is left to be done.\r\nWe continue to work with our other companies on potential exits, and we hope to have more news to share in the coming months.\r\nWe believe that our companies will continue to mature and attract strategic and financial buyer attention as we continue to explore the exit alternatives we referenced above.\r\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Safeguard's net income was $54.6 million or $2.64 per share.\r\nThat's compared with a net loss of $15.6 million or $0.76 per share for the same period in 2018.\r\nOur fourth quarter resulted in a net loss of $0.7 million or $0.03 per share as compared with a net loss of $16.6 million or $0.81 per share for the same quarter in 2018.\r\nTwo large elements impacting the financial results and our financial position for the fourth quarter included the continued downward trajectory of our general and administrative costs as compared to prior periods and of course the $1 per share return of capital dividend.\r\nWe'll speak to those further later in the call, but let me first comment on our liquidity position.\r\nSafeguard's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and securities at December 31, 2019 totaled $25 million, and we have no debt obligations.\r\nAs we've discussed on prior calls, this is the initial targeted level of minimum capital we have determined necessary in order to fund follow-on deployments to support our existing ownership interests and to fund our scaled down corporate structure for multiple years.\r\nWe are eager to continue our process of returning value to shareholders as soon as we have additional cash to do so.\r\nAs we've also previously discussed, the Board declared a $1 per share special dividend that was paid on December 30.\r\nOur year-end results have confirmed our previous analysis that our cumulative and year-to-date earnings and profits allow this dividend to be characterized as a return of capital for federal tax purposes.\r\nNow I'll move back to our results of operations for the 2019 year, which includes the previously disclosed successes such as a $35.1 million gain from the exit of Propeller and a $50.7 million gain related to the exit from Transactis.\r\nIn addition, we have recorded aggregate gains of $4.3 million for additional amounts received for holdbacks and escrows  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Safeguard Scientifics reported a strong 2019, with a net income of $54.6 million ($2.64 per share) despite a Q4 net loss of $0.7 million ($0.03 per share). The company attributed these results to successful exits, such as Propeller and Transactis, and a reduction in general and administrative expenses. Safeguard continues to monitor its portfolio, which has an aggregate value of approximately $230 million across 15 tech-enabled companies. The portfolio is performing well, with six companies having annual revenue run rates between $5 million and $10 million and another six with run rates over $10 million. The average growth rate of non-digital media companies is 54%. To enhance shareholder value, Safeguard plans to return excess cash via share repurchases or dividends and is exploring various exit opportunities for its portfolio companies. Despite a $25 million cash reserve, Safeguard expects additional deployments between $5 million and $10 million in 2020 to support existing ownership interests. The company remains optimistic about its portfolio and believes its current value significantly exceeds its share price.</s>"}

Jeremy Smeltser, Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Lewis, Chief Operating Officer.\r\nTurning to slides three and four.\r\nActual results may differ materially.\r\nBefore I get started, I want to take a moment and speak directly to our employees and our partners around the world.\r\nWhile our work is far from complete, our financial results reflect another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth and further confirm that we are structuring for growth and efficiency to serve our consumers, customers and stakeholders.\r\nI'm also very proud of the progress we've made these past three years.\r\nOur teams have embraced both our new global operating model and the spirit of our servant leadership culture.\r\nThey've also persevered through a global pandemic to deliver excellent and consistent financial performance for our stakeholders.\r\nBecause of you, our employees, the new Spectrum Brands has emerged a more efficient, focused, productive and consistent operating company.\r\nWe will continue to be driven by our values of trust, accountability and collaboration to serve our mission as we make living better at home.\r\nOur latest financial results for the second quarter reflect another excellent quarter of top line growth and operating leverage.\r\nOur investments in marketing and advertising for our trusted brands were higher in each of our business units, and this continued to drive strong demand this quarter.\r\nOur second quarter revenue grew 22.6% as we achieved double-digit growth across all of our business units.\r\nAnd our e-commerce sales grew nearly 43%.\r\nTurning to the bottom line.\r\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 28.8% driven by higher volumes and improved efficiencies from our Global Productivity Improvement Program.\r\nOur operating leverage also improved despite higher inflation and incremental investments that we're making in marketing and advertising.\r\nAs we outlined during our prior earnings calls, our reinvestments continue to reignite the flywheel of new product launches, improving our top line growth, expanding our margins and driving greater profitability and cash flow generation.\r\nIf I could have everyone turn now to slide seven.\r\nAs has been well-documented, transportation and commodity-related inflation continue to negatively impact our industry.\r\nConsistent with our highlights last quarter, we expect these headwinds to more heavily impact the second half of the year.\r\nBut despite these headwinds, our stellar first half performance and our continued organic growth give us confidence in again raising our earnings framework to reflect mid-teens net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth, adjusted free cash flow of $260 million to $280 million.\r\nWe are well positioned going into the third quarter.\r\nAnd while we recognize tough comparisons as we lap last year's fourth quarter performance, we will continue to focus on disciplined execution of our winning playbook, leveraging our stable manufacturing and distribution footprint and investing behind our strong brands.\r\nWe remain laser-focused on capturing gross GPIP savings.\r\nAnd in fact, our teams are targeting incremental savings for 2022.\r\nRandy will highlight that in more detail later on.\r\nOur new operating model and deliberate investments behind our business units over the last few years have built a stronger and much more resilient company, and we continue to expect long-term growth.\r\nNow moving to slide eight.\r\nOur balance sheet this quarter improved sequentially, ending the quarter with net leverage of 3.2 times and over -- and maintaining over $860 million in total liquidity.\r\nOur actions earlier this quarter to refinance our debt are expected to reduce our annual interest expense by $18 million a year.\r\nAs a reminder, we issued $900 million of total debt with a mix of Term Loan B and a new 10-year three 7/8 senior notes, which will lower our cost of capital.\r\nAs announced in April, we are very excited to add the recent acquisition of Rejuvenate to our portfolio.\r\nRejuvenate is a leading developer and marketer of household cleaning products, maintenance and restoration products with an incredible loyal following.\r\nWe expect the transaction to close in the third quarter.\r\nAnd this fits perfectly with our company's strategy to make living better at home, and it adds a fourth category to our Home & Garden business unit.\r\nI'm confident in our ability to create tremendous value together.\r\nTurning to slide nine.\r\nGoing forward, our capital allocation priorities continue to focus on: One, allocating capital internally to our highest-return opportunities, and this includes strengthening our brands through consumer insights, research and development, innovation and advertising and marketing to drive vitality and profitable organic growth; two, we plan to return cash to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases; third, disciplined M&A with tuck-in strategic acquisitions that are synergistic and help drive value creation.\r\nWe will continue to target a net leverage ratio in the three to 4 times range.\r\nNow you'll hear more from Jeremy on the financials, and Randy will give you an update and additional business insights.\r\nOver to you, Jeremy.\r\nTurning to slide 11 and a review of Q2 results from continuing operations.\r\nI'll begin with net sales.\r\nNet sales increased 22.6%.\r\nExcluding the impact of $18 million of favorable foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $26.8 million, organic net sales increased 18% with double-digit growth across all four business units.\r\nGross profit increased $75.1 million, and gross margin of 35.1% was in line with the year ago driven by higher volumes in all business units, improved efficiencies from our Global Productivity Improvement Program and favorable mix, offset by higher freight and input cost inflation and last year's retrospective tariff excluding benefits.\r\nSG&A expense of $262.2 million increased 13.1% at 22.8% of net sales, with the dollar increase driven by improved volumes, higher advertising and marketing investments and incentive and distribution costs.\r\nOperating income of $116.8 million was driven by improved volumes, improved productivity and lower restructuring costs partially offset by input cost inflation, marketing and advertising investments and incentive costs.\r\nNet income and diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by the operating income growth and favorability from Energizer investments, offset by higher debt refinance costs.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share improved to $1.76 driven by operating income growth along with lower shares outstanding.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 28.8% from the prior year primarily driven by growth across all business units.\r\nTurning to slide 12.\r\nQ2 interest expense from continuing operations of $65.5 million increased $30 million due to the debt refinancing costs.\r\nCash taxes during the quarter of $11.9 million were $4.4 million lower than last year.\r\nDepreciation and amortization from continuing operations of $38.7 million was $2.3 million higher than the prior year.\r\nSeparately, share- and incentive-based compensation decreased from $14.6 million last year to $8.5 million this year driven by the change to incentive compensation payout methodology we talked about last year.\r\nCash payments for transactions were $3.1 million, down from $6 million last year.\r\nAnd restructuring and related payments were $7.6 million versus $12.8 million last year.\r\nMoving to the balance sheet.\r\nThe company had a cash balance of $290 million and approximately $577 million available on its $600 million cash flow revolver.\r\nAt the end of the quarter, total debt outstanding was approximately $2.6 billion, consisting of approximately $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $400 million of term loans and Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before getting into the details of the quarter's performance, I would like to remind everyone that the year-ago quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nGiven the significant negative impact that this had on our fiscal Q2 2020 results, the year-over-year comparisons that we discuss today are greater than normal in magnitude.\r\nOur fiscal Q2 results came in well ahead of our expectations, fueled by continued strong demand environment.\r\nTotal revenue for Q2 was up 31% year-over-year to $5.9 billion.\r\nGross profit increased 20% or $55 million compared to the prior year to $329 million.\r\nGross margin was 5.6%, down from 6.1% in the prior year, primarily due to product mix.\r\nTotal adjusted SG&A expense was $159 million or 2.7% of revenue, down $14 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to COVID-related expenses in the prior year.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income was $170 million, improved by $68 million or 67% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating margin was 2.9%, up 62 basis points year-over-year.\r\nQ2 interest expense and finance charges were approximately $23 million and the effective tax rate was 25%, both in line with our expectation.\r\nTotal non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $109 million, up $44 million and improved by 68% over the prior year.\r\nAnd non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.09, up from $1.26 in the prior year.\r\nNow turning to the balance sheet.\r\nWe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion and debt of $1.6 billion.\r\nAccounts receivable totaled $2.5 billion, down 12% year-over-year and inventories totaled $2.7 billion, flat from the prior year.\r\nOur cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was 26 days, 17 days improved from last year.\r\nThe decrease was driven by DSO improvements and better inventory turns.\r\nCash generated from operations was approximately $280 million in the quarter.\r\nAnd including our cash and credit facilities, we had approximately $3.1 billion of available liquidity.\r\nWe are pleased to report that our Board of Directors have approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share for the current quarter.\r\nThe dividend is expected to be paid on July 30, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 16, 2021.\r\nBefore moving to our Q3 outlook, let me provide a brief update regarding our proposed merger with Tech Data.\r\nSince our announcement in March, we have established the capital structure for the planned merger through a new $5 billion credit facility and are on track with the debt financing for the merger.\r\nNow moving to our outlook for fiscal Q3.\r\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5.45 billion.\r\nThis estimate does not contemplate any impact related to the customer consignment change that we have previously spoken about.\r\nAt this time, we no longer expect the change to occur within our fiscal 2021.\r\nNon-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $99.9 million to $110.4 million.\r\nAnd non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10 per diluted share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 51.9 million.\r\nOur Q3 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance exclude the after-tax cost of $7 million or $0.13 per share related to the amortization of intangibles and $5.3 million or $0.10 per share related to share-based compensation.\r\nWith our quarter starting off with the Tech Data merger announcement, there was a potential of this news being a distraction to our daily efforts.\r\nAs expected though, our team executed very well, provided exceptional service to our customers and continued to expertly manage through the ongoing dynamics of our industry and the pandemic.\r\nFor Q2, our results came in above our internal expectations due to continued demand for remote capability, digital transformation, the ongoing recovery of office and data center IT purchasing and overall above-market growth.\r\nEssentially, every product category we participate in saw strength in the quarter, most notably notebooks, Chromebooks, cloud, security, services, networking and collaboration.\r\nOur manufacturing business also performed very well with results above the high end of our internal forecast.\r\nThe demand came from across most all our customer segments with SMB and public sector leading the way.\r\nFrom a geographical perspective, all regions were at expectations or better.\r\nRegarding our proposed merger with Tech Data, everything is going well.\r\nAs Marshall mentioned, we are set up for an effective financing of the transaction.\r\nOur proxy has been filed and our shareholder meeting will be held next week.\r\nAnd from a regulatory standpoint, we have received clearance from a number of governmental authorities and expect the rest to process through normal course.\r\nAs would be expected, the COVID pandemic has led to review delays in some countries.\r\nWe still believe our transaction will close in the second half of 2021, reflective of the typical six to eight months announced to close time frame for a deal of this size and complexity.\r\nSince the announcement of the transaction, we have continued to receive internal and external support for the merger.\r\nThe integration work we have performed since the announcement, albeit limited due to regulatory rules, further supports the strategic benefits of this deal that we discussed in March.\r\nWe look forward to sharing more when the transaction closes later this year.\r\nMoving to our outlook.\r\nOur priority remains on the health and safety of our associates.\r\nOverall, we are optimistic about the IT spending environment, given the current strong demand, the expectation of more geographies reopening and the resumption of on-premise enterprise IT projects.\r\nWe believe these factors represent potential tailwinds for our business.\r\nSpecific to our Q3 guidance.\r\nWe are planning for continued growth in our distribution business but have added a bit of conservatism in the forecast this quarter given the widely reported supply chain component challenges.\r\nConsidering our current backlog, still very strong, we know the business is there.\r\nIt just remains to be seen when it will transact.\r\nFor our manufacturing business, we use the low end of our internal range for forecasting purposes.\r\nThis low end for manufacturing will reflect the decline over Q3 last year.\r\nThis is a result of the very strong prior-year quarter, the over-forecast achievement in Q2 of this year and the overall unpredictable nature of this business.\r\nTaking all these factors into account, we believe our Q3 view reflects a balanced outlook, which incorporates all the various puts and takes of the current environment.\r\nHopefully a conservative view, and as always, we'll strive to do better.\r\nI am confident with ongoing execution we will continue to progress on our stated strategy of improving our core business, driving organic growth, increasing our value-added services and products and successfully closing our proposed merger with Tech Data.\r\n Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment, especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic.\r\nWe have not yet seen a uniform recovery as there are still many regions around the world that have been ravaged by the pandemic.\r\nAs many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment.\r\nOur colleagues and customers that are very much on our minds and we are working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families, and we're doing all we can to support our customers.\r\nDuring today's call, I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our three phase transformation plan focused on; Number 1, beginning our commercial momentum; Number 2, further strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and Number 3, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.\r\nNext, I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth.\r\nMike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter and full-year financial outlook.\r\nBriefly reviewing our operating results, for the first quarter revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year.\r\nThis strong start for the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier-than-expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and strong commercial execution by our team.\r\nLooking more closely at our top-line results.\r\nFirst, from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double-digits during the first quarter.\r\nOur largest market category pharma grew 28% in constant currency, industrial grew 24%, and academic and government grew 29%.\r\nMoving now to our sales performance by geography.\r\nOn a constant currency basis; sales in Asia grew 41%, with China up 109%; sales in Americas grew 14%, with US growing 13%; and sales in Europe grew 25%.\r\nFrom an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26%, while TA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis.\r\nCustomer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way driving better-than-expected trends in recurring revenues and a significant growth in instrument revenue.\r\nRecurring revenues grew 15%, with services growing 14% and chemistry consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand.\r\nLC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth.\r\nIt's encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units grow double-digits, driven by pent-up demand, integration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative.\r\nThe success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated and the ACQUITY PREMIER has been received very well by customers since its February launch.\r\nMass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the pharma market remains robust.\r\nIn addition to rebound, we saw in other markets, including clinical, food and environmental and biomedical research.\r\nDemand was solid for our tandem quads in Europe and China, particularly in pharma and in food.\r\nRevenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma medical devices and semiconductors.\r\nGrowth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electrophoresis.\r\nLooking deeper at our sales performance by geography.\r\nAll major regions grew double-digits.\r\nChina built further on last quarter's strength, more than doubling sales year-over-year, results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions.\r\nPharma was particularly strong in China, driven by triple-digit growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine.\r\nOur food business in China also saw meaningful growth, driven by a significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that were above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019.\r\nThis is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved.\r\nIndia sales grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country.\r\nEurope experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets, including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and academic and government markets.\r\nIn the US, both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter, while demand in our academic and government market remained soft as it lags behind other markets in reopening.\r\nIn summary, we had a great start for the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broadly based than last quarter.\r\nWith impressive performance across all our regions, end markets and product categories.\r\nPharma demand has not subsided and many of our non-pharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year.\r\nNow I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the Company, the effectiveness of the markets that we serve, and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term.\r\nOur three-phase transformation plan is; Number 1, beginning our commercial momentum; Number 2, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and Number 3, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.\r\nLooking at our first priority of beginning our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously.\r\nFirst, our instrument replacement initiative.\r\nWe delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%.\r\nIn February, we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER system augmenting the already solid placement of Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020, creating new opportunities for instrument replacements.\r\nAdditionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging tandem quad mass spec instruments with newer instruments.\r\nSecond, as part of our CROs CDMO expansion initiative, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double digits in both these customer segments.\r\nCustomers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor.\r\nThird, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results, search engine optimization and paid search had lead to search impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year.\r\nWhile not every click translates to immediate revenue increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts.\r\nFourth, driving launch excellence.\r\nLet me start with liquid chromatography.\r\nWhile the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY PREMIER.\r\nLast year we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER Columns and follow that up with the ACQUITY PREMIER System last quarter.\r\nThough, we are still in the early stages of the revenue ramp up for both the Columns and the System sales of ACQUITY PREMIER Columns are significantly outpacing prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY Columns.\r\nTurning to mass spec.\r\nIn 2019, we launched the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos and a next generation version of our TQ-S micro.\r\nPairing our tandem quad with ACQUITY PREMIER creates industry-leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays.\r\nWith expanding applications of the BioAccord, we've ma Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst President and Chief Executive Officer.\r\nActual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors.\r\nAs we look back over our fiscal year 2021, we are pleased with what we have accomplished as a team in the face of what continues to be a unique and challenging operating environment.\r\nDuring the year, our Company and the communities that we operate and then serve continue to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nProgress was certainly made at the introduction of vaccines has allowed for improvements in the overall public health situation as well as the reopening of many businesses.\r\nAs you are all keenly aware however, the challenges related to COVID-19 continue to evolve and are not fully behind us just yet.\r\nI also want to continue to highlight that for over a year now, our team partners have continued to put forth tremendous efforts in the face of the many obstacles created by the pandemic.\r\nThey've worked extremely hard to take care of each other and our customers during these extraordinarily challenging times.\r\nFor our full year fiscal 2021, the Company reported revenues of $1.826 billion exceeding fiscal 2020's total of $1.804 billion.\r\nWhen we provided guidance at the beginning of the fiscal year, we had articulated that showing any growth during fiscal 2021 would be a challenge.\r\nTherefore, overall, we were pleased with this outcome.\r\nOur Core Laundry Operations revenue over the second half of the year were positively impacted by a modest level of customer reopenings as well as increases in the sale of PPE.\r\nIn addition, our Specialty Garments segment was also a strong contributor to our overall results, producing a record year from a top and bottom line perspective.\r\nFrom a profit perspective, full year diluted earnings per share was $7.94 compared to $7.13 in fiscal 2020.\r\nThe improved earnings comparison for the full year was primarily due to our depressed results in the second half of fiscal 2020 when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was greatest on our business, primarily in the form of customer closures.\r\nShane will provide the details of our fourth quarter results shortly.\r\nAs we've talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructure and our technologies.\r\nAll of our investments designed to deliver solid long-term returns to our UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components to our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in the industry.\r\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2022, there are number of key initiatives, we are excited about progressing as we continue to transform the Company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning.\r\nThe first being the rollout of our new CRM system which we have spoken quite a bit about previously.\r\nWe continue to make solid progress on this key initiative, which we will continue -- which will continue through fiscal 2022 and well into fiscal 2023.\r\nThe second is an investment in the UniFirst brand.\r\nOur brand is an area that has not been significantly invested in over the years and we are excited for this revitalization which will not only evolve the look and feel of who UniFirst is, but will solidify our message internally and externally around what we stand for as a company and why we are a great choice for existing and prospective customers and employees.\r\nFinally, during fiscal 2022, we will be embarking on a multi-year project to implement a corporate wide ERP system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology.\r\nThis phase initiative will become the core of UniFirst technology footprint and will integrate and complement the capabilities of the CRM system, we are currently deploying.\r\nFrom an operating standpoint, heading into fiscal 2022, we carry solid momentum from a top line perspective into the year.\r\nDespite the external challenges that the team has hindered, our sales performance has been very solid selling both new business as well as internally to our existing customers.\r\nIn addition, our customer retention for fiscal 2021 was much improved compared to recent years.\r\nWe also will clearly be looking to work with our customers to sharing the cost increases that we are experiencing in various aspects of the business.\r\nAs a result of these top line drivers, we expect organic growth for fiscal 2022 to exceed what we've been experiencing in recent years.\r\nShane will provide the details of our outlook shortly.\r\nFrom a bottom line perspective, there are two categories of costs.\r\nWe expect to present challenges from a margin perspective in fiscal 2022.\r\nThe first group consists of costs that are bouncing back from depressed levels during the pandemic, and costs that are being impacted by the increasingly inflationary environment.\r\nLast quarter, I highlighted some of these items including merchandise amortization, costs related to raw materials and the overall supply chain disruption, the cost to hire and retain labor, energy and travel.\r\nThe second group consists of investments we are making in the future of our company.\r\nA subset of these costs relate to building stronger overall capabilities as a company that we feel are necessary to enhance our competitors -- competitiveness, accelerate growth and ultimately improve efficiency and profitability.\r\nThese investments are being made in several areas including human resources, supply chain, central services and marketing among others.\r\nIn addition, significant costs are expected to be invested in fiscal 2022 and upcoming years related to the three discrete initiatives I discussed earlier.\r\nGoing forward we'll be carving out the portion of costs related to these initiatives that we view are transitionary, and excluding them from a measure of adjusted profitability and we will continue to report until these key initiatives are completed.\r\nYou can expect we'll be providing regular communication during our quarterly earnings calls regarding cost that we are expanding during these large initiatives, so investors can have a better sense of what our results look like excluding some of these costs.\r\nEven excluding these transitory costs related to these large initiatives, our margins will be pressured in fiscal '22 by investments we continue to make in our overall capabilities.\r\nHowever, we feel strongly about the need to invest in these areas and believe in the future benefits they will provide.\r\nWe also firmly believe, on the other side of these initiatives, there will be opportunities not only to rationalize the direct costs related to these initiatives, but to improve the overall efficiency of our cost structure that currently is working to support multiple systems through this technology transformation.\r\nOur solid balance sheet positions us well to meet our ongoing challenges while continuing to make these investments in growth and strengthen our business.\r\nWe also continue to routinely evaluate our strategy around capital allocation.\r\nAs part of that review, we announced earlier today, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share of the Company's common stock and $0.24 per share on the Company's Class B common stock.\r\nAt this time, we believe that a continued annual increase to our dividend was over time expands, commensurate with our free cash flow generation will be a foundational piece to our capital allocation strategy.\r\nIn addition, we have reloaded our share purchase authorization program to allow for the Company to purchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares.\r\nAnd finally, as always we continue to focus on providing our valuable products and services to existing customers and selling new customers on the value UniFirst can bring to their business.\r\nAs we have discussed, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and service Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Despite pandemic challenges, UniFirst reported revenue of $1.826 billion for fiscal 2021, exceeding its previous year's total. Contributing to this growth were modest customer reopenings and increased PPE sales. The Specialty Garments segment also performed strongly, achieving record results in both revenue and profitability. Earnings per share improved to $7.94, driven by lower pandemic-related impacts in the second half of the year. However, the company anticipates margin pressure in fiscal 2022 due to rising costs and investments in technology and infrastructure. Organic growth is projected to exceed recent trends, while diluted earnings per share are estimated to range between $5.70 and $6.10, excluding transitionary costs related to major initiatives. To mitigate margin pressures, UniFirst is implementing cost-sharing measures with customers. Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic due to the essential nature of its services and ongoing capital allocation initiatives, including a 20% dividend increase and a new $100 million share repurchase authorization.</s>"}

which differ from net income as reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States.\r\nAt the conclusion of their remarks, there will be time for your question.\r\nPSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.65 per share.\r\nNon-GAAP operating earnings for the full year rose by 4.6% to $3.43 per share, and mark the 16th year in a row that PSE&G delivered results within our original earnings guidance.\r\nPSE&G GAAP results were $0.85 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $0.86 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019.\r\nIn addition for the full year PSE&G reported 2020 net income of $3.76 per share compared with $3.33 per share in 2019.\r\nDetails on the results for the quarter and the full year can be found on slides 12 and 14.\r\nI am pleased to report that the PSE&G's fourth quarter and full year results reflected solid contributions from both PSE&G and PSEG Power.\r\nAnd I'm particularly proud of the achievements of our employees during this past year as it was one of the most challenging in recent memory.\r\nTheir efforts have kept our customers connected to essential energy services to power their homes, businesses, and vitally important institutions.\r\nWe have also made steady progress in several key business priorities, the most important of which is our transition to becoming primarily a regulated utility, with contract and generation comprise about zero carbon nuclear fleet and future investments in regional offshore wind.\r\nIn the past six months, we've announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's 7,200 plus megawatts of non Nuclear Generating assets, and received initial indications of interest for both the fossil and solar source assets.\r\nPSE&G successfully initiated its landmark clean energy future program, securing approval to spend nearly $2 billion in energy efficiency, smart meter installations and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all of which will enhance New Jersey's environmental profile for years to come.\r\nIn addition, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, I'll refer to them as the BPU recently concluded public hearings regarding PSE&G nuclear application to extend the zero-emission certificate.\r\nI think I'll shorten that to ZEC from now on through May 2025.\r\nOur service area experience milder than the normal weather during the fourth quarter, book ending the week heating season of the first quarter in 2020.\r\nRegarding whether normalized sales for the year, while total electric sales volume declined by 2%.\r\nGas sales rose by 1%.\r\nIn both the electric and gas businesses higher residential usage of approximately 5% largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales resulting in stable margins overall.\r\nWorking with COVID-19 health and safety protocols since last March, PSE&G was able to execute on its plan $2.7 billion capital spending program in 2020.\r\nThese capital programs provide a critical investment to support the New Jersey economy, particularly in the early months of the pandemic, and preserve essential jobs while replacing vitally important energy infrastructure, and generating customer benefits of improved reliability and resiliency, as well as methane reduction.\r\nIn January of 2021, the BPU approved two settlements with PSE&G and other parties in the clean energy future energy, cloud and electric vehicle proceedings.\r\nThe energy cloud investment program is estimated to be approximately $707 million over the next four years, and will result in the replacement of over 2 million electric meters with smart meters.\r\nThe electric vehicle program will direct $166 million into EV charging infrastructure over the next six years.\r\nWith these recent settlements, the BPU has constructively addressed the vast majority of the clean energy future filings and has approved nearly $2 billion of investment to help realize New Jersey's energy goals.\r\nThe Energy Efficiency Program will also be established clean energy job training for over 3,200 direct jobs, while enabling the avoidance of 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions through the year 2015.\r\nInvesting in energy efficiency programs is the most cost-effective solution to reducing carbon emissions.\r\nImportantly, the conservation incentive of the settlement encourages the broad adoption of energy efficiency, with certain programs focusing on low- and moderate-income customers that will lower bills for participating customers.\r\nWe expect the balance of the clean energy future filing, which includes our request to spend under $200 million on energy storage, and a few remaining EV programs will be addressed following future stakeholder proceeding.\r\nPSE&G continues to engage with the BPU staff and re counsel to advance confidential discussions toward a settlement of the return on equity related to PSE&G formula rate for transmission overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\r\nThe annual update under PSE&G existing formula rate filed last October was implemented this past January and together with cost reallocations of our revenue requirements for certain transmission projects, candidly to customers outside of our zone.\r\nThis resulted in a net reduction in PSE&G customer costs.\r\nFor 2020, PSE&G, once again achieved top quartile OSHA scores.\r\nWe also achieve the top quarter of JD Power ranking in the eastern large company category for both residential electric and gas companies.\r\nAnd PSE&G posted its best ever JD Power scores for electric and gas customer satisfaction outpacing the average industry results on metrics that consider total monthly cost, bill clarity, fairness of pricing and options and ability to manage monthly usage among residential customers.\r\nAlso for the 19th year in a row PA consulting recognized PSE&G with its reliability one award as the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic region and for the first time with our 2020 outstanding customer engagement award.\r\nNew Jersey has recently made solid progress in lowering its COVID-19 positivity rates, and continues to face the reopening of businesses, schools and other activities.\r\nWe have a long history of partnering with the state to support the economy.\r\nAnd we continue to work with them on investment programs that can spur economic development and employment recovery, all while being quite thoughtful about managing customer rate impacts.\r\nRegarding collection activities, the moratorium on shut offs residential electric and gas services currently scheduled to conclude in March, recognizing the economic hardship that many of our customers continue to face PSE&G in partnership with the BPU and community groups is working hard to enroll customers and customer payments support programs, such as light heap and deferred payment rate.\r\nWhen the moratorium is lifted, we will work closely with the BPU other stakeholders and our customers to ensure a collections process that supports our customer's individual situations.\r\nTurning now PSEG Power, we're continuing all activities related to the exploration of strategic alternatives we announced last July.\r\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, we launched the formal sales processes of the 1,467 megawatt solar source, and over 6,750 megawatt thoughtful portfolios.\r\nWe are currently evaluating indications of interest, and believe we are on track to announce an outcome in the second half of 2021.\r\nAs we launched the strategic alternatives initiative last year, and throughout the process thus far, PSEG Power has continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA.\r\nLast year PSEG fossil posted one of its best operational performance records ever, and completed its entire maintenance outage schedule without any OSHA safety violations.\r\nIn

[/INST] # PSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, marking a 4.6% increase year-over-year. This increase was primarily attributed to higher transmission revenues, a strong performance by PSEG Power, and stable margins in both electric and gas businesses. Total electric sales declined by 2% while gas sales rose by 1%, with residential usage offsetting declines in commercial and industrial sales. Despite milder weather, solid contributions from PSE&G and PSEG Power drove the company's overall performance. PSE&G invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, while PSEG Power continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA. PSE&G Nuclear's application for the extension of zero-emission certificates was under consideration by the BPU, with the final decision expected on April 27th. The company expects an influx of investments in decarbonization, energy transition, and methane reduction projects in the coming years. For 2021, PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance is $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with regulated operations expected to contribute over 80% of consolidated results.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year.\r\nWe came into 2020 with great momentum and this continued into the first quarter, delivering 5.6% organic growth, then COVID-19 hit the US economy and things changed dramatically.\r\nWhile there was significant uncertainty, we knew we had a great team and resilient responses and innovative with a focus on providing solutions to our customers.\r\nIn addition, we were able to move -- we were able to quickly transition over 10,000 teammates to a no working environment in less than a week.\r\nSo they could pivot and effectively serve our customers.\r\nAs you may remember, we didn't grow as quickly in the second quarter due to the impact of the pandemic on our new business and the recording of revenue adjustments for general liability policies, but we still expanded our margins.\r\nAnd in the third quarter, we delivered outstanding results with strong organic growth and margin expansion.\r\nThe results of the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter as we finished the year strong and with good momentum going into '21.\r\nBased on what we were seeing, if you ask me, if it was likely that we would deliver full-year results with good organic growth and meaningful margin expansion, I would have said it was possible but unlikely that if you would ask me that in, let's say, April.\r\nWe are very pleased with our results for 2020.\r\nWe were able to deliver these results through the hard work of our teammates and their dedication to our customers.\r\n2020 was a testament to our laser focus on delivering innovative risk solutions.\r\nWe also thought the M&A landscape would cool off for several quarters until there was some sort of economic stability.\r\nThe slowdown only occurred for about one quarter and the industrywide activity is now rebounded a pre-COVID-19 levels.\r\nEven with the uncertainty this year, we're very pleased that completed 25 acquisitions and $197 million of acquired annual revenue.\r\nI'd like to highlight two strategic acquisitions, CoverHound that we completed in the fourth quarter, and O'Leary Insurances that we announced in the fourth quarter and closed on the 14th of January.\r\nRegarding CoverHound, this acquisition will help us in many ways.\r\nFirst, it will help us further our investment in technology, drive our innovation agenda and improve our carrier connectivity.\r\nSecond, it enables us to more effectively and efficiently provide quotes and bond coverage for our National Programs segment.\r\nThird, it enables us to better serve smaller customers within our retail segment.\r\nUltimately, these items are focused on enhancing the customer buying experience by delivering curated quotes that best meet the needs of our customers.\r\nWe believe these new capabilities are unique in the marketplace.\r\nWe started 2020 with the acquisition Special Risk in British Columbia and finished the year with our acquisition of O'Leary Insurances in Ireland.\r\nO'Leary was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace.\r\nThis acquisition strengthens our European operations, which we look forward to further developing in the years ahead.\r\nOur new teammates and capability to deliver many opportunities over the coming years.\r\nWe're extremely proud of our results in 2020 in the delivery of total shareholder returns in excess of 20%.\r\nAnd Steve Boyd will become our President of Wholesale.\r\nSteve's background in National Programs as an operator and in technology brings critical skills to the leadership team in Wholesale as we continue to grow this important business through innovative solutions.\r\nI'm excited that Tony and Steve will be working together to further drive this growth in the future.\r\nNow, let's transition to the results of the quarter and the full-year.\r\nI'm on Slide number 3.\r\nWe delivered strong results again this quarter, total revenue of $642 million, growing 10.9% in total and 4.7% organically.\r\nAgain into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.\r\nOur EBITDAC margin was 27.1%, which is up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019.\r\nPlease remember that the fourth quarter of '19 included a gain on sale of business that benefited the prior year margin by approximately 100 basis points.\r\nOur net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34, increasing 25% on an as-reported basis.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3% over the prior year.\r\nOur team did an outstanding job of continuing to profitably grow our revenue, as well as manage our expenses in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19.\r\nDuring the quarter, we completed another nine acquisitions with annual revenues of approximately $80 million.\r\nFor the year, we grew total revenues of 9.2% and delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%.\r\nThis is an outstanding performance given the economic headwinds experienced for most of the year.\r\nWe improved our EBITDAC margin for -- by 110 basis points to 31.1%, compared to 2019 as we leverage the growth in organic revenue and managed our expenses in response to the pandemic.\r\nOur net income per share for the full-year of '20 increased 20.7% to $1.69 from $1.40 in 2019.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-outs, net income per share increased 19.3%.\r\nLastly, we had another strong year of M&A activity, as I said earlier, closing 25 acquisitions with approximately $197 million of annual revenue, adding many excellent businesses and teammates.\r\nNow, on Slide 5.\r\nIn prior calls, we talked about factors that would impact the economic recovery, which included the elections, the approval of the vaccine and the timing of the rollout, as well as how much additional stimulus will be approved.\r\nThe timing of the vaccine rollout and the approval of additional stimulus will have the largest impact upon the recovery of the economy will influence business leaders confidence about rehiring and investing in their businesses.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continue to see companies doing well and other struggling mightily.\r\nWe've seen improving new business and our retention remains good.\r\nHowever, we continue to believe it will be choppy -- a choppy recovery through at least the end of 2021 and maybe into early 2022.\r\nFrom a rate standpoint, the fourth quarter was very similar to the third quarter, most standard rates were up 3% to 7% with E&S rates up 10% to 25% as compared to the prior year.\r\nAs we've talked about before, the main driver of rate increases continues to be loss experience.\r\nCommercial auto rates remain up 10% or more and workers' compensation rates are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters, but they are still negative.\r\nThere has been a lot of talk over the past few quarters that workers' compensation rates are turning positive.\r\nHowever, we're still not seeing it across the board yet.\r\nFor an E&S perspective, coastal property, both wind and quake are up 15% to 25%.\r\nProfessional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry.\r\nWe continue to see outliers to be wanted to coverage.\r\nPersonal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast states remain under intense pressure as carriers are seeking to reduce their exposure due to fires and tropical activity during 2020.\r\nWe expect the reduction in personal lines capacity continue throughout '21.\r\nPlacing coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with significant losses continues to be challenging.\r\nThis includes excess or umbrella coverage, where a carrier or carriers will seek a combination of lower limit and higher premium rates.\r\nWe don't expect this trend to materially change in '21.\r\nNow, on Slide number 6.\r\nLet's discuss the performance of our four segments.\r\nOur Retail segment, organic revenue growth grew by 1.5% for the fourth quar Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n On the call are Jeff Mezger, chairman, president, and chief executive officer; Matt Mandino and Rob McGibney, executive vice presidents and co-chief operating officers; Jeff Kaminski, executive vice president and chief financial officer; Bill Hollinger, senior vice president and chief accounting officer; and Thad Johnson, senior vice president and treasurer.\r\nAnd with that, here is Jeff Mezger.\r\nWe had a remarkable year in 2021, producing revenue growth in excess of 35% and an increase in our earnings per share of more than 90%.\r\nWe achieved our objectives of expanding our scale and profitability, driving our return on equity up by over 800 basis points to 20%.\r\nOur results are even more notable considering they were accomplished despite the supply chain challenges and municipal delays that were pervasive throughout the year as our teams have been successfully navigating these issues.\r\nAs we begin 2022, we are poised to continue delivering returns-focused growth.\r\nOur backlog value of $5 billion, which grew 67% year over year provides a strong base to support our roughly $7.4 billion in expected revenues in 2022.\r\nThis represents substantial top-line expansion, which combined with our expectation of a dramatic increase in our gross margin to nearly 26% will drive our return on equity meaningfully higher.\r\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.91, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 70% on the bottom line.\r\nWe achieved an operating income margin approaching 12%, resulting in a 28% expansion in our operating profit per unit to over $56,000.\r\nIn addition to this significant profit growth, our business is generating a healthy level of cash flow, and we remain consistent in our balanced approach toward allocating this capital.\r\nDisciplined investment in community count growth is our top priority.\r\nAnd in 2021, we put over $2.5 billion to work in land acquisition and development.\r\nWe expanded our lot position to nearly 87,000 lots under control, which is almost 30% higher from year-end 2020.\r\nOur lot position is diversified both across and within our regions, and we own all of the lots that we need for our anticipated 2022 delivery goals.\r\nWe also now own or control the lots that we need for sustained growth in 2023.\r\nIn addition to reinvesting in our business, we returned over $240 million in cash to stockholders through the share repurchases that we completed in our third quarter, along with our quarterly dividend, and we reduced our debt during the year by over $60 million.\r\nThroughout 2021, we implemented price increases across nearly all of our communities, along with managing lot releases to balance pace, price, and production in order to optimize each asset.\r\nAlthough costs rose as we move through the year, our pricing strength outpaced the rate of cost inflation, driving our backlog margins higher.\r\nThis dynamic continued in our fourth quarter contributing to a rise in our net order value of 12% year over year despite net orders decreasing 10%, a level similar to the decline in our community count.\r\nThis increase in net order value contributed to a backlog value that is more than 65% higher.\r\nWith the extension of our cycle times, most of the pricing power we experienced in 2021 will be reflected in our gross margin beginning in our 2022 second quarter.\r\nIn addition, our results will continue to benefit from structural tailwinds, including the performance of our more recently opened communities, where margins are running in excess of the company average.\r\nThe ongoing rotation into a higher quality mix of assets as the impact from reactivated communities continues to diminish, a reduction in amortized interest, and the impact that higher monthly deliveries per community has on field overhead.\r\nAll of these factors combined are driving our expectation of a gross margin of nearly 26% for this year.\r\nWe successfully opened 130 new communities in 2021, our largest number in many years, including 33 in the fourth quarter.\r\nThe higher lot count that I mentioned will enable us to accelerate our new community openings in 2022.\r\nAs a result, we now expect to end 2022 with about 265 communities, up over 20% year over year and ahead of our initial projection that we shared in September.\r\nIn addition of supporting our roughly 30% increase in revenue planned for 2022, our community count expansion will also contribute to our growth in 2023.\r\nOur monthly absorption per community of 5.5 net orders during the fourth quarter, reflected a typical seasonal pattern sequentially.\r\nFor the year, our absorption pace averaged 6.3 net orders per community per month, the best annual rate we have seen in more than a decade.\r\nHomebuyers value the choice and personalization inherent in our built-to-order model, which we believe is the primary reason that we have long generated among the highest absorption rates and the rates will rise this year.\r\nAnd with the strong home price appreciation the market has experienced, it is appropriate to spend a moment addressing affordability.\r\nOur strategy is to target the median household income of a submarket, positioning our homes to be attainable by the largest segment of buyers.\r\nWe strive to be below the median new home price and had a reasonable medium -- had a reasonable premium to the median resale price when we open a community and then be opportunistic in raising price based on demand at that location once opened.\r\nOur average selling price on deliveries rose about 9% year over year in 2021, well below the reported increase for overall pricing levels nationally, highlighting the affordability of our locations and products.\r\nAs we have discussed on previous calls, we track a number of internal key indicators to gauge changes in consumer behavior that could signal affordability challenges, which we are not seeing at this time.\r\nOne of the most telling of these is the square footage of homes that buyers are selecting as they will typically rotate down to a smaller home if they need to in order to achieve homeownership.\r\nAlthough we offer floor plans below 1,600 square feet in about 80% of our communities, buyers continue to choose larger footage homes.\r\nOver the past year, our deliveries have averaged between 2,000 and 2,100 feet, consistent with our historical trend.\r\nAnd our homes in backlog are slightly above that range.\r\nWe also look at our studio revenues and lot premiums, which we view as discretionary spending for our buyers.\r\nWe would expect to see a decline if buyers are stretched, but our studio revenues and lot premiums have increased even as base prices have risen.\r\nOn a combined basis, buyers spent about $48,000 per home in these two categories in the fourth quarter, a solid enhancement to our revenues.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, is the credit profile of our buyers.\r\nTheir average FICO score in the quarter was 732, an all-time high.\r\nIn addition, about two-thirds of our buyers qualified for a conventional mortgage, and our buyers overall are averaging a down payment of over $67,000.\r\nTaken together, these metrics illustrate our buyers' strong credit.\r\nI'll also note that the recent increases in loan limits, both conventional and FHA should help with mortgage financing, provided an incremental benefit to the industry.\r\nWe started over 3,800 homes during the quarter as we worked to position our production for growth in 2022 deliveries.\r\nAt year-end, we had over 9,100 homes in production with 90% of these homes already sold.\r\nGenerally, our cancellation rate once we start the home is extremely low, and at 5% in the fourth quarter, it remains so.\r\nWe're reflecting our customers' strong desire to purchase their personalized homes.\r\nAs to build times, while they expanded about two weeks sequentially in the quarter, we are encouraged to see some signs of stabilization.\r\nConstruction times in November and December were co Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm here today with Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn; and CFO, Joe Reitmeier.\r\nTodd will review key points for the quarter and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and outlook for 2021.\r\nTo give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and requeue for any additional questions.\r\nAll comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period.\r\nFor information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC.\r\nIn the first quarter, we continued to see strong momentum in our Residential business, combined with strong improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration, as the overall company set new first quarter highs for revenue, profit and earnings per share.\r\nOverall, for the company, revenue was up 29% to a new first quarter record of $931 million.\r\nAt constant currency, revenue was up 28%.\r\nGAAP operating income was a first quarter record $114 million, up 213%.\r\nGAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was a first quarter record $2.20, up 588%.\r\nTotal segment profit rose 208% to a first quarter record of $116 million.\r\nTotal segment margin expanded 720 basis points to 12.4%, and adjusted points to 12.4%, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 305% to a first quarter record $2.27.\r\nLooking at our business segments for the first quarter, we've realized double digit revenue growth and margin expansion in all three businesses.\r\nIn Residential, we set new first quarter highs for revenue and profit.\r\nResidential revenue was up 37%.\r\nSegment profit rose 197% and segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%.\r\nReplacement business was up more than 40% and new construction was up more than 25%.\r\nBreaking it down between our Lennox business and our Allied business, Lennox revenue was up about 25%, and Allied was up about 70%.\r\nLet me take a moment to unpack the strength we saw in Residential in the quarter.\r\nFirst, with strong operational execution, our Residential team is capitalizing on its ability to deliver to meet contractor and distributor demand and gain share.\r\nPost the 2018 tornado and the initial 2020 pandemic impact, we are back on offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for market share gains.\r\nSecond, Residential benefited from the colder winter weather with heating degree days up 13% from the first quarter last year.\r\nYou may recall, we had a soft first quarter in 2020.\r\nThird, I'd like to note that we had -- I would like to note that we had a 6% benefit to revenue for more days in the quarter this year than last year.\r\nThat happens every four years as we reset the calendar.\r\nConversely, the fourth quarter will have a 6% headwind from fewer days in the quarter this year.\r\nThis applies to Residential as well as all our other businesses.\r\nAdjusting for the days, Residential grew 31% with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.\r\nIn addition, for Allied, we had approximately $25 million of pull-forward in the first quarter from different distributor loading patterns this year than last year.\r\nAdjusted for both days and this pull-forward, Allied was up approximately 35% in the quarter.\r\nWorking through all this math I gave, adjusting for days and the pull-forward in our Allied business which sells to independent distribution, overall Residential segment revenue was up about 25%.\r\nWe believe this compares to mid-teen sell-through for the industry, driven in part by the favorable cold weather that I talked about.\r\nOur performance that is above that is due to market share gains.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are back on the offensive with production, distribution and executing our playbook for gaining share.\r\nThe team has had strong operational execution to drive this outperformance, and we are well positioned for the summer season and our largest season of quarters.\r\nIn Commercial, revenue, segment profit and margin were all first quarter records.\r\nRevenue is up 12%.\r\nAt constant currency, revenue was up 11%.\r\nSegment profit was up 47% and segment margin expanded 330 basis points to 13.8%.\r\nIn the first quarter, we saw broad strength in Commercial as year-over-year growth turned positive across all of our businesses.\r\nAt constant currency, Commercial equipment revenue was up mid-teens in the quarter.\r\nWithin this, replacement revenue was up mid-teens with planned replacement up mid-teens and emergency replacement up high teens.\r\nNew construction revenue was up high single digits.\r\nBreaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue is up mid-teens, national account equipment revenue is also up mid-teens.\r\nOur team won three new national account equipment customers in the quarter.\r\nOn the service side, the next National Accounts Services revenue was up mid-single digits.\r\nVRF revenue was up mid-30s percentage.\r\nSome highlights to mention for Commercial.\r\nSchools continue to be an area of focus for us.\r\nWe have a dedicated sales force and product line that will drive a multiyear growth opportunity for us in this market.\r\nToday, K-12 schools are just a little under 10% of revenue for this -- equipment revenue for this segment.\r\nThis business is up more than 20% for us in the first quarter.\r\nAnd given the recent stimulus package that benefits HVAC, indoor air quality spending for schools, we expect K3 schools to be a growth vertical for us moving forward.\r\nIndoor air quality continues to be an important focus for us with our building better air initiatives.\r\nMost interest and activity we are seeing are in this K-12 school segment but conversations are taking place with many customers across many industry verticals.\r\nWe have launched our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field and energy efficiency.\r\nThe Model L features variable speed technology and an all-new advanced control system.\r\nWe're seeing high customer interest in this industry-leading product for 2021 and beyond.\r\nOverall, for Commercial, entering the second quarter, momentum continues with backlog up double digits and strong order rates.\r\nIn Refrigeration for the first quarter, revenue was up 21%.\r\nAt constant currency, revenue is up 17%.\r\nIn North America, revenue was up more than 25%.\r\nEurope Refrigeration revenue was up low single digits at constant currency, and Europe HVAC revenue was up mid-single digits at constant currency.\r\nRefrigeration segment margin expanded 560 basis points to 6.3%.\r\nThe segment profit rose to $8 million from $1 million in the prior year quarter.\r\nLike in Commercial, momentum continues for Refrigeration entering the second quarter with backlog up double digits and strong order flow led by North America.\r\nThe strong performance for the company overall in the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter and year, we are raising 2021 guidance.\r\nWe now expect 7% to 11% revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.40 to $12.\r\nWe are also raising free cash flow guidance to $375 million for the full year.\r\nWe now assume about 55% of earnings in the first half of the year compared to the prior guidance of about 50%.\r\nThis reflects the strong first quarter performance and second quarter outlook.\r\nWe repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter and plan on another $200 million for a total of $400 million in our guidance for the year.\r\nI'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling.\r\nIn the quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was a first quarter record $606 million, up 37%.\r\nVolume was up 32%.\r\nPrice was up 1% and mix was up 4%.\r\nForeign exchange was neutral to revenue.\r\nResidential profit was a first

strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants.\r\nWe continue to retain about 80% of digital sales but have now recovered nearly 80% of in-restaurant sales.\r\nWhile COVID impacts will likely persist for a few more quarters, we are hopeful that the worst is behind us and society can shortly return to a more normal environment.\r\nFor the quarter, we reported record quarterly sales of $2 billion, representing 21.9% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales.\r\nRestaurant level margin of 23.5% was 400 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year.\r\nEarnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.02, representing an increase of 86.7% year-over-year.\r\nDigital sales growth of 8.6% year-over-year, representing 42.8% of sales and we opened 41 new restaurants, including 36 with a Chipotlane.\r\nAnd I'm pleased to report that Q4 is off to a great start.\r\nThese results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and allow us to win today, while we create the future.\r\nWhile we regularly get asked, what's next, I believe our current growth drivers have plenty of runway and will be critical to us reaching our longer-term goal of 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs above $3 million and improving returns on invested capital.\r\nTo remind everyone, we're focusing on five key areas.\r\nNumber one, opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences.\r\nNumber two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation.\r\nNumber three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience, and engagement.\r\nNumber four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions in frequency.\r\nAnd last but certainly not least, number five, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved.\r\nLet me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with operations.\r\nWell-trained and supported employees consistently preparing delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success.\r\nWe're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability, and excellent culinary, despite the dynamic and challenging environment.\r\nWe are extremely proud of Chipotle's world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education, and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities.\r\nWe believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees, which is more important than ever given the challenging labor environment we're all experiencing today.\r\nOver the past 18 months, we've made operational adjustments to adapt to our constantly changing environment in support of our in-restaurant business as well as our record-breaking digital business.\r\nAs a result, we've had to allocate labor as needed among the different roles, including the DML and the frontline, depending on available staff to accommodate the needs of our customers and our restaurant teams.\r\nThis flexibility has allowed us to keep our frontline open, given our ability to divert orders on the digital line as needed to overcome periodic staffing challenges.\r\nThis is part of the normal business balancing that occurs at the discretion of on-site managers and has not had a material impact on our business in the past.\r\nThis was through pre-pandemic and is more relevant now as dining room volumes recover.\r\nThe good news is that I believe we're finally getting back to pre-pandemic operations and I couldn't be more excited.\r\nWe're fortunate to have a dedicated digital make line and a dedicated dining room serving line.\r\nOur frontline represented nearly 60% of our business or $1.1 billion of sales for the quarter.\r\nIt is big and it is growing.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring guests on the frontline get the customized meal they want, made with real ingredients, excellent culinary, and faster than anywhere else.\r\nWe still have some work to do, but our goal is to provide exceptional throughput as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value.\r\nTherefore, we are committed to teaching, training, and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience.\r\nWhile taking good care of guest is always a top priority, utilizing our stage gate process to continue innovating is critical to our growth.\r\nThe great news is that Chipotle's delicious food that you feel good about eating, which creates an emotional connection with our customers and they love to see ongoing innovation from us.\r\nAs a result, we introduced new menu items on a regular cadence as it helps bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users, and gives us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand.\r\nRecently, we launched Smoked Brisket for limited time across all our U.S. and Canadian restaurants.\r\nOur culinary team spent the last two years developing the perfect Smoked Brisket recipe that is unique to our brand and pairs flawlessly with our fresh, real ingredients.\r\nThis is our third new menu item this year, following on the success of our Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice and handcrafted Quesadilla.\r\nEarly customer feedback on this entree, which is expected to last through November, has been very positive and we're delighted to see an increase in both check size and transactions.\r\nQuesadillas, which we launched as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, continues to perform well and is also helping attract new customers to Chipotle.\r\nBy the way, if you haven't had a chance to try the brisket quesadilla, you really are missing out.\r\nAnd we're far from being done.\r\nPlant-Based Chorizo is currently being tested in a couple of markets and our talented culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items.\r\nAll that being said, our stage gate process is not limited to new menu innovations.\r\nWe use it for many parts of the business, including development.\r\nAs you know, we validated a new restaurant expansion in Canada earlier this year, impressive unit economics with AUVs and margins, equal to or above those in the U.S. led us to accelerate development in this market.\r\nWe've opened one new restaurant in Canada year-to-date and have several more planned before year-end, including our first ever Chipotlane that's scheduled to open next week.\r\nSimilarly, we are now in the early stages of using this process to learn, iterate, and eventually validate expansion in Western Europe.\r\nCOVID slowed our ability to execute several critical initiatives, however, with restrictions easing, we're making nice progress and have implemented some of our digital assets as well as begun to test alternative formats and explore new trade areas.\r\nThe recent openings have exceeded expectations.\r\nSo while we continue to view international expansion as a medium to longer-term opportunity, I remain quite optimistic about its future contributions to the Chipotle story.\r\nA more near-term pillar of growth has been our ongoing digital transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand.\r\nDuring the third quarter, digital sales grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $840 million and represented 43% of sales.\r\nWe're not surprised to see the mix moderate as the world continues to reopen.\r\nHowever Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

digital sales, which come with double-digit operating margins, increased 11% year-over-year and 79% compared to fiscal '20.\r\nWith this, our e-commerce business now represents 18% of total retail sales and is approaching $0.5 billion; next, increasing gross margin by 210 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher full-price selling and price increases while being flat with fiscal '20 in spite of the changing mix of our business and some freight expense pressure; leveraging adjusted SG&A by 260 basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels, as we make progress on efforts to reshape our cost structure; and finally, restarting our share repurchase activity by buying back $31 million of Genesco stock, demonstrating our strong financial position, confidence in our future, and commitment to a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders.\r\nAs excited as we are about this quarter, we are even more excited about driving our strategy forward to deliver additional growth, profits, and shareholder value.\r\nSo, turning now to discuss each business in more detail.\r\nStrong consumer demand for a variety of brands and styles drove continued momentum as Journeys achieved record third quarter revenue and operating profit, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of record profitability even while operating with inventory almost 30% below pre-pandemic levels.\r\nLeveraging its industry-leading vendor partnerships and deep talent and experience, Journeys merchants selected and secured a compelling assortment of footwear most desired by its team customer.\r\nThe current fashion cycle, which I've been describing as shifting more into casual, plays into Journeys strength with a nicely diversified assortment.\r\nHowever, for this back-to-school, performance was strong in several categories across both casual and fashion athletic.\r\nNine of the top 10 brands experienced year-over-year growth in the quarter.\r\nIn addition, the in-person back-to-school also drove a big pickup in non-footwear sales, like backpacks, with non-footwear up over 50%.\r\nWith consumers willing to spend more for full-priced items, coupled with higher footwear ASPs, Journeys also experienced a nice lift in gross margins.\r\nDirect sales held on to most of last year's very strong gains as Journeys increased social media and digital advertising, driving an almost 30% increase in online conversion versus two-year-ago results.\r\nRecent market research validated that our strategies are further building the strength of the Journeys brand as Journeys share of teen footwear purchases and likelihood to be considered as a go-to place for shoes have both increased nicely since the last time the research was conducted.\r\nWe were also very pleased with Schuh's back-to-school performance as Q3 constant currency sales increased almost 20% above pre-pandemic sales.\r\nAlthough students attended school in person last year, this year, shoppers increasingly return to physical retail, and our store teams drove higher conversion and more multi-sales on the best traffic of the year.\r\nThe return to stores did not impede the growth of online with direct sales notching large gains on top of last year's meaningful growth as the e-commerce channel more than doubled on a two-year basis.\r\nFueling this growth were several back-to-school key marketing campaigns and increased spending.\r\nThe fashion trends driving Schuh's business are largely the same ones driving Journeys, and several of Schuh's top 10 brands experienced growth in the quarter as well.\r\nAdditionally, Schuh's success managing through COVID strengthened its key vendor partnerships, boding well for the future with even better access to products.\r\nTurning now to our branded side.\r\nOur plan to reimagine Johnston & Murphy for a more casual, more comfortable post-pandemic environment is delivering tangible results.\r\nHardest hit by COVID, J&M is tracking well ahead of its turnaround goals.\r\nSales improved further in Q3, both online and in stores but are still below two-year-ago le Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Genesco reported strong third-quarter performance, exceeding expectations and pre-pandemic levels. Total revenue grew 25% to $601 million, driven by store sales, which rose 30% year-over-year despite traffic still being below pre-pandemic levels. Journeys and Schuh, Genesco's retail concepts, led the growth, with sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels and digital sales continuing to increase. Branded concepts, including Johnston & Murphy (J&M) and Licensed Brands, also contributed to the positive results. J&M, in particular, saw progress in its turnaround strategy, with improved sales and the successful launch of new athletically inspired products. For the full year, Genesco expects adjusted earnings of $6.40 to $6.90 per share, representing an increase of approximately 45% over fiscal 2020. The company cited its ongoing footwear-focused strategy, improved gross margins, and cost management initiatives as key drivers of its success.</s>"}

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n A couple of items before we get started.\r\nI'll now hand it off to Brent for his highlights.\r\nI'd like to start by mentioning how pleased we were with our first quarter results.\r\nThe broader operating environment has been unusual to say the least.\r\nBut we'll touch more on that in a minute.\r\nI'd like to highlight the dedication and intense focus our team demonstrated in delivering solid quarterly performance.\r\nFirst quarter operating profit and earnings per share came in above our expectations as we executed on the manufacturing side, while continuing to tightly manage our overall cost structure.\r\nIndicators for our core transportation, logistics and distribution markets continue to be remarkably strong.\r\nRecord spot rates and expectations for continued increases in contract rates are indicative of a robust consumer demand and capital spending paired with already strained industry capacity.\r\nAll types of transportation solutions are in high demand as we begin 2021, and I'll call it our final mile truck body business because of core correction in FMP's markets during 2020 was more severe than we would have expected during non-pandemic circumstances, and we're optimistic that the bounce back is going to be summerly strong.\r\nIndications from our large leasing customers is that demand has returned from small and medium-sized business segments of the market that they serve so effectively.\r\nTheir rental businesses have also benefited as fleets scramble for equipment as well.\r\nWe believe these trends have staying power as the pandemic has clearly accelerated changes that were already under way in transportation, logistics and distribution, and we feel good about the demand environment as we look forward to this year and beyond.\r\nWe'll now talk about the labor and supply chain situation.\r\nRobust industrial and consumer demand across the broader manufacturing landscape has created imbalances throughout an array of manufacturing supply chains, leading to aggressive increases in the price of materials as well as further compounding labor availability across the country.\r\nI'm not aware of any manufacturer that's been immune to these issues.\r\nAnd although we have introduced effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact within Wabash, we also feel the result in headwinds rising from those labor availability and material cost increases.\r\nHiring remains a challenge.\r\nAnd after a relatively successful fourth quarter, our intake of new team members was less than desired during the first quarter and reflected of the general reality of the U.S., labor market.\r\nWe will continue to pursue additional manufacturing talent throughout 2021 as we work to meet our 2021 customer demand and prepare for our 2022 market reality.\r\nAnd our guidance is the reality that integrating additional manufacturing talent impacts overall productivity in the near term.\r\nThis is just a simple reality of the situation.\r\nThe other reality is that the bulk of this impact will not carry over into 2022.\r\nIt is fair to say that supply chains were already stressed heading into this year, and we had some unique Quarter one weather events to say the least, that compounded supply chain issues and heavy winter storms impacted production; both with ourselves and our suppliers.\r\nThis did impact our final mile manufacturing in Texas, disrupted basic flow of commerce for an extended period of time and significantly impacted chemical related production across many industries; all adding to the stressed supply chain, which we feel in terms of increased disruption and further increases in material costs.\r\nThe cost of commodities and semi-finish components has reacted strongly to the current manufacturing environment, constraints in basic feedstock and lack of labor availability, already elevating -- already elevated heading into the year, cost of un-hedged inputs have continued to rise which is why despite our earnings per share beat in Q1, we have maintained our prior earnings per share guidance.\r\nAs I mentioned when referencing market conditions, our products remain high in demand with our customers.\r\nIn particular, our molded structural composite technology is entering a new phase of market adoption, and we're moving into our next phase of modest MSC, molded structural composite technology capacity additions for 2022.\r\nAs we mentioned on a prior call, continued high demand for our current dry and refrigerated products, coupled with product innovation opportunities being brought forward by the structural changes made to our product innovation and technology team means that we are in need of manufacturing capacity to capture the full value of innovation in these traditional product markets.\r\nIn support, we will be committing new and additional resources into our product development and launch team to further scale and accelerate the introduction of new engineered solutions and our entry into new product and customer markets.\r\nAs we have now organized our commercial organization around our dynamic customer base, we're in the early stages of creating the appropriate conditions to leverage new technologies across our industry, leading first the final mile product portfolio to extend our competitive advantage with key customers.\r\nWith this evolving landscape, we see real opportunity to grow in our markets and grow the shared value created with our employees, our customers and our shareholders.\r\nGiven the opportunity ahead of us, being facilitated by strategic changes to our organizational structure and the ability to leverage flexible manufacturing across product lines, I can think of few opportunities more beneficial to our long-term shareholders than reinvesting in our business to support our future organic growth.\r\nCase in point is our backlog through the first quarter.\r\nIt's typical for Q1 backlog to decline sequentially after we booked large deals in the fourth quarter of the previous year.\r\nThis year, new orders get paced with our shipment activity during the quarter as we saw strong demand for our non van business, which, again, is sold out for 2021 and obviously unable to book new orders for the year.\r\nThis level of demand for diversified products and final mile was expected given our customer conversations heading into the year.\r\nBut it's always nice to see the committed customer orders come through.\r\nAs we look to the future, demand for Wabash engineered solutions continues to grow in a manner that requires us to act on our ability to satisfy them.\r\nAs I previously mentioned, we are maintaining our prior guidance.\r\nWe are very pleased with how our demand environment has taken shape in 2021 and its extension into 2022 and beyond.\r\nWe expected labor to be a challenge, and we were not disappointed on that.\r\nWe remain on track to ramp our total man capacity to enter 2022 in a very strong manner.\r\nHowever, I would say the rise of material cost has been greater than anything we could have reasonably expected, given that we are in uncharted territory with all-time highs in a number of commodities.\r\nWhat I'm pleased to see is that we have taken immediate decisive action to recover a large portion of those costs and manage in other ways to mitigate the impact far beyond Wabash's performance of the past.\r\nAs the world begins to return to something that resembles normalcy, we are optimistic that the labor and supply chain challenges of 2021 will normalize over time and leave us with a less challenging operating environment in 2022, while freight growth remains strong and customer demand continues to be robust.\r\nWe are, therefore, excited about what the future holds as many of the structural and process-based changes that we've made to our organization and having the intended outcome of synergistically furthering our ability to execute on our strategy.\r\nOur improved ability to operate and the growing reality of the established vision of enabling our customers to succeed with breakthrough ideas and solutions that hel Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Ron Bernstein, Senior Advisor to Liggett Vector Brands, will join us during the question and answers.\r\nNick will then summarize the performance of the tobacco business.\r\nAs of September 30, 2020, Vector Group maintained sufficient liquidity, with cash and cash equivalents of $451 million, including cash of $76 million at Douglas Elliman and $148 million at Liggett, and investment securities and investment partnership interests with a fair market value of $174 million.\r\nNow turning to Vector Group's operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020.\r\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2020, Vector Group's revenues were $547.8 million, compared to $504.8 million in the 2019 period.\r\nIn addition to increases in revenue in both the Tobacco segment and Douglas Elliman, the 2020 revenues include $20.5 million from the sale of a real estate investment in The Hamptons.\r\nNet income attributed to Vector Group for the third quarter of 2020 was $38.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $36 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2019.\r\nThe company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $103.3 million, compared to $73.7 million in the prior year.\r\nAdjusted net income was $38.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $36.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the 2019 period.\r\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Vector Group revenues were $1.45 billion and were flat when compared to $1.46 billion in the 2019 period.\r\nOur Tobacco segment reported an increase of $63.9 million in revenues, and our Real Estate segment reported a decline in revenues of $80 million.\r\nWhile our Real Estate segment reported increases in revenues in the first and third quarters, the year-to-date decline reflects the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Douglas Elliman's results in the second quarter of 2020 as well as an unusual year-over-year comparison because of the acceleration of real estate closings in New York City in the 2019 second quarter.\r\nThis acceleration occurred in anticipation of the increase in the New York state mansion tax on residential real estate on July 1, 2019.\r\nNet income attributed to the Vector Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was $60.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $90.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\r\nThe company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $240 million, compared to $206.9 million in the prior year.\r\nAdjusted net income was $106.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to $92.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the 2019 period.\r\nFor Douglas Elliman's results for the three months ended September 30, 2020, we reported $208 million in revenues, net income of $11.8 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million, compared to $201.2 million in revenues, net income of $1.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2019.\r\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Douglas Elliman reported $506.5 million in revenues, a net loss of $62.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million, compared to $606 million of revenues, net income of $6.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $11 million in the first nine months of 2019.\r\nDouglas Elliman's net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, included pre-tax and noncash impairment charges of $58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.3 million.\r\nWhen compared to both the second quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2019, Douglas Elliman's third quarter closed sales improved significantly in markets complementary to New York City, including The Hamptons as well as in Palm Beach, Miami, Aspen and Los Angeles.\r\nNonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant effect on the New York City real estate market.\r\nTo address the impact of COVID-19, in April 2020 Douglas Elliman reduced personnel by 25% and began consolidating some offices and reducing other administrative expenses.\r\nThese expense reduction initiatives resulted in a decline in Douglas Elliman's third quarter 2020 operating and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring charges, of approximately $17.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 and $39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\r\nWe believe these initiatives have and will continue to provide long-term upside to Vector Group stockholders.\r\nFurthermore, fourth quarter cash receipts have continued to strengthen when compared to the third quarter in all regions, including New York City.\r\nDuring the third quarter, Liggett continued its strong year-to-date tobacco performance, with revenue increases and margin growth contributing to a 25% increase in tobacco adjusted operating income.\r\nAs noted on previous calls, we are well into the income growth phase of our Eagle 20's business strategy and remain very pleased with the results to date.\r\nOur market-specific retail programs have proven successful, and we remain optimistic about Eagle 20's increasing profit contributions and long-term potential.\r\nOur results also reflect the resilience of Pyramid, which continues to deliver substantial profit and market presence for the company.\r\nPyramid has strong distribution and is currently sold in approximately 98,000 stores nationwide.\r\nI will now turn to the combined tobacco financials for Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco.\r\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenues were $318.9 million and $918.4 million, respectively, compared to $303.3 million and $854.5 million for the corresponding 2019 periods.\r\nTobacco adjusted operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was $91.6 million and $240.2 million, respectively, compared to $73 million and $202.5 million for the corresponding periods a year ago.\r\nLiggett's increase in third quarter earnings resulted primarily from higher gross profit margins associated with increased net pricing and lower per-unit Master Settlement Agreement expense.\r\nThe lower per-unit MSA expense reflects stronger U.S. industry cigarette volumes in 2020, which has increased the value of our market share exemption under the MSA.\r\nSimilar to other consumer product categories, cigarette industry volumes have outperformed recent historical trends and have benefited from increased consumer demand related to changes in the underlying cigarette purchasing patterns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nAccording to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for the third quarter increased by 1.1%, while Liggett's wholesale shipments declined by 2.2%, compared to the third quarter in 2019.\r\nFor the third quarter, Liggett's retail shipments declined by 1.1% from 2019, while industry retail shipments increased 1.7% during the same period.\r\nLiggett's retail share in the third quarter declined slightly, to 4.2%.\r\nThe modest decline in Liggett's third quarter year-over-year retail share was anticipated, with Eagle 20's volume growth slowing due to increased net pricing.\r\nThis is consistent with our income growth strategy for Eagle 20's, which began in the second half of 2018.\r\nEagle 20's is now priced in the upper tier of the U.S. deep discount segment.\r\nNonetheless, Eagle 20's retail volume for the third quarter increased by approximately 2% compared to the 2019 period, and it remains the third largest discount brand in the U.S. and is currently being sold in approximately 84,000 stores nationwide.\r\nThe continued growth of Eagle 20's despite increased pricing also reinforces the effectiveness of our long-term strategy to continue to build volume and margin for our business using well-positioned discount brands providing value to adult smokers.\r\nWith that in mind, and after identifying volume growth opportunities in the U.S. deep discount segment, in August we expanded the distribution of our Montego brand by 10 states, primarily  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n As many of you know, we pre-released limited results for the first quarter, ahead of our investor day hosted here in Dallas on October 20.\r\nDuring our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.\r\nAnd of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.\r\nIt's good to be back with you all again.\r\nIt was great seeing some of you in Dallas and many of you virtually during our investor day a couple of weeks ago.\r\nWhat you should have taken away from that was this, we're very optimistic about where the business is going.\r\nWe're managing for long-term success and we're confident in the strength of our brands and the levers we have yet to pull to continue to grow the business.\r\nFrom a top-line perspective, we're sitting in a good spot.\r\nSales numbers are solid and traffic numbers are extremely good.\r\nOur near-term challenge is not creating demand but rather it's working through the latest pandemic-driven staffing and supply chain issues that are impacting our cost structure.\r\nAs you know, there are -- these are the same challenges impacting the industry as well as much as the economy.\r\nBut after 40 years in this business, I'll take managing costs over searching for sales and traffic any day.\r\nThose are good problems to solve because they're largely within our control.\r\nOur operators are working extremely hard every day to train our new team members, deliver great guest experiences and tying up the middle of the P&L.\r\nWe've taken some additional price during the quarter to help offset our structural labor and cost of sales increases.\r\nAs I mentioned during investor day, we're not going to price to buy a quarter.\r\nBut as we closely monitor the issues, we've layered in incremental pricing to offset what we believe are the structural labor and cost of sales increases.\r\nAnd Joe will give you more detail on that.\r\nMoving forward, if we discover that what we thought was transitory, it turns out to be more structural, we'll deal with that from a pricing perspective with a disciplined approach that protects our traffic performance and keeps our brands strong.\r\nWe know we have pricing power if we need it, particularly in the delivery in virtual brand channels and we're committed to maintaining our margins and our business model.\r\nAnd that's what we wanted you to hear.\r\nWe're also working hard to remove transitory costs from the system with full recognition that the headwinds are notable and persistent, especially around labor.\r\nAnd while it takes some time, we're confident with the progress we're making and we will significantly reduce these costs by the back half of the year.\r\nThe spike in turnover we experienced during the quarter created short-term pressure on the business as we trained our new team members to run our systems.\r\nThe good news is we are quickly building staff and have as many team members now as we did pre-COVID, though there are markets that are still not fully staffed, which is limiting their capacity.\r\nThis is particularly true in the Midwest, where it's taking longer to reach these optimum levels.\r\nThe impact of these staffing challenges cost us 3% to 4% in first quarter in sales, which we view as upside as we -- as we get those restaurants staffed and trained over the coming months.\r\nOur top talent is engaged in these markets to solve these issues as quickly as possible.\r\nMeanwhile, the base business is strong, especially where dining rooms are fully open.\r\nWhen we look at the totality of the business, Chili's is running positive sales and traffic and maintaining a sizable traffic gap to the industry, most recently at 9% on a two-year look as measured by NAFTrack.\r\nAnd we've got sales leverage around virtual brands and deliveries that we're holding in reserve until our operations teams are stabilized and fully trained.\r\nAnd while the last quarter was more challenging than we expected, we're making great progress and my expectation is we will end the year strong.\r\nAnd as we shared with you during investor day, we've got exciting initiatives and innovation we're working on and we're confident in our future growth opportunities.\r\nLet me continue our prepared comments by providing some additional insight to the first quarter results and then share some guidance on our current expectations for the balance of fiscal year 2022.\r\nDuring first quarter, top-line sales performed well and outpaced pre-COVID levels by a very respectable amount despite COVID-related constraints.\r\nFor the first quarter, Brinker reported total revenues of $860 million with consolidated comp sales of 17%.\r\nKeeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic up 11% for the quarter, a 9% beat versus the industry on a two year look.\r\nThe top-line increase resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, up from $0.28 in the previous fiscal year.\r\nIt will come as no surprise, our most significant challenge during the quarter came in the form of industrywide headwinds from both commodity costs and labor-related spend, which negatively impacted our margins and bottom-line flow through.\r\nWe experienced commodity inflation in the mid-single-digit range, with significant price from pork and chicken driving the increase.\r\nAs Wyman mentioned, with a greater-than-normal influx of new team members, we experienced outsized costs in training and overtime.\r\nWe do consider the portion of these costs above our normal operating levels to be transitory, approximately 130 basis points in the quarter, 60 of which are incremental training and overtime costs.\r\nI Anticipate these costs working their way out of the system over the course of the next couple of quarters.\r\nIn the near term, I expect a significant portion of these transitory costs to remain in the system for the second quarter.\r\nWe are taking thoughtful incremental price increases to help offset these higher costs.\r\nOur third price action of this fiscal year is scheduled with our next Chili's menu update in two weeks.\r\nFollowing this increase, Chili's will be carrying a total of 3% of incremental price compared to last year.\r\nOf course, the mid-quarter price action will not fully impact the total price reported for the quarter.\r\nDue to the timing of price actions and the fact that Maggiano's will evaluate its menu pricing after the holiday season, we expect the second quarter blended Brinker price to be closer to 2%.\r\nOur cash flow for the first quarter remained strong, with cash from operating activities of $40 million and EBITDA of $69 million.\r\nWhen compared to first quarter last year, our strength in operating performance and lower level of outstanding debt have combined to improve our balance sheet and leverage position.\r\nOur total funded debt leverage was 2.6 times and our lease-adjusted leverage ended the quarter at 3.7 times.\r\nAs indicated during our recent investor day, we are targeting to move these leverage ratios below two times and three times respectively over the course of the next two years.\r\nNow, turning to our outlook for fiscal year '22.\r\nWe provided some guidance metrics for certain items during our last call and we are reiterating those levels as of this report.\r\nSpecifically, annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and annual adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80.\r\nThis incorporates our current view of the casual dining operating environment, which assumes continuing challenges in the near term, especially related to supply chain and labor issues.\r\nThis guidance, both reiterated and new, assumes no additional meaningful top-line COVID-related disruptions.\r\nWhile guidance is for our fiscal year performance, I can provide some directional thoughts related to the second quarter.\r\nWith the exception of banquet sales at Maggiano's, we expect sales to exhibit close Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Despite staffing and supply chain challenges, Brinker reported solid top-line performance in the first quarter, with total revenues of $860 million and consolidated comp sales of 17%, driven by an 11% increase in traffic. However, headwinds from commodity costs and labor-related expenses negatively impacted margins, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34. To offset these costs, Brinker implemented price increases and projects a total price increase of 3% at Chili's following their next menu update. While transitory costs related to training and overtime are expected to improve in the next couple of quarters, the company assumes continued challenges in the near term. Despite these challenges, Brinker remains optimistic about the future, with plans to reduce leverage ratios and implement strategic initiatives to drive traffic and organic top-line growth. The company maintains its fiscal year guidance of annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80, assuming no significant top-line COVID-related disruptions.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement.\r\nVarious remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute premium statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Security Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\r\nWe delivered another quarter of very strong results, and as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me.\r\nOur proven growth strategy, powered by our PPI business system, continues to drive outstanding financial performance.\r\nCustomer demand is strong.\r\nOur core business is performing very well.\r\nWe're gaining market share and we continue to play a leading role in the societal response to COVID 19.\r\nAnd finally, we continue to build on our trusted partner status with our customers.\r\nAll of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.\r\nI'll get into more detail in my remarks later.\r\nBut first, let me recap the financials.\r\nStarting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.7 billion.\r\nAdjusted operating income was $3.16 billion and our adjusted operating margin was 29.5%.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share was $6.54 per share.\r\nTurning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $39.21 billion in 2021.\r\nAdjusted operating income increased 27% to $12.14 billion.\r\nWe expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points to 31%, and we delivered a 28% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $25.13 per share.\r\nBuilding on the tremendous success that we had in 2020.\r\nI'm incredibly proud of our team's stellar performance in 2021.\r\nIt's really a testament to the strength of our global team and our proven growth strategy, resulting in another year of exceptional financial results and share gains.\r\nLet me now give you color on the results for the quarter and the year, starting with pharma and biotech, with the outstanding performance delivered growth over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year.\r\nIn addition to strong market dynamics, these results were driven by a unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID 19 vaccines and therapies.\r\nDuring the year, we saw broad-based strength across our businesses in this end market, including our bioproduction, pharma services, bioscience, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel.\r\nIn academic and government, we declined in the low single digits during in the quarter against strong demand in the year-ago period and grew in the low double digits for the full year.\r\nDuring the year, we saw very good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly biosciences, electron microscopy, and our research and safety market channel.\r\nTurning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens during the quarter and we grew in the high teens for the full year.\r\nDuring the year, we saw strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as in the research and safety market channel.\r\nFinally, in diagnostics and healthcare, Q4 revenue was 30% lower than the prior-year quarter, and revenue grew in the high single digits for the full year.\r\nThroughout the year, the team executed really well to support customers testing needs, and in the base business, we had strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic businesses.\r\nBefore we move to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on a role in the pandemic response.\r\nIn the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in COVID 19 response-related revenue.\r\nThis was driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to strong testing demand as well as our significant role in enabling vaccine and therapy production.\r\nThroughout 2021, we continue to operate with speed at scale to meet our customers' needs related to COVID-19 and generated total response revenue of over $9 billion, of which $2 billion were from vaccines and therapies.\r\nI'm very proud of the role that we continue to play around the world to enable our customers and governments to fight the pandemic.\r\nAt the same time, we're executing our core business strategy incredibly well.\r\nLet me provide an update on the progress we made in 2021 executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, as you know.\r\nDeveloping high-impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\r\nWe made outstanding progress in 2021.\r\nLet me share a few of the highlights, starting with the first pillar.\r\nIt was a fantastic year of high-impact innovation.\r\nIn 2021, we launched a number of new products across our businesses, strengthening our industry leadership and enabling our customers to advance their important work.\r\nIn our bioproduction business, we launched a high-performer DynaDrive Single-Use Bioreactor.\r\nAvailable in sizes up to 5,000 liters, this latest advancement in our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor technology brings the benefits of single-use technologies to unprecedented volumes and performance and ensures consistent scalability from pilot-scale studies through commercial production.\r\nIn chromatography and mass spectrometry, we continue to innovate across life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development.\r\nDuring the year, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics.\r\nAnd during the fourth quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris MX, a mass detector, providing high-throughput analysis to improve the development and production of biopharmaceuticals.\r\nIn electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL wafer dual-beam scanning electron microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors.\r\nAnd in genetic sciences, our new Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio 7 Pro Dx real-time PCR system, launched in Q4, enables clinical testing laboratories to accelerate molecular diagnostics.\r\nThe second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets that will highlight a few examples.\r\nTo increase our capacity for single-use technology, we open new manufacturing sites in China and Singapore to serve both local and global demand from biopharma customers.\r\nIn South Korea, we continue to enhance our local capabilities with customer-focused innovation centers for both the semiconductor industry and our biopharma customers.\r\nThese additional capabilities position us really well to support our customers' needs.\r\nThe third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition.\r\nWe've continued to significantly accelerate organic investments in our capabilities and added capacity to be an even better partner for our customers.\r\nIn 2021, we invested $2.5 billion in capital to meet short and long-term customer demand.\r\nHighlights included expansion of our sterile fill/finish network, bioproduction, enzymes, nucleotide, plasmids, and lab products capacity As always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture were major factors in our success during the year.\r\nThey enable the rapid execution of our capital investments and help us find a better way every day so we can continue to bring innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, and operate with speed at scale to create even greater value for all of our stakeholders.\r\nTurning to capital deployment, we were very active again this year, which further strengthened our customer value propo Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

and two, a substantial presence in secular end markets, markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.\r\nIf we dissect the pie chart a bit differently with an emphasis on financial contribution and economic relevance, we see a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows, again, a real tribute to the diversified nature of our business today.\r\nLastly, if we look at a third dimension of our portfolio, we find a library of essential capabilities, capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands.\r\nAnd when done correctly, our unique set of capabilities offer Jabil a real competitive advantage, as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.\r\nMoving on to Slide 8.\r\nYou'll see management's outlook for the year.\r\nWe've increased core earnings per share to $7.25, an increase of nearly 30% year on year.\r\nAs for revenue, FY '22 now looks to be in the range of $32.6 billion, up more than 10% year on year.\r\nIn addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year, while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year on year.\r\nFor me, this is a positive testament on how the team is managing the business as our strategy has been consistent, and what needs to be done is well understood throughout our company.\r\nWith that, let's move to my final slide, where I'd like to start with the importance of our purpose.\r\nAt Jabil, with purpose comes expectations, expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe; servant leadership; protecting the environment; giving back to our communities; and offering a workplace, which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance.\r\nWithin Jabil, these behaviors have never been more important than they are today.\r\nI'm proud of our team as they fully grasp our purpose.\r\nAnd in doing so, their conduct is exceptional.\r\nIn closing, our improvement is steady commercially, financially, and operationally.\r\nQuite simply, here at Jabil, we build stuff, and we do it really well.\r\nOne factor that makes good companies great is having a value set, a culture, if you will, that enhances the way in which they solve problems.\r\nAs a team, we embrace this as we take on the challenges put forth by our customers each and every day.\r\nI'm really pleased with the resiliency of our diversified portfolio and the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, as several of our end markets continue to benefit from long-term secular trends.\r\nAs Mark just summarized, our Q2 results were very strong.\r\nDuring the quarter, revenue, core operating income, core EPS, and free cash flow all exceeded our December expectations.\r\nGiven the higher revenue, I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive an extra 30 basis points of margin improvement compared to our expectations in December mainly through broad-based strength in several key end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends as well as outstanding execution by our business, operations, and supply chain teams.\r\nFor the quarter, revenue was approximately $7.6 billion, up 10.6% over the prior-year quarter and ahead of the midpoint of our guidance from December.\r\nThe additional upside was mainly driven by our 5G and cloud businesses, while our automotive, healthcare, and retail end markets remain very strong.\r\nOur GAAP operating income during the quarter was $313 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51.\r\nCore operating income during the quarter was $344 million, an increase of 21% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.6%, up 40 basis points over the prior year.\r\nCore diluted earnings per share was $1.68, a 32% improvement over the prior-year quarter.\r\nNow turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide.\r\nRevenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis.\r\nThe solid year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad based, with strength across our healthcare, automotive, and connected devices businesses.\r\nCore margin for the segment came in at 5.1%.\r\nRevenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.8 billion, an increase of 19% on a year-over-year basis.\r\nThe stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad based, with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and 5G wireless and cloud businesses.\r\nCore margin for the segment was 4%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting improved mix and solid execution by the team.\r\nTurning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.\r\nIn Q2, inventory days came in at 86 days.\r\nThe sequential increase in days was driven largely by two factors.\r\nFirstly, the ongoing tightness in the supply chain continues to weigh on our inventory balances.\r\nIt's worth noting that we've offset a portion of these increases with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet.\r\nNet of these inventory deposits, inventory days was 71 in Q2.\r\nAnd second, at the end of the quarter, we experienced a timing difference on the sell-through of finished goods within our DMS segment.\r\nI anticipate this timing difference to reverse in Q3.\r\nIn spite of these two factors impacting inventory, our second quarter cash flows from operations were very robust, coming in at $246 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $201 million.\r\nFrom a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter at approximately 1.3 times and with cash bala Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Joining me are our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Steers; our President, Joe Harvey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Stadler.\r\nFurther, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.\r\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.\r\nYesterday, we reported record earnings of $0.94 per share compared with $0.54 in the prior year's quarter and $0.79 sequentially.\r\nRevenue was a record $144.4 million for the quarter compared with $94 million in the prior year's quarter and $125.8 million sequentially.\r\nThe increase in revenue from the first quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management across all three investment vehicles, the recognition of performance fees and one additional day in the quarter.\r\nOur implied effective fee rate was 58 basis points in the second quarter compared with 57.3 basis points in the first quarter.\r\nExcluding performance fees, our second quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points.\r\nNo performance fees were recorded in the first quarter.\r\nOperating income was a record $62.6 million in the quarter compared with $35.5 million in the prior year's quarter and $53.2 million sequentially.\r\nOur operating margin increased to 43.4% from 42.3% last quarter.\r\nThe second quarter included a cumulative adjustment to reduce the compensation to revenue ratio.\r\nExpenses increased 12.6% compared with the first quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, distribution and service fees and G&A.\r\nThe compensation to revenue ratio, which included the just mentioned cumulative adjustments to lower the incentive compensation accrual, was 35.03% for the second quarter and is now 35.25% for the six months ended.\r\nThe increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in US open-end funds, and the increase in G&A was primarily due to higher professional and recruitment fees as well as an increase in travel and entertainment expenses.\r\nOur effective tax rate, which also included a cumulative adjustment, was 26.51% for the second quarter and is now 26.85% for the six months ended.\r\nThe reduction in the effective tax rate from the first quarter was primarily due to the diminished effect of the non-deductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre-tax base.\r\nOur firm liquidity totaled $185.6 million at quarter-end compared with $124.3 million last quarter.\r\nTotal assets under management was a record $96.2 billion at June 30th, an increase of $9.2 billion or 11% from March 31st.\r\nThe increase was due to net inflows of $2.6 billion and market appreciation of $7.4 billion, partially offset by distributions of $769 million.\r\nAdvisory accounts, which ended the quarter with a record $23.1 billion of assets under management, had net inflows of $1 billion during the quarter.\r\nWe recorded $300 million of inflows from five new mandates and a record $1.2 billion of inflows from existing accounts.\r\nPartially offsetting these inflows were $493 million of outflows resulting from client rebalancing.\r\nNet inflows were evenly a portion between US real estate, Global real estate, Preferred and Global listed infrastructure portfolios.\r\nBob Steers will provide an update on our institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.\r\nJapan Subadvisory had net outflows of $272 million during the quarter, compared with net outflows of $204 million during the first quarter.\r\nAs mentioned on last quarter's call, in January of 2021, our distribution rate cut was made to one of the funds we subadvised.\r\nEncouragingly the rate of net outflows in this fund decelerated throughout the quarter and we actually recorded net inflows for the month of June.\r\nSubadvisory excluding Japan had net outflows of $375 million primarily from a single client who decided to bring the portfolio management for a portion of the assets we manage for them in-house.\r\nOpen-end funds, which ended the quarter with record assets under management of $43.5 billion, had net inflows of $2.1 billion during the quarter.\r\nThis marks the 10th straight quarter of net inflows into open-end funds, and the first time we have recorded net inflows into each of our 11 US mutual funds.\r\nNet inflows were primarily into US real estate and preferred funds.\r\nDistributions totaled $312 million, $260 million of which was reinvested.\r\nLet me briefly discuss a few items to consider for the second half of the year.\r\nWith respect to our outlook for compensation, the double-digit sequential growth in our assets under management and revenue, driven by our industry-leading organic growth rate and our strong investment performance, is tempered by the fact we still have half a year ago.\r\nAs a result, we reduced the compensation to revenue ratio by 25 basis points to 35.25% for the six months ended, and we expect that our compensation to revenue ratio will remain at 35.25%.\r\nAs we resume certain business activities that have been restricted during the worst of the pandemic, we expect G&A will increase by about 12% from the $42.6 million we recorded in 2020, but only by about 3% from the $46 million we recorded in 2019.\r\nAs was the case last quarter, the increase is primarily attributable to incremental investments in technology and global marketing as well as higher recruitment costs associated with the hiring of certain key investment and distribution personnel.\r\nWe expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 26.85%.\r\nAnd finally, during the second quarter, in response to a client requests, we converted the fee structure on two portfolios from a performance-based fee structure to a base fee-only.\r\nThis conversion resulted in the realization of the year-to-date outperformance.\r\nThe increase in the base fee for these portfolios is not expected to have a meaningful impact on our overall effective fee rate.\r\nToday, I will review our investment performance and discuss related key themes such as our near record, our perfect record of outperformance, what we are doing to sustain and enhance performance, the impact of accelerating inflation on our asset classes and how our major asset classes are performing versus expectations at the beginning of the year.\r\nAs we all know, in the second quarter, the US economy reopened from the pandemic and surged powerfully, driving appreciation and positive returns in virtually all asset classes.\r\nA good portion of our AUM did better than the S&P 500, which was up 8.6%.\r\nAnd we continued to post stellar outperformance versus our benchmarks.\r\nOne surprising development was that, treasury yields declined in the quarter against the backdrop of accelerating economic growth and rising inflation.\r\nIn fact, inflation surprised on the upside, something that hasn't happened in a long time.\r\nLooking at our performance scorecard, in the second quarter, eight of nine core strategies outperformed their benchmarks.\r\nFor the last 12 months, all nine core strategies outperformed.\r\n99% of our AUM is outperforming benchmarks on a one-year basis compared with 93% last quarter, driven by improvements in global listed infrastructure and certain global real estate portfolios.\r\nOn a three-year basis 100% of AUM is outperforming, and for five years 99% is outperforming, essentially the same as last quarter.\r\nUS REITs returned 12% in the quarter, lifting the year-to-date return to 21.3%.\r\nWe outperformed our benchmark in the quarter and for the last 12 months.\r\nGoing into this year, we believe 2021 would be a good, so called vintage year for real estate investing starting first with listed and then followed by private, consistent with a long history of the listed market leading the way, particularly during turning points.\r\nThe reopening in the US economy has created greater visibility into the turnarounds and demand for space, leasing activity and tenant credit and a Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We expect the call to last roughly an hour.\r\nIn addition, during our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide additional information to enhance the understanding of the way management views the operating performance of our business.\r\nOur third quarter performance reflects continued momentum across our business.\r\nGlobal Client top line performance, which grew at 11% on a constant currency basis was once again driven by strong demand for Transformation Services, made up of analytics, digital and consulting.\r\nOur strategic investments over the years in capabilities and talent, including the continuous training and development of our global workforce positions us well to address the pressing challenges and opportunities our clients are facing.\r\nThis quarter, we achieved the milestone of crossing the threshold of $1 billion in quarterly total revenue for the first time.\r\nFor the third quarter 2021, we delivered: total revenue of $1.02 billion, up 8% on a constant currency basis; Global Client revenue of $921 million, up 11% on a constant currency basis; adjusted operating income margin of 16.6% compared to 17.1% during the third quarter of 2020; and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.66 per share, up 18% year-over-year.\r\nGlobal Client revenue growth in the quarter cut across almost all of our industry verticals with double-digit growth in consumer goods and retail, life sciences and healthcare, high-tech and manufacturing and services.\r\nAs expected, banking and capital markets growth continued to be muted due to the restructured relationship with one client that resized its asset management business in late 2020.\r\nOur pipeline remains healthy with a mix of both large and regular-sized deals.\r\nWe continue to scale our revenue and bookings from existing relationships and add new logos, which sets the stage for future growth.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we signed four large deals across life sciences, CPG, banking and capital markets and high-tech services.\r\nAs we deepen our role as a trusted advisor to our clients, we have seen sole-sourced deals, which was, for many quarters, above 50% of our bookings, now rising above 60%.\r\nWe are also seeing great traction build up in fintech, digital banking and other fast growth tech companies where our domain strength and agile development and deployment is helping them scale rapidly.\r\nGlobal Client Transformation Services continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate and now accounts for more than 35% of total Global Client revenue, including the contribution from the Enquero acquisition.\r\nYear-to-date, approximately 70% of Global Client bookings include a component of analytics, digital or consulting in them.\r\nAs a reminder, approximately half of Transformation Services bookings are annuity-based and often lead to large long-term intelligent operations engagements.\r\nAnalytics is not only the largest component of Transformation Services, contributing more than half of its revenue over the last several quarters, but is also its fastest-growing component, consistently growing well above 30%.\r\nMany of our analytics solutions are deeply connected to high-growth areas where we are strategically focused, such as sales and commercial, supply chain, financial crimes and risk and SG&A.\r\nOur sharp differentiation is our ability to orchestrate data and analytics in the cloud with deep industry and process knowledge.\r\nThe availability of high-quality data and the ability to derive actionable insights with analytics to drive decision-making is now more critical than ever.\r\nIt is at this insight to action level where we differentiate ourselves the most.\r\nOur intelligence platform, Genpact enterprise 360 enables clients to do just that.\r\nGenpact enterprise 360 harnesses the power of data and insights from our operations built on proprietary metrics and benchmarks we have deployed and developed over the past 20 years in our digital Smart Enterprise frameworks.\r\nThis enables clients to have radical transparency in their businesses.\r\nThe platform then uses AI to generate connective insights.\r\nThis further empowers clients to take actions, either themselves all through our work with them to deliver better outcomes today and to point transformation opportunities to unlock future growth.\r\nAnother differentiator for us is our ability to drive outcome-oriented value for clients beyond just cost and productivity, such as increased growth, lower receivables and inventory, lower losses in fraud and better pricing.\r\nThis is one of the key reasons why our Transformation Services solutions resonate so well with our clients.\r\nSome examples include, for a large global CPG client, leveraging our experience and design thinking methodologies, we are using analytics to help them with better sales targeting and automating processes such as contract management and payment reconciliations.\r\nThis enables its sales teams to focus on much higher proportion of their time on business development.\r\nFor a large fintech client, we have designed, implemented and are now running a best-in-class anti-money laundering and transaction monitoring process to improve their regulatory risk compliance as they experience hyper growth.\r\nFor a large high-tech client using our Cora sales assist solution, we are leveraging data and analytics to proactively generate and prioritize advertising leads for small and medium business segment to grow the client's top line.\r\nFor a large client in the semiconductor ecosystem, we are using digital and analytics solutions to improve supply and demand forecasting, diversify their supplier base for greater resilience, conduct global inventory analysis and run spot price forecasting to optimize the timing of purchases.\r\nThese examples reflect the five trends we continue to see in every CxO conversation.\r\nThe five trends are: one, a significant shift from off-line to online across every industry; two, the virtualization of all technology services and solution delivery; three, an accelerated consumption of cloud-based services and solutions; four, an exponential growth in real-time predictive analytics; and five, the move to human-centered design that creates superior experiences for customers, users and employees.\r\nClients continue to tell us that our approach of bringing together our expertise in digital and cloud-based analytics solutions with our deep industry and process depth to drive actions that deliver outcomes is different.\r\nWe continue to see momentum in driving commercial models linked to these outcomes versus traditional input-based models that focus on the cost of FTEs.\r\nThese commercial models ensure goal alignment between us and our clients.\r\nFor example, being paid for the outperformance of predefined metrics, consumption of transaction-based models or fixed fee models.\r\nAs the world continues to adapt to the changes that I've seen over the last 18 months, companies across every industry are intensely competing for talent across the globe.\r\nWhile this hot talent market presents challenges for our kind of a business, it certainly creates an interesting set of opportunities for us.\r\nWe see many engagements where we can help our clients access and nurture global talent, given our ability to scale across a range of skill sets and geographies as well as our focus on reskilling.\r\nWe are using our investments in our online on-demand learning platform, Genome, to build the critical skills businesses are looking for across digital, data and analytics.\r\nSpecific industry and process knowledge, use of Lean and Six Sigma as well as soft skill and personal development.\r\nAs an example, our data and analytics certification program equips our employees with the skills necessary to generate impact immediately after course completion by deriving insights from complex data sets.\r\nTo date, Almost 70% of our employees are enrolled with more than 43,000 fully trained and tested.\r\nThis is analytics at s Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards released fourth quarter 2021 financial results.\r\nThese statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities; regulatory approvals; clinical trials; litigation; reimbursement; competitive matters; and foreign currency fluctuations.\r\nFinally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nOtherwise, they are referring to GAAP results.\r\nWe're proud of our performance in 2021.\r\nAlthough hospitals continue to be impacted by COVID, it was a year of significant milestones and investment for Edwards and our teams were relentless.\r\nIn TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy.\r\nIn particular, we invested in increasing awareness, pursued further therapy expansion and advance new technologies.\r\nWe completed enrollment of the EARLY-TAVR trial, an important pivotal study studying the treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients before their symptoms develop.\r\nSeparately, we initiated enrollment in our PROGRESS trial for moderate AS patients, and we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to start our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.\r\nIn TMTT, we achieved our significant 2021 milestones as we continue to make meaningful progress on advancing our three key value drivers: a portfolio of pioneering therapies for patients; positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.\r\nWe are pleased to have treated over 3,000 patients in 2021 with our differentiated portfolio of TMTT therapies, gaining valuable learnings through both our clinical and commercial experiences.\r\nEach of our platforms demonstrated promising outcomes and clinical performance.\r\nI'm also pleased to announce that we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial in 2021, an important milestone that keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year.\r\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the adoption of our premium technologies.\r\nWe also implemented valuable additions to our smart monitoring advancements in critical care.\r\nMost importantly, in 2021, even more patients benefited from Edwards' life-saving technologies than ever before.\r\nI'm also proud to say that throughout the year, our employees remain dedicated to keeping our commitments to patients and to one another.\r\nDespite the ongoing pandemic that fueled global challenges, our employees found innovative ways to support hospital procedures and to ensure our ability to supply our life-saving therapies was not impacted.\r\nAnd through their efforts, we were able to get our technologies into the hands of our trusted partners around the world so they could serve their patients.\r\nNow I'd like to cover several 2021 financial highlights before I get into the quarterly details.\r\nIn 2021, we are pleased to achieve all of our key financial expectations.\r\nUnderlying sales increased 18% to $5.2 billion, driven by balanced organic sales growth in each region.\r\nWe achieved 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share, while also increasing R&D, 19%.\r\nThe significant increase in R&D and infrastructure investments this year helped strengthen our long-term outlook.\r\nAnd as you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever about the tremendous opportunity we have to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the healthcare system.\r\nTurning to our financial results.\r\nFourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period.\r\nGrowth was driven by our portfolio of innovative technologies, although at the lower end of our October expectations due to the pronounced impact of Omicron on hospital resources in December, especially in the U.S. Full year 2021 global TAVR sales of $3.4 billion increased 18% on an underlying basis versus the prior year.\r\nDespite intermittent challenges associated with the pandemic throughout the year, sales were in line with our original guidance of 3.2 to 3.6 billion and were driven by increased awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy with our SAPIEN platform.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales were $872 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, with impressive strength outside the U.S.\r\nWe estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth.\r\nAnd globally, average selling prices were stable as we maintained our disciplined pricing strategy.\r\nIn the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 10% year over year in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable.\r\nAs previously mentioned, the Omicron variant had a noticeable impact on hospital resources in December as cases were postponed or limited in a number of hospitals.\r\nGrowth in the U.S. was highest in small- to mid-volume centers, which are helping provide access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients.\r\nOutside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% year over year on an underlying basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable.\r\nWe continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions.\r\nIn Europe, Edwards' growth was in the mid-teens, and we estimate that our competitive position was stable.\r\nGrowth was broad-based across the region.\r\nIt's worth noting that a recent cost-effectiveness study demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN 3 was economically dominant when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating French patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at low surgical mortality -- who are at low risk of surgical mortality.\r\nWe're also encouraged by the recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery, which now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over 75.\r\nWe believe both of these developments represents an important long-term opportunity to bring TAVR therapy to even more patients in need.\r\nSales growth in Japan was also strong, where therapy adoption is still relatively low.\r\nSeveral important milestones were achieved in Q4.\r\nFor the first time, the number of TAVR procedures performed in Japan was comparable with the surgical aortic valve replacements.\r\nFurthermore, in each prefecture in Japan, there is now at least one hospital offering SAPIEN.\r\nFollowing the recent reimbursement approval for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country.\r\nLonger term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.\r\nIn addition to our geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion.\r\nIn Q4, we completed enrollment of our EARLY-TAVR pivotal trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic AS patients.\r\nSeparately, we initiated enrollment in PROGRESS, an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease.\r\nWe believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment before they have symptoms or before their AS becomes severe, rather than risking irreversible damage to their heart as the disease progresses.\r\nWe also took steps to advance our innovative product portfolio.\r\nIn Q4, we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to study our next-generation TAVR device, SAPIEN X4.\r\nAdditionally, in Q4, we received FDA approval to use SAPIEN 3 with our Alterra adaptive pre-stent for congenital heart patients.\r\nThis should result in a quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that these younger patients will require over their lifetime.\r\nIn summary, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, we continue to anticipate 2022 underlying TAVR sales Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

[/INST] # Edwards reported solid fourth quarter 2021 results, driven by strong growth in its TAVR therapy portfolio. Despite the impact of the Omicron variant in December, TAVR sales rose 13% on an underlying basis, largely driven by international markets. Edwards remains confident in its long-term TAVR opportunity, with a target to double sales to $10 billion by 2028. The company also made significant progress in its TMTT business, completing enrollment in pivotal trials for early-stage and moderate aortic stenosis. TMTT sales more than doubled in 2021, and Edwards anticipates continued growth in this market. Additionally, Edwards reported steady growth in its Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care businesses, with solid sales increases in both segments. Despite a slow start to 2022 due to Omicron, Edwards maintained its previous sales guidance for the full year, expecting total sales to grow by a low double-digit rate.</s>"}

safety.\r\nOur site and country level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the shifting guidelines provided by the CDC, and local health and safety agencies.\r\nThe flexibility our teams have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been excellent.\r\nNow let me turn to our results for the quarter.\r\nThird quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\r\nOrganic sales were down 14%.\r\nWith the recent acquisitions contributing five points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a three point headwind and foreign currency adding one point.\r\nAs expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company, experienced the largest impact from COVID, with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year.\r\nOur businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness.\r\nThese efforts lead to excellent operating results in the quarter.\r\nThird quarter operating income was $270 million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter.\r\nEBITDA in the third quarter was $332 million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year's comparable period.\r\nThis led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\r\nFurthermore, our businesses generated a strong level of cash flow.\r\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of that income.\r\nNext, let me provide additional details at the operating group level.\r\nOur Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the quarter, despite end-market weakness, delivering outstanding operating performance resulting in strong margin expansion.\r\nSales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2019.\r\nAs expected, we saw solid and wide-spread sequential sales improvements from the second quarter.\r\nOrganic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing six points and foreign currency contributing one point.\r\nCommercial aerospace remains a largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG.\r\nEIG's third quarter operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.\r\nOur Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand environment with solid operating performance.\r\nEMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year's third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture.\r\nOrganic sales were down 13%, with a divestiture of 8-point headwind, the acquisition of PDT added two points and foreign currency adding one point.\r\nEMG's operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the quarter.\r\nLet me comment briefly on end-market dynamics for some of our businesses.\r\nOverall, we saw solid sequential sales improvements across all markets in the third quarter.\r\nWe expect continued sequential improvements in the fourth quarter for all businesses other than customer aerospace, where we expect largely flat conditions sequentially.\r\nOur strongest market remains defense, where we continue to be well-positioned with content across a wide range of important defense platforms.\r\nWe are also very well-positioned with our medical and healthcare businesses.\r\nAlthough, they experienced a delay in the return of electro procedures during the third quarter, which offsets solid COVID-driven demand.\r\nAnd our most challenging market remains commercial aerospace remain cautious of a trajectory of a recovery given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19.\r\nGiven the uncertain and challenging end-market dynamics, our businesses remain highly focused on driving operational excellence initiatives, both structural and temporary, to manage topline weakness, while ensuring we maintain our investments and key growth initiatives across the company.\r\nAMETEK's asset-light operating model provides us with the flexibility to do both.\r\nOur ability to expand margins and generate strong levels of cash flow during this pandemic is evidence of the strength of our operating model.\r\nIn the third quarter, we generated $70 million in total cost savings, which was at the high end of our expectations, with $40 million in structural savings and $30 million in temporary cost reduction savings.\r\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly higher level of structural savings, while temporary savings will be reduced from the third quarter levels, as we add back additional temporary costs during the quarter.\r\nAs a result, we expect approximately $55 million in our total cost savings in the fourth quarter, with $45 million in structural and $10 million in temporary cost savings.\r\nAnd for the full year, we expect approximately $230 million in total cost savings, with $140 million in structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings.\r\nOur businesses continue to implement new and innovative ways to reach our customers around the world in new markets.\r\nThrough virtual meeting platforms, augmented reality product demonstrations and service, and enhanced digital marketing initiatives, our businesses have adapted quickly to the new landscape.\r\nSeeing our businesses adopt these new ways of doing business quickly and effectively has been very impressive.\r\nOur businesses are also collaborating across platforms.\r\nAs an example, AMETEK Land and AMETEK Rauland recently partnered together to help support Rauland's reopen schools safely campaign for their Telecenter U

SEC.\r\nI'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\r\nAMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter.\r\nStrong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations.\r\nWe established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter.\r\nThis performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams.\r\nWe also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile.\r\nThe five acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth.\r\nGiven our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year.\r\nNow let me turn to our second quarter results.\r\nOur businesses saw robust, broad-based sales growth in the quarter.\r\nOverall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020.\r\nOrganic sales growth was 25%.\r\nAcquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added two points.\r\nOverall orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year,

reflected in our results.\r\nSecond quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020.\r\nAnd operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%.\r\nExcluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%.\r\nEBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%.\r\nThis operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10.\r\nOur businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions.\r\nIn the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% of net income.\r\nLet me provide some additional details at the operating group level.\r\nBoth our

basis points to a record 24.9%.\r\nNow switching to our acquisition strategy.\r\nAs we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter.\r\nThese acquisitions as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected.\r\nAMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions.\r\nOur M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year.\r\nAdditionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives.\r\nWe remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications.\r\nIn the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E.\r\nAnd for the full year, we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales.\r\nFor all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments.\r\nIn addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our front-end sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth.\r\nAs noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure.\r\nWhile we are seeing higher levels of inflation due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we are capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions and allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread.\r\nAdditionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives.\r\nFor the full year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings.\r\nNow moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021.\r\nGiven our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our orders momentum and record

Orders grew significantly by 92%, leading to a record backlog of $2.5 billion. Operating income also surged by 40% to a record $317 million, expanding operating margins by 40 basis points. Excluding acquisitions, core margins increased significantly by 160 basis points. The company's strategic acquisitions are integrating well and contributing to growth. Despite supply chain challenges, AMETEK's operational excellence initiatives have resulted in $145 million in savings for the year. Given this strong performance, AMETEK has raised its full-year sales guidance to approximately 20% growth and earnings guidance to a range of $4.62 to $4.68 per share, representing a 17-18% increase.

performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\r\nIn a challenging global supply chain environment, we grew sales 11% and expanded our gross profit and operating profit margins.\r\nOur performance demonstrated our focus on product vitality and customer service.\r\nWe allocated capital effectively by closing the acquisition of OSRAM's North American digital business and have created permanent value for our shareholders through the repurchase of company shares.\r\n2021 was a pivotal year for us as we advanced our corporate transformation and I'd like to take a few minutes to recap some of those achievements.\r\nWe returned the company to growth.\r\nWe grew sales in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, and the full year and we expect this growth to continue.\r\nWe expanded gross profit margins for the full year, despite a challenging global environment.\r\nWe realigned our businesses into ABL, our Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls business and ISG, our Intelligent

vitality and increasing our service levels for the benefit of our customers has delivered strong results.\r\nAnd we are continuing our efforts to drive our product expansion.\r\nThe Compact Pro High Bay, which we've discussed before, continues to deliver from both a revenue and margin perspective in the high growth industrial sector.\r\nOur product vitality efforts include improvements to existing products and the introduction of new ones.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, we introduced the HomeGuard LED Security flood light.\r\nIt's an exciting addition to our contractor select portfolio.\r\nThis new platform offers a technology upgrade, higher efficacy, greater safety options, and ease of installation.\r\nSales have been strong.\r\nWe're off to a great start in a category where we currently have low share and strong growth opportunities.\r\nWe are also continuing to increase our service levels and deliver productivity improvements.\r\nWe are using better, smarter, faster to improve our processes and our technology for better, more efficient, customer service.\r\nToday, I'd like to focus on Agile.\r\nAgile as our commerce platform that is used by our channel for all of the key step that they need to do business in lighting and lighting and controls.\r\nFrom finding products to creating solutions for large projects, to bidding on those projects, to placing the orders and finally tracking those orders to completion.\r\nOur team is constantly improving Agile.\r\nOne of our key areas of focus has been to improve the quality of the product data that we provide.\r\nThis improvement provides many tangible benefits including ease of use and improved order accuracy.\r\nAnother area of focus that I have spoken about before is order status.\r\nI bring

the future.\r\nAs we enter 2022, the priorities for Trevor and the rest of the ABL team remain the same.\r\nMaintain high product vitality, continue to elevate our service levels, and continue to use

greener.\r\nWe believe that each of these provides ample opportunities for future growth.\r\nThis tech controls is a collection of open protocol products necessary to effectively operate spaces.\r\nAtrius provides applications which use data to deliver value in those spaces.\r\nWe are having success across Europe and North America with our Distech platform, especially around campuses, data centers, and spaces that require a significant amount of control around the operation of the facilities.\r\nWe continue to add products to this ISG portfolio.\r\nDuring the quarter we added the

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from these expectations.\r\nAll these documents are available on our website at brunswick.com.\r\nOur businesses had a fantastic start to 2021 with a very healthy marine market, strong boating participation and outstanding operating performance, driving historic financial results.\r\nRobust retail demand for our products continues to drive low field inventory levels, with increased production across all our facilities necessary to satisfy orders from our OEM partners and dealer network.\r\nOur teams have performed exceptionally well in the face of supply and transportation headwinds, tighter labor conditions, and continued impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nAnd we are excited about our ability to further harness the positive momentum we've generated to propel our growth and industry leadership.\r\nOur Propulsion business continues to deliver outstanding top-line, earnings and margin growth, outperforming the market by leveraging and expanding the strongest product lineup in the industry.\r\nOur parts and accessories businesses delivered strong top-line growth and robust operating margins as a result of increased boating participation, which drove strong aftermarket sales, together with high demand for our full range of OEM systems and services, as boat manufacturers attempt to satisfy retail demand.\r\nOur boat business performed well, as anticipated, in the quarter, reaching double-digit adjusted operating margins for the first time in over 20 years.\r\nDespite elevated production levels consistent with our plans for the year, the continued surge in retail demand is still driving historically low pipeline inventory levels, with 41% fewer boats in dealer inventory at the end of the first quarter, versus the same time last year.\r\nFinally Freedom Boat Club has had an extremely busy start to the year, which I will discuss further in a couple of slides.\r\nWe have exceptional momentum as we enter the prime retail season in most markets, and as you can see from our significant guidance increase, we are confident in our ability to perform for the rest of the year and well beyond.\r\nBefore we discuss the results for the quarter, I wanted to share with you some updated insights from 2020 concerning our boat buyers and Freedom Boat Club members that reflect very favorable trends for the future of our business.\r\nWe continue to outperform the industry in attracting new, younger and more diverse boaters, positioning us for very strong growth in the years to come.\r\nLast year, Brunswick's average boat buyer age was two years younger than the industry average and reached its lowest level in over a decade.\r\nAdditionally, Brunswick's first-time boat buyers averaged five years younger than our overall boat buyer demographic, and three years younger than the industry.\r\nEqually encouraging was the fact that the percentage of Brunswick female boat buyers in 2020, while still a minority, equaled the highest percentage on record and first-time female boat buyers entered at double that rate, which was a notable 700 basis points higher than the industry.\r\nIn Freedom Boat Club, we saw even more promising trends with the average Freedom member being almost three years younger than our typical boat buying customer, and female Freedom members making up 35% of our member base in 2020 and 2021.\r\nThese trends are an extremely important validation of our strategy to secure a healthy future for Brunswick and are also favorable for the entire marine industry.\r\nI also wanted to briefly update you on some very important awards and milestones for Brunswick during the first quarter, which are important in positioning Brunswick for investors and employees, and our ability to secure top new talent.\r\nI am pleased to announce that for the second consecutive year, Brunswick has been recognized by Forbes as one of the Best Employers for Diversity.\r\nThose recognized were chosen based on an independent survey of over 50,000 employees working for companies employing at least 1,000 people in their U.S. operations.\r\nDiversity and inclusion are cornerstones of our culture and a source of innovation and inspiration for our Company.\r\nWe also published our 2020 Sustainability Report at the end of March which reviews the exceptional progress we have achieved against our sustainability goals, including our prioritization of the health and safety of our employees.\r\nIn 2020, we reported the lowest recordable incident rate in Company history, in the face of immense challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nAnd I also wanted to share with you a snapshot of what the return to in-person boat shows looks like.\r\nThe Palm Beach International Boat Show was recently held for the first time since the Spring of 2019.\r\nThis was the first major in-person saltwater show of the 2021 season and the outcomes were very positive.\r\nAttendance was up and our brands outperformed the broader marine industry.\r\nOver the course of the four-day show, Sea Ray and Boston Whaler more than doubled the number of boats sold this year vs.\r\n2019 and revenues more than tripled, driven by increased demand for the recently launched models.\r\nConsumers were also able to see Mercury's V-12 600 horsepower Verado in person for the first time, with many eager to repower their boats with this new, game changing engine.\r\nI'll now provide some first quarter highlights on our segments and the overall marine market.\r\nOur Propulsion business continues to gain significant retail market share in outboard engines, especially in higher horsepower categories where we have focused higher levels of investment in recent years.\r\nMercury gained share in each horsepower category over 50 horsepower in the first quarter, with outsized gains in nodes in excess of 200 horsepower.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mercury launched its new 600 horsepower, V-12 Verado engine in February at Lake X in Florida to much fanfare.\r\nMany OEM partners, including Fountain, Scout, Viking and Tiara, and our own Boston Whaler and Sea Ray brands, have already designed boats with this engine in mind and are taking orders.\r\nMany models are already sold out for 2021, with twin-, triple- or even quad-configurations being very popular with both OEMs and customers.\r\nNew or enhanced OEM relationships, along with significant investments in new technology, have also helped fuel the continued growth in Mercury's industry-leading controls, rigging and propeller businesses.\r\nAs Mercury's growth continues to accelerate, we regularly review our capacity requirements to ensure we are able to meet projected demand and fully capitalize on future growth opportunities.\r\nIn this regard, we anticipate having to pull ahead some additional capacity actions.\r\nOur Parts and Accessories businesses also experienced significant top-line and earnings growth in the quarter as aftermarket sales remain elevated due to strong participation trends and service needs, with increased OEM orders to keep up with production resulting from the accelerating retail demand.\r\nOur dealer network reports that their service centers are busier than ever, with the strong participation trends from 2020 continuing into 2021.\r\nIn addition, favorable weather conditions in many parts of the U.S. are enabling consumers to return to the water early and in force.\r\nThis demand drives the need for aftermarket service parts and a healthy distribution network to get dealers the products they need on a same-day or next-day basis.\r\nThe Advanced Systems Group, which has a larger OEM component to its business and also serves some non-marine segments demonstrated significant growth across all its product categories and delivered strong operating margins that were accretive to the overall segment.\r\nOur boat segment had an outstanding quarter, with successful execution of its product plan, resulting in strong revenue and earnings growth, together with double-digit operating margins.\r\nGiven the continued r Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in our Form 10-Q filed earlier today.\r\nBefore we get started on operational results, one of the strategic priorities outlined during our Strategy Day was to foster a high-performance culture with purpose.\r\nAnd I'm pleased to announce that we have appointed Tolani Azis, a six-year Fluor employee with 20 years of EPC experience, to lead our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\r\nFluor is a vast and diverse company, and with Tolani's leadership, she will help us retain, attract and cultivate a workforce that represents the world in which we live and operate.\r\nOn a separate subject, please note that earlier this week, a favorable motion was granted as it relates to an outstanding securities class action lawsuit.\r\nThis motion dismissed with prejudice all allegations, except those relating to a single statement in 2015 about one gas-fired power project.\r\nWhile no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this remaining allegation, we do not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred.\r\nIt's been great to see the vaccine rollout around the globe, and I'm particularly encouraged at the speed of distribution here in the United States.\r\nAlthough there are still many regional challenges to deal with, the end of the pandemic seems to be in sight, which will be a relief to all of us.\r\nCurrently, well over 90% of our project sites and about 80% of our offices are operating at limited operations or better.\r\nOne exception is our office in New Delhi, where a surge in COVID cases has caused local officials to issue a lockdown and curfew order effective until May 10.\r\nThe safety and well-being of all employees is our top priority.\r\nTo help support our Delhi colleagues and families that are in medical need, we airlifted several oxygen concentrators from Houston.\r\nOur 1,500 New Delhi employees are all now working safely and productively from home.\r\nIn the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.25, with new awards led by the Dos Bocas in our Energy Solutions Group.\r\nWhile we continue to see softness in the markets when it comes to capital spending, we anticipate that awards will start to pick up as we get into the back half of 2021.\r\nAnd our teams are busy on front-end work and project pursuits that will help to build a healthy backlog over the next few years.\r\nNote again that we are now reporting in line with our three new business segments: Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions and Mission Solutions.\r\nAdditionally, Stork is now a part of discontinued operations.\r\nJoe will give an update on our divestitures of Stork and AMECO in just a few minutes.\r\nMoving to Slide 5, with regard to NuScale's.\r\nOn April 5, we announced a $40 million equity contribution from JGC.\r\nWe know JGC well, having executed projects with them for more than 10 years.\r\nThey are an ideal partner that could support NuScale's industry-leading carbon-free energy solution.\r\nThis is consistent with the strategy announced in January to reduce Fluor's equity ownership of NuScale.\r\nRegarding our cost savings initiative, efforts are now well under way to streamline the organization.\r\nWe will be updating you on our progress as the year proceeds.\r\nKey to this program will be ensuring the deployment of world-class execution teams onto new prospects over the coming quarters, coupled with the proper level of fit-for-purpose back-office support.\r\nI'd like to take the next few minutes to inform you on what is happening across our end markets and what we expect to see over the next few quarters.\r\nIn Energy Solutions, this quarter, our ICA Fluor joint venture was awarded three contracts totaling $2.8 billion for the PEMEX Dos Bocas refinery in Mexico.\r\nWe have a long and successful history of PEMEX contracts, and we are pleased to be adding our $1.4 billion share of this refinery program to backlog.\r\nDuring the quarter, a chemicals project was canceled.\r\nAnd as a result, we removed approximately $1 billion from backlog while slightly increasing Energy Solutions total backlog to $11.1 billion.\r\nWhen we unveiled our strategy in January, there was a lot of interest in Fluor's energy transition opportunities, supporting a reduced carbon future.\r\nOver the past few months, we've been in extensive conversations with clients about our energy transition capabilities.\r\nWe are executing several carbon capture FEED and feasibility studies using our proprietary Econamine FG plus technology.\r\nAdditionally, we are doing early work in the areas of refinery efficiency, gasification to produce carbon-negative energy, green hydrogen, renewable diesel, renewable jet fuel and energy storage.\r\nIn each of these areas, we have identified projects and are continuing to pursue new opportunities as well.\r\nI encourage all of you to check out the project website and social media channels to see our progress on the project.\r\nOn site, we have completed all site preparation work.\r\nThe Cedar Valley Lodge camp is filling up, pilings are in place and -- overseas -- modules are being constructed in the fab yards.\r\nWe've been remobilizing craft workers on site and are currently at required staffing levels.\r\nIn 2021, the focus on site is completing the installation of underground cable and pipe as well as concrete foundations.\r\nThis will allow the project team to go vertical and be positioned for the receipt of large equipment and the first modules which are scheduled to arrive later this year.\r\nCOVID-19 and changes in law have impacted both engineering and material deliveries as well as the site's ability to mobilize workers due to public health orders.\r\nHowever, several opportunities are being jointly explored with the client to mitigate the COVID-19 and change in law impacts.\r\nWe will keep you updated on the outcome of these discussions.\r\nMoving to Urban Solutions on Slide 8.\r\nThis segment is comprised of the infrastructure, mining and metals and advanced technologies and life sciences end markets.\r\nIn infrastructure, we completed the handover for the 183 South Highway project outside of Austin, just a few miles from the Oak Hill Parkway project we booked in 2020.\r\nThere is obviously a lot of interest and excitement with the proposed federal infrastructure plan.\r\nWe think a long-term infrastructure bill would obviously be a good thing for the U.S. economy.\r\nIn addition to providing needed funding for surface transportation improvements, it would enable state and local governments to better plan for future growth and capacity needs.\r\nIt's too soon to tell what impact the bill could have on Fluor, but we typically experience a two- to three-quarter lag between any new federal infrastructure spending and the release of construction and services RFPs within the states.\r\nWithin our infrastructure-focused area of regional projects in selected states, we are tracking some key opportunities in Texas and North Carolina this year.\r\nNext, we remain confident in our mining and metals opportunities and prospects.\r\nWe are currently completing FEED work that represents $20 billion of potential projects, and we see a robust pipeline of FEED and feasibility studies ahead of us.\r\nThese projects will support an increasingly urbanized and electrified world that is driving the need for investment in minerals like copper and lithium.\r\nWe have several large prospects in 2021 and expect awards throughout the year.\r\nFor our last group in Urban Solutions, we have a lot of positive momentum in advanced technologies and life sciences, as we briefly mentioned in February.\r\nIn the first quarter, we won a significant EPCM biotech project in Europe.\r\nThis award from Fujifilm is for a world-scale biologics drug substance manufacturing facility that will be used to produce a variety of treatments, including vaccines.\r\nAs we have seen over the last 18 months, vaccine developme Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends.\r\nThen we will take questions.\r\nThe Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively.\r\nSales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\r\nSequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically.\r\nBreaking down sales into our two segments.\r\nThe interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.\r\nOur cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.\r\nFor the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019.\r\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\r\nFrom a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020.\r\nIn the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020.\r\nFor the full year 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019 and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019.\r\nThis 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and results -- resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year.\r\nGiven the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the Company's performance.\r\nOur team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment.\r\nThe Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019.\r\nFor the full year, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% -- 24.5%.\r\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019.\r\nFor the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019.\r\nThis was a strong performance considering the significant challenges and related incremental costs related -- resulting from the pandemic.\r\nOrders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 to 1.\r\nThe Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.\r\nWe are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the Company.\r\nCash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter, or 124% of net income.\r\nNet of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million, or 104% of net income.\r\nCash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion, or approximately 132% of net income.\r\nAnd net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion, or 110% of net income.\r\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within a normal range.\r\nDuring the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million.\r\nTotal debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion.\r\nTotal liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of

the full year.\r\nAs Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets.\r\nNow, with respect to the fourth quarter and amid what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance.\r\nSales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record $2.426 billion.\r\nThis organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets in particular.\r\nThe Company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter and that's a strong book-to-bill of 1.04 to 1.\r\nDespite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year.\r\nCraig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the Company, very strong at $441 million and $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter.\r\nBoth just excellent reflections of the quality of the Company's earnings.\r\nI just want to say, with this fourth quarter how proud I am of our team around the world.\r\nAnd our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amid the environment that still has continued challenges.\r\nOur small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January.\r\nAs we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors, for $58.50 a share.\r\nThe MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals, as well as customary closing conditions.\r\nIn addition, last week we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Tool Works, under which ITW will acquire MTS' Test & Simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS.\r\nThe sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\r\nWe continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS, as well as the follow-on sale of the Test & Simulation business to ITW, will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021.\r\nI can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to fiscal 2019 results.\r\nWe are extremely pleased to be reporting an incredibly strong start to fiscal 2021.\r\nWe took decisive actions at the start of the pandemic to protect our people, our brands and our liquidity.\r\nThis combined with our focus over the past year on delivering happiness to our customers and investing in enhanced digital, marketing and store capabilities, as well as in our bars and restaurants, have strengthened our foundation for profitable growth.\r\nAs consumers have become increasingly more comfortable returning to physical shopping, our overall engagement levels have greatly accelerated, leading to strong momentum across our entire portfolio of brands.\r\nGiven conditions last year, it is not surprising that we were able to post strong sales gains across all brands and all channels of distribution during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\r\nWhat's much more impressive about our first quarter 2021 performance is how it compares to the first quarter of 2019.\r\nWe believe that the comparison to 2019 is much more informative for most purposes than comparing to 2020.\r\nAccordingly, during our discussion today, we will focus on the positive traction we have made toward returning to and even exceeding our 2019 levels of performance.\r\nFirst quarter sales came in at $266 million compared to $282 million in fiscal 2019 and versus our guidance range of $220 million to $240 million.\r\nIt is worth noting that $14 million of the $16 million sales decrease from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is due to lower sales in Lanier Apparel, which, as you know, we are in the process of exiting.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased to a $1.89 compared to our earnings of a $1.30 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\r\nScott will provide more detail in a few minutes, but these results were driven by very strong performance in our e-commerce businesses and outstanding gross margins.\r\nOur bar and restaurant business also performed very nicely during the quarter.\r\nIn our bricks and mortar stores, we generally saw a sequential improvement in traffic and sales in the quarter with regions in Florida, the Southeast and Texas showing the most strength while the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and the Midwest are recovering at a somewhat slower pace.\r\nThere is no question that we are benefiting from some pent-up demand so far this spring and summer and the alignment of our brands' focus on products related to travel, vacation and social occasions with the consumers' desire to travel and reengage socially.\r\nWe expect this to continue as more regions of the country begin to normalize.\r\nThat said, we believe that the results we have seen thus far this year and that we are projecting for the balance of the year also demonstrate the value of staying true to our brands during the challenges that we faced last year.\r\nOur commitment to the happy, upbeat and optimistic messages of our brands and delivering those messages to our consumers through our products and services is paying off handsomely as the world reengages.\r\nIn addition, we are seeing positive returns on the investments we have made and continue to make in enhancing our brands' creative content in improving our omni-channel customer service and continuing to hone our digital marketing capabilities, and in our stores, bars and restaurants.\r\nIn our biggest brand, Tommy Bahama, we are anchored in the relaxed island lifestyle.\r\nWe deliver this lifestyle to our guests through our amazing products, our wonderful stores and e-commerce website, and very importantly through our bars and restaurants.\r\nBy staying true to our Live the Island Life brand message and making the types of investments outlined above, we were able to deliver outstanding first quarter results.\r\nSales overall came close to 2019 levels, driven by healthy gains in e-commerce and restaurants while stores in the wholesale continued to improve sequentially.\r\nVery importantly, increased full-price selling and stronger initial IMUs, coupled with excellent expense control, helped contribute to a marked improvement in gross margin, operating margin and a 36% increase in operating income over first quarter of 2019.\r\nWe are delighted with the margins we achieved for the quarter.\r\nFinally, we were pleased to see that while performance in our men's business was strong, our women's business at Tommy Bahama was even stronger.\r\nWe are honored to have the dedicated cadre of true Tommy Bahama fans that comprise our very loyal customer base.\r\nThat said, we believe there is room on the island to delight even more customers.\r\nThrough the investments we are making and the priorities we have established, we are intent on expanding our customer reach while continuing to serve our loyal guests.\r\nStaying anchored to its resort chic lifestyle and as we say being the sunshine served Lilly Pulitzer very well during the first quarter.\r\nLilly's product priority for spring '21 was feel-good fashion with a focus on the happy color and print, easy chic comfortable pieces and a resort state of mind.\r\nThis focus together with the investments that we have made in enhancing our brand creative and enhancing our store and digital capabilities paid off in strong first quarter results.\r\nWe continue to see strong growth from e-commerce while our stores in the wholesale business continue to improve as consumers feel increasingly comfortable engaging in the physical world.\r\nIn total, first quarter '21 sales exceeded first quarter 2019 sales, and operating margin came in at an impressive 27% as compared to 21% in 2019.\r\nOur Luxletic and lounge product continued to drive growth and we saw a healthy rebound in our dress business as for social calendar begins to fill up.\r\nAt the same time, our golf and tennis collections have also been bright spots and the consumer is showing strong renewed interest in swim as she thinks about travel and vacation this summer.\r\nOur recent results demonstrate that we have the product she wants and our brand message is resonating with her.\r\nWe look forward to continuing to drive a strong business through the balance of the year.\r\nOur smaller brands, Southern Tide, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head, also had a great first quarter, all posting meaningful sales gains above first quarter 2019 levels.\r\nAll three are poised to contribute to our profitability this year.\r\nWe are very pleased with our first quarter results and are excited about the balance of the year.\r\nScott will provide more details in our guidance momentarily, but I will say that we do expect to have a strong year, particularly in terms of profitability.\r\nOur enthusiasm is based on both external factors as well as the internal priorities that we have been focusing on for the last year.\r\nI'll start with the external factors.\r\nAs the summer progresses, we expect some of the regions that have been slower to recover for us, namely the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and the Midwest, to pick up momentum.\r\nWe also believe that consumers will continue to have a high degree of interest in travel, vacation and social events through the year.\r\nFinally, after a long pandemic, consumers appreciate the highly differentiated happy, colorful, upbeat nature of our brands and products more than ever.\r\nAll of these external factors portend a strong 2021.\r\nWe are also excited about the benefits we are seeing as the result of our internal priorities.\r\nThere are many, but I will highlight five here.\r\nFirst, in our brand message, we are taking care to ensure that our messages are both true to our core brand values and relevant for today's consumer and marketplace.\r\nSecond, we have realigned our creative teams and are enhancing our creative content to make sure it is delivering the full impact of our powerful brand messages.\r\nThird, as part of our effort to enhance our d Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

operations is included in our SEC filings.\r\nThe company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to the statements made in today's call other than through filings made concerning this reporting period.\r\nIn addition, today's discussion will include references to non-GAAP measures.\r\nClean Harbors beliefs that such information provides an additional measurement and consistent historical comparison of its performance.\r\nStarting on slide three.\r\nWe concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter.\r\nOur Environmental Services segment outperformed our expectations, driven by a combination of factors, including the level of high-value waste in our disposal network, greater-than-expected COVID decontamination work and ongoing cost controls.\r\nTotal fourth quarter revenues were in line with expectations as our Safety-Kleen business remained constrained by the effects of the pandemic.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q4 increased to $136.1 million, which included $5.6 million in benefits from government programs, primarily from Canada.\r\nFor the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew by 3% to $555.3 million, with annual margins growing to 17.7%.\r\nWe generated record adjusted free cash flow of $265 million, a noteworthy accomplishment considering the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\r\nWithout question, the success we achieved in 2020 is a direct result of the dedication, flexibility and perseverance of our exceptional team.\r\n2020 was a challenging year on many levels.\r\nTurning to our segment results, beginning with Environmental Services on slide four.\r\nRevenue, while down year-over-year due to a market -- due to market conditions, was up on a sequential basis.\r\nTypically, Q4 is a seasonally weaker quarter for us, but the $18 million increase from Q3 is evidence that many of our markets are on the road to recovery.\r\nWe also saw strong disposal and recycling volumes to close out the year.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 13% from a year ago, with margins up nearly 400 basis points.\r\nThis was driven by a combination of business mix, cost savings and $3.9 million in benefits from government assistance programs in Q4.\r\nRevenue from our COVID-19 decon work totaled $31 million in Q4.\r\nFor the full year, our team completed nearly 14,000 responses and was an essential resourcing and protecting our customers' people and facilities.\r\nIn Q4, we benefited from a record level of drums collected as well as some high-value complex waste streams we received into our network.\r\nThis resulted in an average price per pound increase of 16% from the year earlier period when we saw more bulk streams.\r\nIncineration utilization in the quarter was 84% due to a higher-than-expected number of maintenance days.\r\nLandfill volumes were down 37% in the quarter as the lack of remediation and waste projects opportunities intensified with the resurgence of the pandemic.\r\nHowever, our strong base landfill business largely offset that decline with a 42% increase in our average price per ton.\r\nMoving to slide five.\r\nSafety-Kleen revenue was down 15% from a year ago, but was flat sequentially as the ongoing recovery offset normal year-end seasonality.\r\nVehicles miles driven had been on a nice upward trajectory throughout the summer, but plateaued a bit in Q4, with the COVID-19 surge resulting in some new local restrictions in areas such as California, and all across Canada.\r\nMost of our core services in the SK branch business were down year-over-year as a result, but flat from Q3.\r\nSafety-Kleen's adjusted EBITDA declined 21%, mostly due to the lower revenue and business mix.\r\nThis decline was partly offset by our cost reductions initiatives as well as the government assistance programs that provided $1.4 million of benefits in Q4.\r\nWaste oil collections were 49 -- no, excuse me, were 49 million gallons in Q4 with a healthy average charge for oil, given the lack of available outlets for generators.\r\nOn the SK oil side, we saw typical seasonal softening of the demand for base oil and lube products.\r\nHowever, due to lower production levels in the traditional refinery space, available base oil and lubricant supply shrank in the quarter, resulting in a rising price environment that should benefit us here in 2021.\r\nPercentages of blended products and direct volumes came as expected and consistent with prior year.\r\nTurning to slide six.\r\nLooking back at 2020 from a capital allocation standpoint, our strategy due to the pandemic was focused on capital preservation, which served us well.\r\ncapex in Q4 was slightly higher than the prior year, but our full year spend was down from 2019.\r\nMoving forward, we expect to focus on internal growth capital on our plants and other assets that we believe generate the best returns.\r\nFrom an M&A standpoint, our opportunity pipeline is healthy, as businesses emerge from the pandemic, and we gain a clear light -- line of sight on our end markets.\r\nWe prudently increased our level of share repurchases in Q4 and had an active repurchase program for the year, and Mike will provide the detail on our buyback shortly.\r\nLooking ahead, we're beginning 2021 in excellent shape, both operationally and financially.\r\nThe markets we serve are on an upward trajectory.\r\nFor our lines of business that have been held back by the pandemic, such as waste projects and remediation, we expect a measurable recovery this year.\r\nIn 2021, we expect to pursue growth opportunities through our core suite of offerings and by capitalizing on market conditions.\r\nAnd Mike is going to talk about our new sustainability report in a moment.\r\nBut let me say that we expect to take full advantage of the growing market acceptance of our sustainable offerings in 2021 and beyond.\r\nWe provide a broad array of green solutions that go well beyond our role as the largest collector and recycler of waste oil.\r\nWithin Environmental Services, we entered the year with higher deferred revenue and given the availability of waste in the marketplace, expect strong incineration performance in 2021.\r\nWe anticipate our offerings within Industrial Services and Tech services to grow from last year.\r\nWe expect Field Services to generate $25 million to $35 million of COVID-related revenues in 2021.\r\nWithin Safety-Kleen, we remain below normal demand levels as we kick off 2021.\r\nHowever, later this year, we anticipate a steady recovery in the SK branch business.\r\nFor Safety-Kleen Oil, our rerefineries are producing well.\r\nAnd as I mentioned, pricing for both base oil and blended products is favorable to start the year.\r\nWe will continue to actively manage our charge for oil rates, while focusing on growing collection volumes to supply our rerefinery network and take advantage of market conditions for recycled fuel oil.\r\nAs I look at 2021, the underlying dynamics in both our operating segments remain positive, and we expect a strong sales growth year with healthy free cash flow as a result.\r\nI anticipate another great year for the company in 2021.\r\nBefore I take you through the financials, let me comment briefly on our first ever sustainability report, which is available on the IR section of our website.\r\nWe're proud of this document, which we created based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework.\r\nThe document highlights the integral role that sustainability plays in our business decisions as well as our environmental, social and government goals and benchmarks for 2030.\r\nThe At a Glance page of the report shown on slide eight is an overview of some of the -- of our ESG benchmarks.\r\nI want to reiterate the point that Alan made about ESG and sustainability as foundational to our business.\r Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 is in the range of $545 million to $585 million, with Environmental Services experiencing a mid-single-digit decline on a percentage basis due to the reduction in high-margin decontamination work and government assistance but expecting growth in incineration, service businesses, and cost measures. Safety-Kleen is projected to see a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from a rebound in the branch business and improved performance in SK Oil.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n With us on the call, from National Fuel Gas Company are Dave Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Camiolo, Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer; and John McGinnis, President of Seneca Resources.\r\nWe vmay refer to these materials during today's call.\r\nWhile National Fuel's expectations, beliefs, and projections are made in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis, actual results may differ materially.\r\nNational Fuel will be participating in the Barclays Energy Conference in September.\r\nPlease contact me or the conference planners to schedule a meeting with the management team.\r\nAs with most oil and gas companies, lower commodity prices weighed on the third [Technical Issues] gathering business.\r\nHowever, the remainder of the system had a very solid third quarter with pipeline earnings up nearly 45% on the strength of Supply Corporation's recent rate settlement and stable utility earnings, in spite of the COVID pandemic.\r\nAlso the quarter was another great example of the benefits of our integrated, diversified model where the earnings and cash flows of our regulated businesses provided a strong measure of stability against the more variable earnings of our E&P business.\r\nOperationally, this was a really significant quarter for National Fuel, one in which we reached several important milestones that make us well positioned to deliver meaningful growth in the years to come.\r\nFirst and foremost, last week we closed on the acquisition of Shell's upstream and midstream properties in Appalachia.\r\nThis is a terrific opportunity to check all the boxes we are looking for in an acquisition.\r\nFrom start to finish, it was the results of the exceptional work of dozens of employees across our upstream and midstream operations.\r\nHats off to the team on a job well done.\r\nThe acquisition meaningfully increases our presence in Appalachia.\r\nIn fact, earlier this week Seneca's gross natural gas production crossed the 1 Bcf per day threshold.\r\nThis is a great milestone.\r\nAnd to put in perspective, in fiscal 2018, our average daily production was only about half of that.\r\nWith the added scale, we expect to realize immediate cost synergies and you can see that in our guidance on cash operating costs, which we expect will be down about $0.05 per Mcfe in '21.\r\nThe financing for the transaction is complete.\r\nKudos to our finance team and the banks that supported them.\r\nWe're getting the deals done in the face of a challenging backdrop in the capital markets.\r\nAs I described a few months ago, the plan was to finance the deal with roughly 50-50 debt and equity, and I'm happy to say that we achieved that objective.\r\nIn May, we issued $500 million of bonds, the proceeds from which were used to fund the debt component of the acquisition and to term out our revolver.\r\nWe also raised just under $175 million through a common equity offering that was done at a better price than we would have received under the equity backstop arrangement available to us under the Shell purchase-and-sale agreement.\r\nAnd lastly, earlier this week, we signed an agreement to divest substantially all of our Appalachian timber properties for approximately $116 million, which will fund the remaining equity needed for the transaction.\r\nThe timber properties are our non-core asset that we've held for some time.\r\nThe earnings and cash flows associated with them are modest, in fact, pretty close to break-even.\r\nReinvesting the proceeds from the sale allows us to avoid issuing another roughly 2 million common shares at the midpoint of our fiscal 2021 guidance.\r\nThat saves approximately $0.08 per share of dilution.\r\nIn addition, the timber properties have a very low tax basis.\r\nBy selling them now, we're able to structure the timber sale and Shell acquisition, is a like kind of exchange and by doing so, defer a large tax gain.\r\nThe remainder of Seneca's operations continue to run smoothly and John will have a full update later on the call.\r\nBut I'd like to emphasize the improvement we expect in this business in fiscal '21.\r\nAs you can see in last night's release, the midpoint of our production guidance is 320 Bcfe, a 32% increase over our expected production for fiscal 2020.\r\nIn addition with the NYMEX strip in the $2.65 to $2.75 area, there is cause for optimism on natural gas prices and we've been aggressive with our hedging program.\r\nAt this point about two-thirds of our fiscal '21 gas production is hedged.\r\nBoth of these factors should cause cash from operations to grow meaningfully.\r\nOn top of that, as a result of moving to a single rig program, capital spending at Seneca and NFG midstream is expected to decrease by $105 million or about 25%.\r\nSo, putting it all together, assuming the current strip, next year we expect more than $150 million in free cash flow from our E&P and gathering businesses.\r\nThe Pipeline and Storage segment is also positioned to deliver meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.\r\nAnd several noteworthy events occurred during the quarter to help make that a reality.\r\nOn the expansion front, we placed a portion of our Empire North project into service ahead of schedule, which allows us to capture some modest short-term growth -- short-term revenue opportunities this summer.\r\nOnce it's fully in service, which we expect will occur by the end of September, this project will add $25 million in annual revenues.\r\nIn July, we received our FERC certificate for the FM100 project and Transco also received their FERC approval for the companion Leidy South project.\r\nBoth projects are on track for a late calendar 2021 in-service date.\r\nAnd as a reminder the expansion portion of this project is expected to add $35 million in annual revenue.\r\nLastly, in early June, FERC approved the settlement of Supply Corporation's rate case.\r\nAs I discussed on last quarter's call, new rates went into effect this past February and are expected to add $35 million in annual revenues.\r\nSettlement also addressed the rate-making treatment of the modernization component of the FM100 project.\r\nOn the later of the in-service date of that project or April 2022, a step up in rates will go into effect, providing an incremental $15 million in annual revenues.\r\nIn total, the expansion projects and rate case settlement are expected to provide in excess of $100 million of incremental annual revenues for our pipeline business by mid-2022.\r\nTo put that in perspective, our fiscal 2019 pipeline revenues were $288 million.\r\nSo we're looking at some really meaningful growth in the next two years.\r\nIn addition to improving earnings and cash flows, the growth in our pipeline business will help us maintain relative balance between the regulated and non-regulated portions of our company.\r\nOn the utility front, despite the pandemic, our operations and financial performance remain right in line with our expectations.\r\nWith the reopening of most of the economies in our New York and Pennsylvania service territories, our capital program has returned to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nWe continue to focus on modernization projects that enhance the safety and reliability of our system, while at the same time reducing emissions.\r\nIn New York, our system modernization tracker allows us to do this in a manner that minimizes the regulatory lag to recover these large investments.\r\nAnd given that we can add rate base to this tracker, through March of 2021, we expect to maintain consistent returns at our utility for at least the next few years.\r\nLastly, a few words on the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nOverall the business continues to run smoothly across the system.\r\nEmployees who can work from home are doing so and those who cannot,

[/INST] # National Fuel reports a challenging third quarter amidst lower commodity prices, particularly impacting its E&P gathering business. However, its Pipeline and Storage segment performed strongly due to Supply Corporation's recent rate settlement and stable utility earnings. The company recently acquired Shell's Appalachian assets for a combination of debt and equity, significantly increasing its presence in the region and boosting production by 32% in fiscal 2021. As a result, cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $150 million in its E&P and gathering businesses next year. Moreover, ongoing growth in the Pipeline and Storage segment and steady utility operations are expected to significantly increase earnings per share in fiscal 2021, with a range of $3.40 to $3.70. The company remains financially strong, with ample liquidity and a favorable capital structure.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Mike Speetzen, our chief executive officer; and Bob Mack, our chief financial officer; have remarks summarized in the quarter and our revised expectations for the full year, then we'll take questions.\r\nYou can refer to our 2020 10-K for additional details regarding these risks and uncertainties.\r\nI continue to be incredibly impressed with the dedication, commitment and execution of the Polaris team as we navigated ongoing supply chain pressures, logistical challenges and increasing input costs to deliver impressive second-quarter results.\r\nFocused execution is our mantra and it once again paid off as the team expertly navigated the challenges to enable us to exceed expectations.\r\nThe powersports industry has experienced significant demand, and that trend continued into the second quarter.\r\nDemand, while down from unprecedented levels in the second quarter of last year was up over prepandemic levels of Q2 2019 by 14%.\r\nOverview market share gains continued in the second quarter with gains in both ATVs and side-by-sides.\r\nWe did, however, lose a small amount of share in India, particularly in our midsized bikes given the supply chain challenges.\r\nThat said, demand remains strong for these models, and we anticipate our share gains will resume as our vehicle supply improves.\r\nBoats also remained strong, growing retail sales and market share during the quarter and we have a healthy and significant backlog.\r\nAlthough it's off season for snowmobiles with over half our snowmobile build this year being represented by our near-record high snow check preorders, the sales cadence of our snowmobile business will be even more heavily weighted toward our fourth quarter this year given the timing variation in our component deliveries.\r\nOur PG&A and International businesses also performed quite well.\r\nPG&A sales were up 35% during the quarter.\r\nI'd also note that we are experiencing an increase in the attachment rate for PG&A as more consumers look to personalize their vehicles.\r\nOur International business continues to see strength.\r\nWe grew sales 64% as the economies outside North America continued to improve in Q2.\r\nOur earnings outperformed expectations, demonstrating the team's ability to overcome challenges with focused execution.\r\nNot surprisingly, production and delivery were and continue to be impacted by global supply chain and logistics challenges.\r\nAs a result of this and continued strong consumer demand, our dealer inventories are at the lowest levels in decades.\r\nI'll talk more about this in a moment.\r\nGiven our first half results, continued strong consumer demand and our team's hard-fought ability to execute, I am pleased to report that we are again raising our full-year earnings guidance.\r\nBob will give more details shortly.\r\nOn a two-year basis, our retail is up 14%, reflecting continued growth in powersports, driven by strong underlying consumer demand.\r\nAs expected, our second quarter North American retail sales were down 28% from the 57% increase reported in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nThe gating factor for retail sales today compared to a year ago is low dealer inventory driven by supply chain impacts on delivery.\r\nRetail sales would have likely been significantly higher without these impacts.\r\nDespite the supply impacts to ORV retail sales, market share again grew during the quarter.\r\nOur ORV business gained over 1 percentage point of market share in both ATVs and side-by-sides.\r\nMotorcycle retail sales also continued to grow, increasing 22% during the quarter.\r\nHowever, Indian lost a modest amount of share during the quarter, driven by low availability of bikes, particularly our very popular scout and chief models.\r\nStrong boat retail also continued and remained ahead of the industry.\r\nDealer inventory levels ended the quarter down 57% on a year-over-year basis and were also down sequentially.\r\nOur presold order process continues to be an effective lever that our dealers are utilizing to ensure they don't lose a sale.\r\nAnd I'll go into this in more detail in the next slide.\r\nLooking at the remainder of the year, dealer inventories are expected to remain lean into Q4, which is when we are anticipating the supply chain issues will begin to slowly improve.\r\nGiven stronger-than-anticipated demand, coupled with continued supply constraints, our expectations for dealer inventory levels to return to RFM profile levels is now sometime in late 2022 or even into 2023.\r\nAs I discussed earlier, the unprecedented demand, coupled with the supply chain constraints, has created significant disruption in our shipping cadence.\r\nWith dealer inventory at record lows, the most effective, efficient way for our customers to secure the product they want, and for our dealers to maximize retail and profitability is through our presold order process.\r\nThe advantage to consumers is that orders placed in the presold system received priority in our production and shipping schedule.\r\nIn addition, dealers and consumers can receive PG&A priority is placed at the time of the vehicle order.\r\nAs a result, presold orders have increased significantly since the pandemic began.\r\nPre-pandemic presold orders accounted for roughly 3% of our retail.\r\nExiting Q2, ORV presold orders were approximately 80% of retail.\r\nWhile there have been some reports that the presold order process can be misused, our audits have found that not to be the case.\r\nWe regularly audit the system looking for a name change from the presold order at the time of registration.\r\nThese audits have found less than 1% where the names changed at registration and where there were changes, the majority had valid reasons for the change.\r\nI'd also point out that the presold order cancellations remain at low single-digit percent, which is similar to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nLastly, we have analyzed shipping patterns to our dealers by tiers, volumes and regions and were all within 1% of pre-pandemic levels.\r\nThe bottom line is that there's high confidence in the presold order process, which is why it continues to be a competitive advantage in this very tight inventory environment.\r\nOur manufacturing plants are operating at peak supply chain constrained capacity.\r\nOur manufacturing, supply chain and logistics teams continue to execute at a very high level, managing the ever-changing production schedules driven by component availability with a singular focus to meet the demand of our consumers and dealers with high-quality vehicles and components.\r\nDespite our efforts, we couldn't meet all the demand during the quarter.\r\nAs I indicated earlier, our presold order levels have increased significantly, and it appears those customers are waiting for the high-performing high-quality vehicles we produce.\r\nI'd like to be able to say today that we see the light at the end of the tunnel.\r\nBut given the ongoing heightened demand for our vehicles and supplier challenges, it appears we, along with the entire powersports industry will be in a period of tight vehicle supply for the remainder of the year.\r\nOur teams are doing impressive work to keep the flow of products moving, including expediting components, adjusting build schedules, substituting materials were appropriate and buying select materials on the spot market.\r\nFocused execution and teamwork will ensure we win the competitive battle.\r\nAs indicated in our last call, we are also adding capacity later this year and into 2022 that will bring on 30% more production capability between ORV boats and motorcycles.\r\nThis capacity is needed to meet demand, fill the dealer channel and allow for the addition of some very exciting new products coming next year.\r\nOne of the drivers behind the unprecedented demand has been new customers coming into powersports.\r\nNew customer growth in the first half of 2021, while down slightly from the robust rates in the first half of 2020 remains comfortably ahead on a comparable two-year pre-COVID basis with approximately 300,000 new customers coming into the P Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

while supply challenges persist especially for automotive products.\r\nSecond quarter gross margin was 36.8%, up 525 basis points from 31.6% in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nThough improved, gross margin performance continues to be impacted by semiconductor and commodity price increases, as well as increased logistics costs.\r\nEBITDA margin of 21.5% was up 480 basis points from 16.7% in the same period last year.\r\nSecond quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 were up 225% from $0.16 in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nLater, Ashish will add color to the GAAP performance including a non-cash charge related to the U.S. pension plan termination.\r\nOperating cash flow of $19 million was up from $12 million in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nNew business awards of $174 million were solid and up from $105 million in the same period last year.\r\nAshish Agrawal, our CFO, is with me for today's call and will take us through the Safe Harbor statement.\r\nAnd more information can be found in the company's SEC Filings.\r\nTo the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investor section of the CTS website.\r\nI will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO, Kieran O'Sullivan.\r\nIn the second quarter, our sales were $129.6 million, up 54% from the second quarter of 2020.\r\nExcluding sales from the acquisition of Sensor Scientific, sales were up 52% organically.\r\nThe SSI acquisition continues to deliver solid growth.\r\nAs I referenced in our last earnings call, we expected the transportation sales run rate to be slightly lower than our first quarter 2021 performance due to ongoing supply challenges.\r\nOur teams worked creatively and diligently to secure parts, approved substitutions and adapt with speed to support our customers.\r\nTransportation sales while up 88% from the same period last year would have been stronger by a few million dollars if we did not have these supply challenges.\r\nWe expect the supply challenges and some customer shutdowns to persist in the second half.\r\nNew business awards were $174 million for the quarter, up from $105 million in the same period last year.\r\nWe added three new customers in the quarter; two in transportation and one in telecom.\r\nIn Asia, we added a new transportation customer in China for a large platform that would ship in the 2023 timeframe.\r\nAcross the accelerator modules, we had wins with two existing customers in China, secured awards with two Japanese OEMs for the North American market and added a new electric vehicle customer in Europe.\r\nWith passive safety sensors, we had wins with existing Tier 1 customers across all three regions with one of the wins for an EV application.\r\nIn Europe and North America, we had wins for throttle position and transmission position sensing.\r\nBookings and sales for two-wheeler applications were strong in Asia.\r\nWe continue to advance our diversification strategy by growing in non-transportation end markets.\r\nIn Defense, we had several undersea sonar wins and we also maintain good momentum with our RF filter products for GPS anti-jamming applications.\r\nTemperature sensor wins were solid in defense, and we had an important win for an aviation application in Europe.\r\nIn Industrial, we continue to see strong demand for temperature products across pool and spa as well as HVAC applications.\r\nWe also had a large win in industrial printing, securing a two-year contract where the market has expanded into new applications such as garment printing.\r\nMomentum in medical markets was positive but with inconsistencies regionally due to countries emerging from lockdowns and some customers being impacted by material shortages.\r\nWe had various temperature application wins and additional wins in CPAP, medical ultrasound and intravenous drug delivery.\r\nFor medical ultrasound, our design wins are increasing through new programs with existing customers and several new customers sampling our solutions.\r\nWe received two transportation OEM quality awards and we're also recognized for delivery performance by an industrial OEM and a large distributor.\r\nOverall, across all end markets, demand remains robust.\r\nSome automotive customers have confirmed demand through 2022.\r\nOrder intake for electronic components was strong in the second quarter.\r\nAlthough we've not seen signs so far, we remain cautious of potential inventory buildup in various end markets.\r\nThis past quarter we announced the $50 million stock buyback program.\r\nAs we look to capital deployment, our emphasis remains firmly on supporting organic growth investments and using our strong balance sheet to advance on M&A in alignment with our strategic priorities.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our M&A pipeline.\r\nPotential changes in capital gains taxation may also provide some further momentum in our areas of interest.\r\nWe continue to seek to expand our range of technologies, products, customers, and geographic reach.\r\nAnd at the same time, continue to diversify our end market profile to complement our quality of earnings.\r\nFor the second quarter, transportation sales represented 55% of our total company revenues as we made progress in Industrial, Medical, and Defense sales.\r\nOperationally, we can see the end of our journey and the rollout of the SAP system, though we will continue to optimize our learnings and capabilities.\r\nThe previously announced restructuring savings of $0.22 to $0.26 by the second half of 2022 are tracking close to the target range.\r\nBuilding the CTS operating system capability continues with four sites advancing their proficiency on the system and tools as we aim to empower our teams and strengthen operational and enterprise expertise.\r\nTransitioning to end markets, the semiconductor shortage is expected to reduce vehicle builds by 6 million units this year.\r\nThe supply of global microcontrollers is improving from companies such as Renesas and NXP, which should deliver some improvements to vehicle OEMs. For the U.S. light vehicles transportation market, demand remains robust.\r\nWe still expect approximately a 15 million to 16 million unit range this year, up double digits year-over-year.\r\nOn-hand days of supply are between 25 and 30 days, the lowest in recent history, and down 50% since January of this year.\r\nEuropean production is forecasted in the 16 million to 18 million unit range with some uncertainty persisting due to the extended COVID lockdowns.\r\nThe Chinese market has fluctuated recently showing the first chip-related impact.\r\nChina volumes are expected in the range of 23 million to 25 million unit range for this year.\r\nThe commercial vehicle market remains strong, not only for this year but likely into the first half of 2022.\r\nThe biggest challenge is the supply of semiconductors as demand remains robust.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, for transportation, the supply challenges will continue to impact our sales in the second half of this year.\r\nHowever, we see improvements in medical as well as solid growth in industrial and defense markets.\r\nIn terms of guidance for the full year 2021, we are updating our range.\r\nOur previous guidance was for sales in the range of $445 million to $500 million, and adjusted earnings in the range of $1.35 to $1.70.\r\nWe are now updating our guidance for sales to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million, and adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90.\r\nFurther updates will be provided as we continue to monitor the ongoing supply challenges.\r\nPhase 2 of our journey and our biggest priority as we advance toward our 2025 goals is layering on a more robust sales growth profile.\r\nOur teams are making progress as we continue to

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n PSEG released first quarter 2021 earnings results earlier today.\r\nWe also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which differ from net income as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\r\nI'm pleased to report that PSEG has achieved several major milestones on our path to becoming a primarily regulated utility company with a complementary and significantly contracted carbon-free generating fleet.\r\nOur GAAP results for the first quarter were also $1.28 per share versus $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\r\nResults from ongoing regulated investments at PSE&G and the effect of cold weather on PSEG Power drove favorable comparisons at both businesses.\r\nWe are well positioned to execute on our financial and strategic goals for the balance of the year given this eventful quarter.\r\nBeginning was out nearly $2 billion of Clean Energy Future programs, which have moved from approval to execution.\r\nPSE&G is helping to advance the decarbonization of New Jersey in a sizable and equitable way.\r\nOur Clean Energy Future investments are paired with a jobs training program that offers opportunities to low and middle-income New Jersey community.\r\nLast week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted unanimously to award a continuation of the full $10 per megawatt hour zero-emission certificates, I'll just call them ZECs from now on, for all three New Jersey nuclear units, that would be Hope Creek, Salem number one and Salem number two through May of 2025.\r\nThis was the maximum amount that the BPU could have awarded, and we are appreciative of the support received from the many community, labor, business, environmental and employee organizations that participated in this enormously important process.\r\nEach of these groups recognizes the value of the reliable around the clock and carbon-free electricity supply our nuclear plants provide.\r\nThroughout this process, our nuclear team has approached operations at the units with the utmost professionalism and dedication to safety.\r\nI congratulate PSEG Nuclear for being recognized by as an industry leader in operational reliability, one of only two nuclear fleets across the industry with no scrams over the past 365 days.\r\nThe BPU's decision to extend the ZEC program will advance climate action in New Jersey by helping to preserve the state's largest carbon-free generating resource and is consistent with the growing interest at the federal level in preserving existing nuclear as an essential part of a clean energy mix.\r\nWe applaud the BPU for its decision, which is in the best interest of the state of New Jersey and its ability to achieve its long-term clean energy goals without compromising reliability or going backward on environmental gains made to date.\r\nLooking ahead, we will soon work with stakeholders to obtain alignment of state and federal climate goals in seeking ways to extend the duration of support for carbon-free nuclear power.\r\nDuring the quarter, the BPU also approved PSEG's 25% equity investment in Orsted's Ocean Wind project.\r\nIn addition, Ocean Wind received a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, which we will also review -- which will also review the project's construction and operations plan.\r\nIn April, PJM, closed cooperation with the BPU, opened a four month solicitation window to seek transmission solutions to support New Jersey's offshore wind generation target.\r\nThis process is PGM's first public policy transmission solicitation, and we will participate in this proceeding.\r\nThe recent Biden administration proposal focusing on climate action is clearly supportive of offshore wind, existing nuclear generation and electrification of transportation, all of which are aligned with PSEG's business plan and strategy for sustainability.\r\nPSEG eagerly encourages an advocate for a national approach to accelerate economy wide, net zero emissions even sooner than 2050 in a constructive manner that expands green jobs by investing in clean energy infrastructure.\r\nI am more optimistic than ever that the momentum for real climate action is taking hold, PSEG continues to press ahead with our powering, progress, vision, that incorporates energy efficiency and the electrification of transportation to help our customers use energy -- use less energy.\r\nWe are pairing that with our move to make the energy our customers use cleaner, which aligns with our efforts to preserve our existing nuclear units and pursue strategic alternatives for our Fossil fleet.\r\nThen we strive to deliver with high reliability and resiliency, which ties to our investments in Energy Infrastructure and the Energy cloud.\r\nToday, we are also announcing progress on our strategic alternatives exploration with an agreement to sell our solar source portfolio to an affiliate of LS Power.\r\nThe sale resulted from a robust marketing process, and we're pleased with the outcome of the sale, having determined that the transaction is modestly accretive on the sum of the parts and on an operating earnings basis going forward.\r\nWe expect the solar source portfolio deals to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to customary, regulatory and other closing conditions.\r\nPSEG Power is continuing the exploration of strategic alternatives for its Fossil generating fleet and currently anticipate reaching an agreement around midyear.\r\nThese expected transactions, along with over a decade of capital allocation directed mainly toward PSE&G to position the remaining company as a primarily regulated electric and gas utility with a complementary carbon-free nuclear fleet and offshore wind investments that will be highly contracted.\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact continued to affect the New Jersey economy.\r\nThe large contribution of the transmission and residential electric and gas components to our overall sales mix has had a stabilizing effect on the margins of our utility business as does a supportive regulatory order that authorizes deferral of certain COVID-19-related costs for future recovery.\r\nGovernor Murphy recently announced that a significant easing of COVID-19 restrictions on the state's businesses, venues and gatherings would begin on May 19 following progress in vaccinating over half of the state's population and a sustained reduction in positivity and hospitalization rates.\r\nPSE&G has begun implementing the Clean Energy Future Energy Efficiency programs by initiating customer engagement and outreach as well as advancing the clean energy jobs training program I mentioned earlier and related IT system build-out activity.\r\nFollowing the BPU approval of our $700 million AMI proposal in January, we have begun implementation of the 4-year program.\r\nOur current focus is on planning the AMI communications network, customer outreach and developing the installation schedule of the new meters.\r\nOn the regulatory and policy front, there are several upcoming developments at the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the BPU and PJM that could influence future results.\r\nLast month, FERC promulgated a new proposed rule to limit the 50 basis point RTO return on equity incentive to a 3-year period.\r\nGiven the Biden administration's interest in the significant transmission build out to expand the integration of Clean Energy into the nation's power grid, this development was disappointed.\r\nWe have long supported the need for higher incentives for transmission investment over distribution returns based on the added complexity and risk of these projects.\r\nCoordination through the RTO has benefits, but -- risks and complications must be considered as well.\r\nBased on the short comment window provided, the proposed rule could be enacted as early as the third quarter.\r\nWe will file comments to recognize the merits of continuing the RTO adder, but this looks to be an uphill battle, given  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The positive results were driven by PSE&G and PSEG Power. PSE&G's net income increased 8% due to higher revenue from capital investments and favorable pension results.

Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\r\nXia will provide you with more details in just a few minutes.\r\nBut given our strong performance through the first half of this year, we're raising our annual guidance.\r\nThe new range is $4.02 a share to $4.05 a share, and our expectation is that we will reach the top end of that range.\r\nAs always, this assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.\r\nNow as we look across our business lines, I'm pleased to report that every segment is performing at a high level.\r\nOur companies continue to deliver superior reliability and customer satisfaction.\r\nA solid economic recovery in Wisconsin with commercial and industrial expansion gives us confidence in our projected sales growth.\r\nOur balance sheet is strong.\r\nWe have no need to issue new equity to fund our ESG progress plan, and our plan is well on track for both our regulated and our infrastructure segments.\r\nAs you may know, we expect our ESG progress plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%.\r\nAt the same time, it's bolstering our sustainability as we invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art technology.\r\nA good example of our progress is the announcement we made just a week ago about a $400 million investment in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center.\r\nScott will provide you with more detail on this development in just a moment, but I will tell you that the offtake agreement is with one of the largest high-tech companies in the world, and we expect the project to meet or exceed all of our financial metrics.\r\nWe've also made great progress on our plan to build 1,800 megawatts of regulated solar, wind and battery storage.\r\nThese carbon-free assets will play a significant role in improving our environmental footprint.\r\nRecall that, back in May, we set near-term goals that are among the most ambitious in the industry: reducing carbon emissions by 60% from our electric generation fleet by 2025 and achieving an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline.\r\nSo ahead that we now expect only 8% of our regulated electricity supply to come from coal by the end of 2030.\r\nWe believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units; operating refinements; and the use of existing technology as we execute our ESG progress plan.\r\nOf course, our long-term goal remains net-zero carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050.\r\nAnd our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and introduce renewable natural gas into our system will help us achieve another aggressive goal: net-zero methane emissions by 2030.\r\nYou can learn more about these goals and much more in our corporate responsibility report, which we published just last week.\r\nAnd now let's switch gears a bit and take a quick look at our regional economy.\r\nWe're still seeing the positive effects of a strong recovery.\r\nWisconsin's unemployment rate, in fact, stands today at 3.9%.\r\nFolks, that's two full percentage points better than the national average.\r\nAs I mentioned, business continues to grow with new projects across the region.\r\nFor example, Milwaukee Tool is expanding the operations again here in Milwaukee.\r\nIf you're not familiar with Milwaukee Tool, company has been a leader in the development of battery-powered, cordless tools.\r\nIt now has become the world's number one producer of tools for professionals in the construction trades, utility sector, as well as for auto mechanics.\r\nAnd now Milwaukee Tool is redeveloping a vacant downtown office tower to provide space for one,200 new employees over the next five years.\r\nIn addition, a number of other economic development projects are in the pipeline, and we'll be covering those with you in future calls.\r\nOn that note, I'll turn our call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segment.\r\nWell, wonders never cease.\r\nAnd I'm not sure I can top all of that, but no pun intended, let's give it a shot.\r\nWe have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO;

[/INST] # Due to strong performance in the first half of the year, the company has raised its annual guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.05 per share, with expectations of reaching the top end of the range. The company's focus on ESG progress is driving a 7% average annual growth in asset base and improving sustainability through investments in renewable energy and technology. The Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center project is a notable example with an offtake agreement from a major high-tech company. Wisconsin's positive economic outlook, with a low unemployment rate and business expansion, contributes to the company's confidence in its sales growth. The company remains financially sound with no need to issue new equity for ESG initiatives. Additionally, the company is investing significantly in its infrastructure segment, with $2.3 billion invested to date and plans for $1.1 billion more over the next five years. It is closely monitoring inflation but has not encountered any significant impacts on projects yet.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\r\nI'm sure you saw the announcement last week that our Board of Directors has taken the next step in our long-term succession planning.\r\nKevin has decided to devote more time with his grandchildren and to water-skiing barefoot on his favorite lakes.\r\nHe'll be retiring in 2022.\r\nWe're delighted that Scott will assume the role of President and Chief Executive on February 1.\r\nAnd finally, I've agreed to continue serving as Executive Chairman until our Annual Stockholders Meeting in 2024.\r\nKevin and Scott, of course, have been instrumental in shaping our progress over many years.\r\nAnd I look forward to working hand-in-hand with Scott as he takes on his new role.\r\nOur results were significantly better than expected, driven by warmer than normal weather, continued economic recovery in our region, and our focus on operating efficiency.\r\nOur balance sheet, our cash flows remained strong, and as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity.\r\nIn just a moment, we'll update you on the details of our new five-year ESG Progress Plan, a plan that will cover our investments in reliability and decarbonization over the period 2022 through 2026.\r\nAs we've reported to you, we're well on our way to achieving some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions.\r\nAcross our generation fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction by 2025 and then 80% reduction by 2030, both from a 2005 baseline.\r\nImportantly, we have a roadmap to reach these goals without any major advances in technology.\r\nSo today, we're announcing that our use of coal will continue to decline to a level that we expect will be immaterial by the end of 2030.\r\nBy the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal will account for less than 5% of the power we supply to customers.\r\nA number of you have also been asking when can we exit coal completely.\r\nHere is the answer.\r\nWe believe we'll be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the year 2035.\r\nThe next logical question is, what does this mean for the modern coal-fired units at our Oak Creek site?\r\nAs you recall, these units were part of our Power the Future plan and were completed only about a decade ago.\r\nWell, our modern units at Oak Creek will remain a key part of our fleet for many, many years to come.\r\nThese Power the Future units rank as some of the most efficient in the country, among the top 5% of all coal-fired plants in heat rate performance over the past decade and they're strategically -- as we've discussed, they are strategically located to support reliability on the Midwestern transmission grid.\r\nFortunately, we can plan for the future of the new units at Oak Creek with fuel flexibility in mind.\r\nWe've tested coal firing on natural gas at the site.\r\nSo subject to the receipt of an environmental permit, we plan to make operating refinements over the next two years that will allow a fuel blend of up to 30% on natural gas.\r\nAnd then over time, we will be able to transition completely away from coal by making incremental investments in plant equipment.\r\nThis would include, for example, new burners and, of course, we will need additional pipeline capacity reaching into the site.\r\nSo we see a very bright and long future for the newer units at Oak Creek.\r\nAnd now, let's take a look at the capital plan that will continue to shape a decarbonizing economy.\r\nFor the period 2022 through 2026, we expect to invest $17.7 billion.\r\nOur focus remains on efficiency, sustainability and growth.\r\nThis ESG Progress Plan is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $1.6 billion or nearly 10% above our previous five-year plan.\r\nWe expect this plan to support compound earnings growth of 6% to 7% a year over the next five years without any need to issue new equity.\r\nWe'll be increasing our investment in renewables for our regulated utilities from 1,800 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 2,400 megawatts in this brand-new plan.\r\nThese carbon-free assets include solar, wind and battery storage.\r\nWe're also dedicating more capital to hardening our electric distribution networks, so that we can maintain a superior level of reliability for our customers, and investments in our gas delivery systems and the development of renewable natural gas will support our goals for the gas distribution business as well.\r\nAs a reminder, we're targeting net zero methane emissions by 2030.\r\nSo add it all up and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan.\r\nThe projects that are driving our growth are low-risk and highly executable, and they are accelerating the transition to a clean energy future.\r\nWe continue to see customer growth across our system.\r\nAt the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and 15,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago.\r\nRetail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet.\r\nOverall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.4% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather normal basis were up 2.5%.\r\nWe continue to see economic rebound in our service territory.\r\nFor example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 3.5% from last year's third quarter and on a weather normal basis, they were up 4.2%.\r\nMeanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 3.8% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather normal basis were up 3.5%.\r\nNatural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were up 1%.\r\nThis excludes gas used for power generation.\r\nAnd on a weather normal basis natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%.\r\nOverall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up.\r\nTurning now to our Infrastructure segment, our new capital plan calls for the investment of $1.9 billion between 2022 and 2026.\r\nConsidering the three projects that are currently under development, we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion at that timeframe.\r\nAs a quick reminder, we have eight wind projects, all with long-term off-takers.\r\nAnnounced through an operation in our Infrastructure segment, this represents approximately $2.3 billion of investments.\r\nAs previously discussed, our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year and our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service in the first half of 2022.\r\nThese timelines have been factored into our updated capital plan.\r\nFirst, I'll cover some developments here in Wisconsin.\r\nI'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow I Solar project is just weeks away from completion.\r\nYou'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin.\r\nFor the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, we now are performing civil work and grading.\r\nOur target for completing that project is the end of 2022.\r\nThat date will depend on module supply which is uncertain as we await clarity on matters before the Department of Commerce.\r\nNow, for a few regulatory updates.\r\nWe expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission shortly on our plans to build two liquefied natural gas storage facilities in the Southeastern part of the state.\r\nThis proposed investment would greatly enhance customer savings and reliability during Wisconsin's cold winters.\r\nPending approval, we expect the facilities to enter service in late 2023.\r\nThey are projected to save our We Energies customers approximately $200 million over time.\r\nWe also have updates on the rate reviews at two of our smaller utilities.\r\nThe Illinois Commerce Commission unanimously approved the final order for our rate case at North Shore Gas.\r\nThe order authorizes a rate increase Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP.\r\nWe also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\r\nI hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon.\r\nWe've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall.\r\nBut that is not the situation everywhere.\r\nIn many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery.\r\nYet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this pandemic.\r\nI'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis in our own small way to support the global effort.\r\nWe've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals.\r\nAnd we're off to a very strong start in 2021, executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets outside the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics.\r\nIn the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales.\r\nIn total, our containment animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticides and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products.\r\nDigging deeper on pet care, it has been one year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio.\r\nIt is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a 90% plus penetration rate in our largest U.S. corporate accounts.\r\nSimparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides.\r\nAfter several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart.\r\nWe believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy.\r\nAnd our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world.\r\nMeanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and Cytopoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth.\r\nWe are seeing excellent traction and significant growth across the range of international market.\r\nOur dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for pruritus in dogs.\r\nVeterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide.\r\nIn the containment animal space, we've also continued to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter.\r\nWe have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales, made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan images platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch.\r\nWe're also making progress on our Reference Labs integrations and look forward to future expansion in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally.\r\nOur growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter.\r\nCattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and generic competition projection was later than expected.\r\nMeanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China.\r\nLooking ahead, we are raising guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10.5% to 12%.\r\nAnd while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN.\r\nGlenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks.\r\nSince the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands.\r\nSince our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year.\r\nOsteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats.\r\nMeanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU.\r\nAnd we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dog owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets.\r\nIn the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia, and we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year.\r\nWe will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans.\r\nIt is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH a one-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine, and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth.\r\nWe're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion.\r\nIn poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets.\r\nAnd in parasiticides, we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets.\r\nIn terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to communities, animals and the planet.\r\nWe've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nWe'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June.\r\nIn closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum.\r\nPet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U.S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally.\r\nWe feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach.\r\nIn 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue.\r\nLast year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand.\r\nIn livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, a Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nI'll then wrap things up and then would be glad to take questions.\r\nYesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $207 million or $2.17 per share.\r\nExcluding special items, second quarter 2021 net income was also $207 million or $2.17 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share.\r\nSecond quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2020.\r\nTotal company EBITDA for the second quarter excluding special items was $397 million in 2021 and $299 million in 2020.\r\nReported earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included special items expense and income rounding to a negligible impact while last year's second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our Paper segment.\r\nExcluding special items, the $0.79 per share increase in second quarter 2021 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.01 and volume $0.74 in our Packaging segment, higher volume in our Paper segment of $0.03, and lower non-operating pension expense of $0.03.\r\nThese items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.57 primarily due to inflation related increases in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies, recycled fiber cost as well as other indirect and fixed cost areas.\r\nWe also had inflation related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.05 per share while annual outage expenses were up $0.19 per share compared to last year.\r\nFreight and logistics expenses were higher by $0.19 per share driven by historically high load to truck ratios, driver shortages, increases in fuel costs, and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep pace with the box demand.\r\nLastly, depreciation expense was higher by $0.01 per share and Paper segment prices and mix were lower by $0.01 per share.\r\nLooking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter of 2021 of $409 million with sales of $1.7 billion resulted in a margin of 24% versus last year's EBITDA of $313 million and sales of $1.4 billion or a 22% margin.\r\nOur mills and plants continued to do an outstanding job of meeting our customer needs while managing through certain material and chemical availability issues, a tight labor market, various freight and logistics challenges as well as the planned maintenance outages at four of our mills during the second quarter.\r\nThe mills executed the planned outages extremely well and with the help of the No.\r\n3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill provided our plants the necessary containerboard to achieve an all-time record for total box shipments.\r\nAlthough we were able to build some much-needed inventory, due to very high demand, we ended the second quarter below our targeted levels and at a new low for weeks of inventory supply for this time of year and ahead of expected very busy third and fourth quarters.\r\nIn the second half of the year, we still anticipate a planned outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill later in the third quarter as well as a significant planned outage at our DeRidder mill in the fourth quarter.\r\nImplementation of the previously announced price increases continues to be executed extremely well by our sales organization while our engineering and technology organization and the employees at all of our mills and corrugated products plants continues to successfully implement numerous initiatives and projects to reduce cost through efficiency, productivity, and optimization improvements.\r\nWith inflation driven cost increases across most all areas of our company coupled with truck, rail, and barge challenges for both incoming and outgoing products and materials at our facilities, these efforts are absolutely critical to our success.\r\nIn addition, being a primarily virgin fiber based producer of containerboard minimizes the impact of significant increases in recycled fiber costs over the last several quarters.\r\nAs Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets.\r\nOur plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter.\r\nThrough the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%.\r\nDriven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments, supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year.\r\nWe are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines.\r\nDomestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021.\r\nExport containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021.\r\nFinally, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases.\r\nThe benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last few years have been extremely successful and put us in position to serve our customers better than ever before.\r\nOur strategy of improving the technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our footprint through the construction of new facilities as well as closing certain plants to consolidate business with other locations is based upon our customer's needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them.\r\nWe're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and savings, and cost reductions in several conversion areas throughout our plants.\r\nLooking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $12 million with sales of $142 million or an 8% margin compared to second quarter 2020 EBITDA of $5 million and sales of $3 million or a 4% margin.\r\nAlthough about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continued to implement our announced price increases.\r\nVolume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama mill down for two months during the second quarter while this year, we ran the No.\r\n1 machine at Jackson on paper and the No.\r\n3 machine ran linerboard.\r\nNow that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a three machine paper system.\r\nWe'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and will run our paper system accordingly.\r\nCash provided by operations for the second quarter was $228 million with free cash flow of $97 million.\r\nThe primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $131 million, common stock dividends of $95 million, cash taxes of $87 million, and net interest payments of $40 [Phonetic] million.\r\nWe ended the quarter with $972 million of cash on hand or $1.1 billion including marketable securities.\r\nOur liquidity at June 30th was just under $1.5 billion.\r\nAs we move from the second to the third quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the second quarter of 2020.\r\nHopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.\r\nThese risks include those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures by governmental or regulatory authorities to combat the pandemic on our business and operations as well as the business and operations of the consumer, our customers, suppliers, business partners and labor force.\r\nThese risks also include those detailed in our various filings with the SEC, which may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.\r\nThe use of the term PPE relates to our personal protection garment business, including face masks, face coverings and gowns.\r\nAlso, please note that unless otherwise stated, all prior year comparisons are to 2019 results that have been rebased to reflect the exited C9 Champion program at Target and the DKNY intimates license.\r\nWith me on the call today are Gerald Evans, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer.\r\nThis quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic.\r\nDespite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses.\r\nFor the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow.\r\nOur strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio, the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model.\r\nIn my view, there are four key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model.\r\nAnd our ability to grow this business going forward.\r\nFirst, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity.\r\nTouching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our three main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international.\r\nPoint-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settled into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world.\r\nIn fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. Basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels.\r\nIn U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter.\r\nMoving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June.\r\nWe experienced strong momentum in our Basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter.\r\nWithin our Intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened.\r\nWe experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment.\r\nIn the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continued to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel.\r\nWith store reopenings under way in our International business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia.\r\nStrength in our Online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year.\r\nWe experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website.\r\nWithin our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter.\r\nWe are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trend in our Apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year.\r\nTurning to the second highlight of the quarter.\r\nOur newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue.\r\nThis was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses.\r\nWe recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail.\r\nWe expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity.\r\nThe third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations.\r\nYear-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year.\r\nWith the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating cost and working capital.\r\nWe continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year.\r\nAnd finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities.\r\nThis focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend.\r\nWe ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward.\r\nLooking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly.\r\nAbsent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half.\r\nOur core brands are healthy.\r\nWe are gaining market share.\r\nPoint-of-sale trends remain strong.\r\nOur back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring 2021 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region.\r\nWe believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment.\r\nSo in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment.\r\nMomentum is building in our Apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity.\r\nWe believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years.\r\nI've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years.\r\nTo the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years.\r\nTogether, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories.\r\nThese are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together.\r\nI look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead.\r\nOur strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our verti Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifices.\r\nFrom navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost-saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination, and an indomitable spirit.\r\nI am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other.\r\nDuring today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our 4th quarter and full-year operating results as well as an update on the, on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021.\r\nMike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full-year financial outlook.\r\nBriefly reviewing our operating results for the 4th quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis and adjusted, adjusted earnings per share grew 14%.\r\nFor the full year, revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%.\r\nThe strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong -- strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives.\r\nLooking more closely at our top line results, first from a customer perspective.\r\nOur largest market category pharma was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 15% growth.\r\nOur industrial market grew 5% while academia and government declined 15%.\r\nOn a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 12% with China, up 19%.\r\nMeanwhile, sales in the Americas grew 3% for the US growing 4% and European sales grew at 6%.\r\nFrom a product perspective, our Waters branded products and services grew approximately 8% while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis.\r\nWhile still navigating the global pandemic, we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues, and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand.\r\nServices grew 10% while consumables business grew approximately 14% driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched PREMIER Columns, which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market.\r\nLC Instruments grew most -- grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth.\r\nThis improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal pharma year end budget flush, and early contributions from our LC replacement initiatives.\r\nFollowing last June's release of the Arc HPLC System in the core HPLC market with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA-QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio.\r\nOn February 10, we will launch ACQUITY PREMIER, a next generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity, and overall capability.\r\nThis new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research.\r\nThis new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the 4th quarter.\r\nThe combined solution will alleviate non-specific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation, and an increased confidence in analytical results.\r\nAfter a very strong 3rd quarter, mass spec sales were about flat in Q4.\r\nAs you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy, which we saw with biomedical research.\r\nThere was also a general softness in clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing.\r\nNotably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double-digits, driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and the QDA.\r\nFinally, to TA, revenues declined low single digits, which was -- which was much improved from earlier in the year.\r\nWe saw the core thermal business start to pick up driven by market improvement in Asia.\r\nIn particular, life sciences including pharma and medical devices grew double-digits.\r\nCombined these, comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues.\r\nHowever, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers.\r\nLooking now, at our geographies, all major regions grew.\r\nThe Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double-digits.\r\nIn the US, the growth was driven by pharma, which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental, academic, and government.\r\nThough Latin America continued to decline, it improved meaningfully relative to earlier in the year.\r\nEurope also experienced strong pharma performance, partially offset by material science, food, and academic and government.\r\nIn both US and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based including strength in big pharma, large molecule customers, genetics, and contract labs.\r\nChina had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth driven by continuing acceleration in pharma as well as strong environmental growth.\r\nThe pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers including particularly strong growth at contract labs.\r\nIndia also continued to grow double-digits.\r\nIn summary, overall in the 4th quarter, we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year end spending trends.\r\nNow for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the US, Europe, and India all seeing positive growth.\r\nIndustrial declined 3% for the full year and academic and government declined 16%.\r\nNotably, our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8% owed in part to strength in small molecules, the industry recovered from lock-downs.\r\nIndustrial also grew in the second half at 4% while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22% respectively.\r\nGeographically for the year, Asia sales were down 4% with China -- China sales down 8%.\r\nSales in Americas were down 4%; for the US, down 2%.\r\nEurope sales were up 2%.\r\nNotably, all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year with the US up 4% and Europe up 6% following first half declines of 9% and 3% respectively.\r\nChina market grew in the second half, up 11%, reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year.\r\nNow, I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program, as several of the initiatives we're putting interaction are starting to contribute to growth.\r\nFirst, I would talk about our instrument replacement initiative, then our progress in contract lab expansion followed by e-commerce and lastly, I'll give you a BioAccord update.\r\nFirst, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative under way, we delivered our first quarterly LC Instrument revenue growth in two years and our LC Instrument win-loss was the highest it has been in three years.\r\nInitial customer feedback has been very positive on the Arc HPLC as well.\r\nSecond, as part of our contract lab expansion initiatives, we have made important progress in targeting this high growth customer group.\r\nWe have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings, which have -- which have been well received by the segment.\r\nIt is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we're making.\r\nThird, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com traffic is up double digits, driven by search engine optimization and paid search.\r\nWhile there isn't a one-to-one relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traff Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

of both our revenues from rental properties, which increased by 3.5% for the quarter and 5% for the year.\r\nAnd our adjusted funds from operations per share, which grew by 12% for the quarter and 7% for the year.\r\nIn a normal year, we'd be proud to report on this growth.\r\nWhen you consider the countless challenges brought upon us by COVID-19, I can say with great satisfaction that these results were only possible due to the extraordinary efforts put forth by the entire Getty team this year.\r\nI believe these results reflect the value of our portfolio and combined with our strong and flexible balance sheet and growing pipeline of investment prospects position the Company well for success as we work toward 2021 and beyond.\r\nI'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the stability of our triple-net lease rents and growth platform.\r\nOur portfolio of convenience stores, gas stations and other automotive assets produced another strong quarter of rent collections, operating performance and growth at Getty.\r\nWe saw the rent collection rate increase to 98.7% and we collected substantially all of the deferred rent and mortgage payments that were due to us in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe entered 2021 with a small balance of COVID-related deferrals, which we expect to collect throughout this year.\r\nIn addition, Getty completed several leasing and disposition transactions in the quarter, which we -- which will serve to stabilize the small number of assets where we were experiencing difficulties with rent collections.\r\nLooking ahead, although uncertainty remains regarding the forward impact of COVID-19 to the broader economy, we are encouraged by the strength exhibited by our tenants and assets since the beginning of the pandemic.\r\nWe will continue to be vigilant in monitoring the health of our tenants as we believe the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US economy will continue to impact the consumer and retail activity through at least the first half of 2021, and therefore, could negatively affect Getty's rent collections and financial results.\r\nThe execution of the Company's acquisition strategy was an important driver of Q4 and full year 2020 performance.\r\nFor the quarter, Getty acquired 10 properties for $45.1 million and for the year, we acquired 34 properties for $150 million, which represents significant growth over the Company's acquisition activity in the prior year.\r\nThese high-quality assets are located in numerous markets across the country and include portfolios of both convenience stores which offer consumers food, traditional merchandise and fuel as well as car washes.\r\nWe also continued the momentum of our redevelopment program as we completed our third project with AutoZone, bringing our total of completed projects for the year to six.\r\nWe are closing in on completing 20 projects since the inception of our redevelopment strategy further demonstrating the value of the real estate we hold in our portfolio.\r\nOur balance sheet also ended 2020 in excellent condition as we successfully issued a $175 million, 3.4% debt private placement in December and we issued approximately $65 million of equity under our ATM program during the year.\r\nOur leverage continues to be less than 5 times and with a revolver that is almost completely undrawn, Getty has significant capacity to fund its growth plans.\r\nAs we enter 2021, we feel encouraged about our portfolio of nearly 1,000 properties.\r\nThe convenience store industry and other automotive businesses are essential and largely internet resistant.\r\nOur rents 65% of which come from the top 50 MSAs in the US continue to be well covered.\r\nIn fact, despite COVID-related challenges, our rent coverage ratio remained stable throughout the year and ended 2020 at a healthy 2.6 times.\r\nOur portfolio is built around serving the needs of the car driving individual and it's continuing to do so whether it's stopping for convenience store items, fuel, getting snacks, meals, or getting your car washed or reserviced.\r\nThese are needs that continue to be in high demand today and which we believe will be stable for the mobile consumer for years to come.\r\nOur team is more focused than ever on executing our growth initiatives, including maximizing the quality of our input portfolio through continued active asset management, enhancing our portfolio through accretive acquisition in stores and other automotive assets which serve the mobile consumer and unlocking embedded value through our selective redevelopments.\r\nWe are confident in our targeted investment strategy, which focuses on acquiring high-quality real estate in Metropolitan markets across the country and in our ability to continue to successfully execute on these strategic objectives.\r\nOur approach and focus on driving growth should result in driving additional shareholder value as we move through the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\r\nDuring 2020, Getty's underwriting of potential transactions grew as we added resources to focus on convenience store and other automotive opportunities.\r\nFor the year, we reviewed approximately $2.1 billion of opportunities, which met our initial screen process.\r\nConvenience store opportunities represented 62% and other automotive represented 38% of the total.\r\nAs Chris mentioned, we remain highly committed to growing our portfolio in terms of both the convenience store industry, which offers consumers food, traditional merchandise and fuel, and with other automotive-related assets that are tied to mobile consumer spending.\r\nGoing forward, we anticipate growing both areas of our underwriting platform as we view the businesses as highly complementary and the underwriting characteristics to be very similar.\r\nTo review a few highlights of our investment activities, for the fourth quarter, we invested $45.1 million in 10 highly -- high quality convenience store and car wash assets.\r\nIn October, we completed a sale-leaseback with CEFCO Convenience Stores, one of the leading independent convenience store operators in the Southern United States.\r\nIn this transaction, Getty acquired six properties for $28.7 million, all of located throughout the state of Texas.\r\nThese properties are subject to unitary triple-net lease with a 15-year base term and multiple renewal options.\r\nThey have an average lot size of 2.7 acres and an average store size in excess of 5,300 square feet, which reflect that the assets we acquired have all the attributes of today's modern full service convenience store.\r\nOur initial cash yield is in line with our historical acquisition cap rate range.\r\nIn addition, we acquired four car wash assets in individual transactions with Go Car Wash and Zips Car Wash for $16.4 million in the aggregate.\r\nFor the year, we acquired 34 properties for $150 million.\r\nOur weighted average initial return on acquisitions for the year was 7%.\r\n Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 in a brief cautionary statement.\r\nWe appreciate you joining us for our second-quarter investor update.\r\nMoving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call.\r\nJoe will then provide a detailed review of second-quarter financial results and walk through some recent actions we've taken to strengthen PPL's balance sheet.\r\nTurning to Slide 4.\r\nThe second quarter has been a busy one as we continue to advance the strategic repositioning of the company.\r\nFirst, we completed the sale of our U.K. utility, achieving exceptional value for the business and once again demonstrating our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities to maximize shareowner value.\r\nThe sale resulted in net cash proceeds of $10.4 billion, which will support the repositioning of PPL as a high-growth U.S.-regulated utility company.\r\nAs a reminder, we've earmarked $3.8 billion of those proceeds to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid.\r\nWe also deployed some of the proceeds to achieve our previously stated objective of strengthening our balance sheet, utilizing $3.9 billion to retire $3.5 billion of outstanding holding company debt which will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility.\r\nRegarding the remaining proceeds, we continue to review various options as previously discussed, including investing incremental capital at our utilities or in renewable energy, as well as the repurchase of PPL shares.\r\nOn the topic of share repurchases, our board recently authorized the company to repurchase up to $3 billion in PPL common stock.\r\nWe currently expect to repurchase about $500 million by year-end, while we continue to assess other opportunities to deploy proceeds to maximize shareowner value.\r\nThe actual amount we apply to share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the determination of other uses for the proceeds.\r\nWe believe our current plan provides a balance of an efficient use of proceeds while still maintaining financial flexibility.\r\nI'll note that we are in the process of reevaluating our capital plans for incremental investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers.\r\nWe'll provide further updates to our capital and rate base plans after we complete this review.\r\nThe U.K. sale represented an important first step in our strategic repositioning.\r\nrate-regulated utilities and strengthening our balance sheet while providing much greater flexibility to support future growth.\r\nWe're also making great progress in the acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island.\r\nTo date, we've satisfied our HSR and FCC requirements.\r\nAnd on July 16, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities granted a waiver of jurisdiction over the sale, streamlining the overall path to regulatory approval for the acquisition.\r\nWe continue to make progress on securing approvals from FERC and the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers, which are the two remaining approvals required for the transaction.\r\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to close the transaction by March of next year with hopes of closing before year-end.\r\nAs we pursue the final regulatory approvals, we are working closely with National Grid on transition planning to ensure a seamless transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing.\r\nWe've also announced our planned leadership team for the Rhode Island Utility, Dave Bonenberger, who has nearly four decades of energy industry experience, including leading both the transmission and distribution businesses at PPL Electric Utilities will serve as the Rhode Island President upon completion of the transaction.\r\nDave is well-positioned to lead the execution of our operational strategy in Rhode Island as we seek to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers and to support the state's decarbonization goals.\r\nDave will be joined in Rhode Island by former National Grid employees in creating a strong, experienced, and local leadership team with a deep commitment to delivering energy safely and reliably to Rhode Island customers.\r\nMoving to Slide 5.\r\nThis goal encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from our Kentucky generation, as well as other aspects of our business as outlined in the footnote on the slide.\r\nPPL is fully committed to driving innovation to enable net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\r\nAnd to ensure a balanced, responsible, and just transition for our employees, communities, and customers as we advance toward our clean energy goals.\r\nOur new goal reflects our continuous evaluation of our progress and opportunities through ongoing business and resource planning efforts.\r\nBased on our latest reviews, we believe we are on a path to achieve 80% emissions reduction by 2040, a full decade ahead of our prior goal.\r\nAs a result, in addition to today's announced net-zero emissions goal, we've also accelerated our previous interim goals, now targeting an 80% reduction by 2040 and a 70% reduction by 2035.\r\nIn addition, we are undertaking an enterprisewide effort to enhance our clean energy strategy and develop additional programs, metrics, and goals that will guide our path to net-zero emissions.\r\nWe've hired an industry-leading global consulting firm to assist us in this endeavor.\r\nIn addition to the strategic initiative, we are completing an updated scenario-based climate assessment to evaluate the potential impacts to PPL from climate change and potential future requirements.\r\nOur last climate assessment report was published in 2017.\r\nOur updated assessment, which we intend to publish later this year, will analyze multiple scenarios, including a scenario tied to limiting the global temperature increase to no more than one and a half degrees Celsius.\r\nAs we conduct our climate assessment, our efforts will be informed by our ongoing integrated resource planning activities in Kentucky.\r\nLG&E and KU submit an IRP once every three years to the Kentucky Public Service Commission.\r\nAnd the next IRP will be filed in October of this year.\r\nBoth the Climate Assessment and the IRP will serve as key inputs as we further define the pathway to achieving our emissions goals.\r\nWrapping up this slide, we recognize that achieving these emissions reductions while maintaining reliability and affordability will require significant advances in clean energy technology and solutions, that can be scaled economically to meet the country's energy needs.\r\nThis is especially true as we support greater electrification of other sectors.\r\nWith that in mind, investing in research and development is a key pillar of our clean energy strategy.\r\nAnd we continue to look for opportunities to engage in this area to drive the innovation and solutions necessary to achieve net-zero.\r\nPPL, for example, is an anchor sponsor of the low carbon resources initiative, being led by EPRI in the Gas Technology Institute and I chair EPRI's LCRI Board Working Group.\r\nWe also recently joined Energy Impact Partners global investment platform, which brings together leading companies and entrepreneurs worldwide to foster innovation toward a sustainable energy future.\r\nThrough our participation in the EIP platform, PPL will support up to $50 million in investments aimed at accelerating shift to a low carbon future and driving commercial-scale solutions needed to deliver deep economywide decarbonization.\r\nApart from LCRI and EIP's investment platform, we also continue to engage in a number of other R&D efforts related to clean energy technologies and enhancing the power grid.\r\nThese collaborative efforts provide PPL greater visibility into emerging technologies that can be leveraged to advance the clean energy transition, and we will continue to look for opportunity to expand our work and support in this area.\r\nMoving to Slide 6.\r\nWe've outlined our updated path to net-zero carbon emissions on this slide, along with our current expectations on coal-fired generation capacity in Kentuck Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nAfter which, I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take any questions.\r\nYesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $57 million or $0.59 per share.\r\nExcluding the special items, second quarter 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share compared to the second quarter of 2019, net income of $194 million or $2.04 per share.\r\nSecond quarter net income was $1.54 billion in 2020 and $1.76 billion in 2019.\r\nTotal company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $299 million in 2020 and $376 million in 2019.\r\nSecond quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our paper segment.\r\nBob will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes.\r\nSpecial items expenses also included the previously reported closure of our corrugated products facility in San Lorenzo, California and costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nExcluding the special items that we mentioned, the $0.66 per share decrease in second quarter 2020 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment of $0.66 and paper segment $0.05, lower volumes in our paper segment, $0.40 and higher depreciation expense, $0.04.\r\nThese items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.33, primarily in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies and several fixed cost areas.\r\nWe also had lower annual outage expenses of $0.10, lower converting costs, $0.03, lower freight expenses, $0.02 and other costs, $0.01.\r\nLooking at our packaging business.\r\nEBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2020 of $313 million with sales of $1.4 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $349 million and sales of $1.5 billion or 23% margin.\r\nWe ran our containerboard mills to demand, built some much-needed inventory from the historically low levels at the end of the first quarter and maintained the industry-leading integration rate by supplying our box plants with the necessary containerboard to establish a new second quarter record for box shipments per day.\r\nWe ended the second quarter with inventory still at the relatively low levels but in adequate position to meet our expected stronger third quarter demand.\r\nOur efficiencies and cost control at the mills and corrugated products facilities throughout the quarter were truly remarkable.\r\nAnd we continue to see improvements in freight and logistics expenses through the optimization of our trucking operations and geographic footprint of our containerboard supply.\r\nDemand for our corrugated products was very good in the second quarter, especially during the month of June.\r\nAs Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new second quarter record for shipments per day, which were up 1.2% compared to last year's second quarter.\r\nTotal shipments for the quarter were also up 1.2% over last year.\r\nAs a comparison for the second quarter, the industry was down 1.4% in total and on a workday basis.\r\nThrough the first half of 2020, our box shipment volume is up 2.5% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 0.6%.\r\nOutside sales volume of containerboard was about 10,000 tons below last year's second quarter and 23,000 tons below the first quarter of 2020, and as we ran our containerboard system to demand, supplied the record needs of our box plants and positioned our inventory for even higher demand during an expected stronger third quarter.\r\nDomestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.61 per share below the second quarter of 2019 and down $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020.\r\nExport containerboard prices were down about $0.05 per share versus last year's second quarter and flat compared to the first quarter of 2020.\r\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last couple of years are continuing to gain traction.\r\nAs we have said many times, this strategy of improving the technology and equipment in various plants as well as the construction of new box plants is based upon our customers' needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them.\r\nWe're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and various operating and conversion cost areas.\r\nLooking at the paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $5 million with sales of $123 million or a 4% margin compared to second quarter 2019 EBITDA of $48 million and sales of $238 million for a 20% margin.\r\nSecond quarter paper prices and mix were about 5% below last year, and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2020.\r\nAs expected, our sales volume was about 45% below last year, and as announced back in April, we had our Jackson mill down for the months of May and June to help manage our supply with our demand outlook.\r\nUnfortunately, our view of demand as we approached the end of June did not improve to the point of allowing us to restart the mill, resulting in us recently announcing that Jackson will also be down for the months of July and August.\r\nWe'll continue to assess the market conditions for potential September restart of the mill.\r\nCash provided by operations for the second quarter was $227 million, with free cash flow of $146 million.\r\nThe primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $81 million, common stock dividends of $75 million; net interest payments of $41 million and cash taxes of $39 million.\r\nWe ended the quarter with $853 million of cash on hand or $977 million, including marketable securities.\r\nOur liquidity at June 30 was just over $1.3 billion.\r\nDuring the second quarter, uncoated freesheet market conditions and especially demand for our cut size office paper products, continued to deteriorate rapidly arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nThese conditions, along with the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations, resulted in a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets within our paper segment.\r\nDue to this triggering event in a more likely than not assessment that an impairment of goodwill occurred, an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020, was performed.\r\nBased on this evaluation, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the paper segment and recognized a noncash impairment charge totaling $55.2 million.\r\nThe impairment charge is not tax deductible.\r\nWe also performed a recoverability test on the long-lived assets within our paper segment, including long-lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2020.\r\nThe results of this test indicated that these assets were 100% recoverable.\r\nLastly, we are planning to take or to make a change to the scheduled outages in our containerboard mills for the fourth quarter of this year versus what we discussed during last quarter's call.\r\nOur current plans are to pull forward some recovery boiler work at the DeRidder Mill from next year to eliminate the risk of unscheduled downtime and during this period, perform a high-return capital project on the No.\r\none paper machine real section.\r\nThe fourth quarter estimate for our scheduled outages is now $0.59 per share, and the full year increment is now $1.05 per share.\r\nAs in the first quarter, the employees at all of our manufacturing and office locations ran their operations safely and in a very cost effective manner while facing the unprecedented conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nAll facilities continue to operate in adherence to CDC guidelines and followed a strict protocol f Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm William Prate, Senior Director of Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.\r\nChris will brief you on our operations, Dave will provide an update regarding our enterprise strategy and Tom will cover the financials.\r\nAfter their remarks, we will open the call to questions.\r\nThese risks and uncertainties are described in today's news release and the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nWe encourage you to review those documents, particularly our Safe Harbor statement, for a description of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results.\r\nAdditionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items.\r\nWe hope that you and your loved ones are continuing to stay safe.\r\n2020 tested us all.\r\nAnd I'm extremely proud of the way the Tennant team rose to the challenge.\r\nWe did so by remaining true to our guiding principles while continuing to provide the solutions and service that our customers have always expected from Tennant.\r\nOur full year 2020 results reflect our speed and effectiveness in responding to the pandemic, specifically in how we prioritized the health and safety of our employees, the measures we took to manage costs and ensure liquidity, and above all, the determination and dedication that our employees showed in meeting the needs of our customers.\r\nTheir hard work helped minimize the overall operational and financial impact of the pandemic.\r\nWhile the business impact of the pandemic significant across most of our markets, it had little effect on our strategic initiatives within the company.\r\nA year ago, I shared with you our enterprise growth strategy, which is based on three pillars.\r\nTo win where we have competitive advantage.\r\nTo reduce complexity and build scalable processes.\r\nAnd to innovate for profitable growth.\r\nWe follow through with our plan in spite of the pandemic.\r\nIn fact, our strategy was integral to everything we accomplished in 2020.\r\nFor example, our recent launch of a range of new floor scrubbers reflects Tennant commitment to innovation and our focus on winning where we have competitive advantage.\r\nWe've also made meaningful improvements to our operating model as illustrated by our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales, for which full year 2020 was in line with that of 2019 despite the decline in organic sales.\r\nAs part of the ongoing implementation of our enterprise strategy, which Dave will speak to in greater detail in a moment, we've made the strategic investments needed to allow us to exit the pandemic in a strong position as markets continue to recover.\r\nWe recognized that now more than ever our customers are relying on us to help them maintain the safety and appearance of their facilities, while at the same time reducing their overall cost to clean.\r\nAlso, I cannot overstate how important our strategy has been in channeling those team efforts to ensure the best possible results.\r\nI will walk you through some of our key achievements of the past year in that regard and provide a look at where we are headed.\r\nAs Chris mentioned, our enterprise strategy is based on three pillars in support of our value creation objectives.\r\nOne, winning where we have competitive advantage.\r\nTwo, reducing complexity and building scalable processes.\r\nAnd three, innovating for profitable growth.\r\nIn 2020, the first pillar, winning where we have a competitive advantage, began with a thorough evaluation of all aspects of our business, including products, market geographies, channels and customers in order to identify where we have the strongest competitive advantage.\r\nThe findings of that comprehensive review have led to meaningful changes within Tennant.\r\nFor example, as we announced earlier this month, we completed the sale of our coatings business.\r\nAlthough the business represented approximately 2% of our total sales, it was not central to our core strength in professional, industrial and commercial floor cleaning.\r\nBy divesting it, we can redirect resources toward more strategic and profitable activities.\r\nOur strategy implementation has been truly global, expanding across our operations worldwide.\r\nIn Japan, for example, after a thorough review of our direct sales go-to-market strategy in that market, we have made the decision and begun to shift to a distributor-only model, which offers compelling S&A savings, while delivering a superior customer experience.\r\nOn the product side, we continued to simplify.\r\nAnd in 2020, managed a 35% reduction in our core Tennant legacy product portfolio along with a 20% reduction in product options.\r\nThese changes have far reaching benefits in terms of manufacturing, supply chain and sales efficiency.\r\nFurthermore, after rigorously assessing our product lines, we have created a standard offerings across our legacy Tennant products.\r\nThis helps customers by eliminating guesswork from the buying process.\r\nWhere customers used to have to pick from literally dozens of options and features, they can now rely on Tennant's expertise to identify the solutions and features that best suit their needs.\r\nIn addition to enhancing our sales funnel, this change improves our manufacturing process as well.\r\nWe will continue to provide customized solutions when needed, but we will do so while prioritizing manufacturing efficiency.\r\nThe second pillar of our strategy, reducing complexity and building scalable processes goes to the level of product design and subsystem architecture.\r\n2020 initiatives in this area targeted cost reductions along with customer facing quality and performance improvements.\r\nA great example of this is an industrial tire project review we completed last year.\r\nThrough an engineering redesign effort across our large scrubbers and sweepers, we introduced new tires that reduced our cost, improved traction and performance for our customers and reduced our tire SKUs by over 50%.\r\nAnother example of reducing complexity is the plant optimization work we completed in China last year.\r\nOur acquisition of Gaomei included a number of benefits, including a skilled workforce based in Hefei, China where we have now centralized our China manufacturing.\r\nThese optimization efforts allowed us to close our facility in Qingpu and will enable greater manufacturing flexibility and improved profitability.\r\nAs Chris noted, the implementation of our enterprise strategy is a continuous process, particularly with respect to our third pillar, innovating for profitable growth.\r\nThat means using a process of innovation to unlock value for our customers and for Tennant.\r\nA great example of how we executed against this pillar in 2020 is the advances in our robotic floor cleaning product category.\r\nIn November of last year, we introduced our T380AMR robotic floor scrubber.\r\nIts smaller size enhances maneuverability and navigation in tight areas, leading to maximum productivity and is ideal for customers with narrow spaces or layouts that may have been too challenging for our other robotic machine.\r\nOur customer-centric approach in identifying and solving real world problems

The Americas saw an 11.6% sales decline, EMEA saw a 3.7% increase (3.4% organic decline), and Asia Pacific saw a 10.4% decline (13.9% organic decline). Adjusted gross margin, however, improved to 41.3% from 40.5% due to pricing actions and cost-cutting initiatives. Though adjusted S&A expenses rose to 33.9% due to strategic investments, net earnings fell to $2.5 million from $10.9 million. Adjusted EPS decreased from $0.86 to $0.48. For 2021, Tennant anticipates net sales between $1.05 billion and $1.08 billion, with organic sales growth of 5% to 8%. They also project adjusted EPS of $3.50 to $3.95, an adjusted EBITDA range of $130 million to $140 million, and a 20% effective tax rate.

realized may differ materially based on risk factors included in our SEC filings.\r\naeo-inc.com in the Investor Relations section.\r\nI hope everyone is doing well.\r\nI'm extremely happy with the continued strength across our business.\r\nIt was truly a milestone quarter in which we posted best ever third quarter results and announced an important strategic acquisition.\r\nI'll start with our results, which were simply outstanding.\r\nThis quarter, we delivered record revenue of $1.27 billion, reflecting growth at 24% from 2020, and an increase of 19% to 2019.\r\nHealthy sales and merchandise margins combined with cost efficiencies drove profit flow-through, which surpassed our expectations.\r\nRecord operating income of $210 million, reflecting a margin at 16.5%, our highest rate since 2007.\r\nWe are extremely pleased to see a sustained momentum across our brands and channels, which posted growth versus 2020 at pre-pandemic 2019 levels.\r\nCasualwear remains in high demand, and AE and Aerie are perfectly positioned to benefit.\r\nWe are delivering great product and sharper marketing as well as brand [Phonetic] experiences, both in-store and online that are second to none.\r\nAE brand is achieving exceptional results.\r\nUnder Jen's leadership, the product style and quality has improved remarkably and customers are noticing.\r\nAs back-to-school came rolling back, AE received more than its fair share of growth.\r\nShopping frequency and spend is up dramatically and we are acquiring and reactivating more customers.\r\nAt the same time, we are seeing renewed growth in categories that have been underpenetrated in recent years.\r\nAerie's growth continues at a fast pace, with momentum across all categories, including our new activewear brand OFFLINE by Aerie.\r\nCustomers who try Aerie love it and the brand is just beginning to unlock its true potential.\r\nHealthy acquisition retention are fueling strong sales and we are seeing nice reception as we expand into new markets.\r\nstrategic pillars have provided a roadmap and instilled focus across the company.\r\nSimply put, we are running our business better than ever.\r\nKey initiatives such as inventory and real estate optimization and the transformation of our supply chain are driving significant profit flow-through.\r\nThe processes, disciplines and capabilities we have put in place over the past 18 months will continue to set us apart, fueling strong returns and taking AEO to even greater heights.\r\nAs an organization, innovation is a core value and at the heart of everything we do.\r\nWe clearly recognize that many of the changes in our industry over the past year are here to stay.\r\nIn order to remain competitive today and in the years to come, we must pivot and think differently about our business.\r\nThat brings me to our exciting plan to acquire Quiet Logistics.\r\nThis acquisition marks a major milestone for our company, which I believe will be transformative.\r\nAcquiring Quiet allows us to build on the efficiencies we've gained over the past 12 months and position us for success as we grow our business over the coming years.\r\nWe also have a broader vision.\r\nWe expect the combination of Quiet Logistics and the recent acquisition of AirTerra to create a unique platform that revolutionizes logistics within our business and retail.\r\nThrough consolidation and pooled resources, the customer at Quiet and AirTerra will enjoy the agilities and efficiencies that were previously only available to the world's largest brands and retailers.\r\nI believe this will create an exciting new profit center with meaningful growth opportunities for AEO.\r\nLastly, our efforts around sustainability and building a better world through our ESG initiatives remain front and center at all times.\r\nWe continue to increase our most sustainable real good styles across all merchandise categories.\r\nAdditionally, we are investing to decrease emissions in our operations as we make progress toward becoming carbon-neutral.\r\nAE's outperformance year-to-date was truly remarkable and exceeded our expectations.\r\nThey clearly demonstrated the agility to meet unexpected challenges, while also staying the course toward our long-term goals.\r\nOur results continue to be fueled by a sound and meaningful strategy, resilient operations and focus on innovation and a passionate world-class team.\r\nStrong demand continues and we expect a strong close to 2021.\r\nThis was another amazing quarter for AEO.\r\nWe saw tremendous excitement around Aerie and AE as customers turned to their favorite brands this back-to-school.\r\nCustomer KPIs were very favorable as we brought in new customers and won more of their wallet.\r\nIt was a great set up for the holiday season, where I'm happy to note the energy has stayed just as elevated.\r\nStarting with Aerie, we consistently reach new heights each and every quarter.\r\n28% revenue growth in the third quarter following a 34% increase last year demonstrates Aerie's strong growth path.\r\nThis marked the 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\r\nProfit flow-through was also very healthy with a 16.5% operating margin, reflecting new third quarter highs for the brand.\r\nWe achieved this despite some unevenness of inventory flow during factory shutdowns in South Vietnam.\r\nThis occurred primarily in our high demand legging business, which is also one of our best margin categories.\r\nSales metrics in the third quarter were incredibly healthy.\r\nThe AUR was up in the high teens, driven by higher full price selling and more strategic decision-making around promotions.\r\nDemand was strong across the Aerie portfolio with our core intimates bralettes and apparel leading the charge.\r\nThe OFFLINE activewear brand is continuing to generate excitement as it expands its product offering.\r\nWe feel great about what's to come as we grow the store footprint and widen the customer base.\r\nMarketing is also playing a key role.\r\nIn August, we launched the Voices of AerieREAL.\r\nThis was Aerie's largest integrated marketing campaign featured across TikTok and connected TV and Snapchat.\r\nThis platform is giving our customers a voice and opportunity to share what makes them real.\r\nThe response was truly amazing, hundreds of customers shared their touching and funny real stories and will be featured in our upcoming campaigns.\r\nYear-to-date, Aerie's customer file has expanded 15%.\r\nCustomers are transacting more frequently and across more categories.\r\nThis is driving higher spend per customer as Aerie becomes the go-to for intimates activewear and cozy apparel.\r\nWe opened 29 new Aerie doors in the quarter, including a mix of new stand-alone and side-by-side formats, roughly a quarter of them are OFFLINE doors.\r\nMomentum heading into the holiday season remains strong.\r\nWe are focused on driving broad-based scale recognition of Aerie as a must-stop gifting destination, and I am so excited for what we have planned and I look forward to sharing more Aerie highlights in the upcoming quarters.\r\nNow, turning to American Eagle.\r\nI'm thrilled with the great progress we're making just 11 months into the launch of our new strategy.\r\nAs I shop our website and walk our stores, I have to tell you the strong AE heritage we all know and love is back.\r\nThe assortment has been refreshed, our advertising and messaging is reenergized and it's working.\r\nSales in the quarter rose 21% compared to 2020 and increased 8% to 2019.\r\nReigniting our brand product together with inventory optimization and promotional discipline drove strong AUR growth and merchandise margin expansion.\r\nThis resulted in significant profit flow-through and operating margin of 27.8% that reflected new highs.\r\nOur strength during back-to-school is clear -- is a clear signal that we are

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Matt will then review our fourth-quarter results in some detail, then Rusty will conclude with comments on our outlook for the first half of fiscal 2022.\r\nOn our April investor call, we referenced rising inflation across our P&L at structurally high single digits with some select spikes of 150% to 200%.\r\nSomeone in our call today thought that by now raw material costs and availability would have gotten better to the point of pressure from some customers to give back price.\r\nThat was wrong in April and way wrong today.\r\nRaw material costs have increased to levels on average in the high teens.\r\nMore importantly, certain critical raw material shortages across our industry are negatively impacting our ability to produce and meet market demand.\r\nIn Q4, this raw material availability cost us an estimated $100 million in revenue.\r\nIt's likely to cost us more in Q1 and we anticipate having more raw material availability lost production days in Q1 this year than we had from the impact of COVID shutdowns in Q1 last year.\r\nOur full-year consolidated sales increased 11% to $6.1 billion, our EBIT margin increased by 150 basis points, and adjusted EBIT was up 26.5%.\r\nOperating cash flow climbed nearly 40% to a record $766.2 million, and our adjusted EBIT margin climbed to 12.8%, which was also a record.\r\nOur MAP to Growth program has been the principal driver of this strong financial performance.\r\nThe successful execution of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, especially in light of the incredible disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic and more recently by unprecedented supply chain challenges, is a true testament to the dedication and resilience of the RPM associates worldwide.\r\nAt the program's onset, we recognized that RPM had reached the point where a center-led approach in selected areas of the business was required to take it to the next level of growth.\r\nIn manufacturing, we formed a center-led team that has created a lasting culture of manufacturing excellence and continuous improvement disciplines across the organization.\r\nThis team launched our MS-168 manufacturing system, which is allowing us to produce better products more quickly, more cost-effectively, and more sustainably.\r\nIn addition, we reduced our global manufacturing footprint by 28 facilities, consolidating production to more strategically advantageous plants.\r\nOur original target was 31 plants but consolidation efforts were slowed by the COVID pandemic.\r\nWe expect to exceed the original target in the coming year.\r\nWe also created a center-led procurement team that has consolidated material spending across our operating companies, negotiated improved payment terms with our supplier base, and has helped us reduce working capital.\r\nThese initiatives have created millions of dollars in cost savings.\r\nWith stronger supplier partnerships, longer-term contracts, we are in a much better position to secure necessary raw materials and control costs through the current raw material supply shortages than we would have been just three years ago.\r\nAdditionally, we took significant steps to streamline many of our administrative functions.\r\nThrough our financial realignment, we consolidated 46 accounting locations, improved controls, developed more effective and efficient accounting processes, and reduced costs.\r\nSimilar initiatives were undertaken in our IT infrastructure as we have migrated 75% of our organization to one to four group-level ERP platforms.\r\nAdditionally, we have reduced the number of data centers we manage by shifting systems and hardware to the cloud, and we are creating a number of platforms for centralized data-driven decision making.\r\nOver the course of the three-year MAP to Growth program, we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases.\r\nAside from a significantly improved profit margin profile and stronger cash generation, as reflected in the cumulative total return generated by RPM, which has exceeded our peer group over the three years of the MAP to Growth program, the lasting legacy of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan is the revolutionary change in how people work together at RPM.\r\nOur operating company leadership is managing today with a broader view of RPM as a whole, allowing us to better leverage resources.\r\nAnother permanent change has been the operational disciplines we developed that will continue to generate improvements in profitability, cash flow, and operating efficiency well into the future.\r\nPerhaps more significant has been our ability to maintain our unique entrepreneurial growth-oriented culture, evidenced by the fact that our revenues continue to grow at or above industry averages throughout the MAP to Growth program.\r\nThe real heroes behind the MAP to Growth success were our associates worldwide, particularly our frontline workers who kept our manufacturing and distribution centers operating during the COVID pandemic.\r\nWe also owe a debt of gratitude to my good friend and one of RPM's great operating leaders, Steve Knoop, who is the architect of the MAP to Growth program and passed away prematurely in 2019.\r\nAdditionally, I'd like to recognize Mike Sullivan, vice president of operations and chief restructuring officer; Tim Kinser, vice president of operations procurement; and Gordy Hyde, vice president of operations, manufacturing, who successfully executed the program with an intense focus and strong leadership that were integral to delivering these results and instilling a permanent focus on operating efficiency and continuous improvement into our culture.\r\nWhile we have reached the 2020 MAP to Growth conclusion, there will be some runoff from the MAP to Growth program in fiscal '22, during which we expect to capture approximately $50 million in incremental savings.\r\nWe will also be leveraging the lessons learned from this program to chart a course for 2025.\r\nOver the next six to 12 months, we will be working on a MAP 2.0 program in conjunction with our operating leaders.\r\nWe remain fully committed to achieving our long-term goal of a 16% EBIT margin, and we will be sharing more information about our progress for a new program in the coming quarters.\r\nPlease keep in mind that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis.\r\nFor the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.74 billion, an increase of 19.6%, compared to the $1.46 billion reported in the year-ago period.\r\nSales growth was 13.9% organic, 2.2%, the result of recent acquisitions, and 3.5% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds.\r\nWe are very pleased with this strong top-line growth in light of raw material shortages and supply chain disruptions.\r\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $1.28, compared to $1.13 in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter.\r\nOur adjusted EBIT was $236.2 million, compared to $213.6 million during the year-ago period, which was an increase of 10.6%.\r\nKeep in mind that last year's fourth quarter was impacted by the pandemic's onset, which created the extraordinary situation where our non-operating segment reported a profit due to lower medical expenses, incentive reversals, and other factors.\r\nOn the other hand, during this year's fourth quarter, we experienced higher insurance costs due to business interruptions created by hurricanes and the winter storm Uri as well as higher incentives tied to improve performance.\r\nIf you exclude the impact of our nonoperating segment from both years, our four operating segments combined generated impressive sales growth of 19.6% and adjusted EBIT growth of 27.5% as they overcame margin pressures and supply availability challenges.\r\nTurning now to our segment performance for the quarter.\r\nOur construction products group generated record results.\r\nConstruction, maintenance, and repair activity accelerated in the U.S. during the quarter and even more so in international markets.\r\nConstruction products group net sales wer Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

However, the company faces challenges in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Raw material costs have increased to high teens, resulting in an estimated $100 million revenue loss in Q4 and anticipation of more in Q1. Limited raw material availability is also impacting production, with the consumer group facing particular difficulties due to margin compression and plant shutdowns. Despite these challenges, RPM expects three segments (construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products) to continue their momentum with strong revenue growth in Q1. However, consolidated adjusted EBIT is projected to decrease by 25% to 30% in Q1, with the consumer group experiencing a significant decline.</s>"}

Power, and USAA.\r\nImportantly, the Star's bonus allows us to maintain a strong value proposition for our members and provided value for supplemental benefits that address social determinants of health and other barriers not addressed by fee-for-service Medicare.\r\nLooking ahead to 2022, we are pleased to be able to provide stable or enhanced benefits for the majority of our Medicare Advantage members.\r\nOperating plans that support members whole health needs while continuing to deliver the human care our members have come to expect from us.\r\nOur strong clinical and quality programs drive improved clinical outcomes and cost savings that allow our Medicare Advantage plans to continue to expand member benefits on those covered by fee-for-service Medicare.\r\nOur plans include highly valuable extra benefits including dental, vision, hearing and over-the-counter medication allowance, transportation support, business program memberships and home delivered meals following an inpatient hospital set.\r\nOver the last few years, we've made great progress in addressing social determinants of health and health equity by expanding our Medicare Advantage benefits.\r\nExamples of those impactful areas include respite care distributing 1.5 million meals during COVID, sending fans to seniors with COPD during a heat wave and providing support for financial need impacting a senior's health and well-being.\r\nGiven the increased demand for health equity across America, we have aggressively expanded our efforts to address it.\r\nWe continue to advance our consumer segmentation efforts developing plans that are tailored to the unique needs of specific member populations.\r\nThis has allowed us to provide benefits that enhance and complement an individual's existing coverage through programs like Medicaid or entities such as Veterans Affairs.\r\nThis approach leads to disproportionate growth.\r\nAs you've seen in our D-SNP plans designed for dual eligible members where we have grown our membership approximately 40% in both 2022 and 2021.\r\nWe've expanded our D-SNP offerings for 2022 to cover nearly 65% of the dual eligible population nationally.\r\nTo reduce food and security, 97% of our members enrolled in our D-SNP plans, and we'll have a healthy foods cart, which provides a monthly allowance to purchase approved food and beverages at various national chains.\r\nNew for 2022, many of our D-SNP members will have reduced Part D drug co-pays as a result of the D-SNP prescription drug savings benefit, which will help address the financial barriers some members face when assessing needed prescriptions leading to better medication adherence, an important driver of member's health -- overall health outcomes.\r\nAs previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2022 bids recognizing the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and potential impacts to premium and claims assumption allowing us to prioritize long-term benefit stability for our members.\r\nWhile it is early in the selling season we believe we struck the right balance and are competitively positioned for our continued growth in Medicare Advantage.\r\nOur brand promise to deliver human care resonates with seniors given our comprehensive set of offerings and focus on providing a patient-centric experience based o Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Despite strong underlying fundamentals, the company adjusted its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind of 1% below baseline in Q4. This adjustment is attributed to higher-than-anticipated COVID costs driven by hospitalizations, partially offset by favorable non-COVID utilization.

purchasing options to our customers, we are increasing our focus on subscription bookings and we expect to continue to increase the mix of subscription in these upcoming quarters and years.\r\nIn Q3,

beyond, given the skew that the SentryOne acquisition timing creates.\r\nWe have completed now the successful spin-off of the N-able business in July, and that has enabled us to plan and execute our

support, which now includes Google cloud extensions and added enhanced integration, including with Microsoft teams to our ITSM solutions.\r\nIncreasingly, our application, database, and ITSM offerings will become integral elements of SolarWinds' observability that -- as we create -- as we support customers of all sizes with their IT, Dev, and SecOps requirements.\r\nWe believe that this will help differentiate our offerings from all -- from those of the other vendors.\r\nWe are expanding our global partner engagement with events in various geographies.\r\nThe global partners, including GSIs, cloud service providers, and MSPs, are critical to expanding our GTM reach and to jointly deliver customer success.\r\nDifferentiated offerings with rich enablement, incentives, and a spirit of mutual accountability are the underpinnings of our partner strategy.\r\nIn September, we celebrated the Seventh Annual IT Professionals Day holiday, which was originally established by SolarWinds here in 2015.\r\nIT Pro Day recognizes and celebrates all IT professionals and the contributions they make to their business every day.\r\nAs part of the celebration, we released findings from our IT Pro Day 2021 Survey, Bring It On, which then revealed IT [Inaudible] confidence and [Inaudible] in their roles.\r\nWe were also able to recognize four IT professionals nominated by their peers in our second annual IT Pro Day awards.\r\nWe also believe that IT professionals showed their true grit under challenging conditions this past year and deserve recognition and appreciation for their efforts, commitment, and resiliency.\r\nWe continue to attract excellent talent across all functions of our organization, and we are selectively adding our footprint in international regions, including most recently in South Korea and parts of our EMEA region.\r\nI'll discuss our SolarWinds results on a stand-alone basis.\r\nAs most of you know, our spin of the N-able business happened earlier this quarter and was effective on July 19th.\r\nTherefore, these results are reflected as discontinued operations in our third quarter financial results.\r\nAlso, a quick reminder that the guidance for the third quarter that I provided in August did not include any impact from N-able as the spin had been completed at that time.\r\nOnce again, our public filings will present N-able as discontinued operations in the third quarter as well as in prior periods for a much better comparability.\r\nOur third quarter financial results reflect another quarter of improving execution while demonstrating the resiliency of our model.\r\nThat execution led to another quarter of better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter with total revenue ending at $181.3 million, above the high end of our total revenue outlook of about $176 million to $180 million.\r\nFor the third quarter of 2021, there was no impact of purchase accounting on revenue, so our non-GAAP total revenue is equivalent to our GAAP total revenue.\r\nTotal license and maintenance revenue was $149 million in the third quarter, which is a decrease of 6% from the prior year period.\r\nThe maintenance revenue was $120 million in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the prior year.\r\nOur maintenance revenue has been impacted by a combination of year-over-year declines in license sales for the past eight quarters and a reduction in our renewal rate in 2021.\r\nThe trend of this lower license sales intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 and because of the introduction of subscriptions of our licensed products in Q2 of 2020 as well as the SUNBURST incident in December of 2020 as we focus more for our efforts on longer-term customer success and retention rather than maximizing near-term sales.\r\nAlthough maintenance renewal rates have remained lower than historical levels since SUNBURST, we are encouraged by the fact that they have improved throughout the year.\r\nOur expectation at the start of the year was Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Maintenance revenue remained a challenge, declining 6% year-over-year due to lower license sales and a reduced renewal rate. However, the renewal rate is improving, currently standing at 88%. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year, driven by SentryOne products and on-premise subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA margin reached 42%, despite ongoing investments in Secure by Design initiatives and sales and marketing. The company expects a high single-digit increase in subscription revenue in Q4. For the full year, SolarWinds estimates total revenue between $712 million and $716 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $297 million and $299 million.

results may differ significantly from results expressed or implied in these communications.\r\nIn addition, when -- we may use certain non-GAAP financial measures in this conference call.\r\nThe format of the call will be open remarks and announcement by Jose followed by a financial review from George.\r\nThese discussions will be followed by a Q&A session and we expect the call to last about 60 minutes.\r\nWe had another great quarter and a lot of good things to talk about today.\r\nToday I will be reviewing our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as providing my outlook for 2021 and the markets we serve.\r\nAnd I hope in pray that you and your love ones are healthy and state.\r\nThe safety of our team members has been our top priority.\r\nAnd as I reflect on the unprecedented challenges during 2020, I am incredibly proud of the men and women of MasTec.\r\nOur operations have exhibited tremendous resiliency during the pandemic.\r\nAnd as I look forward to 2021 and beyond, I am extremely excited about various significant growth opportunities as we provide critical power, communications and other infrastructure services to our customers.\r\nI am honored and privileged to lead such a great group.\r\nThe men and women of MasTec are committed to the values of safety, environmental stewardship, integrity, honesty and in providing our customers a great quality project at the best value.\r\nThese traits have been recognized by our customers and it's because of our people's great work that we've been able to deliver these outstanding financial results in the challenging environment and position ourselves for continued growth and success.\r\nNow some fourth quarter highlights.\r\nRevenue was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter.\r\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $262 million, and fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.75.\r\nFor the full year, 2020 revenue was $6.3 billion, 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $810 million, and 2020 full year adjusted earnings per share was $5.11.\r\nAnd finally, cash flow from operations for the year was $937 million a record level.\r\nIn summary, we had an excellent quarter and another great year.\r\nOn our third quarter call in October, we talked about our longer-term goals and our future business mix.\r\nConsidering the impacts of the pandemic on the oil and gas industries, we laid out a path to achieving an annual revenue target of $10 billion with double-digit margins.\r\nOne of our key highlights of 2020 and was our ability to grow non-oil and gas revenues by almost 12% and non-oil and gas adjusted EBITDA by over 40% despite the pandemic.\r\nOur guidance that we provided today reflects continued diversification, as we expect our non-oil and gas business to grow approximately 20% in revenues and approximately 45% in EBITDA in 2021.\r\nWhile we didn't lay out a time line for our $10 billion revenue target in the third quarter, the visibility within our end markets has continued to improve.\r\nIn just a matter of months since our last call, we believe the size and the scale of growth opportunities has significantly expanded.\r\nI believe the recent events in Texas, demonstrates the need for significant investment in both infrastructure and continued power generation diversification.\r\nWe believe MasTec's diversification with capabilities in transmission grid and substation construction, power distribution maintenance, renewable construction including wind, solar, biofuels and battery storage coupled with our capabilities around gas-fired plant construction with its associated infrastructure uniquely positioned MasTec to benefit from continued and renewed investments in the power grid.\r\nThese opportunities coupled with the growing investments in communication networks from both large carriers and smaller rural focused operators provide MasTec with significant growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond.\r\nIn addition to our organic growth opportunities, we are seeing a growing number of potential acquisition targets.\r\nAcquisitions over the years have been a source of significant growth for MasTec.\r\nWhile we've been less active over the last few years, we believe the right companies can help us fully capture our current market opportunities.\r\nSubsequent to year-end in the first quarter, we closed on two acquisitions.\r\nThe first company focuses on integrity work and maintenance work related to gas distribution and the second company is a fully integrated infrastructure contractor specializing in transportation projects.\r\nIncluded in today's 2021 guidance, revenue contribution for these two companies is about $300 million.\r\nIn addition, we remain active and are focused primarily on clean energy, power grid services, telecommunications and infrastructure companies.\r\nNow I'd like to cover some industry specifics.\r\nOur communication revenue for the quarter was $569 million.\r\nEBITDA margins came in better-than-expected at 11.1% and were up 300 basis points year-over-year.\r\nFor the year, revenues were $2.5 billion and margins were 10.7%, a 270 basis point improvement over last year.\r\nFourth quarter and second half of the year communication revenues were impacted by a slowdown of our largest two customers in this segment.\r\nWith the recent 5G spectrum auctions now complete, we expect revenue acceleration throughout 2021.\r\nWhile the first quarter of 2021 will be sequentially similar, we are encouraged by our customers' capital plans discussed this earnings season.\r\nA key highlight for us in 2020 was our ability to diversify our customer base within our Communications segment.\r\nComcast became MasTec's third largest customer in 2020 growing over 100% from 2019 and our T-Mobile business also grew significantly in 2020 with sequential growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 60%.\r\nWe're also very excited with recent developments with rural operators.\r\nThe rural digital opportunity fund or RDOF which is a follow-up to the Connect America Fund will provide $20 billion of funding over the next 10 years to build and connect gigabit broadband speeds in unserved rural areas.\r\nAdditionally in October of 2020, the FCC established the 5G fund for rural America which will provide up to $9 billion in funding over the next decade to bring 5G wireless broadband connectivity to rural America.\r\nWe entered the rural telecom space in 1997 through an acquisition and have been serving this customer base for nearly 25 years.\r\nI believe we are entering one of the most exciting periods in the history of telecommunications and that the deployment of 5G wireless technologies and the associated networks is truly a game changer for the consumer, our customers and for MasTec.\r\nMoving to our Electrical transmission segment, revenue was $126 million versus $116 million in last year's fourth quarter.\r\nMargins decreased year-over-year and were impacted by poor performance on a particular project, which we expect to complete in the first quarter.\r\nWe have now begun one of the larger projects we had previously been awarded and expect a much better margin profile in 2021.\r\nBacklog remained strong and improved both sequentially and year-over-year.\r\nWe are confident that we can deliver strong revenue growth this year.\r\nScale in this segment is important for us, as we strive to achieve double-digit margins.\r\nWe believe we are well positioned for 2021 and beyond as the drivers for this segment remain intact, which include aging infrastructure, reliability, renewable integration and system hardening.\r\nMoving to our oil and gas pipeline segment, revenue was $600 million.\r\nWhile we had nice sequential revenue growth, revenues were negatively impacted by the delayed start of some of our larger projects.\r\nMargins for the quarter were again very strong and positively impacted by the reimbursement of delayed project idle equipment cost.\r\nWithout associated revenue, these reimbursements had a  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Preston, with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions.\r\nGlenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.\r\nI would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees as they work through the many challenges that we've faced during 2020.\r\nThroughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world.\r\nOur fourth quarter organic sales declined to roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections offset by a continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products.\r\nWe are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership technique that we gain in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopaedics market.\r\nPreston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly.\r\nThroughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of a pandemic which combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019.\r\nAnd we delivered impressive cash flow from operations which exceeded $3 billion for the full year.\r\nIn addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities.\r\nWe have established a structure focused on digital, robotics, and enabling technology where we see a significant opportunity to create a companywide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako.\r\nWe maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including neurovascular where we gained new product approvals across aspiration, stent retrievers, and flow-diverting stents, and in our MedSurg segment, where we continued product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention.\r\nFinally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shifts to the outpatient setting.\r\nOur continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides.\r\nTurning to 2021, our people and culture of execution remain strong which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make healthcare better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leverage earnings.\r\nMy comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts, and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and OrthoSensor.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in those regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December.\r\nAs a result, growth was uneven and correlated for the state of the pandemic in each region.\r\nThe areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown.\r\nEven with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China which grew double-digit over prior-year quarter.\r\nLooking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence and they are working to bring back the procedures, but have been delayed.\r\nBut we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue during the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent.\r\nThis slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales.\r\nHowever, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients while maintaining some level of elective surgeries.\r\nIn addition, the early trends on the launch of our new ProCuity bed are positive and expected to continue into 2021.\r\nDuring the year, our Mako install base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter.\r\nThis growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology, as well as our ongoing success selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs, and competitive accounts.\r\nWe are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia, and Brazil which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies.\r\nTurning to U.S. knee procedures.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees will make their knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase.\r\nThe shift toward cementless knees also continued and in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures.\r\nDuring the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products in businesses like joint replacement as surgeons worked to performing procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals.\r\nHowever, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021.\r\nWe are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gain in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics, and enabling technology.\r\nThe combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across to more than $3 billion extremities market.\r\nThe integration has been progressing well over the last few months.\r\nThe long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience.\r\nTo date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for trauma, upper extremities, and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer.\r\nThe U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these three specialized business units has been announced and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned.\r\nOutside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year.\r\nOur teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business, and during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing in integration activities.\r\nFinally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of OrthoSensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement.\r\nSmart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopaedics and the addition of OrthoSensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology, including intraoperative sensors, wearables, and ultimately, smart implant.\r\nAs a release to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full-year guidance for sale, operating margin, and EPS.\r\nUpdates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year.\r\nToday, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers.\r\nOur organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter.\r\nAs a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019.\r\nPricing in the q Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

same details as they have historically, and as I have said, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\r\nWith these formalities out of the way, I'm joined today by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer.\r\nI was just checking to make sure I was on -- off mute for a change.\r\nLet me start with a couple of words on COVID, even though I'm sure all of you, like I, are so sick of the topic and the issue.\r\nFor those of us in the U.S., I think we can sense at least the beginning of a change in mood.\r\nAt least for me, it's wonderful to see the rollout of vaccines, and no -- I don't know anybody who doesn't get incredibly excited when we see our friends or our family was getting vaccinated.\r\nI think on the other hand, I think most of us know, the story is not as true every place around the world.\r\nWhen I talk to colleagues on the continent of Europe, story feels somewhat aligned, but also somewhat different.\r\nThere's a lot of frustration about the slowness of the rollout of the vaccine, and it feels very different.\r\nIt felt very different last week when I talked with colleagues in Latin America and some colleagues in India.\r\nIf we look at the statistics, I think we see that global cases globally, total cases right now are actually at the highest levels we have ever seen -- the world has ever seen.\r\nAnd of course, the rollout of the vaccine, though happening around the world, is happening at very different paces depending on where you sit.\r\nSo the good news, I think, is that we can all, at this point, see a light you can see that light at the end of the tunnel.\r\nAnd I'm so excited for those of us for whom that light feels close.\r\nI just want to also share -- say, mine and my colleagues, hearts and thoughts are also with all of those folks, within our firm and within yours for whom the light still feels further away.\r\nLet me turn to a brighter subject, which is our quarter, our results.\r\nIt had some positive surprises in it and had some items that one can't count on recurring, which Ajay will talk about.\r\nBut even normalized for those, it was a terrific quarter.\r\nI doubt very many people, 10 years ago or even a few years ago, would have thought that in a period where restructuring as an industry is down substantially, and our restructuring business is well off the peak that we saw last year that we would produce a halfway decent quarter but along a quarter like this.\r\nBut the quarter was spectacular.\r\nLet me, however, say, something that we discussed many times, quarters are fickle.\r\nMarkets can fluctuate up and down.\r\nBig jobs can come and go.\r\nCases can settle in continuously investments to drive future growth, although critical for the future can negatively impact quarters in the short term.\r\nQuarters to me, as excited as you can be about a quarter are, in fact, never good measures of performance for this company, good quarter or bad quarters.\r\nTo me what is much more powerful than this quarter or any quarterly results is the strength of the longer-term trajectory that we have been on and that I believe we are on as well as the reasons for that grade trajectory.\r\nCompared to 10 years ago -- forget the quarter.\r\nCollectively, we have managed to build a business that is much more powerful, much more global, much more diverse than it ever has been.\r\nAnd that's true for the company as a whole, but even within each segment.\r\nToday, for example, our business, it's more powerful in restructuring than it ever has been, is also much broader, much more powerful, much breadth of experience and capabilities to serve our clients on a broader range of challenges and opportunities than ever.\r\nYes, it's powerful in restructuring but also in transactions, in the office of the CFO and so many other services, and you can say the same for all of our business segments.\r\nThe way we've gotten here is the basis for that, the terrific teams, reinvesting in our core, reinvesting behind our good businesses but also looking where our clients have needs and broadening our business, both our offerings and our geographical footprint.\r\nThose actions and our collective commitment, the best behind great positions and great people, to me, have changed the fundamental trajectory and resilience for this company.\r\nTo me, we have shown over the past several years that if we do the right thing, if we do the right thing, if we commit to our -- position our business in a right way, if I support great people for long-term sustainable growth, though we can still have bad quarters, for any extended period of time, we control our destiny.\r\nWe control our destiny in a way that allows us to serve ever more our clients' most important needs across a wider range of circumstances, not just in things like restructuring but in antitrust, in major M&A and cybersecurity and SPACs and public affairs, in global cross-border investigations and it could go on.\r\nAnd that to me, that growth and capabilities of our people, that ability to extend our firm to innovate is far more exciting and a much more durable basis for excitement and success than any, any given quarter's results.\r\nSo I'm not going to talk any more about the quarter, Ajay will.\r\nIt's been so frustrating to see that the light is there at the end of the tunnel, but see how slow it's been approaching in some places.\r\nThe emotional fortitude that our people have shown during this period that keep our company moving, to keep connected with each other, to remain supportive to each other, dedicated to our clients has been wonderful to see as the CEO but actually equally as much as just a human being.\r\nI'm delighted to report year-over-year double-digit revenue growth this quarter.\r\nOn our last earnings call in February, we said that strong M&A activity would favorably impact our economic consulting, technology and strategic communications segments as well as our transactions business within our corporate finance and restructuring segment.\r\nConversely, we had also expected weakness in demand for our restructuring services.\r\nBoth trends occurred and were deeper than we anticipated.\r\nAnd in Forensic and Litigation Consulting, or FLC, the segment which was most impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, we expected continued gradual improvement.\r\nInstead in the quarter, results rebounded faster than we anticipated as we were able to resume work on many matters where trials were rescheduled or resumed, particularly in North America.\r\nObviously, we are very pleased with these results.\r\nFirst quarter of 2021 revenues of $686.3 million were up $81.7 million or 13.5%.\r\nGAAP earnings per share of $1.84, compared to $1.49 in the prior year quarter.\r\nGAAP earnings per share included $2.3 million of noncash interest expense related to our convertible notes, which decreased earnings per share by $0.05.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.89, which excludes the noncash interest expense, compared to $1.53 in the prior year quarter.\r\nNet income of $64.5 million, compared to $56.7 million in the prior year quarter.\r\nThis increase was due to higher operating profits in our economic consulting, FLC, and technology segments, which was partially offset by lower operating profits in corporate finance and restructuring.\r\nSG&A of $126.5 million was 18.4% of revenues and compares to SG&A of $127 million or 21% of revenues in the first quarter of 2020.\r\nSG&A was flat year over

Billable headcount grew by 12.3%, with a 34.9% increase in corporate finance and restructuring, and sequentially increased by 1.5%. While the strong performance in Q1 provides a positive start, the company cautions that such exceptional strength may not persist throughout the year due to factors such as fixed costs, the conclusion of large engagements, and ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19. Nevertheless, the company remains confident in its ability to meet its guidance and attributes its success to a diverse portfolio of businesses, a strong team, a focus on staff utilization, and a sound balance sheet.</s>"}

$2.23 billion were up 37% compared to the prior year period.\r\nAdjusted gross margin of 25.6% was up 170 basis points compared to last year.\r\nBoth our pre-tax income of $303.4 million and our earnings per share of $1.87 more than doubled compared to last year.\r\nWe signed 3,154 net contracts for approximately $2.98 billion, up 11% in units and 35% in dollars compared to the prior year period.\r\nThese were third quarter records in both units and dollars.\r\nIn addition, our contracts per community at 10.2 were 20% above last year and our highest third quarter ever.\r\nOur average selling price in the quarter was approximately $945,000, up $70,000 compared to the second quarter and up $163,000 year-over-year.\r\nThis increase in ASP shows the pricing power of our luxury business.\r\nThis strong demand has continued into our fourth quarter.\r\nWe've averaged over 300 non-binding deposits per week in the first three weeks of August, a pace that is consistent with May through July.\r\nNot surprisingly, our deposits were down 15% compared to the same three weeks last August when demand surged following the lifting of COVID lockdowns.\r\nHowever, compared to the same three weeks of August 2019, deposits were up 29%.\r\nIn some markets, demand still far outpaces supply, and we are limiting lot releases.\r\nIn other markets, we are seeing demand return to seasonal patterns.\r\nI want to remind you that in summer and fall of 2020, we, along with the rest of the industry, experienced a historic surge in demand and sales.\r\nFrom August 1 to September 15, 2020, the first half of our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, net signed contracts were up 110% in units, and for the full quarter, they were up 68%.\r\nWe knew these growth rates would be unsustainable, and as a result, we expect our fourth quarter contracts to be down compared to last year.\r\nWhile year-over-year order declines may make headlines, they don't reflect the current state of this housing market, which remains very strong.\r\nIn the near term, our biggest challenge is managing industrywide supply and labor constraints that are extending delivery times.\r\nIn our third quarter, cycle times grew by about two weeks, pushing some anticipated third quarter deliveries into our fourth quarter.\r\nThis same pressure will apply to our fourth quarter.\r\nDuring the third quarter and into the start of our fourth quarter, we raised prices in most of our communities.\r\nJust this past Monday, we rolled out another nationwide price increase.\r\nThese increases have more than offset cost pressures we've experienced this year.\r\nIn light of the pricing embedded in our backlog and our focus on managing costs, we are confident that our gross margin in fiscal 2022 will significantly exceed the 25.6% margin we project for fiscal 2021's fourth quarter.\r\nIt is important to note that our customers are generally better positioned to absorb price increases due to their higher incomes, investment portfolios and the benefit of increased values in their existing homes.\r\nIn terms of demand across our markets, strength in the quarter was broad based across both geography and product type, with especially strong demand in our affordable luxury and active adult communities.\r\nWith our strategic expansion in the Sunbelt and Mountain states, we continue to benefit from migration out of higher-cost markets into more affordable markets, lessening the impact of affordability as prices have risen.\r\nOur backlog at quarter-end was a record in both units and dollars.\r\nBacklog was $9.4 billion on 10,661 units, up 55% in dollars and 40% in units compared to last year.\r\nAs we noted last quarter, we expect meaningful growth in revenue, gross margins, earnings and ROE in fiscal year 2022.\r\nWe reaffirm these expectations, including a return on beginning equity for fiscal 2022, well above 20%.\r\nThese expectations are driven not just by the strength of the housing market and our backlog, but also by the structural and permanent changes we have made to many aspects of our business, especially to how we acquire and develop land in a more capital-efficient manner.\r\nWe remain bullish on the long-term prospects for the housing market, which is supported by many factors, including the significant imbalance between the supply and demand of homes.\r\nOn the supply side, this imbalance is the result of a decade of underproduction of new homes.\r\nOn the demand side, millennials, who make up the largest generation of Americans, are forming families and entering their prime homebuying years.\r\nWe have also seen baby boomers and other active adults reenter the market.\r\nMany older workers are accelerating their plans, moving now and working virtually in places they might have planned to move to a few years later.\r\nInterest rates remain low, the resale market is tight, Americans have a much greater appreciation of home and the overall economy is improving.\r\nWe believe that all these factors will continue to contribute to strong and sustained demand for new homes in the years to come.\r\nAnd we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities this market presents.\r\nAt quarter-end, we owned or optioned approximately 79,500 lots.\r\nOur option lots represented 53% of our total lots controlled at third quarter end compared to 49% one quarter earlier and 43% one year ago.\r\nWe have already made significant progress in moving toward the 60% optioned and 40% owned goal we set last quarter.\r\nThis shift to more optioned land is a key part of our capital efficiency initiatives.\r\nThis land position provides the foundation for growth over the next several years, and we are currently benefiting from the significant percentage of our land that we acquired at lower pre-pandemic prices.\r\nAt quarter-end, we were selling from 314 active communities.\r\nWe continue to project growth to 340 communities at fiscal year-end and an additional 10% community count growth in fiscal 2022.\r\nThis guidance is based solely on land we already control today.\r\nWe also have the land under control today for meaningful further community count growth in fiscal year 2023.\r\nOur strategic expansion into new markets, new product lines, new price points and especially the affordable luxury niche has positioned us well for growth and is contributing to improvements in both our gross margin and our ROE.\r\nIn fact, our affordable luxury homes are generating gross margins that are comparable to our luxury homes.\r\nAffordable luxury comprised 44% of deliveries in the quarter ended July 31, up from 40% last year.\r\nFirst-time homebuyers who are the primary buyers in our affordable luxury segment accounted for 29% of our deliveries this quarter compared to 27% one year ago.\r\nOur affordable luxury product enables us to move into new markets and expand our presence in markets where we are already established.\r\nThese homes appeal to many millennials who are making their first home purchase and can be built up more quickly and efficiently and on less expensive land.\r\nJust last week we announced the acquisition of StoryBook Homes in Las Vegas.\r\nWith about 550 owned and controlled lots, this acquisition allows us to quickly expand our affordable luxury offerings in the Las Vegas market.\r\nStoryBook is a remarkably efficient builder, and we look forward to sharing lessons learned from its operations throughout the rest of our organization.\r\nWe continue to focus on additional ways to improve capital efficiency to bolster ROE.\r\nYesterday, we announced a new strategic partnership with Equity Residential, a world-class S&P 500 company focused on luxury apartment rentals to jointly acquire and develop sites into new rental apartment communities in key US markets  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The year is off to a good start.\r\nIn the first quarter, we generated earnings of $2.43 per share, a 59% increase over the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong credit quality.\r\nOur ROE grew to over 18% and our ROA was 1.68%.\r\nI am pleased to report that we are hearing more optimism among our customers and colleagues across our markets.\r\nStimulus payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits, along with PPP loans to small- and medium-sized businesses have provided much needed relief to those that are struggling.\r\nAlso, the Infrastructure Bill that is being considered is expected to spread spending over many years.\r\nThis fiscal stimulus and the ramp up in the vaccine distribution, in combination with ample liquidity and low borrowing costs, has the potential to spur substantial activity.\r\nThe economic metrics are improving quickly and the outlook for the back half of the year is for strong economic growth.\r\nAs the economy continues to reopen and pre-pandemic conditions return, many businesses are beginning to experience accelerating activity.\r\nI remain very proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and each other.\r\nWe've again stepped up our efforts to support those affected by the pandemic.\r\nLast month, Comerica and the Comerica Charitable Foundation pledged approximately $16 million to support small businesses and communities impacted by COVID.\r\nThis support is in addition to the $11 million committed in 2020.\r\nAs you know, last year, we funded $3.9 billion in the first round of PPP loans.\r\nAlso, so far this year, through the hard work of colleagues across the Bank, we further assisted businesses by funding close to $1 billion in the second round of PPP.\r\nIn addition, in the first quarter, we processed over $600 million in PPP loan repayments, mainly through forgiveness.\r\nTurning to our first quarter financial performance on Slide 4.\r\nCompared to the fourth quarter, average loans decreased with seasonally lower home purchase volumes impacting our Mortgage Banker business.\r\nAlso, total line utilization across nearly all businesses have remained low.\r\nHowever, our loan pipeline has continued to grow.\r\nAverage deposits increased over $1 billion to another all-time high as customers received additional stimulus payments.\r\nNet interest income was impacted by $17 million in lease residual adjustments in an expiring legacy portfolio.\r\nExcluding this impact, pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased 5% despite the shorter quarter and the decline in loan volume.\r\nThis increase in PPNR was due to continued robust fee generating activity in our expense discipline.\r\nAs far as credit, our conservative culture, diverse portfolio, as well as deep expertise has served us well.\r\nStrong credit performance and an improvement in our economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of $182 million.\r\nThe credit reserve remains healthy at 1.59%.\r\nNet charge-offs were only 3 basis points.\r\nThrough the cycles, our net charge-offs have typically been at or below our peer group average, including during the past year as we navigated the pandemic.\r\nWith more confidence in the economic recovery and an estimated CET1 ratio of 11.09%, we plan to restart share repurchases.\r\nIn the second quarter, we expect to make significant strides toward our 10% target, giving careful consideration to earnings generation, as well as capital needs to fund future loan growth.\r\nOur ongoing goal is to provide an attractive return to our shareholders, which includes a dividend that currently has a yield of about 4%.\r\nTurning to Slide 5, average loans decreased approximately $800 million.\r\nAs Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was Mortgage Banker, which declined from its record high in the fourth quarter due to lower purchase volumes.\r\nEnergy decreased as higher oil prices are resulting in improved cash flow and capital markets activity.\r\nWe had expected National Dealer loans would begin to rebound in the first quarter.\r\nHowever, supply chain issues, most notably with computer chips have STIMI [Phonetic] production.\r\nIn addition, March auto sales were the second highest of all-time for that month, further depleting inventory.\r\nDealer loans were $1.5 billion below the first quarter of 2020.\r\nWe remain confident in the floor plan balances will eventually rebuild to historical levels.\r\nEquity Fund Services was a bright spot, increasing over $200 million with strong fund formation.\r\nTotal period end loans reflected decreases of $900 million in Dealer and $700 million in Mortgage Banker.\r\nLine utilization for the total portfolio declined to 47%.\r\nWe feel good about the pipeline, which now sits above pre-pandemic levels.\r\nIt increased to nearly every business line and loans in the last stage of the pipeline nearly doubled over the fourth quarter.\r\nUltimately, we would expect this to translate into loan growth.\r\nAs far as loan yields, there were $17 million in lease residual value adjustments, mostly on aircraft and an expiring legacy portfolio.\r\nWe have not done business in this segment for many years and no further adjustments are expected.\r\nExcluding the 14 basis point impact from the residual adjustment, loan yields increased 3 basis points with the benefit of accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness.\r\nContinued pricing actions, particularly adding rate floors when possible as loans renew, offset the decline in LIBOR.\r\nAverage deposits increased 2% or $1.1 billion to a new record as shown on Slide 6.\r\nConsumer deposits increased nearly $1 billion, primarily due to seasonality and the additional stimulus received in January.\r\nCustomers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances.\r\nWith strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 69%.\r\nThe average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 8 basis points, a decrease of 3 basis points from the fourth quarter and our total funding cost fell to only 9 basis points.\r\nSlide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio.\r\nPeriod end balances are up modestly as we recently began to gradually deploy some of our excess liquidity by opportunistically increasing the size of the portfolio.\r\nLower rates on the replacement of about $1 billion in payments received during the quarter resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.89%.\r\nYields on repayments averaged approximately 235 basis points, while recent reinvestments have been in the low-180s.\r\nWe expect to mostly offset the yield pressure on MBS in the near term with a modestly larger portfolio.\r\nHowever, maturing treasuries will likely be a slight headwind in the back half of the year, depending on the mix of MBS and treasuries we would likely replace them with, as well as market conditions.\r\nTurning to Slide 8, excluding the impact of the lease residual adjustment and two fewer days in the quarter, net interest income was roughly stable and the net interest margin would have increased 2 basis points.\r\nAs far as the details, interest income on loans decreased $28 million and reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points.\r\nThis was primarily due to the $17 million of lease residual adjustments, which had a 9 basis point impact on the margin, as well as two fewer days in the quarter, which had a $7 million impact.\r\nLower loan balances had a $5 million impact and were partially offset by a $3 million increase in fees related to PPP loans.\r\nOther portfolio dynamics had a $2 million unfavorable impact and included lower LIBOR, partially offset by pricing actions.\r\nLower securities yields, as I outlined in the previous slide, had a $2 million or 1 basis point negative impact.\r\nContinued prudent management of deposit pricing added $3 million and 1 basis point to the margin and a reduction in wholesale funding added $1 million and 1 basis point.\r\nAverage balances of the Fed were relatively steady and remain extraordinarily high at $12.5 billion.\r\nThis continues to weigh heavily on the margin with the gr Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Avner will review our financial performance and provide an outlook for the balance of 2021 with closing remarks from Steve.\r\nThis will be followed by Q&A.\r\nA replay of today's call will be available for the next seven days.\r\nIt will also be read in full at the end of today's call.\r\nToday, I would like to begin by sharing some opening comments and then provide a brief overview of the quarter.\r\nBefore I do that, I want to take a moment to recognize the contributions of Walter Scott, Jr., who served on our Board for more than 40 years and passed away late last month.\r\nWalter was an incredible individual whose wisdom and leadership were critical to Valmont's success over the years.\r\nHis loss is felt deeply by those who knew him and the entire Omaha community.\r\nWalter's counsel, kindness and mentorship will truly be missed by all of us at Valmont.\r\nMoving on to the business.\r\nOur strong performance this quarter, once again, demonstrated the solid demand across our businesses and the consistent execution of our growth strategies, even amid a challenging global environment.\r\nLike most others, we have safety impacts of broad-based inflation, the COVID-19 Delta variant, and labor and supply chain disruptions.\r\nGovernment mandated lockdowns in Australia and workforce quarantines in North America, including Mexico and the Southeast United States, impacted certain utility and coatings facilities.\r\nSupply chain disruptions affect the timing of some shipments in our Irrigation and Solar businesses.\r\nDespite this, we delivered a strong quarter of growth and profitability.\r\nOur commercial and operations teams are managing exceptionally well through these unique dynamics of focus and perseverance, while continuing to prioritize employee safety and serve our customers.\r\nI'm extremely proud of our team's execution throughout this year.\r\nRecord third quarter sales of $868.8 million increased more than 18% compared to last year.\r\nSales growth was realized in all segments led by higher pricing and strong broad-based market demand with particularly substantial sales growth in Irrigation.\r\nMoving to the segments and starting with Utility.\r\nSales of $276.5 million grew slightly compared to last year.\r\nA significantly higher pricing and higher volumes were mostly offset by renewable energy projects that did not repeat or that were pushed into future quarters due to customers' supply chain disruptions.\r\nNorth American utilities have been increasing their planned investments in transmission and distribution projects, even exceeding recent years of higher capital spending.\r\nFurther, proposed capacity additions in the renewable energy sector are favorable demand drivers across our Utility business.\r\nWe see strong demand continuing, as both utilities and developers have been increasing their forecast of additional projects over the next several years to comply with mandates to increase renewable energy generation.\r\nMoving to Engineered Support Structures.\r\nSales of $281.1 million increased 10% year-over-year, led by favorable pricing in all markets and sales growth of more than 25% in wireless communication products and components.\r\nPricing improvements across all product lines continued this quarter, and international markets are benefiting from higher stimulus and infrastructure investments, especially in Australia.\r\n5G build-outs and significant investments by the major carriers are driving demand in our wireless communications business, providing a good line of sight into 2022.\r\nSales of $96.7 million grew 10% year-over-year, driven by higher pricing, improved general end market demand and sales from our greenfield facility in Pittsburgh.\r\nGlobal sales of $240.3 million grew more than 72% year-over-year, with sales growth in all regions and higher sales of technology solutions.\r\nIn North America, sales grew nearly 55%, as strong market fundamentals and improved net farm income projections continue to positively impact farmer sentiment, generating very strong order flow.\r\nInternational sales doubled year-over-year, led by solid demand in the Middle East and Africa, including the ongoing deliveries of the Egypt project and another record quarter of sales in Brazil.\r\nLast quarter, we highlighted our acquisition of Prospera Technologies.\r\nIntegration is going well, and we are making substantial progress building on our new strategy to grow recurring revenue services.\r\nWe are on track to meet the financial targets that we shared last quarter and look forward to sharing progress toward these goals in the future.\r\nIn Irrigation, we have a unique market advantage due to our global footprint and highly differentiated AI solutions, both are critical components of our growth strategy.\r\nOver the past year, we have been increasing opportunities for local manufacturing in the markets we serve, especially in light of the challenging supply chain environment, labor availability and higher freight costs.\r\nFor example, we recently localized some of our electronics assembly in Dubai facility and are increasing the total capacity in our Brazil factory by 50%, positioning us for long-term international market growth, while we continue enhancing service to our dealers and customers.\r\nWe are also very pleased that our Irrigation backlog at the end of the third quarter was $388 million, up 26% year-over-year.\r\nTurning to slide five we've said before, ESG is embedded into the core of our company's purpose, and there are many ways of products and services to serve resources and improve life.\r\nOne recent example of this is using Solar solutions to transform the Sudan desert into a prosperous and sustainable region for agricultural production.\r\nSudan is the third largest country in the African continent.\r\nAgriculture is quickly becoming its primary economic driver, accounting for 40% of the nation's GDP and employing close to 80% of the local workforce.\r\nBut arid conditions and a lack of direct access to electricity in the region are hindering its expansion.\r\nTo help overcome these challenges, our Valmont Solar team recently installed a PV plant to bring power to center pivots.\r\nSunlight is captured and transformed immediately into electricity, eliminating the need for a battery or secondary energy source.\r\nWe're proud to have initiated this project powering pivots by solar energy, 100% independent from the grid.\r\nOur innovative solutions are leading the way, precision agriculture in Sudan, opening doors to other solutions that will enhance productivity, empower local communities to solve food security issues, and help build a more sustainable world.\r\nTurning to slide seven, and third quarter results.\r\nOperating income of $80.4 million or 9.3% of sales grew 20% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes in Irrigation and favorable pricing, notably in Engineered Support Structures.\r\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.57 grew 30% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher operating income and a more favorable tax rate of 23.5%, which was realized through the execution of certain tax planning strategies.\r\nTurning to the segments.\r\nOn slide eight, in Utility Support Structures, operating income of $24.6 million or 8.9% of sales decreased 170 basis points compared to last year.\r\nRaw material costs continued to increase during the quarter, impacting our ability to fully recover cost to our pricing mechanism, leading to lower-than-expected margin.\r\nAlso the impact of workforce quarantine in a few North American facilities led to operational inefficiencies, which we do not expect to repeat.\r\nMoving to slide nine.\r\nIn Engineered Support Structures, operating income increased to $34.4 million or 12.2% of sales, a third quarter record.\r\nThe benefits of proactive pricing actions have more than offset the impact of continued rapid cost inflation, better fixed cost leverage, including SG&A, also contributed to positive results.\r\nTurning to slide 10.\r\nIn the Coatings segment, operating income of $12.5 million or 1 Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\r\nDuring the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations or FFO, core FFO, same-center net operating income, adjusted EBITDA and net debt.\r\nAs such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, November 2, 2021.\r\nAt this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.\r\nWe request that everyone ask only one question and one follow-up to allow as many of you as possible to ask questions.\r\nIf time permits, we are happy for you to requeue for additional questions.\r\nOn the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nWe had a great quarter as a result of improvements in occupancy, rent spreads and sales.\r\nThese all contributed to earnings, which exceeded our expectations, and an increase in our guidance for the remainder of the year.\r\nOur proactive capital market success has also positioned us well with low leverage, ample liquidity and exciting potential growth opportunities.\r\nI'm proud of the tireless efforts of the entire Tanger team who are successfully delivering our strategic objectives.\r\nWe delivered strong performance in the third quarter and the continued momentum we are demonstrating across our portfolio supports our decision to increase our guidance for the year.\r\nThe successful execution of our strategic plan is evident across all of our key metrics, including occupancy, rent spreads, tenant sales and our focus on driving non-rental revenues, all of which continue to contribute to core FFO growth.\r\nOur portfolio occupancy has returned to pre-pandemic levels, despite having recaptured over 1 million square feet due to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings since the beginning of 2020.\r\nThis includes 55,000 square feet recaptured in the third quarter as anticipated.\r\nAs of September 30, occupancy was 94.3%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 130 basis points since the end of the second quarter.\r\nWith regard to rent spreads, we continue to see positive momentum for leases that commenced in the 12 months ended September 30.\r\nBlended average rates improved by 240 basis points on a cash basis compared to the 12 months ended June 30.\r\nSpreads have improved each quarter this year and we believe that the continued improvement we are seeing in traffic and sales will help sustain this trend.\r\nWe also benefited from significant percentage rental growth this quarter, which was more than 2.5 times the comparable 2019 period.\r\nDuring the height of the pandemic, we renegotiated select leases with an aim to trade value for value, in some cases, trading base rent for a larger variable rent component.\r\nIn many cases, reducing break points and increasing variable rent pay rates are now producing total rents that exceed the prior contractual fixed rents.\r\nOur rent spreads don't capture percentage rent contributions as spreads measure the change in base rent and common area charges only, but the strong variable rent component has contributed to our core FFO growth.\r\nAdditionally, as we continue to negotiate renewals on these leases, we are focused on converting some of the variable upside into base rents, which provide longer term certainty.\r\nIn light of the improving trends, we are being strategic in our renewal and permanent leasing activity.\r\nRenewals executed or in process represented 68% of the space scheduled to expire during the year compared to 72% at this time last year.\r\nTraffic for the quarter was approximately 99% of the same period in 2019.\r\nWe saw a slight downturn in August, in part, due to concerns over the Delta variant and the timing of Labor Day, but September traffic returned to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nTenant sales accelerated in the quarter, reaching an all-time high of $448 per square foot for the consolidated portfolio for the 12 months ended September 30, representing an increase of more than 13% over the comparable 2019 period.\r\nThe key objective underlying our leasing strategy is to maximize NOI.\r\nWhile shorter-term leasing will continue to be a strategy, our goal is to convert this space to permanent deals over time as conditions improve, retaining the current tenant with higher rent or repopulating the space.\r\nWe also continue to focus on growing our non-apparel and footwear tenant base and have added multiple new brands and categories to our portfolio this quarter.\r\nKey categories include furniture and home goods and wellness and beauty.\r\nWe have also focused on growing our food offerings, adding numerous sit-down, quick serve and grab-and-go concepts across our portfolio and we are growing the presence of entertainment stores, kiosks and amenities aimed to driving shopper visits, frequency, dwell time and ultimately larger spend.\r\nThese new uses are presenting both on-center and in our outparcel and peripheral real estate.\r\nWe are seeing traction with non-rental revenues.\r\nThis is an area with growth opportunity as it is still in the early stages as a focus for Tanger.\r\nMarketing partnerships in the form of sponsored onsite events, activations and advertising provide an opportunity for retailers to interact and communicate with the tens of millions of customers that shop at our centers annually.\r\nAnd our Labor Day Block Party activations, for example, was sponsored by international brands such as Unilever, Tesla and Heineken, and we are planning similar events in the fourth quarter around holiday themes and tree lightings.\r\nEvents like these not only improve traffic and dwell time, but also generate revenue.\r\nThis revenue is captured in

Tenant sales reached a new high of $448 per square foot, an increase of 13% over the same period in 2019. The company's focus on non-apparel and footwear tenant diversification and non-rental revenue growth is paying off, with categories like furniture, home goods, wellness, and beauty adding to the portfolio. Marketing partnerships and onsite events have doubled revenue from 2020 and increased by 38% compared to 2019. Core FFO per share for the quarter was $0.47, excluding a charge for debt extinguishment, and the company raised its guidance for the year to a range of $1.67 to $1.71 per share, reflecting improved variable rents and a potential for additional bankruptcies or brandwide restructurings.</s>"}

follow-up.\r\nWe describe these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nOur statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics.\r\nI'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times.\r\nIn the third quarter, sales increased to 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth.\r\nThis was against a strong 16% comp from last year.\r\nThis growth came as we continue to face significant supply chain challenges.\r\nCertain raw materials were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets.\r\nFreight congestion in ports and lack of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages, continue to be a challenge.\r\nThey have kept our plants running, and our customers supplied, resulting an outstanding top line performance.\r\nOperating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products.\r\nMoving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing.\r\nSales increased 15% excluding currency, led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business.\r\nThese results highlight the strength of our plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels.\r\nTo support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia.\r\nThis additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen Hansgrohe's capabilities to serve its customers.\r\nWe plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project over the next three years.\r\nAnd our Decorative Architectural segment sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter of 2020.\r\nPropane had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in DIY paint.\r\nDIY paint declined mid single-digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of 2020.\r\nWe continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent throughout the quarter.\r\nWhen compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals.\r\nLastly, Behr Paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department.\r\nThis recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot on stock during the DIY surge last year.\r\nOur continued investment in our joint effort to grow the PRO paint category, and our commitment to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched Behr Dynasty to The Home Depot, each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr Paint and the Home Depot.\r\nAnd this recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership.\r\nMoving on to capital allocation.\r\nWe continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million.\r\nIn addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year.\r\nNow let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation.\r\nThe second half of 2021 is largely unfolding as anticipated.\r\nWe experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter and we expect mid teens inflation in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe have taken pricing actions across both segments, and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end.\r\nIt has been an extremely dynamic year and our supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges.\r\nBecause of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full-year earnings per share in the range of $3.67 to $3.73.\r\nThis report demonstrates our commitment to environmental, social and governance responsibility.\r\nDuring a year of unparalleled change, our team members remained committed to maintaining our strong reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I efforts.\r\nI'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense of inclusion, belonging and support.\r\nOur progress in ESG is a priority for our Board and our executive leadership team.\r\nI hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community.\r\nAs Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.\r\nTurning to slide seven.\r\nDemand for our industry-leading brands remains strong and our teams executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment.\r\nThis resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top line growth.\r\nSales increased to 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year.\r\nNet acquisitions contributed 2% growth and currency had a minimal impact.\r\nIn local currency, North American sales increased 9% or 6% excluding acquisitions.\r\nThe strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in propane, faucets, showers and spas, and by increased selling prices.\r\nIn local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18% excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the healthy 9% comp.\r\nGross margin of 34.2% is impacted by higher commodity and logistics cost in the quarter.\r\nWe expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives.\r\nWe expect the exit this year price cost neutral.\r\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%.\r\nAs planned during the quarter, we increased certain expenses such as headcount, advertising and marketing to a more normalized level to support our brands.\r\nWe expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter and these costs continue to normalize.\r\nOperating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%, our earnings per share was $0.99.\r\nTurning to slide eight.\r\nPlumbing growth continued to be strong with sales up 16% against the 13% comp in the third quarter of last year.\r\nNet acquisitions contributed 2% to its growth and currency contributed another 1%.\r\nNorth American sales increased 16% or 10%, excluding acquisitions.\r\nDelta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength in e-commerce and trade channels.\r\nWith strong brand recognition and channel relationships, Delta continues to drive consumer demand for its products.\r\nWatkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter with both demand and our backlog remained strong.\r\nInternational plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions.\r\nHansgrohe delivered strong growth and demand continue to improve across Europe and numerous other countries.\r\nHansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the UK, all grew double-digits in the quarter.\r\nSegment operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million and operating margin was 18.7%.\r\nOperating profit was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier, as well as an unfavorable price/cost relationship.\r\nThis was partially offset by strong incremental volume.\r\nWe anticipate additional SG&A increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity  Please summarize this transcript

statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics.\r\nI hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.\r\nWe performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong.\r\nThis resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double digit earnings-per-share growth.\r\nI'm extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth.\r\nFor the quarter, sales increased 24%.\r\nExcluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased 18%.\r\nOperating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to strong volume leverage.\r\nEarnings per share increased an outstanding 34%.\r\nOur overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the professional.\r\nTurning to our plumbing segment, sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business.\r\nInternational plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency, as Hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets.\r\nStrong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets.\r\nNew product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR One collection in the second half of the year.\r\nThis collection was designed by Barber Osgerby, an award-winning internationally acclaimed London-based industrial design studio.\r\nThis continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality.\r\nNorth American plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency, in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double digit growth at Delta.\r\nDelta faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels, and particularly strength in the professionally oriented trade channel.\r\nWe continue to invest in new products in North American plumbing as well.\r\nAnd two days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd Wright collection by Brizo that furthers the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.\r\nLastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steamist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta.\r\nSteamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.\r\nIn our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against the healthy 8% comp for the second quarter of 2020.\r\nWhile bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and propane grew in the quarter, demand moderated for DIY paint.\r\nMaterial availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter.\r\nBecause of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter.\r\nDue to lower than expected second quarter sales and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low-single digits for the full year.\r\nHowever, with the acceleration we saw in our propane business in the quarter, we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low-double digit growth from high-single digit for the full year for our propane business.\r\nFor the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year.\r\nWith respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high end line of paint in the third quarter at the Home Depot called Behr Dynasty for both DIY and pro painters.\r\nDynasty is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff resistant, one-coat hide paint ever.\r\nIt's low VOC, Greenguard and LEED certified, fast drying and has an anti-microbial mildew-resistant paint finish.\r\nThis is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional.\r\nMoving on to capital allocation.\r\nWe continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million.\r\nAs part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million.\r\nThis is approximately 5% of our outstanding share account at the beginning of the year.\r\nUnderscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately $1 billion.\r\nFinally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness.\r\nWe continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging.\r\nInbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter.\r\nWe now expect our all-in cost inflation to be in the high-single digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low-double digit inflation in the second half of the year.\r\nInflation in coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later in the fourth quarter.\r\nTo mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments, and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations.\r\nWe're also working with our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs.\r\nDespite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end.\r\nWhile cost inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business.\r\nOur teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions, and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers.\r\nHowever, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products and the channels that we serve.\r\nWe anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over time.\r\nThe demand for our products remains strong.\r\nAnd with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70.\r\nAs Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.\r\nTurning to Slide 7.\r\nWe delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs.\r\nAs a result, sales increased 24% with currency and net acquisitions, each contributing 3% to growth.\r\nIn local currency, North Ameri Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.\r\nLeading our discussion today are Maria Pope, President and CEO; and Jim Ajello, Senior Vice President of Finance, CFO and Treasurer.\r\nOur financial results this quarter were strong.\r\nWe reported net income of $96 million or $1.07 per share compared to net income of $81 million or $0.91 per share in the first quarter of last year.\r\nIn light of the strong quarter and positive outlook, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.70 per share, as well as our long-term earnings and dividend growth rates.\r\nJim will cover first-quarter results in more detail, provide regulatory and capital updates, as well as discuss the outlook for the rest of the year.\r\nThis quarter, again, presented significant weather-driven operational challenges.\r\nAnd I'm proud of how our teams came together, responding to the most severe, ice, wind and snowstorms in our history, improving our operations and achieving important customer-focused results.\r\nIn February, we restored over 750,000 customer outages, as nearly half of our customers were without power, many of whom experienced multiple outages over a more -- more than 2.5-week period.\r\nI want to recognize the hard work of our coworkers, mutual aid crews and assistance from as far away as Southern California, Utah, Montana to Alberta, British Columbia, all of whom in the midst of a pandemic went above and beyond to restore power quickly and most importantly, safely.\r\nEven as we speak, crews continue to repair equipment and clear down trees, as damage is still extensive.\r\nAs of March 31, the cost of the February storm were $87 million, which Jim will discuss in detail.\r\nThe recent storms and wildfires last fall on top of the pandemic with so many people living, working and learning remotely underscore the importance of our ongoing system hardening and reinvestment programs, combined with the deployment of digital capabilities, AI and smart grid technologies.\r\nToday versus a year ago, customers are experiencing about 16% less planned outages.\r\nAverage outage restoration times are about 7% faster and outage text notifications and digital payment options are making a difference in customer satisfaction.\r\nAnd equally important to note is what did not happen during the February weather events, our generation plants, as well as wind and hydro facilities operated seamlessly.\r\nAnd power was generated across the region throughout the harsh conditions.\r\nTurning to load growth and the economy.\r\nFor the last couple of years, we've discussed the strength of our service territory.\r\nOverall, year-over-year, customer count increased more than 1%, and load growth was up 1.2% on a weather-adjusted basis and 2.3% after accounting for the harsh winter conditions.\r\nResidential usage was up 3% weather-adjusted, offsetting commercial declines of 5%.\r\nIndustrial usage grew an impressive 8%, powered by the strength of the tech and digital sectors.\r\nExpansion within our region of several digital companies and the global semiconductor shortage are expected to continue and solidify our positive outlook.\r\nOverall, Oregon's economy is recovering, with nearly two-thirds of the state's pandemic-driven job loss recovered.\r\nUnemployment currently stands at 5.7% across our service territory.\r\nESG, Portland General has long been an ESG leader.\r\nAnd this quarter, we join the Amazon Climate Pledge in keeping with our commitment to reduce carbon by 80% by 2030 over 2010 levels and our aspirational goal of net zero by 2040.\r\nWe also know that to make real progress on climate, we need to partner in addressing the admissions from transportation and other sectors.\r\nLast week in partnership with Daimler Trucks North America, we celebrated the opening of the first of its kind heavy-duty electric truck charging site.\r\nThis site aligns with the West Coast clean transit corridor initiative to electrify along the I-5 Corridor from the borders with British Columbia to Mexico.\r\nAnd finally, I'd like to address the ongoing social unrest and importance of our diversity, equity and inclusion work.\r\nIn these tumultuous times, corporations have an opportunity for change.\r\nAt Portland General, our DE&I priorities are focused on recruiting, retaining, training and promoting from our front lines to our Board of Directors.\r\nWe are committed to transparency and have published for three years running our workforce and pay equity statistics.\r\nWe've made good progress, but we know that there is still much work to do.\r\nAs we look to the year ahead, we're excited to lead a clean energy transformation and humbled by the challenges as we work seamlessly to integrate ever-increasing amounts of renewable and distributed energy resources into a growing, reliant and resilient grid, meeting customers' needs for safe, affordable, clean energy.\r\nI too was impressed with the efforts of our teams across the company to restore power safely to customers during the February storms.\r\nAs we turn to economic conditions, it's clear that we're beginning to see recovery take hold.\r\nApproximately 40% of Oregonians have had at least one vaccine shot and as of mid-April, K-12 public schools reopened for in-person education, either hybrid or full time.\r\nAs of March 2021, the unemployment rate in PGE's service territory was 5.7% compared to a 14% peak in April 2020.\r\nIn the first quarter, Oregon saw accelerated job growth and as of March, had recovered over half of the jobs lost last spring.\r\nHarder hit segments such as leisure and hospitality have posted a noteworthy gains after experiencing a second wave of job losses in late 2020.\r\nWhile there are greenshoots of recovery, we appreciate that many of our customers are still facing challenges, and we embrace our role as an essential service provider and partner to Oregon communities.\r\nTurning to slide 5, I'll cover our financial performance.\r\nAs Maria said, we reported $1.07 per share compared to $0.91 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\r\nFirst, we saw a $0.06 increase in total revenue.\r\nThis is composed of $0.04 due to higher loads, which increased 1.2% year-over-year weather-adjusted and a $0.02 positive impact from weather.\r\nAdditionally, there was $0.02 from the earnings power associated with the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2020.\r\nNext, a $0.03 decrease in net variable power costs driven by lower hydro wind production in 2021.\r\nWhile our wind production exceeded our expectations, it was still less than the unusually high levels of production experienced in 2020.\r\nA $0.07 decrease was associated with higher operating and maintenance administrative expense, which consists of $0.05 of favorable fixed plant O&M primarily due to lower maintenance expense at our generation facilities.\r\nThis was offset by $0.12 of unfavorable administrative expenses, which included $0.03 of higher employee benefit expenses, $0.03 of higher legal and professional expense and $0.03 from the timing of bad debt recognition under our COVID deferral, and $0.03 from other items.\r\nA $0.05 increase was associated with lower depreciation and amortization expense, largely as a result of asset retirements, which were partially offset by capital addition.\r\nThere was a $0.04 increase in other income, primarily attributed to market returns on the non-qualified benefit trust.\r\nIt was an $0.11 increase from lower tax expense, primarily driven by a one-time recognition of a benefit from a local flow through tax.\r\nTurning to the regulatory update, we are continuing to evaluate our cost structure to ensure that we're providing safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers, while making investments that leverage the use of technology and advance our strategy.\r\nWe are still a Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

our business model, and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID.\r\nLooking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale, in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees, and above-store leaders, have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth.\r\nNow we'll discuss our Recipe for Growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it.\r\nTo start, I'll cover two growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short, and unrivaled culture and talent.\r\nThen Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our unmatched operating capability, and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.\r\nFirst, a few highlights from the quarter.\r\nsystem sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth.\r\nImportantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021.\r\nThis was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the U.K., and Australia, with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and show signs of recovery.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive two-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the two-year trend from Q1.\r\nThis is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery.\r\nEven more exciting is the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad-based and record-setting.\r\nLooking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall global trend is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country to country nor linear within a country.\r\nThis insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on and off-premise channels.\r\nWe've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets.\r\nA key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, geared toward providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands.\r\nEven as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority.\r\nWe delivered a second quarter record with over $5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year.\r\nEven more exciting, for the first time, on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in digital sales.\r\nWe believe these sales are highly incremental and result from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience.\r\nTo bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points.\r\nThe Taco Bell U.S. launch of our Taco Bell rewards program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives and early access to crave-worthy promotions.\r\nWe're incredibly excited by the early results from the program and the future growth opportunity that remains.\r\nWe're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visit, leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell rewards program compared to their pre-loyalty behavior.\r\nAs another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021, replacing our previous third-party solution.\r\nAs a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full-year digital sales amount.\r\nNow let's talk about our RED Brands.\r\nStarting with the KFC division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 35%, driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\r\nFor the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.\r\nAt KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter.\r\nSame-store sales declined 1% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.\r\nWe had truly outstanding results in March, leading the recovery with double-digit two-year same-store sales growth in the U.K., Australia, Canada, and the Middle East.\r\nOur strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength, and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally.\r\nNext, at KFC U.S., we continued to see strong momentum, with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2.\r\nImportantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a two-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier, and our new chicken sandwich.\r\nOur chicken sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future.\r\nMoving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit.\r\nThe division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10%, driven by 10% same-store sales growth.\r\nWhile the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevate Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst's president and chief executive officer.\r\nActual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors.\r\nOverall, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\r\nOur team continues to focus on providing industry-leading services to our customers as well as selling prospective customers on the value that UniFirst can bring to their businesses.\r\nThe results for our first quarter were largely as we anticipated, with consolidated revenues growing 8.8% and an overall adjusted operating margin for our core laundry operations of approximately 10%.\r\nThe team continues to execute well, producing solid performances in both new account sales as well as customer retention during the quarter.\r\nIn addition, wearer additions versus reductions during the quarter were positive, indicating the continued growth and recovery of our customer base.\r\nThis is a favorable comparison to a year ago when many customer wearer levels remained depressed due to the impact of the pandemic.\r\nThe strong year-over-year growth in the quarter was also impacted by adjustments to customer pricing as we continue to work with our customers through this inflationary environment.\r\nAs a reminder, from a profitability perspective, we discussed during our year-end earnings call that going forward over the next few years, we are going to be reporting adjusted results, which exclude the impact of costs that we are expending on three discrete strategic initiatives that are critical in our efforts to transform the company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning.\r\nAs a reminder, these three initiatives are the rollout of our new CRM system, investments in the UniFirst brand, and a corporatewide ERP system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology.\r\nAs we have talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructure, and our technologies.\r\nAll of the investments designed to deliver solid long-term returns for UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components of our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry.\r\nAfter excluding our costs in our quarter related to these investments, our adjusted operating margin is showing an anticipated decline compared to a year ago.\r\nThe comparison of adjusted margin is being impacted by increases in costs we've been highlighting for a couple of quarters now.\r\nSome are simply bouncing back from depressed levels during the pandemic and others are being impacted by the inflationary environment and some are being impacted by both.\r\nAs a reminder, these costs include merchandise amortization, costs related to raw materials and the overall supply chain disruption, the cost to hire and retain labor, energy, and travel.\r\nOur solid balance sheet positions us well to meet these ongoing challenges while continuing to make investments in growth and strengthen our business.\r\nAlong those lines, during December, we closed on two small acquisitions, which will improve our footprint in key markets.\r\nAs we have highlighted before, acquisitions continue to be part of our overall growth strategy.\r\nDespite the challenges in the overall operating environment, we continue to be confident in our ability to manage and execute through these obstacles.\r\nWe maintain a sharp focus on taking care of our employees, our customers, and bringing new customers into the UniFirst family.\r\nAs we have discussed previously, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and services and we feel the company is positioned well to support the evolving economic landscape.\r\nIn our first quarter of 2022, consolidated revenues were $486.2 million, up 8.8% from $446.9 million a year ago, and consolidated operating income decreased to $44.8 million from $56 million in -- or 20.1%.\r\nNet income for the quarter decreased to $33.7 million or $1.77 per diluted share from $41.9 million or $2.20 per diluted share.\r\nOur financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 included $5.9 million of costs directly attributable to the three key initiatives that Steve discussed.\r\nExcluding these initiative costs, adjusted operating income was $50.7 million, adjusted net income was $38.1 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.\r\nAlthough our financial results in the prior year may have included direct costs related to these key initiatives, which in our first quarter of 2021 would have primarily been for our CRM initiative, the company did not specifically track the amounts that were being expensed.\r\nThis is because the amount was less significant in value and a large number of the costs were still being capitalized.\r\nAs a result, we will not be providing adjusted amounts for the prior year comparable period.\r\nOur core laundry operations revenues for the quarter were $428.8 million, up 9.1% from the first quarter of 2021.\r\nCore laundry organic growth, which adjusts for the estimated effect of acquisitions as well as fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, was 8.6%.\r\nThis strong organic growth rate was primarily the result of customer reopenings, solid sales performance, and improved customer retention in fiscal 2021 as well as efforts to share with our customers the cost increases that we are seeing in our business due to the current inflationary environment.\r\nCore laundry operating margin decreased to 8.5% for the quarter or $36.5 million from 12.4% in the prior year or $48.9 million.\r\nCosts we incurred during the quarter related to our key initiatives were recorded to our core laundry operations segment.\r\nAnd excluding these costs, the segment's adjusted operating margin was 9.9%.\r\nThe decrease from prior year's operating margin was primarily due to higher merchandise amortization, which continues to normalize from depressed levels during the pandemic, as well as the effect of large national account installations, which are providing additional merchandise amortization headwinds.\r\nAlso, inflationary pressures and the overall supply chain disruption continued to impact our other merchandise costs.\r\nDuring the quarter, the adjusted operating margin was also impacted by higher travel and energy costs as a percentage of revenues as well as wage inflation we are experiencing, responding to the very challenging employment environment.\r\nEnergy costs increased to 4.3% of revenues in the first quarter of 2022, up from 3.6% in prior year.\r\nRevenues from our specialty garments segment, which delivers specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services, increased to $39.5 million from $38.1 million in prior year or 3.5%.\r\nThis increase was primarily due to growth in our cleanroom and European nuclear operations.\r\nThe segment's operating margin increased to 21.9% from 18.8%, primarily due to lower merchandise costs as a percentage of revenues.\r\nAs we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services.\r\nOur first aid segment's revenues increased to $17.8 million from $15.5 million in prior year or 14.8%.\r\nThis increase was due to improved top line performance in both our wholesale distribution as well as our first aid van business.\r\nHowever, the segment had an operating loss of $0.3 million during the quarter primarily due to continued investment in the company's initiative to expand its first aid van business into new geographies.\r\nWe continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $478.1 million at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2022.\r\nDuring the quarter, our net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by our reduced profit Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n For today's call, Jeff will begin by covering a summary of our second quarter results and by providing a current status of our global operations.\r\nRoop will then discuss the second quarter results in more detail, including a cash and balance sheet summary and our third quarter guidance.\r\nJeff will wrap up with an outlook by market sector and an update on our strategic initiatives before we conclude the call with Q&A.\r\nOur second quarter results were achieved against the backdrop of mandatory facility shutdowns, component constraints, and extra processes required to keep everyone safe.\r\nDuring Q2, we achieved revenue of $491 million, which was down sequentially from Q1, but supported by strong demand in our Medical and Semi-Cap sectors.\r\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.07.\r\nOur non-GAAP earnings include $4 million or $0.10 per share of COVID related costs that we could not fully anticipate as we entered the quarter.\r\nIn addition to these COVID costs, we experienced other production inefficiencies as a result of the current pandemic environment.\r\nOur overall performance was helped by the aggressive cost reduction actions taken earlier in the quarter.\r\nOur cash conversion cycle for the quarter was 84 days.\r\nDespite operating challenges, we generated $23 million in cash flow from operations and returned $6 million of cash to shareholders as part of our recurring quarterly dividend payment.\r\nAs we look forward, I wanted to step back and offer a few perspectives.\r\nI'll do that on Slide 4.\r\nSince I joined Benchmark last year, we've made a lot of positive changes and all of these have been supported by an amazing team.\r\nFrom the hard work required to execute on our strategic initiatives and goals that we outlined last year, to overcoming unique challenges presented by the unprecedented global pandemic of today, let me simply say our team has risen to the occasion.\r\nBefore I arrived, the company had embarked on a strategy to diversify the markets we serve and drive our portfolio mix with a greater concentration in higher value markets.\r\nIn the past year, we have worked further to align the customers where we can add the most value and these efforts have paid off.\r\nToday we enjoy a diverse portfolio of products across many high growth and high value sectors.\r\nThat being said, we are not immune to the current recession that this disease has caused and we have an unprecedented amount of demand changes in our portfolio that's required a lot of the team's attention to ensure we capitalize on new opportunities while mitigating any risks.\r\nWe believe this diverse portfolio and exposure to high value segments will allow us to expand our quarterly revenue through the balance of the year.\r\nSupply chain in our complex high mixed environment is a constant focus, and our recent results have been supported by the strong performance of our supply chain team.\r\nDuring the second quarter and due to the team's efforts, we were not significantly impacted by component shortages, but they did in some places contribute to operational inefficiencies.\r\nFurther, our revamped go-to-market organization has grown the manufacturing and engineering services opportunity pipeline by over 30% in the past 12 months, and have delivered three quarters of sequential growth in bookings, which bodes well for our long-term growth potential.\r\nAs we look out to the end of the year, we are still on track to exit 2020 with at least 9% gross margin and we expect to build on this momentum into 2021.\r\nAs the global pandemic continues to evolve, we have expanded protocols focused on keeping a safe work environment for our employees.\r\nOur actions are informed by the best practices published by the CDC, the WHO and local authorities, and we've completed a Company Employee Survey to solicit direct feedback on our actions to date and ensure our employees agree that we are maintaining a safe work environment.\r\nWhere possible we are continuing to permit about 20% of our employees to work from home.\r\nWe have shifted our customer engagements to a virtual environment with real time video supported factory tours as we limit travel to protect our teams.\r\nWe even hosted a virtual grand opening of our new Phoenix operation with Governor Ducey and Mayor Gallego.\r\nOur teams have adapted well to the new reality, and we are finding creative ways to stay close to our customers and continuing to collaborate with them on solving new challenges.\r\nIn Asia, China and Thailand we are fully operational through the second quarter.\r\nAs we entered Q2, our Penang, Malaysia operations, which includes our largest precision machining facility operated at 50% capacity based on local restrictions, which were subsequently lifted at the end of April.\r\nFrom the 1st of May, Malaysia has been fully operational.\r\nOur European sites in the Netherlands and Romania were fully operational in the second quarter and remains so today.\r\nAcross the US, our five operations in California were impacted by shelter-in-place orders through April.\r\nSince early May and to the present all California locations as well as our other US sites are fully operational.\r\nIn Mexico, we have two operations in Tijuana and one in Guadalajara.\r\nThe 100% shutdown that impacted our Tijuana operations was lifted in mid-May after we passed some inspection and were given authorization to operate by the Baja's state.\r\nThere has been a phase return to work since this time and the Tier 1 sites are now operating at approximately 75%.\r\nOur Guadalajara facility has been essentially operating at 75% productivity due to at-risk employees being required to stay home for the Jalisco state government restrictions.\r\nWe are staggering shifts and other protocols in our Mexican operations to keep our employees safe and optimize output.\r\nThis has been and remains a highly dynamic environment.\r\nAs shelter-in-place orders were lifted in the US, we had hoped the country could maintain the declining infection curve.\r\nUnfortunately this has not happened.\r\nAs the incident rate domestically increases, there could be temporary shutdowns of one of our facilities at any given time.\r\nAnd we stand ready to execute decontamination protocols beyond our normal safe work in cleaning procedures.\r\nOur operation teams will continue to maintain our safety first approach, while managing schedules to ensure we meet delivery obligations to our customers.\r\nOver to you, Roop.\r\nI hope everyone and their families are staying healthy and safe.\r\nLet me start by echoing Jeff's sentiment on the incredible efforts of our teams to support our customers through a very dynamic environment.\r\nAs we manage through the COVID crisis, our priorities remain centered on one, the health and safety of our employees.\r\nTwo, delivering for our customers.\r\nThree, maintaining a healthy balance sheet and four, ensuring the financial flexibility to run our operations through uncertainty.\r\nTotal Benchmark revenue was $491 million.\r\nMedical revenues for the second quarter increased 14% sequentially and were up 18% year-over-year from continued new product ramps, strength throughout our medical customers and increasing demand for critical devices necessary to support the COVID-19 fight, including X-ray and ultrasound devices, ventilators and diagnostic equipment, which we estimate is approximately a third of our sequential growth.\r\nSemi-Cap revenues were up 5% in the second quarter and up 39% year-over-year from continued strong demand across our Semi-Cap customers.\r\nA&D revenues for the second quarter decreased 26% sequentially due to approximately $15 million lower revenue from our commercial aerospace programs, which is approximately 30% of the sectors revenue.\r\nThe remaining decline in the sector is related to defense program timing changes, whether that is the end of certain programs or transitions to new programs.\r\nDemand from our defense customers for security solutions, aircraft, munitions  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I will begin today with a high-level overview of our first quarter performance and capital allocation priorities.\r\nKarla will then speak to our operating results and demand trends by end market, and Arthur will conclude with a review of our first quarter 2021 financials.\r\nOur resilient business model, coupled with outstanding execution in a favorable market, resulted in record financial performance during the first quarter of 2021.\r\nWe experienced ongoing strength in metals pricing during the first quarter, led by multiple price increases for carbon steel products, along with improving demand in many markets, and leveraged our decentralized operating structure, small order sizes and diversification of products, end markets and geographies to achieve record gross profit margin for the third consecutive quarter of 33.6%, up 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 330 basis points from the first quarter of 2020.\r\nOur record quarterly gross profit margin, combined with average selling prices well above our expectations and our continued focus on expense control, contributed to record pre-tax income of $359 million in the first quarter of 2021, up over 100% from the prior quarter and up over 300% from the prior year period.\r\nOur quarterly earnings per diluted share of $4.12 were also a record and substantially exceeded our outlook.\r\nOur strong earnings and effective working capital management resulted in cash flow from operations of $161.8 million in the first quarter of 2021 despite $182.8 million of working capital investment.\r\nThis is a significant result as we typically use cash in the first quarter as we rebuild working capital from seasonal low fourth quarter levels, compounded by the significant increases in metals costs we are experiencing.\r\nWe improved our inventory turn rate to 5.4 times, surpassing our 2020 annual rate and companywide turn goal of 4.7 times.\r\nOur ability to cross-sell inventory among our family of companies, which we believe is the key advantage and differentiator of our model and scale, was a significant contributor to our improved inventory management.\r\nDespite extended mill lead times and inventory shortages, collaboration among our family of companies and strong long-standing relationships with our domestic mills enabled us to source the metal needed by our customers.\r\nOur managers in the field effectively supported our valued customers by ensuring inventory availability while maximizing margin on opportunistic orders.\r\nOur strong cash flow generation and significantly enhanced liquidity position enables us to maintain a flexible capital allocation strategy focused on both growth and stockholder returns.\r\nOur 2021 capital expenditure budget of $245 million includes new buildings and other projects to expand, upgrade and maintain many of our existing operating facilities.\r\nHowever, when factoring in project delays and extended lead times for equipment due to COVID-19, we believe our potential cash flow outlays for our capital expenditure will be closer to $300 million in 2021 due to the prior year holdover spending.\r\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we invested $43.7 million back into our business through capital expenditures, including several growth opportunities to address and exceed our customers' and suppliers' needs.\r\nFor instance, we've invested in toll processing expansions in Texas and Kentucky given the significant demand we've experienced in our toll processing capabilities throughout our footprint.\r\nOperations at our Kentucky facility commenced in November 2020 and have been steadily ramping ever since.\r\nConstruction continues in Texas on our new greenfield facility focused on carbon steel tolling, which will support increased capacity of our toll processing customers who are primarily metals producers and their end customers.\r\nWe're very excited about these opportunities to expand our toll processing service offerings and see many more possibilities in the future for our toll processing capabilities moving forward.\r\nAs mentioned on our last call, we are installing energy-efficient lighting and solar panels in certain of our facilities as well as investing in additional innovative processing equipment to continue providing our customers with the highest quality products and services.\r\nWe continue to see a healthy pipeline of prospective opportunities, including in adjacent businesses in addition to traditional metals service center businesses as we've broadened our universe of potential acquisition candidates.\r\nNevertheless, we will maintain our strict transaction criteria, including our focus on quality of earnings when we evaluate any prospective targets to ensure a strong fit within our family of companies.\r\nI will now turn to our stockholder return activity.\r\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we paid $44.8 million in dividends to our stockholders.\r\nWe've maintained our payment of regular quarterly dividends for 62 consecutive years without ever suspending payments or reducing our dividend rate.\r\nIn fact, we've increased our dividend 28 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 10% in the first quarter of 2021.\r\nAt March 31, 2021, approximately 2.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.\r\nWe expect to remain a prudent allocator of capital by maintaining our flexible approach focused on both growth, which remains our top priority; and stockholder return activities, including opportunistic repurchases of our common stock.\r\nIn summary, I am inspired by the strong operational execution demonstrated by the entire Reliance team during the first quarter of 2021.\r\nOur unwavering focus on the core elements of the Reliance business model, including health and safety, pricing discipline, diligent expense control when needed, inventory management, organic growth and innovation, enables us to perform from a position of strength in both good times and bad.\r\nIn the current environment characterized by extremely high metal pricing, strong demand from many of our customers and limited metal availability, we believe Reliance remains well positioned to continue generating strong earnings.\r\nGiven our strong liquidity position, we look forward to continuing to support the growth and needs of our customers and suppliers while also returning value to our stockholders.\r\nWe will continue to support our colleagues, customers, suppliers and communities in a sustainable manner through both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\r\nWe remain confident that America is going to need Reliance to rebuild.\r\nStrong demand conditions in the majority of our end markets resulted in our tons sold increasing 11.3% compared to the fourth quarter, which was within our guidance range of up 10% to 12% and above the typical seasonal improvement in shipping volumes we experienced in the first quarter.\r\nWhile demand is healthy and continues to improve in most markets, our first quarter shipments did not reach pre-pandemic levels and were down 4% from the first quarter of 2020.\r\nHowever, on a per day basis, our tons sold were down only 2.5%.\r\nWe believe underlying demand is stronger than our shipment levels reflect, given many factors holding back economic activity for us, our customers and our suppliers, including metal supply constraints, supply chain disruptions for various components and materials and labor and trucking shortages.\r\nThe good news is we expect to fill this demand in future periods and these factors support increased metal pricing.\r\nThis strengthened demand, coupled with rising input costs and limited metal availability, resulted in metal prices accelerating throughout the first quarter for many of the products we sell, most notably carbon steel products.\r\nOur average selling price increased 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, exceeding our guidance of up 12% to 14% by a significant margin.\r\nThese robust demand and pricing conditions contri Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n These statements are based on how we see things today.\r\nActual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\r\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be -- should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results.\r\nTom will provide an overview of the current operating environment, while Rob will provide some details on our second quarter results as well as some shipment trends for the third quarter.\r\nWe delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment.\r\nThat's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities.\r\nOur second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter.\r\nOverall restaurant traffic in the US was resilient by holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter.\r\nHowever, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continued to vary widely by channel.\r\nTraffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats.\r\nTraffic at full service restaurants was 70% to 80% of the prior year levels for much of the quarter.\r\nHowever, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets.\r\nTraffic and demand at non-commercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, healthcare, schools and universities, sports and entertainment, and workplace environment was fairly steady at around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter.\r\nIn retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year.\r\nOutside the US, restaurant traffic in fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter.\r\nIn Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture, fry demand during much of the quarter was similar to last year, but softened the 75% to 85% of prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turn colder.\r\nAs you may recall, unlike in the US, QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities.\r\nDemand in our other key international markets was mixed.\r\nIn China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels.\r\nIn our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter, but remained well below prior year levels.\r\nGoing forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carryover into our fiscal third quarter.\r\nThe sharp resurgence in COVID in the US and Europe has led government to imposed even more rigid social restrictions, In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the northern hemisphere.\r\nNot surprisingly, we expect traffic at full service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected.\r\nMajor QSR chains in the US should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery.\r\nRetail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home.\r\nAnd as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view.\r\nSo on one the hand in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year.\r\nOn the other hand, we believe this COVID induced shock to demand is temporary.\r\nWe're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long term.\r\nAs COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually less social restrictions.\r\nThis should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses.\r\nWe believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021.\r\nIn the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemics impacts on our manufacturing operations.\r\nOur recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend in the planned resumption of our share repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category, as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders.\r\nIn summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment.\r\nWe expect frozen potato demand has softened in the near term due to reduced traffic, following government reimposed, social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather, and we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021.\r\nAs Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter, as our teams continued to manage through an ever changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks.\r\nFor the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million.\r\nSales volume was down 14% largely due to fry demand at restaurants and foodservice being negatively impacted following government imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID, as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets.\r\nOverall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the US stabilized at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel.\r\nInternational sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter.\r\nPrice mix increased 2% driven by improved price in our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail.\r\nGross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price mix and productivity savings.\r\nAs we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expect that our manufacturing cost to increase in the quarter.\r\nThis was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual.\r\nWe did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemics impact on fry demand.\r\nProcessing older crop results in increased cost due to significant -- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates.\r\nSince we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realize the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory.\r\nWe also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients.\r\nOverall, our input cost inflation was in the low-single digits.\r\nFinally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations.\r\nAs a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other cost to shutdown, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID.\r\nCost associated with modifying production schedules reducing run-times and manufacturing retail products on lines primarily designed for foodservice products and cost  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

[/INST] # Lamb Weston delivered solid Q2 financial results, with net sales of $896 million despite challenging operating conditions due to COVID-19 restrictions and weather. The decline in sales was primarily attributed to reduced restaurant traffic, impacting fry demand. Gross profit decreased due to higher manufacturing costs from processing older crops and input cost inflation but was partially offset by favorable price mix. Shipments to major QSR chains in the US remained strong, approaching prior year levels. However, demand in Europe softened as governments reimposed restrictions. The company expects softer demand in the near term due to social restrictions and weather but remains optimistic that restaurant traffic will gradually recover by the end of calendar 2021. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 2% and plans to resume its share repurchase program. Lamb Weston is confident in its fundamentals and ability to manage through pandemic impacts, anticipating demand will approach pre-pandemic levels as vaccines become widely available.</s>"}

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne.\r\nAnd of course, actual results may differ materially.\r\nI'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter.\r\nWe achieved record revenue, 75.2% greater than last year, driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 62.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR.\r\nRevenue increased organically in every major business group but was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter.\r\nFurthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with the third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1 GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year, and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019.\r\nHowever, excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020.\r\nCash flow was a third quarter record allowing repayment of $300 million of debt while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3 from 3.7 at the end of the second quarter.\r\nTeledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter.\r\nIntegration efforts have been swift and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne.\r\nWe continue to accelerate the pace of plant synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022 as we described in our July earnings call, and compared with 2024 as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021.\r\nRegarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues, inflation, and other operational challenges.\r\nHowever, to-date, we have been successfully navigating and managing these issues, and today, we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin, and earnings outlook compared with the outlook we presented in July.\r\nOn a full year basis, we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5%, led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in digital imaging, which excludes Teledyne FLIR.\r\nThis translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from digital imaging, including FLIR.\r\nI will now further comment on the performance of the four business segments.\r\nIn our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3% largely due to the FLIR acquisition but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%.\r\nSales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record and healthcare sales return to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nGAAP segment operating margin was 12.5%, but adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting segment margin was 23.9%.\r\nIn our Instrumentation segment overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year.\r\nSales of test and electronic test and measurement systems, which includes oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels.\r\nSales of environmental instruments increased 7.6% from last year with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter.\r\nSales of marine instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter.\r\nIn addition, orders were the strongest in the last six quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13.\r\nOverall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3% with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization.\r\nIn the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7% driven by 8.4% growth in defense, space, and industrial sales combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter.\r\nGAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year.\r\nFinally in the Engineered System segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4% but operating profit and margin declined slightly since we exited the higher margin turbine engine business earlier this year.\r\nBut before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook.\r\nFor several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low-teens to over 20%.\r\nOver the last 2.5 years, we made tremendous progress with it -- with stand -- notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures.\r\nTo date, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full-year 2021 forecasted operating margin which excluding acquisition-related charges is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July.\r\nAnd now to Sue.\r\nI will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook.\r\nIn the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million including all acquisition-related costs.\r\nExcluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax, cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020.\r\nFree cash flow that is cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020.\r\nCapital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020.\r\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $29.2 million in 2020.\r\nIn addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million.\r\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt that is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $551.8 million.\r\nStock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020.\r\nResulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021.\r\nTurning to our outlook.\r\nManagement currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17.\r\nAnd for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29 and on a non-GAAP basis $16.35 to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50.\r\nThe 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.9%.\r\nIn addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.\r\nI'll now pass the call back to Robert.\r\n Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimates and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations.\r\nThe company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\r\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nThese measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results.\r\nWe're thrilled to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2021, driving record results with a Q4 comp of 10.8% and operating margin expansion of 310 basis points.\r\nThese results reflect the resilience in our business model as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges within the supply chain, material and labor shortage and capacity limitations from our incredible consumer demand.\r\nThis resilience, coupled with continued execution in our growth initiatives, fueled an annual comp of 22%, operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, and earnings per share growth of 64% to $14.85 per share.\r\nOur three key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy, and our values, continue to provide the framework for execution both in our core business and in our growth areas like B2B, marketplace, cross-brands, and our global business, which excitingly have all gained traction faster than predicted and demonstrate to us that we are well-positioned to continue to take share in this industry.\r\nFirst, let's spend some time on our top-line performance in the fourth quarter.\r\nThroughout fiscal 2021, we continued a deliberate reduction in our sitewide promotional cadence in all of our brands.\r\nInstead, we shifted our focus on delivering aspirational and inspirational content, and our customers clearly responded.\r\nThis pricing power is entirely a function of our differentiated and sustainable product offering that our customers know and love.\r\nAnd further, despite the highly promotional environment in the fourth quarter, we made a conscious decision to maintain this pricing integrity and not pursue incremental top line at the cost of our merchandise margins.\r\nIn fact, we delivered gross margin expansion of 290 basis points in the quarter.\r\nFurther, this pricing power has allowed us the flexibility to absorb supply chain costs and aggressively fund marketing efforts.\r\nOur bottom-line performance in the fourth quarter speaks for itself.\r\nWe drove operating margin of 21% and a 37% increase in EPS, both of which demonstrate the durability of our earnings power through execution in our core and growth initiatives, which I'm excited to update you on now.\r\nOur B2B business continues to outperform, building its book of business to $753 million in 2021.\r\nB2B is an underserved and fractured industry as we continue to take share in this white space, servicing businesses that need high-quality, sustainable furnishings at good price points.\r\nFurthermore, our in-house design capabilities offering the wide breadth of aesthetics across our brands, coupled with our industry-leading global sourcing and supply chain operations, allows us to take this service to the next level.\r\nOur B2B business has tremendous potential to contribute to our results.\r\nOur growth targets continue to climb as we unlock new opportunities.\r\nAnd not only is our B2B business model accretive to our gross margin but even more accretive to op margin as a result of the fixed operating costs.\r\nWe continue to exceed our own expectations for this business.\r\nAnd longer term, we believe this is one of our biggest opportunities.\r\nAnother contributor to our success has been our global strategy.\r\nWe're franchise first with strong retail and digital execution.\r\nDuring 2021, global achieved record revenue up 23% over last year with strong earnings growth.\r\nCore company-owned markets of Canada and U.K. achieved record results for the year and the quarter.\r\nFranchise continues to be a growth vehicle with the critical markets of the Middle East, Mexico, and India providing a large diverse growth base.\r\nWith our systems investment in our new digital platform and large cost reductions in warehousing, transportation, and delivery, we expect to exceed our record results in 2022.\r\nMarketing is another component that sets us apart and drove results in FY '21.\r\nCustomers who shop across our brands generate three to four times more revenue than the single brand customer.\r\nAnd we've seen incredible results this past year due to our continued marketing efforts.\r\nIn fiscal '21, approximately 60% of our sales came from cross-brand customers, a record high in terms of percent to total.\r\nAnd our cross-brand customer counts grew faster than those of the single-brand customer.\r\nWhile new customer acquisition is always a priority and continues to grow, we believe we have even more upside by increasing our share of wallet with our existing customer base.\r\nCore to this strategy are three things.\r\nFirst, our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key.\r\nWe continue to see record levels of customer engagement and an all-time high membership.\r\nSecond, our recently launched cross-brand credit card.\r\nThis card reached its six-month anniversary, producing cardholder spend and cross-brand activity that has exceeded our expectations.\r\nAnd third, we are focused on personalization efforts in our digital marketing.\r\nWe continue to leverage our in-house managed first-party data across our brands, which positions us for the cookieless future that is rapidly approaching.\r\nRemember, our multifaceted loyalty program generates benefits across our portfolio and is a clear competitive advantage a few of our peers offer.\r\nAs a digital-first company, we are in constant pursuit of incremental improvement to our customers' shopping journey online.\r\nWe've improved several product finding and purchasing experiences on our website, from improved room styling, native registry applications, and the removal of friction in the checkout process.\r\nAdditionally, we relentlessly focus on continued optimization and automation in our DCs and logistics networks to improve our service time.\r\nOn the sustainability front, we take great pride in the progress we are making with our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishings industry.\r\nNotable accomplishments in this quarter included our second annual inclusion in Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index, being recognized as No.\r\n21 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and receiving an A rating from CDP for leadership in supplier engagement and our work with suppliers on tackling climate change.\r\nThese commitments are reflected in the high-quality sustainable products that we offer our customers and continue to distinguish our company and our brands.\r\nOur values are both central in our actions and embedded in our products.\r\nWe always want to provide our customers with transparency.\r\nAnd each day, we commit ourselves to maintaining the highest level of integrity and ethical standards.\r\nWe are deeply saddened by the war in Ukraine, and we stand with Ukrainians and all people who oppose war and its atrocities on family and the home.\r\nRelated to product and business with Russia, we have no operations in Russia.\r\nAnd as the situation between Russia and Ukraine escalated, our team identified a handful of products of Russian origin, which we are no longer selling.\r\nAnd now let's turn to the performance of our brands.\r\nWest Elm delivered an 18.3% comp in the fourth quarter with all categories driving strong growth.\r\nCustomers responded well to new products, including best-sellers in bedroom, dining, storage, and occasional categories.\r\nAdditionally, new categories such as bath, kids, and kitchen also contributed to incremental growth.\r\nOn the full year, West Elm delivered a comp of 33.1%, building to a 48.3% on a two-year basis and continui Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially.\r\nYou can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in our Form 10-K filed earlier today.\r\nMy first two official months back at Fluor have been extremely busy.\r\nThe immediate priority was to reset and communicate our longer-term strategy and the corresponding organizational structure.\r\nAs you know, we announced the new Fluor management team in January.\r\nOur collective focus is on the end markets where we have the right technical expertise to add value for our clients, while earning a suitable return for our shareholders.\r\nThe recent changes that have been implemented align our business around the strategic priorities identified for Fluor in the near term.\r\nAs a reminder, our four strategic priorities are to: number one, drive growth across the portfolio; two, pursue contracts with fair and balanced terms; three, foster a high-performance culture with purpose; and four, reinforce financial discipline.\r\nFor a longer-term view of Fluor's opportunities and key focus areas, please tune in to our Strategy Day from last month if you haven't had a chance to view it yet.\r\nStrategy Day kicked off one of the more exciting eras of change and growth in Fluor's long history.\r\nAnd we are confident that the strategic plan as outlined will deliver a directional earnings range between $3 and $3.50 per share by 2024.\r\nWe ended the year with a backlog of $25.6 billion and full year new awards of $9 billion.\r\nNew awards clearly reflected the impact of the pandemic and its pressure on our clients.\r\nThey also reflect our stringent pursuit criteria and strategy to reduce risk.\r\nAcross our end markets, we saw clients delay capital spending plans while they waited for uncertainty from the pandemic to subside.\r\nBased on conversations with our clients, we are starting to see positive momentum and expect to see new awards pick up in the second half of 2021.\r\nWe continue to see good prospects across our portfolio and are completing front-end work scopes to populate our future backlog.\r\nHowever, lower awards in 2020 will create a headwind for 2021 earnings.\r\nBefore talking about what we are seeing for 2021, I want to reinforce that the people of Fluor have tackled the challenges of 2020 with a resilience and energy that was unmatched.\r\nThese challenges have made us all more adaptive, and I believe that the organization is truly motivated to successfully take the company forward into its next chapter.\r\nNow let's turn to our business lines and how we are aligning our priorities with the opportunities ahead.\r\nTurning to Slide 4.\r\nAs we move into 2021, our urban solutions end markets are gaining momentum, specifically, in mining.\r\nWe are seeing high demand for metals such as copper and iron ore.\r\nLast year, we booked a significant North American steel project as well as several front-end studies that we expect will convert to follow-on EPCM awards in late 2021 and beyond.\r\nLate last year, we achieved patent completion for the BHP Spence copper project in Chile.\r\nWe've had a long-term relationship supporting BHP's capital efforts, and we are proud to be completing another successful project for them.\r\nWe are also encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in our advanced technologies and life sciences end markets.\r\nHere, we are pursuing data centers and semiconductor opportunities in North America and major life sciences prospects in Europe.\r\nIn addition, Fluor has just been selected for a large biotech project in Europe, and we are finalizing contract details now.\r\nThis confirms our strategy to leverage front-end technical solutions into full EPC awards.\r\nContract signature is expected by the end of Q1 2021, and we look forward to sharing more specifics at that time.\r\nAdvanced technologies and life sciences is well positioned to support our clients for advanced manufacturing projects.\r\nThis includes opportunities arising from the U.S. government's executive order that is focused on the domestic supply chain for critical materials, including semiconductors, batteries, pharmaceuticals and rare earth elements.\r\nMoving to Slide 5.\r\nIn Infrastructure, we are well positioned for select opportunities in the U.S. due to urbanization and an aging infrastructure system.\r\nFurthermore, we believe these opportunities could be enhanced with the introduction of a federal infrastructure spending bill.\r\nAs a reminder and as messaged previously, infrastructure margins will be under pressure as legacy zero-margin projects are worked down through the year.\r\nApproximately 35% of our infrastructure revenue will come from zero-margin work in 2021.\r\nAs we discussed during Strategy Day, we will be very selective in the infrastructure projects we pursue in the future.\r\nEach pursuit must have the right scope, the right client, the right location, the right contract terms, the right size and, importantly, the right execution team and resources.\r\nOur goal is to deliver predictable earnings and not chase top line growth.\r\nThis will be especially apparent in our infrastructure pursuits going forward.\r\nTurning to Slide 6.\r\nThe management team is very excited about the work we are doing in Mission Solutions and the opportunities we see in supporting our government clients going forward.\r\nAs you know, we are keenly focused on growing our presence in the intelligence, cyber and mission-critical infrastructure and operations markets.\r\nFurthermore, we continue to support the DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration with its nuclear security, environmental remediation and energy projects and operations.\r\nWe expect that work to be a strong baseload for Fluor in the coming years.\r\nWhile we are optimistic about our prospects in Energy Solutions in 2021, we don't expect our clients to resume capital spending at a meaningful pace until later in 2021 and beyond.\r\nWe are having productive conversations with our energy clients and are well positioned to meet their growing needs.\r\nImportantly here, we are living in an ever-changing world, and Fluor continues to enhance its capabilities in the energy transition space.\r\nWe fully expect this market to begin a larger part of our prospect pipeline as clients pivot themselves toward a lower carbon economy.\r\nNext, our chemicals clients see recovery in key sectors of the market, which are anticipated to translate into additional capital expenditures.\r\nThis includes the specialty chemicals market, where we continue to see positive signs of investment with our existing clients and significant activity with ongoing pursuits.\r\nAlso, future consumer demand in the battery market is translating into additional client investments associated with lithium and related battery chemicals.\r\nNow let me give you a brief update on some of our key projects, starting with LNG Canada.\r\nMoving to Slide 8.\r\nAt our Strategy Day, Project Director Phil Park gave a full update on the good progress at LNG Canada and Kitimat.\r\nEarlier this month, the project received approval

[/INST] # Fluor Corporation reported a 2020 net loss of $294 million, reflecting impairments and COVID-19 impacts. Moving forward, the company is prioritizing balance sheet stability through debt retirement and divestitures. For 2021, Fluor anticipates booking a pipeline of projects that align with its revised pursuit criteria, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.80. This guidance excludes NuScale expenses, foreign currency fluctuations, restructuring, or impairments. Despite lower awards in 2020 creating a headwind for 2021 earnings, Fluor remains optimistic about growth in the second half of the year. The company is well-positioned in end markets such as urban solutions (e.g., mining, advanced technologies, life sciences), infrastructure, mission solutions (e.g., intelligence, cyber), and energy solutions. Fluor expects NuScale initiatives to provide significant returns over time and is evaluating new investors to capitalize on its clean energy investment. The company anticipates average full-year margins of 2-3% in Urban Solutions, 2.5-3% in Mission Solutions, and 2.5-3.5% in Energy Solutions, improving as the year progresses. Fluor maintains its long-term guidance of earnings per share between $3 and $3.50 by 2024, as COVID headwinds gradually subside and project awards resume to drive profitability.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm joined today by Scott Buckhout, CIRCOR's president and CEO; and Abhi Khandelwal, the company's chief financial officer.\r\nThese expectations are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by today's remarks.\r\nYou can find a full discussion of these factors in CIRCOR's Form 10-K, 10-Qs and other SEC filings also located on our website.\r\n2020 was another transformational year for CIRCOR.\r\nAnd despite the continued challenges presented by COVID-19, our team made significant progress on executing our strategic plan.\r\nI'm proud of the resilience and efforts of the entire CIRCOR team in navigating such a challenging year while continuing to deliver for our customers and shareholders.\r\ns we saw throughout the year, our diversified product portfolio across multiple end markets and geographies helped mitigate the impact of a weaker macro environment.\r\nOur defense business delivered strong results for the year, which mostly offset lower demand for our commercial products.\r\nOur differentiated technology and market positions enabled us to increase prices across the portfolio.\r\nWe executed well throughout this year's downturn and exited the year with positive momentum.\r\nWith the health and safety of our employees as our foundation, we focus on the things we control.\r\nWe achieved decremental margins of 25% for the year through value-based pricing and difficult but necessary cost actions of $45 million.\r\nAerospace and defense improved their margins by 290 basis points despite lower volume.\r\nNotably, aerospace and defense won 20 new programs, including 60 defense and four in commercial.\r\nWe continue to implement the CIRCOR operating system across the company, resulting in improved operational performance.\r\nCIRCOR is well positioned to take advantage of an eventual market recovery in 2021 and beyond.\r\nWith the sale of instrumentation and sampling and distributed valves earlier in the year, our exit from upstream oil and gas is complete.\r\nWe continue to invest in innovation, launching 49 new products in 2020 versus 33 in 2019.\r\nWe delivered on our free cash flow commitments throughout the year and ended with strong free cash flow of $20 million in the fourth quarter.\r\nAnd finally, we reduced our debt by $126 million or 22%.\r\nI want to highlight some new mission-critical technology we introduced in 2020.\r\nOn the defense side, our new missile arming switches are designed to operate in more severe environments with respect to temperature, radiation and G-force.\r\nWe launched self arming switches in support of various missile programs, including hypersonic applications.\r\nOn the commercial side, we introduced a switch, which activates the aircraft's location transmitter in case of an in-flight emergency.\r\nIn industrial, we launched a series of new gas pressure reduction systems to help our customers in Marine, Medical and public utility industries.\r\nThese systems help our customers transport and manage high-pressure industrial gas, LNG and CNG, biomethane fuels and medical oxygen.\r\nNow, I'd like to provide some financial highlights from the fourth quarter.\r\nWe booked orders of $168 million in the quarter, which was flat sequentially and down 25% organically.\r\nSequentially, industrial was up 12% in the quarter.\r\nA&D had lower orders sequentially, down 21% and due to the timing of large naval program orders that pushed into 2021.\r\nRevenue in the quarter was $208 million, up 10% sequentially, driven by strong defense deliveries, mainly on U.S. Naval programs and moderate growth across most end markets in industrial.\r\nAdjusted operating income was $23 million, representing a margin of 11.2%, up 200 basis points from the prior quarter.\r\nMargin improvement was driven by sequential volume recovery, pricing, cost actions and productivity.\r\nAs a result of improved operating income, the company delivered $0.66 of adjusted earnings per share.\r\nFinally, we generated strong free cash flow of $20 million during the fourth quarter, as we exited the year with operational cash flow unencumbered by transformation disbursements.\r\nWe are providing both comparisons due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on our end markets and year-over-year comparison.\r\nStarting with industrial on Slide 4.\r\nIn Q4, industrial segment orders were up 12% sequentially, down 22% organically.\r\nThe industrial segment saw a sequential recovery in all major end markets, driven by opening economies.\r\nRevenue in the quarter was $131 million, up 4% from prior quarter and down 13% organically.\r\nSequential improvement was primarily driven by strength in aftermarket sales across the portfolio.\r\nWe exited the year with an operating margin of 9%, a sequential improvement of 160 basis points, driven by price increases and cost actions taken throughout the year.\r\nLower sales volume continued to drive a lower operating margin versus prior year.\r\nTurning to Slide 5.\r\nOur aerospace and defense segment booked orders of $47 million in the quarter, down 21% sequentially and down 33% versus prior year.\r\nBoth declines are primarily driven by timing of large defense program orders and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our commercial business.\r\nWe remain confident in the segment's growth outlook in 2021.\r\nRevenue in the quarter was $78 million, up 25% from prior quarter.\r\nStrong defense deliveries mostly offset the COVID-19 impact, on commercial Aerospace, resulting in only 3% lower revenues versus by year.\r\nFinally, operating margin was 24% in the quarter, roughly flat sequentially and year over year.\r\nPricing, up 3%, combined with factory and cost actions drove strong margins in line with prior year despite lower revenue.\r\nMoving to Slide 6.\r\nFor Q4, the effective tax rate was approximately 14%.\r\nThe company took a non-cash charge of approximately $15 million to record a valuation allowance against its remaining deferred tax assets in Germany.\r\nThis non-cash charge is acquired under GAAP accounting rules.\r\nThis charge does not impact our non-GAAP after tax results for the quarter and is not expected to have an impact on our future non-GAAP after tax results.\r\nLooking at special items and restructuring charges, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of $13.4 million in the quarter.\r\nThe acquisition-related amortization and depreciation was a charge of $12 million with the remaining charges associated with restructuring activities in the quarter.\r\nInterest expense for the quarter was $8.5 million, down $2.3 million compared to last year as a result of lower debt balances.\r\nOther income was approximately $1 million, primarily driven by pension income.\r\nFinally, corporate costs were $7.8 million in the quarter.\r\nTurning to Slide 7.\r\nAs Scott mentioned previously, our free cash flow was $20 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% compared to 2019.\r\nFree cash flow was positively impacted by improved operating income and lower working capital, particularly inventory.\r\nReducing working capital remains one of our top priorities, and we expect further improvement in 2021.\r\nWe used the proceeds from the sale of our instrumentation and sampling business to reduce our net debt to $443 million, a reduction of $126 million or 22% year over year.\r\nFree cash flow generated in 2021 will be used to further pay down debt and we continue to target leverage ratio of two to two and a half tiems net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\r\nNow, I will hand it back over to Scott to provide some color on our end markets.\r\nLet's start with our industrial outlook on Slide 8.\r\nAs Abhi mentioned, signs of order recovery were evident in the fourth quarter across most major industrial end markets after hitting the bottom in Q3.\r\nGeographically, we continue to see growth in China and India, and we started to see signs of recovery in Europe and North America in the quarter.\r\nDownstream orders were up sequentially, driven by an increase in aftermarket orders, but down significantly ve Please summarize

Power.\r\nThis is the tenth time we have received that honor in the past 12 years, and it is a testament to community awareness of the value of the quality care and experience patients receive at GNP member pharmacies.\r\nWe held our annual Thoughtspot Conference last week, and I was touched and inspired by the stories that our members shared through the entrepreneurship, expertise and deep community roots, community pharmacies prove that they do more than just [draw] prescriptions.\r\nThey are critical promoters of health equity across the U.S., often driving above and beyond to provide holistic care and health education at the local level, particularly in under-resourced communities.\r\nSince beginning of the pandemic, community pharmacies have stepped up fearlessly to meet the unprecedented challenges of a global health crisis and show the world why community pharmacies are integral to our communities.\r\nThe value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer.\r\nAnother relevant example is on the animal side.\r\nThe growth in pet ownership has increased demand for our veterinarian customers as pets are a cherished part of the family and the care a veterinarian provides is valued.\r\nThis positive trend over the last year has long-term benefits for our business as MWI is well positioned with key anchor customers and services.\r\nOn the human health side, access to local trusted expertise care remains vital, particularly for those dealing with complex health challenges that bring them into the care of specialty physician providers.\r\nAs I've said from the onset of the pandemic, we are conscious of the negative impact that restricted measures have on patients when they have less access to screenings and tests that help doctors identify serious health issues.\r\nThis has particularly impacted patients who are used to a doctor or healthcare facility.\r\nBut now our customers have begun to see a normalization in new patient trends.\r\nAnd as a result, patients are more effectively being diagnosed and gaining access to treatment.\r\nThis is a clear positive for patient care.\r\nAs the leading provider of specialty distribution and commercialization services, we will continue to play our role in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access as patients visit volumes continues to normalize.\r\nOur specialty physician services business had strong performance this quarter and continues to differentiate AmerisourceBergen with leading value-added services, such as those through our physician GPOs.\r\nAdditionally, bio centers continue to be a positive for our customers, our business and the healthcare system overall as they provide room for new innovative products to come to market.\r\nThe innovations in CAR T and cell and gene therapies and the potential applications of the new mRNA technology offers the medical community new potential tools in the treatment of serious diseases that previously alluded truly effective care.\r\nAmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support all these innovations through our specialty distribution and manufacturer services offerings.\r\nOur unique ability to provide value-added expertise in conjunction with innovative solutions and quality service enhance our partnerships and grow our business.\r\nWith strong partnerships, relationships and a leading portfolio of solutions to support a wide pipeline of practices and products, AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities provided by global pharmaceutical innovation as we drive growth in our business and help our partners tackle some of the most critical challenges based in healthcare.\r\nWe have a strong foundation in place across our businesses.\r\nAnd in June, we took another significant step forward by closing the Alliance Healthcare transaction and welcoming their talented team to the AmerisourceBergen family.\r\nThe acquisition of Alliance Healthcare is the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions and is a critical component to our future success.\r\nAlliance Healthcare is a strong and diversified pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer services company with leading market positions across an attractive portfolio of both established European markets and high-growth emerging markets.\r\nIn addition to their traditional wholesale business, Alliance Healthcare operates a range of leading higher-margin innovation businesses serving both upstream partners and downstream customers.\r\nThe acquisition of Alliance Healthcare extends our distribution reach built by our market-leading services capabilities and expands on our key differentiators.\r\nSpecifically, AmerisourceBergen's leading portfolio of key anchor customers now includes a long-term relationship with Boots in the U.K. and a network of independent pharmacie Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made.\r\nWe had another very strong quarter, resulting in another raise in our 2021 operating FFO guidance.\r\nWe experienced balanced success across all our disciplines as we continue to refresh our portfolio, tenant mix, liquidity and balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on future earnings growth.\r\nWe closed on several high-quality acquisitions across all three of our strategic investment platforms, bringing our gross acquisition volume to $500 million in 2021.\r\nWe continue to see strong demand for space in our centers and signed a number of key leases with well-capitalized tenants, driving our accelerated signed not opened balance to almost $4 million.\r\nAnd lastly, we raised or received commitments on $670 million of capital from our equity, debt and joint venture partners, strengthening our liquidity profile and balance sheet.\r\nStarting off with our capital-raising efforts.\r\nI am very pleased with GIC's recent commitment of an additional $500 million to our core grocery-anchored R2G platform, positioning that platform to scale up to $1.7 billion.\r\nWe believe this is an endorsement of RPT and our ability to create value.\r\nWe are grateful to be in the company of top-tier REITs, like Ventas, Boston Properties, Equinix and others, that have partnered with GIC.\r\nThe new commitment provides us with the firepower to further accelerate our portfolio transformation while enhancing our management fee income stream.\r\nWe also recently obtained commitments for $130 million in the debt private placement market and received another $40 million through our ATM, demonstrating our ability to access multiple sources of capital to accretively fund our growth plans.\r\nThe size of our portfolio is an advantage as it allows us to rapidly reshape our geographic exposures toward higher-growth and more durable markets like Boston, which is now our third-largest market.\r\nWe also increased our exposure to Atlanta and Tampa while reducing our concentrations in Detroit, Cincy and Chicago.\r\nThis real-time shift in our mix not only improves our geographic diversification but also increases our visibility with retailers, brokers and other stakeholders, which is leading to increased deal flow on both the leasing and acquisition fronts.\r\nTo support our data-driven investment decisions, we have an in-house data scientist who developed a proprietary asset scoring model that combines advanced data analytics with a collective knowledge and experience of our investments, leasing, property management and portfolio management teams.\r\nWith this dynamic tool, we can continually assess our existing and potential future properties in real time to inform our capital allocation decisions.\r\nOur scoring model was a key advantage for us as we underwrote our recent acquisitions and will continue to be used as we assess our future acquisitions and dispositions through the lens of quality, balance sheet and earnings accretion.\r\nRegarding the acquisition environment, we are currently experiencing a very competitive landscape to acquire high-quality shopping centers, where cap rates for grocery-anchored centers in top U.S. metros are down approximately 50 basis points over the past few months.\r\nAs a result, we believe the $500 million of acquisitions that we closed on so far could be up as much as 10% relative to our transacted prices.\r\nDespite the recent cap rate compression, our three investment platforms provide us a competitive advantage to acquire at higher returns, allowing us to remain active on the acquisition front in our target markets.\r\nWe continue to work tirelessly, sourcing additional acquisitions, focusing primarily on off-market, relationship-driven opportunities and expect 2022 to be another active year.\r\nWe continue to see a healthy pipeline of deals for grocery-anchored centers, smaller strips and wealthy infill suburbs in our core communities and larger high-quality centers over $70 million, where we can allocate the real estate between our platforms.\r\nWe also see unique opportunities to acquire value-add or opportunistic centers, where we can utilize our tenant relationships to create significant value after the purchase.\r\nFor example, we are currently under negotiation to buy an asset in the Southeast that has an empty anchor box related to a recent tenant bankruptcy.\r\nWe are in lease negotiation with a premier investment-grade grocer to take that space, which will drive the occupancy to about 99%, resulting in an estimated stabilized yield on cost of 7% in a 5% cap rate market.\r\nOn the other side of the coin, current market demand is also creating opportunities for us to monetize assets at attractive yields in non-core markets.\r\nEarlier this week, we closed on the sale of Market Plaza in the Chicago market for $30 million.\r\nWe received 11 offers and sold the property at a high 5% buyer's cap rate.\r\nChicago is not a market that we are looking to expand in due to the less-than-business-friendly political environment.\r\nWe are also exploring other opportunities to further reduce our exposure to nonstrategic markets and take advantage of the current frothiness in the private markets.\r\nNow turning to operations.\r\nWe continue to drive rent and sign leases with high-credit essential tenancy.\r\nThis quarter, we signed a lease with a new investment-grade grocer at our Crofton Centre in Baltimore, which is replacing a Shoppers Food Warehouse.\r\nIn October, we signed an expansion lease with Publix at The Crossroads in Palm Beach.\r\nThis will be a brand-new flagship prototype store, demonstrating Publix' commitment to the center and cementing the anchor tenancy for years to come.\r\nIn both cases, we locked in strong credit anchors, thereby enhancing the durability of the cash flows at these centers.\r\nWe also signed a new medical tenant, Piedmont Urgent Care, that replaces a sit-down restaurant at Promenade at Pleasant Hill just outside of Atlanta, swapping a high-COVID-risk tenant for an essential tenant at a mid-20% spread to the old brand.\r\nNot only were we able to reduce tenant risk, but we were able to do so at attractive economics.\r\nLastly, we signed a new deal for a Ferguson gallery showroom at Providence Marketplace in the Nashville market.\r\nThis will be Ferguson's first showroom in Nashville, which we think will be a premier destination for residents to access the latest concepts in quality home fixtures and appliances.\r\nWith only five to six Ferguson showroom openings in a typical year, we think this deal is a testament to the strength of our center.\r\nFor those of you that are not familiar with Ferguson, they are a $34 billion market cap, BBB+-rated credit and the largest U.S. distributor of plumbing and second-largest distributor of industrial products.\r\nWe think they will be an attractive regional draw for the property based on the strong demographic match between the center and the Ferguson customer profile.\r\nLooking forward, our leasing team remains active with a solid pipeline of deals lined up for the fourth quarter.\r\nNotably, we are seeing strong demand in Florida, Boston and Detroit, where we are in negotiations on a number of major box deals, ranging from grocer to off-price retail as well as several national small shop deals.\r\nNotably, we have seen a major pickup in demand in Detroit over the past few quarters and are in negotiations on over half a dozen grocery deals and another eight to 10 box leases with discount apparel, pet, outdoor recreation and homegood retailers.\r\nToday, I'll discuss our third quarter results, provide an update on our balance sheet and end with commentary on our increased guidance.\r\nThird quarter operating FFO per share of $0.27 was up $0.05 over last quarter primarily due to about $0.04 of higher NOI from acquisitions, $0.01 from lower rent not probable of collection and about $0.01 from higher lease termination fees, pa Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

environment.\r\nTotal sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.\r\nThe last two weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter.\r\nDuring the quarter, we remain focused on four key priorities.\r\nThe health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in the complex operating environment, deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model.\r\nThe health and safety of our team members and guest has always been our top priority.\r\nWe continue to follow latest guidance from the CDC as well as our own enhanced safety protocols to create a safe environment for everyone.\r\nThis includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring mask for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols.\r\nI'm proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe.\r\nSecond, our restaurant teams remain focused on our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that results in great guest experiences whether our guests are dining with us or ordering curbside to-go.\r\nOur teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it's still not easy.\r\nThat's why we remain committed to our simplified operations, including streamline menus, processes and procedures which continue to strengthen our execution and our guest satisfaction metrics confirm that our restaurant teams are doing a great job delivering exceptional guest experience in this challenging environment.\r\nThird, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience.\r\nOur brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database.\r\nDuring the quarter, Olive Garden LongHorn Steakhouse launched refresh websites and all our brands continue to use their digital storefronts effectively.\r\nMore than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online.\r\nAnd at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital.\r\nDuring the quarter, we also rolled out Curbside I'm Here, which allows our guests to easily notify the restaurant that they've arrived to pick up their curbside to-go order by simply tapping on a link embedded in a text message.\r\nAs a result, our operators are spending less time on the phone and more time focused on ensuring orders are accurate and on-time, which is leading to improved guest satisfaction scores.\r\nWe also introduced Wait List Visibility, allowing guest to see their place on the waiting list using their phone regardless of whether they've checked in online or in person.\r\nAnd we're working on several other initiatives, including streamlining our online checkout process and adding additional mobile payment options to provide even more convenience for our guest.\r\nWe continue to accelerate our digital journey, and I'm encouraged by the progress we are making.\r\nFinally, we continue to view this environment as a rare opportunity to transform our business model for long-term growth.\r\nWe continue to make investments in our team members, product quality and portion sizes to ensure we emerge even stronger and better positioned to grow share.\r\nOlive Garden same-restaurant sales declined 19.9% as capacity restrictions continue to limit their top-line sales.\r\nOlive Garden began November with 56 dining rooms closed, and that number accelerated to 208 by the end of the month.\r\nHowever, they were able to deliver strong average weekly sales during the quarter of more than 73,000 per restaurant, retaining 80% of last year's sales.\r\nOlive Garden also continue to realize operational efficiencies and strengthened margin as a result of their simplified menu and the elimination of promotional activity, including discounts.\r\nIn the current limited capacity environment, their reduced marketing spend was focused on showcasing the convenience of their off-premise experience, while featuring compelling core menu items rather than limited time promotions.\r\nThis led to increased segment profit margin, while making additional investments in abundance and value.\r\nAdditionally, off-premise sales grew 83% in the quarter, representing 39% of total sales.\r\nEnabled by the technology investments I mentioned earlier, Olive Garden improved their to-go experience and achieved another all-time high in guest satisfaction for having orders ready to pick up at the time promised.\r\nFinally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter.\r\nLongHorn Steakhouse had another solid quarter.\r\nSame-restaurant sales declined 11.1%.\r\nAlmost 20% of their restaurants grew same-restaurant sales in the quarter.\r\nThey also successfully opened three new restaurants during the quarter.\r\nThe LongHorn team remains laser focused on their strategy of increasing the quality of their guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement.\r\nDuring the quarter, the team did a great job of managing controllable costs while their simplified menu drove improved labor productivity.\r\nFinally, LongHorn grew off-premise sales by more than 175%, representing 22% of total sales.\r\nFor the second quarter, total sales were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%.\r\nSame-restaurant sales declined 20.6%, EBITDA was $206 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.\r\nOur second quarter start was encouraging with weekly sales building on results from the first quarter.\r\nHowever, as COVID-19 cases began increasing in November and many state and local governments reimposed dining room restrictions, the last two weeks of the quarter trended down significantly.\r\nWe estimate that this downward shift in sales over the last two weeks negatively impacted operating income by approximately $15 million.\r\nTurning to the P&L.\r\nFood and beverage expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and increased to-go packaging.\r\nRestaurant labor was 140 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor improving by over 310 basis points, driven by operational simplification.\r\nThis was partially offset by deleverage and management labor due to sales declines and $3 million of emergency pay net of retention credits as we reinstated our emergency pay program for our team members impacted by dining room closures.\r\nRestaurant expense per operating week was 13% lower than last year, driven by lower repairs, maintenance and utilities expenses.\r\nHowever, sales deleverage resulted in restaurant expense as a percent of sales coming in 170 basis points higher than last year.\r\nWe reduced marketing spend by almost $50 million this quarter with total marketing 210 basis points favorable to last year.\r\nRestaurant level

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.\r\nWe plan to release fiscal 2021 fourth quarter earnings on June 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\r\nIt's hard to believe it's been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business.\r\nWhen I reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty.\r\nOur portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our Back to Basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results oriented culture.\r\nAnd while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger.\r\nOur significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment.\r\nThe depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions.\r\nWe have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators.\r\nOur scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively.\r\nThe robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest.\r\nFinally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of COVID-19.\r\nAs soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models.\r\nAs our Founder Bill Darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our Company has is the quality of our employees, evidenced by the excellent job they do every day.\r\nThroughout this past year, Darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences.\r\nThat is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year.\r\nSince March of 2020, we have invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave, COVID-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed.\r\nThese investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\r\nIn addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today, totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members.\r\nBeginning Monday, every hourly team member, tipped and non-tipped, will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income.\r\nAdditionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in January 2022 and to $12 per hour in January 2023.\r\nThese investments further strengthen our industry-leading employment proposition.\r\nLastly, I continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year.\r\nYou are the heart and soul of our Company and on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you.\r\nAs Gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year.\r\nIn addition to executing our Back to Basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage through this situation by remaining focused on the four key priorities we established at the onset of the pandemic: one, ensuring the health and safety of our team members and guests; two, simplifying operations and strengthening execution; three, deploying technology to improve the guest experience; and four, transforming our business model.\r\nThe health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority.\r\nThroughout the past year, our team members have done a fantastic job of upholding our safety protocols while taking great care of our guests.\r\nToday, even as restrictions are easing in some parts of the country, we continue to follow our enhanced safety measures.\r\nThis includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring masks for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols.\r\nOur second priority has been to continue finding ways to simplify our operations and drive in-restaurant execution at each of our brands.\r\nThis environment gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to evaluate every aspect of how we operate and make decisions we would not have been able to do in a normal operating environment.\r\nA good example of this work all of our brands have done to streamline menus and remove low preference or low satisfaction items.\r\nThis focus makes it easier for our restaurant teams to consistently execute our highest preference items which means we are serving our most popular dishes to more guests.\r\nIn fact, a year ago, the top 10 entrees at Olive Garden accounted for about 48% of guest preference, and today they account for approximately 55%.\r\nReducing the bottom selling items eliminates distractions and allows us to execute at a high level.\r\nWe have dramatically reduced low volume items which reduces the need to prepare them, saving time and reducing food waste.\r\nFor example, at LongHorn Steakhouse, the number of total items with less than 1% preference is down to eight from more than 25 pre-COVID.\r\nThird, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience and build on the progress we have made over the last 12 months.\r\nWhen the pandemic began and our dining rooms were closed, we were able to quickly roll out online ordering at our brands that had yet to deploy it.\r\nWe also streamlined the curbside to-go pickup process by rolling out the Curbside I'm Here text message notification feature so guests can easily alert us when they arrive.\r\nThese technology enhancements and other process improvements helped Olive Garden achieve new all-time high guest satisfaction ratings for delivering on time and accurate off-premise experiences during a quarter that included three busy off-premise days: Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day.\r\nIn fact, Valentine's Day was our highest sales day since the start of the pandemic.\r\nAlso during the quarter, several brands, including Olive Garden LongHorn implemented enhancements to their websites to streamline the online checkout process.\r\nThis resulted in a meaningful reduction in order abandonment rates.\r\nOur continuous digital transformation is resonating with our guests.\r\nIn fact, during the quarter, nearly 19% of total sales were digital transactions.\r\nFurther, 50% of all guest checks were settled digitally, either online or on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay.\r\nWe have made great strides in our digital journey over the past year and we will continue to strengthen our digital platform and provide our brands with the tools to compete more effectively.\r\nAnd finally, the investments we've made to simplify our business through menu and process simplification have resulted in significant transformation of our business model.\r\nFor example, across Darden, our hourly labor productivity has improved by over 20%, with some brands improving by well over 30% such as Cheddar's.\r\nWe thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more insight into what the business model transformation has done to Cheddar's P&L.\r\nYear-to-date through the third quarter, Cheddar's has grow Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Darden reported a decline in total sales and same-restaurant sales for Q3 due to the pandemic's impact. Despite this, the company highlighted its robust business model, driven by significant scale, extensive data, strategic planning, and a results-oriented culture. These advantages enabled Darden to execute its Back to Basics strategy, streamline menus, simplify operations, and deploy technology to improve the guest experience. As a result, hourly labor productivity improved by over 20%, and restaurant-level EBITDA margins increased. Darden's investment in team members included bonuses and hourly wage increases, strengthening its industry-leading employment proposition. Despite the challenges, Darden's financial performance was bolstered by cost reductions and operational simplifications, with restaurant-level EBITDA margin only 150 basis points below last year's figure. The company declared a pre-COVID quarterly dividend and authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Looking ahead, Darden estimates Q4 sales of $2.1 billion and earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates capital spending between $350 million and $400 million, opening 35 new restaurants, and an effective tax rate ranging from 12% to 13%.</s>"}

obligation to update this information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\r\nFinally, today's call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website later today.\r\nAfter restored first half of the year, our team continued on our path toward transformative growth.\r\nAfter having communicated an ambitious second half of 2021 forecast, our third quarter results still managed to exceed our expectations.\r\nThe entire organization has been energized to see the durability of our business model as we produce strong financial results and risk adjusted portfolio returns.\r\nOur GAAP earnings were $0.65 per diluted share for the third quarter, and our GAAP book value increased 4.7% in the quarter to $12 per share at September 30th.\r\nThis contributes to an overall year-to-date increase in our GAAP book value of 21% despite having raised our dividend each quarter of the year thus far.\r\nWhen combined our GAAP book value growth in dividends paid resulted in a 27% economic return to shareholders year-to-date.\r\nOperationally speaking, you'll hear more from Dash and Brooke on our third quarter results.\r\nBut suffice it to say it was a very strong quarter, several in-house records broken.\r\nI'm particularly proud of a series of strategic and innovative transactions across our firm that were both accretive to earnings and foundational for future operating progress.\r\nThis included the first private label RMBS securitization to leverage blockchain technology, completed in collaboration with liquid mortgage and early horizons investment partner.\r\nWe also completed our first ever bridge loan securitization through our BPL platform, which provides a meaningful new distribution alternative to us.\r\nNext, our investment portfolio team co-sponsored the first ever securitization backed entirely by residential home equity investments.\r\nFinally, these deals are rounded out by six new venture investments by RWT Horizons in the third quarter.\r\nI'm also pleased that after following strict health and safety protocols, we're able to successfully host our third Investor Day in September, the first since the onset of the pandemic.\r\nDuring the event, we affirmed our commitment to our corporate mission to make quality housing, whether rented or owned accessible to all American households.\r\nWe also unveiled a much bolder strategic vision, become the leading operator and strategic capital provider driving sustainable innovation and housing finance.\r\nAs we showed in New York, opportunities for transformative scale are clear and now attainable, based on the strategic progress we've made in recent years.\r\nOur vision is built upon an immense multi-trillion dollar addressable market that transcends the traditional mortgage lending space.\r\nWe're already attacking antiquated processes in our markets with technology enabled solutions, and over time, we plan to completely reimagine how the non-agency housing finance market works.\r\nAcross the Redwood enterprise, we've cultivated a talented and engaged workforce that as you might expect, believes in our mission, and is inspired to innovate and help us realize our strategic vision and goals.\r\nOur role is not a typical one for REIT, much less one, one of the longest tenured publicly traded REITs in the country.\r\nBut that should not come as a surprise as we never defined our business by way of our Federal tax election.\r\nThose who do, risk missing the growth potential of our platform, particularly as we continue to analyze our optimal long-term corporate structure.\r\nRun into bend toward the end of the year, we remain very optimistic about our business, but we are proceeding cautiously.\r\nWe see several macro and market risks ahead, COVID-19 variants, rising inflation, Central Bank tapering, and Federal debt ceiling stripe to name a few.\r\nMore fundamentally, recent trends and unemployment claims suggest that we're still in a recovery phase, and the current economic situation is far from stable, notwithstanding the consistent upward pressure on home prices and rents that we've all observed in recent quarters.\r\nOur interest rate capital and broader risk management posture reflects this view.\r\nWhile we've generated strong earnings thus far this year, we've done so with record amounts of cash on hand, putting $557 million at September 30.\r\nGoing forward, our stakeholders should expect that we will continue to work to fulfill our broadly conceived mission focused on the significant addressable market in front of us and run a business grounded in fundamentals and sound analysis.\r\nAll while nurturing and diverse and talented bench team members were engaged and aligned with our values.\r\nAs Chris describe, the third quarter was another prolific one across our platform with increases in purchase and origination volumes complemented by innovative work across technology and capital markets.\r\nOur teams are operating at a highly productive and sustainable level, as the foundation we have laid drives efficiency gains and demand for our products remains robust.\r\nNotwithstanding the recent uptick in benchmark rates, excess capital in the market is still in search of yield.\r\nWe remain the partner of choice for whole loan and securities investors alike and continue to expand our distribution channels creatively to our capital efficiency and bottom line.\r\nOur third quarter results reflect continued execution of the strategic goals we laid out at the beginning of the year.\r\nAs Chris referenced, we are seeing meaningful progress in a number of the initiatives that we presented at our recent Investor Day, both organically and through new investments and partnerships already bearing fruit.\r\nIn this vein, we strive to innovate daily in addressing the issues facing the housing market, but also look to take advantage of our strategic positioning in the markets we serve, to continue to grow profitably and sustainably.\r\nOur progress also underscores important realities about housing affordability and accessibility, themes we focused on at Investor day.\r\nHousing finance needs more creative solutions, driven by technology, a common sense approach to underwriting and most importantly, leadership and bringing market constituents together in pursuit of common goals.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we took important steps in this direction.\r\nOur results reinforce this broader backdrop and the opportunity across our platforms to continue serving growing areas in housing.\r\nAnd the recent path of home prices, coupled with the evolution in consumer demand and important trends in industry regulation has created ample room for other creative solutions to help consumers monetize equity in their homes.\r\nOur third quarter results represent another step in the path toward transformative growth that we laid out at Investor Day, with our core operating businesses leading the way and notable strategic progress across the enterprise.\r\nThe durability and diversification of our business model, coupled with our crisp execution and technological innovation, puts us in a unique position to drive change that benefits all stakeholders.\r\nWith this in mind, it's important to unpack the key drivers of profitability across our platforms.\r\nOur residential business continued executing in the third quarter, and we believe is well positioned heading into year end, facing several market headwinds, including renewed inflation fears and meaningful rate volatility.\r\nThe team drove margins and volumes higher and once  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n These statements are based on management's expectations, plans, and estimates of our prospects.\r\nToday's statements may be time sensitive and accurate only as of today's date, Thursday, February 13, 2020.\r\nWe assume no obligation to update our statements or the other information we provide.\r\nAlso on the call today are Jojo Yap, our Chief Investment Officer; Peter Schultz, Executive Vice President; Chris Schneider, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Bob Walter, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Asset Management.\r\nWe finished 2019 with an excellent fourth quarter to cap up another successful year.\r\nFor 2020, we expect more of the same, leveraging our platform to generate more cash flow growth and value creation.\r\nOccupancy at year end was a very strong 97.6% and full year cash rental rate growth was 13.9%, a Company record.\r\nBoth of these metrics reflect continued strong tenant demand for logistics space, and the great work of our leasing and operations professionals.\r\nWe developed a number of high quality facilities at strong margins, and replenished our pipeline with the acquisition of several exciting new sites and target markets, particularly Miami.\r\nIn addition, we continue to shape our portfolio to drive long-term growth as we further increase our capital allocation to higher barrier markets.\r\nBefore we get into the specifics of the quarter, let me provide you with a quick overview of the national industrial market.\r\nAccording to CBRE Econometric Advisors, new supply for 2019 was 224 million square feet compared to net absorption of 183 million.\r\nThis marks the first time since 2009 that new supply exceeded net absorption.\r\nDespite this, our outlook for 2020 is similar to that of 2019.\r\nVacancies remain low and excess new construction continues to be concentrated primarily in larger format buildings in certain sub-markets, most notably Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston.\r\nWe continue to see new tenant requirements from a range of industries across all of our markets.\r\nSo the overall environment remains very favorable for strong demand and rent growth.\r\nThat's also the case for our portfolio.\r\nWe've signed leases for approximately 60% of our 2020 rollovers at a cash rental rate increase of more than 9%.\r\nIncluded in these results is the long-term renewal of our largest rollover, a 675,000 square foot single tenant building in Central Pennsylvania.\r\nOur expirations for the balance of 2020 are fairly granular.\r\nFor the full year, we expect cash rental rate growth of approximately 10% to 14% on our new and renewal leasing.\r\nTurning now to a few highlights from our development program.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, we placed in-service seven developments totaling 2.1 million square feet with a total investment of $165 million.\r\nIncluded in this total is our 556,000 square footer at First Aurora Commerce Center in Denver.\r\nAs evidence of the strength of this market, we signed a long-term lease for 100% of the space, which commenced shortly after completion of construction.\r\nIn total for 2019, we placed in service 13 buildings totaling 4.4 million square feet with an estimated investment of $325 million.\r\nThese assets are 91% leased with an estimated cash yield of 6.7%.\r\nThis represents an expected margin of 42% to 52%.\r\nAt the mid-point, that would translate to a little over $1 per share in NAV accretion.\r\nAt year end, our pipeline of completed developments in lease-up and under construction totaled 3 million square feet with a total estimated investment of $277 million and a projected cash yield of 6.9%.\r\nThey are 36% leased and have an expected margin of approximately 40% to 50%.\r\nThis pipeline includes a few new starts in the fourth quarter on both Coast and in Dallas.\r\nStarting on the West Coast, First Redwood Logistics Center II is a 72,000 square foot building in the Inland Empire West, with an estimated total investment of $12.6 million.\r\nCompletion is set for the third quarter with a cash yield of 5.2%.\r\nIn Los Angeles, one mile north of the Port of Long Beach, we acquired a 1.8 acre site for $6 million.\r\nIt's leased as a surface lot with an in-place yield of 5.4%.\r\nIn Northwest Dallas, we broke ground on our 435,000 square foot multi-tenant building at Phase 2 of our First Park 121 with an estimated investment of $31.2 million and a targeted cash yield of 6.7%.\r\nThis building is 77% pre-leased.\r\nWe expect to complete this development in Q3.\r\nMoving across the country to South Florida, we've been very active in expanding our development pipeline there.\r\nWe broke ground on our First Cypress Creek Commerce Center, a three building park totaling 374,000 square feet on land for which we have a 50-year ground lease.\r\nOur estimated total investment for the building is $35.6 million, with a targeted cash yield of 7.1% and completion is slated for Q4.\r\nWe also acquired seven acres of land and broke ground on First Sawgrass Commerce Center, a 104,000 square footer in Broward County, estimated investment is $15.3 million, with a targeted yield of 5.8%, completion is expected in Q3.\r\nOn our last call, we discussed our 19.6 acre covered land investment in South Florida for $19.8 million.\r\nRecall this site has three below market ground leases that are currently yielding 3.5%.\r\nWe also added another 9 acre site in the Miami market for $8.6 million on which we can develop 131,000 square feet.\r\nThus far, in the first quarter of 2020, we're very pleased to announce the acquisition of a new land site we call First Park Miami.\r\nWe acquired 63 developable acres in Medley, a great infill location where land is difficult to come by.\r\nOur acquisition price was $48.9 million and we can build 1.2 million square feet in total on the site.\r\nWe will begin the first phase of development this summer, with three multi-tenant buildings totaling approximately 600,000 square feet.\r\nTotal estimated investment for these three buildings is approximately $90 million reflecting land, pre-development and construction costs.\r\nOur target stabilized yield is in the mid-5s.\r\nFor the year, building acquisitions totaled 542,000 square feet for $67 million with an expected stabilized cap rate of 5.4%.\r\nSo far in the first quarter of 2020, we've acquired our first building in the East Bay market of Northern California.\r\nThe property is a 23,000 square footer in the I-880 Hayward submarket, purchase price was $4.9 million, and our expected yield is 5.3%.\r\nWe completed $155 million of sales in the fourth quarter, comprising 3.6 million square feet and one land parcel.\r\nThese sales were consistent with our ongoing portfolio management efforts that support better long-term cash flow growth.\r\nWith these sales, our market footprint has significantly changed.\r\nThe largest portion of these dispositions came from the sale of substantially all of our Indianapolis portfolio which totaled $98 million and 2.7 million square feet.\r\nOther notable sales included two buildings in St. Louis totaling $13 million and 245,000 square feet.\r\nWith just one building remaining in each of these markets, we've moved those properties to the other category in the portfolio reporting section of our supplemental.\r\nThus far, in the first quarter, we sold 226,000 square feet in Tampa for $26.5 million.\r\nWith this sale, we've now effectively exited the Tampa market with just leased land remaining there.\r\nOur efforts in Florida are now focused in the South Florida and Orlando markets.\r\nGiven the leasing progress and rollover status of our portfolios in each of these three markets, we felt the time was right to further simplify our market exposure and redeploy these proceeds into higher rental growth opportunities.\r\nFor 2019, dispositions totaled $261 million and comprised 5.2 million square feet and four land parcels.\r\nThese figures exclude the sale on Phoenix recognized for accounting purposes in the third quarter of

section of our website.\r\nIn order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.\r\nAny non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.\r\nErica will review the business segment and corporate financial details.\r\nAt this time last year.\r\nI talked about being prepared to win as the recovery takes hold and I think 2021 is evidence that we were prepared.\r\nFiscal 2021 was a remarkable year for Cabot as the business recovered from the 2020 COVID lows to deliver record results.\r\nWe accomplished this through a combination of extraordinary execution and our commitment to driving growth through differentiated investments.\r\nI would like to spend a little time now recapping the accomplishments of the year.\r\nThe Cabot operating model is built on the foundations of commercial and operational excellence and our strength in these disciplines drove our outstanding results in fiscal year 2021.\r\nWe delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and total segment EBIT of $550 million.\r\nAnd our focus on cash, resulted in a record discretionary free cash flow of $353 million.\r\nThe macro environment in 2021 required resilience and agility and I'm very proud of the Cabot team in how they work tirelessly to support our customers' evolving needs.\r\nServing our customers and innovating to grow with them is what motivates our team.\r\nThis was made more challenging in 2021 given the myriad global supply chain disruptions that companies face and the fact that necessary COVID safety protocols continue to evolve and adjust our normal ways of working.\r\nAdditionally, companies experienced sharply rising input costs, which required dynamic commercial management.\r\nOur teams worked closely with our customers to manage through this environment and we were successful in our pricing efforts to ensure our margins remained robust and we could invest to support our customers long-term supply needs.\r\nFiscal year 2021 mark the sixth year of our advancing the core strategy and I'm very pleased with our record of execution and the growth prospects for our company.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% since the inception of our strategy, ahead of our 7% to 10% target.\r\nA growth focus built around our core segments and disciplined execution have been the hallmarks of our approach.\r\nAs pleased as we are with the results since 2015, I'm even more excited about the growth opportunities that lie in front of us and the progress we made in 2021.\r\nOur growth strategy is built on a philosophy of investing from positions of strength and where we have what we call a right to win.\r\nA few highlights from 2021 are particularly noteworthy.\r\nOur unmatched portfolio of conductive carbon additives in our strong customer focus model resulted in a doubling of revenue in our battery materials business year-over-year.\r\nWe are progressing with the specialty carbons conversion of our plants in Xuzhou, China and this investment will provide growth across our broad range of specialty carbon applications and will free up additional capacity to support battery materials.\r\nOur inkjet business is well positioned to capitalize on the shift in the commercial and packaging segments from analog to digital printing and we achieved multiple OEM qualifications in 2021 that set us up well for growth as inkjet presses penetrate these markets.\r\nAnd finally, we continue to the execution of a project to build a specialty compounds production line in Cilegon, Indonesia, which will allow us to meet customer demand for black masterbatch in this high growth region.\r\nWhile growth and execution are highlights from 2021, these accomplishments have been achieved with sustainability at the core.\r\nWe continued our sustainability journey in 2021 with several noteworthy accomplishments.\r\nFirst and foremost, we committed to align our disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosure or TCFD and we engaged a third party to help us evaluate climate risks and opportunities following the TCFD guidelines.\r\nWe intend to share the results of this work in the coming months.\r\nWhile the operating rhythm of 2021 was challenging, I'm very proud of our performance in employee safety.\r\nOur total recordable incident rates of 0.34 keeps us firmly in the upper echelon of chemical and industrial companies.\r\nWe also completed a major air emissions control project at our carbon black manufacturing facility located in Louisiana.\r\nThis investment in control technology will result in improved air quality through the substantial elimination of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions and will ensure that we can support our customer supply needs in a sustainable fashion over the long term.\r\nIn addition, waste heat from the plant is being recovered and used to generate up to 50MW of cogen power without creating any additional emissions.\r\nIn August, we announced a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that has pricing that is based on the company's credit ratings, as well as our performance against annual intensity reduction targets for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.\r\nThe transaction reinforces our commitment to sustainability and was one of the first sustainability-linked revolving credit agreements in the U.S. chemical industry.\r\nLastly, as a chemical industry, we need to attract the next generation of talented and diverse candidates into our field of chemistry.\r\nIn support of this aim, Cabot is taking part in an industry effort to support the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative or FOSSI, which focuses on creating pathways for students at historically black colleges and universities to enter and succeed in STEM careers within the chemical industry.\r\nThis initiative will have a lasting and transformational impact on the students and our industry and we are proud to be an inaugural sponsor.\r\nOverall, we had a very successful 2021 in terms of financial performance and progress against our strategic objectives.\r\nThis well-rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team.\r\nNow a few comments on the fourth quarter.\r\nI am pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.11.\r\nThis performance was 63% above the same quarter last year despite the effects of the semiconductor chip shortage and ongoing global supply chain disruptions, as well as a higher level of maintenance spending due to the timing of turnarounds.\r\nWe also continue the momentum of battery materials and ended the year with EBITDA in our previously communicated range of $15 million to $20 million.\r\nCash flow from operations was strong at $100 million in the quarter despite the impact of higher raw material prices.\r\nI will start with discussing results in the Reinforcement Materials segment.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021, EBIT for Reinforcement Materials increased by $8 million and $167 million respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.\r\nThe increases were principally due to higher unit margins and higher volumes.\r\nHigher margins were driven by higher spot pricing, particularly in Asia.\r\nThe higher volumes in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021 were due to a strong recovery in all regions from the COVID related impacts in fiscal 2020.\r\nThe fourth quarter results were also impacted by higher costs associated with the plant maintenance.\r\nGlobally, volumes were up 6% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period of the prior year due to 6% growth in the Americas, 5% increase in Europe and up 7% in Asia.\r\nHigher volumes were driven by strong demand in all reg Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

include, but are not limited to, the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, and the level of consumer spending, the company's ability to capitalize on opportunities or grow its market share, and numerous other factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nI'm very proud of the extraordinary achievements of our team in fiscal 2021; record revenue of more than $2 billion record gross margin of over 30%, record earnings per share, all while achieving record net promoter customer satisfaction scores.\r\nGiven the extremely lean inventory and well documented supply chain issues, this is a great achievement in 2021.\r\nToday, I'd like to share highlights from our fourth quarter and full year, followed by a discussion of the results of our strategic growth plan, which will continue to create shareholder value in 2022 and beyond.\r\nThen, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide color on our 2022 financial outlook.\r\nLet me start by touching on our fourth quarter and full year performance.\r\nFor the quarter, we generated 16% revenue growth, record gross margin of almost 38%, and record earnings per share of $1.45.\r\nI'm extremely pleased that our strategic acquisitions are exceeding expectations and diversifying our model resulting in robust margins and earnings growth.\r\nOur same-store sales for the quarter were down 7% versus 33% growth a year ago.\r\nAs supply chain challenges and lean inventory environment worsened and impacted us as we move through the later part of the quarter.\r\nHowever, demand remained strong and we see no softening as consumers are still actively seeking the boating lifestyle.\r\nThis strong demand environment is highlighted by our customer deposits, which jumped more than 3 times last year's level to over 100 million.\r\nLast year was elevated with increased demand, so this increase, this year, is a significant sign of strong and growing demand.\r\nFor the full-year, same-store sales growth was over 13%, on top of 25% a year ago.\r\nOur significant geographic and product diversification along with the effective utilization of our digital platform are driving profitability and growth.\r\nThe marine industry is continuing to experience an influx of new boaters.\r\nGiven our scale, and global presence, we are benefiting from our growing share of the market.\r\nAnd based on available industry data, we believe we continue to gain market share.\r\nFrom a cadence perspective, the supply chain headwinds deteriorated as we moved through the quarter.\r\nI want to emphasize that we are not seeing a demand issue, rather the timing of shipments is impacting our ability to fulfill some customer orders and therefore recognize revenue.\r\nSimply put, if we had the boats, they would be delivered and we'd have even higher revenue.\r\nWe are working closely with our manufacturing partners to satisfy the strong demand.\r\nBut as many experts in the industry are forecasting it, we'll likely not improve materially until later in fiscal 2022.\r\nIt's a unique environment and one that is challenging to predict, but our team will continue to perform.\r\nI also want to underscore our strategic growth plan, and how it is not only driving market share and revenue growth, but expanding company wide margins.\r\nThis quarter, we increased our operating margin by 130 basis points over last year's record to 9.5%.\r\nWe also finished the fiscal year with an operating margin increase of more than 300 basis points to over 10%.\r\nThis performance is directly attributable to our ability to execute our strategy, focusing on higher gross margin businesses, including charter, finance, insurance, marina, storage, parts, service and brokerage.\r\nThe gross margin strength we produced in the first nine months of the year accelerated in the September quarter.\r\nAdditionally, as we integrate our acquisitions, they continue to outperform and are aligned with our strategy of attributing to MarineMax's record margin expansion.\r\nSpecifically, each company we have acquired has outperformed their best year, or is on pace to outperform their best year.\r\nEarlier this month, we shared that we have entered into an agreement to buy Intrepid Powerboats.\r\nMany of you know that Intrepid is an iconic brand led by one of the best management teams in the industry.\r\nWe are very excited about having Ken Clinton and the Intrepid team join the MarineMax family.\r\nWe plan to support them with their innovative plans, provide them capital, and arm them with the tools to better serve the Intrepid nation.\r\nNow, let me discuss our confidence we have that our strategy will continue to create sustained growth and long-term shareholder value in 2022 and beyond.\r\nWe continue to make significant progress on our vision of creating exceptional customer experiences through best services, products, and technology.\r\nOur team remains focused on these initiatives, resulting in strong demand and margin.\r\nWe will accomplish this through our global market presence, premium brand, valuable real estate locations, exceptional customer service, technology investments, strategic acquisitions, industry-leading inventory management, and finally, a continued commitment to build on our strong company culture.\r\nSupported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, we will continue to make strategic accretive acquisitions in a disciplined manner.\r\nThe combination of being well capitalized and having a broad global geographic presence, has allowed, and will allow us to grow in many ways by adding additional dealers, marinas, storage, service related offerings, manufacturing an asset-light business such as our superyacht services business.\r\nWe continue to have strong demand and are ready to keep serving our loyal customers.\r\nAs supply constraints are resolved by manufacturers, we expect to ramp sales in the future.\r\nOur scale continues to be a competitive advantage as we leverage our deep manufacturing relationships, our nationwide shared inventory, and our strong balance sheet to support the growing demand.\r\nWe believe the combination of driving operating leverage and generating significant cash flow, coupled with strong consumer demand, will result in sustained growth well into fiscal 2022 and beyond.\r\nAnd with that update, I will ask Mike to provide more detailed comments on the quarter.\r\nFor the quarter, revenue grew 16% to over $462 million, even with the lean inventory environment, as we benefited from the accretive acquisitions we completed during the year.\r\nOverall, our growth has been demand driven across generally all segments of products and across every global market.\r\nWe expected inventory to remain low through the quarter, but with the increased supply chain challenges, retail deliveries grew more challenging, which impacted revenue in excess of 50 million.\r\nThis led to decline in same-store sales growth.\r\nOur units declined in the quarter, double digits, while our average unit selling price continued to expand.\r\nHowever, with increasingly strong customer deposit visibility, coupled with our broad product portfolio and production insight from our manufacturing partners, we believe we are better positioned than most in our industry, resulting in market share gains in all our major segments.\r\nGross profit dollars increased over $58 million, while our gross margin rose 860 basis points to almost 38%.\r\nOur initiatives to drive margin growth over the last several years continue to generate solid results.\r\nMargins rose with contributions from multiple segments and businesses, including new and used boats, storage, parts and service, higher margin, finance, insurance, and brokerage businesses, as well as our global superyacht services businesses Northrop & Johnson and Fraser Yachts.\r\nAs expected, with Europe reopening, we did se Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n These types of statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those described in MFA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other reports that it may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nLittle did I know that I would have to compete for airtime with Chairman Powell who is testifying in the Senate at 10:00 AM.\r\nI apologize for those of you who drew the short straw and get stuck on our call.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to give a shout out to our entire MFA team.\r\nThe last three months have obviously been extremely challenging and made exponentially more so by the fact that all of our efforts have been remote.\r\nThe Company fully implemented our business continuity plan during the third week of March and successfully completely transitioned to our remote work environment to address the operating risks associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nThe effort and commitment displayed by our entire team over the last three months has been extraordinary and I've been humbled by their dedication.\r\nBefore we discuss the first quarter of 2020 financial results, which frankly at this point seems like ancient history, I'd like to spend some time discussing what other important work streams have been taking place at MFA since March 23 and I think it will be obvious why we've been silent on so many of these activities.\r\nThese critical efforts have been comprised primarily of three things.\r\nOne, forbearance; two, balance sheet and liquidity management; and three, sourcing third-party capital.\r\nAs arduous that these forbearance agreements have been to negotiate and operate through, they have provided us with the time to manage our balance sheet and liquidity while also working to source third-party capital and we are grateful to our lending counterparties that stuck with us through three versions of forbearance plans.\r\nDuring April and May, we significantly reduced our balance sheet in an effort to raise liquidity and delever.\r\nImportantly, because we entered into these forbearance plans, we were able to manage our balance sheet in a more judicious fashion, given the time allowed through forbearance.\r\nMany of our asset sales, particularly on mortgage-backed securities, were at prices significantly higher than the price levels that existed in late-March.\r\nOur sales during the month of April alone of legacy non-agencies, CRTs, and MSR-related assets generated over $150 million of realized gains versus March 31 marks.\r\nNow, while still down significantly from values at the end of February, the patience permitted through forbearance enabled us to work hard to lessen book value erosion.\r\nWe were also able to manage the sale of a large non-QM whole loan portfolio that traded in late-April and closed in mid-May.\r\nWhile we realized a significant loss on the sale, we are confident that we achieved a much better execution by controlling and managing the trade than we would have realized had the lender just liquidated the pool.\r\nIn the end, all of our lenders will have been fully repaid with no deficiencies, which is another of the design goals of the forbearance plan.\r\nIt was clear to us in late March that our situation was not due to bad assets, but the fragile funding and the path forward would require more durable forms of financing.\r\nWe also recognize that term financing, margin holiday and/or non-mark-to-market financing would necessarily require higher haircuts and therefore more capital.\r\nOur method for seeking third-party capital began somewhat passively during the last week of March with fielding incoming indications of interest.\r\nAs this process intensified with more and more parties together with negotiating NDAs and then responding to voluminous data requests, all the while with our hair on fire negotiating a forbearance agreement while managing our balance sheet and liquidity and we engaged Houlihan Lokey at the end of March to manage this process for us.\r\nInitial indications of interest from a number of capital providers came back in mid-April, but as we continue to delever and raise liquidity, it became evident that our third-party capital needs have already changed.\r\nWe extended our initial forbearance agreement at the end of April to June 1 and as we entered May, we began to obtain better price discovery, particularly on our loan portfolio, which gave us more clarity as to our path forward.\r\nWe started a second round of proposals from third-party capital providers in mid-May.\r\nAnd as we held due diligence and informational calls with many of these institutions, we found that there was a competitive dynamic at work and a keen interest in pursuing a transaction with MFA.\r\nWe signed a term sheet over Memorial Day weekend and have been working since to negotiate and document this agreement.\r\nFor obvious reasons, we could not communicate publicly about these activities and it was frustrating not to be able to provide the public disclosure and transparency on which we pride ourselves.\r\nWe signed these agreements last night and we're happy to announce today that we have entered into an agreement with Apollo and Athene, an insurance company affiliate of Apollo, to raise $500 million in the form of a senior secured note.\r\nBut this $500 million note is only part of a holistic solution for MFA and a very strategic partnership with Apollo and Athene.\r\nApollo and Athene together have arranged a committed term borrowing facility with Barclays of approximately $1.65 billion that includes over $500 million for participation from Athene.\r\nThis term non-mark-to-market facility will provide us with durable financing for a large portion of our loan portfolio.\r\nIn addition, Athene has committed to purchase, subject to certain pricing conditions, a portion of our first securitization of non-QM loans.\r\nAnd finally, Apollo and Athene are engaged with another of our lenders to structure an additional similar lending facility for our fix and flip portfolio in which Athene also intends to participate.\r\nPro forma for these facilities, approximately 60% of the Company's financing will be in the form of non-mark-to-market funding, providing shareholders with significant downside protection in the event of future market volatility.\r\nWe expect that upon closing and funding of these transactions, we'll be able to satisfy remaining margin calls, which were only $32 million as of June 12 and exit from the current forbearance agreement on or before June 26.\r\nWe also anticipate using some of the proceeds to pay accumulated unpaid dividends on our Series B and C preferred stock issues.\r\nAnd finally, we expect that this transaction will provide us with substantial capital to once again begin to pursue attractive investment opportunities.\r\nAs part of this transaction, Apollo and Athene will receive warrants to purchase MFA common stock at varying prices over a five-year period and will appoint a non-voting observer to our Board of Directors.\r\nApollo and Athene have also committed to purchase the lesser of 4.9% or $50 million of MFA stock in the open market over the next 12 months.\r\nWe are extremely excited about this transaction, which we consider to be much more than a capital raise and very much a strategic alliance.\r\nMoving on to the financial results for the first quarter of 2020.\r\nAs others have described before us, the first quarter of 2020 was literally a tale of two distinct and utterly different periods in time.\r\nJanuary, February and the first two weeks of March were very normal and a good start to the new year.\r\nAnd in only a few days, the financial markets and the mortgage market in particular completely collapsed.\r\nWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, pricing dislocations for markets and residential mortgage assets was so extreme that liquidity evaporated.\r\nPrices of legacy non-agencies, which had not changed by more than 3 points in the last two to thr Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable -- attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. is included in today's release.\r\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter.\r\nThe results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins.\r\nRevenues grew over $1.1 billion, or 8.7% as compared to the prior year.\r\nThis growth was generated by highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in March.\r\nGenerally speaking, March trends are continuing into April.\r\nInpatient revenues increased by 12%.\r\nThe acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both the case mix index, which increased 7% and length of stay which grew by 6%.\r\nAdditionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits, compared to 26.5% last year.\r\nThe commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past four quarters.\r\nThese two factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admissions.\r\nThe total -- the total admits were down 4.2% year over year.\r\nIn comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%, which was -- which was in line with our expectations.\r\nIn the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total admissions.\r\nThroughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined.\r\nJanuary with 17%, February was 8%, and March was down to almost 5%.\r\nOutpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to the prior year.\r\nThis result is better performance than the previous two quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%.\r\nOutpatient revenues declined in January and February, consistent with that trend.\r\nBut March, which had one additional weekday this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly.\r\nSame facility outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year.\r\nAs compared to 2019, they declined 3%.\r\nE.R. visits declined 18%.\r\nThis decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the previous two quarters.\r\nvisits were down 19% compared to 2019.\r\nOur teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda.\r\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter.\r\nDiluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales as well as losses on debt retirement, increase 78% to $4.14.\r\nDuring the quarter, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home health and hospitals business of Brookdale Senior Living.\r\nThis business provides us with a large platform that complements our local provider systems.\r\nIt will expand the services we offer across our networks and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their experiences.\r\nAdditionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for healthcare in the future with continuing growth and demand.\r\nWe anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter and we look forward to our new partnership with Brookdale.\r\nAlso during the quarter, we opened two new hospitals.\r\nOne in Denver and one in Orlando.\r\nEach of these hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities.\r\nIn the second quarter, we expect to close on the acquisitions of two small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and Savannah.\r\nAnd lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access, and value for patients by developing more outpatient facilities.\r\nThe pipeline for development and acquisition in this category remains strong.\r\nAs we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors.\r\nMainly, governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets including uninsured assumptions.\r\nBill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments.\r\nThe first corps is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by our teams were on display.\r\nWe could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our patients and the communities we serve.\r\nAs we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda, we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all our stakeholders.\r\nSam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results so I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter and then review our updated 2021 guidance.\r\nAs a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020.\r\nCapital spending for the quarter was $654 million and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter.\r\nWe have approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization and consistent with our year-end discussion.\r\nWe are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021 subject to market conditions.\r\nOur debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85 times and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.\r\nWe expect revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion.\r\nWe expect full-year EBITDA to range between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion.\r\nWe expect full-year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30 and $14.30.\r\nAnd our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion.\r\nOur revised guidance considers the strong results in the first quarter, and also considers the extension of the public health emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year.\r\nIn summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the balance of the year, but we are confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles and we are well-positioned to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if they become available.\r\nPlease remind everyone to limit their questions to one so that we may keep trying and get in the queue as possible.\r\n Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences. Keep the summary below 300 words. It is very important that you do not use any titles in the summary. Include relevant information and statistics from the Earnings Call Transcript in your summary.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website.\r\nWe'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call.\r\nThis cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nWe also have other company representatives available to help answer any questions you may have after Steve, Lisa and Darrel provide updates.\r\nOn Slide 4, we present our quarterly and annual financial results.\r\nIDACORP's 2019 fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of $0.41 per share over last year's fourth quarter.\r\nIDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the full-year 2019 were $4.61, an increase of $0.12 per share over 2018.\r\nThese full-year results represent the 12th straight year of earnings growth for IDACORP and are the highest achieved in its history.\r\nIDACORP's cumulative average growth rate in diluted earnings per share is 7.9% since 2007.\r\nToday, we also initiated our full-year 2020 IDACORP earnings guidance estimate to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize any of the tax credits in 2020 that are available to support earnings in Idaho under its settlement stipulation with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.\r\nLast week, we announced that after 24 years with the company that I would retire effective June 1 of this year.\r\nIn connection with this decision, our board of directors selected Lisa Grow to succeed me as president and CEO of IDACORP and Idaho Power effective June 1 and also appointed her to the boards of directors of both companies effective last week.\r\nShe's an electrical engineer by training and she's got over 32 years of experience at Idaho Power.\r\nNot only does she have a long tenure at the company, she also has a long history with Idaho Power as her grandfather was a lineman with the company for 30 years prior to Lisa joining the company.\r\nShe has contributed significantly to the operational and financial success of Idaho Power since becoming an officer in 2005.\r\nShe has earned the opportunity to take over the reins as we move forward into 2020 and beyond.\r\nI look forward to continuing to serve as a member of the board of directors once I step away from my executive roles.\r\nWith that short introduction, I will now turn the time over to Lisa for some updates on the company, as well as ongoing economic activities.\r\nI am honored by the opportunity to succeed you, and I look forward to the exciting times ahead.\r\nIn addition to the financial success noted by Justin, Idaho Power set records across several of our important metrics: safety, customer satisfaction and reliability.\r\nOn Slide 5, we see details of the company's record employee safety results in 2019.\r\nWe are very excited and proud to see injuries at an all-time low as we continue to spend significant time on our safety culture and to emphasize the importance of safety at work and at home.\r\nOur record-setting results in residential and business customer satisfaction are shown on Slide 6.\r\nAs the population within our service area continues to grow, Idaho Power is working hard to meet our customers' evolving needs.\r\nMost Idaho Power customers experienced -- most Idaho customers experienced an overall price decrease for the second consecutive year in 2019 with business customers' rates going down by at least 5%.\r\nIdaho Power's efforts to keep prices affordable, provide personal service and improve the customer experience are paying off as overall customer satisfaction metrics continue to rank near the top of the list among our peer utilities.\r\nReliability is a key piece of the customer satisfaction puzzle and is also included on Slide 6, which shows another outstanding year.\r\nIdaho Power kept customers' lights on 99.975% of the time in 2019, and overall system reliability was among the best in company history, finishing very close to 2018's record results.\r\nAs noted on Slide 7, Idaho Power service area continues to experience substantial customer growth.\r\nFor the third year in a row, Idaho remains the fastest-growing state in the nation, and Idaho Power's customer base grew 2.5% in 2019, including a 2.7% growth rate for our residential customer segment.\r\nIdaho Power now has more than 570,000 customers, and we view the reliable, affordable, clean energy that our company provides as a key driver for continuing to attract new customers.\r\nThe economy is thriving within Idaho Power's service area, and Moody's GDP forecast calls for sustained economic growth.\r\nIn 2019, Idaho Power experienced sales growth in its commercial and industrial sectors through a balanced mix of new business and expansion projects across the food processing, manufacturing, distribution and technology sectors.\r\nMoody's current forecast of GDP in Idaho Power's service area predicts growth of 4.4% in 2020 and another 4.4% in 2021.\r\nMeanwhile, employment increased 3.2%, and the unemployment rate was 2.8% at the end of 2019, compared with 3.5% nationally.\r\nTurning to Slide 8.\r\nIdaho Power's most recent integrated resource plan calls for continued work toward a unit-by-unit early exit from the Jim Bridger plant located in Wyoming by 2030.\r\nIn 2019, the company ended its participation in Unit 1 of the North Valmy plant in Nevada, which was a significant milestone in our path away from coal.\r\nWe also have an agreement to exit Unit 2 by 2025.\r\nThe Boardman plant in Oregon is also scheduled to cease operations this year.\r\nIn both cases, Idaho Power has State Public Utility Commission's support for a cost recovery framework to be applied through the end of their useful life, which we believe could provide a blueprint for a similar approach for Bridger.\r\nWe are continuing to explore options with PacifiCorp, the co-owner of Bridger, as we plan the end-of-life for the entire Jim Bridger plant.\r\nPacifiCorp's IRP, as published last fall, showed early shutdown dates for two Bridger units as well.\r\nIdaho Power's overall coal-fired generation has decreased for six consecutive years.\r\nAs recently as 2013, coal was our largest energy source at 47% of our total energy mix.\r\nToday, that number is around 16%.\r\nOur path away from coal, which is driven by the economics of the plant, aligns with our Clean Today, Cleaner Tomorrow plan to provide 100% clean energy by 2045.\r\nAnother key project in our Cleaner Tomorrow plan is the Boardman to Hemingway transmission project or B2H, which made solid progress in 2019.\r\nThe Oregon Department of Energy recommended approval of the 300-mile line.\r\nThe department is expected to release a proposed order, which is the next step in the permitting process, authorizing the transmission line this year.\r\nIf the permitting process remains on track, we expect the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council to issue a final order and site certificate in 2021.\r\nFollowing preconstruction activities, construction is expected to begin as early as 2023, with the line expected to be in service in 2026 or sometime thereafter.\r\nThe IRP we amended and filed at the end of last month also plans for us to include 120 megawatts of solar from the Jackpot Solar power purchase agreement.\r\nIdaho Power evaluated purchasing the project and elected not to pursue it.\r\nWe do not expect Idaho Power to file a general rate case in Idaho or Oregon in the next 12 months.\r\nThe influx of new customers, constructive regulatory outcomes and effective cost management all play significant roles in this decision.\r\nWith that, I will turn the time to Steve, who will go through the 2019 financial results.\r\nWe had excellent 2019 results.\r\nWeather challenges through the year were more than offset by a very good final quarter.\r\nI'll walk you through the drivers year over year on Slide 9.\r\nStrong net customer growth of 2.5% added $18.8 million to operating income in 2019.\r\nA decline in usage per customer, mostly related to lower irrigation sales, decreased operating income by $21.4 mill Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

links on the Investor Relations page of our website, cousins.com.\r\nIn particular, there are significant risks and uncertainties related to the severity and duration as the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing and strength of the recovery there from.\r\nWe began the third quarter with the expectation that our customers will begin bringing their teams back to the office post Labor Day.\r\nSince then, the delta variant hit the Sun Belt hard and created delays.\r\nHowever, as cases have now significantly declined, we're increasingly hearing from our customers that they plan to return toward the end of this year or early next year.\r\nOur team delivered strong financial results during the third quarter.\r\nHere are a few highlights.\r\nOn the earnings front, the team delivered $0.69 per share in FFO.\r\nSame-property NOI on a cash basis increased 3.6%, and importantly, we leased over 597,000 square feet, including over 500,000 square feet of new and extension leases with 7.7 years of weighted average lease term and a net effective rent of $24.06 per square foot, which is higher than our 2019 average.\r\nSecond-generation cash rents increased 23.1%, our strongest rollout since 2015.\r\nAnd we ended the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 4.54 times.\r\nWhile the macro narrative around office remains ambiguous, our leasing performance highlights three office sector trends that are becoming quite clear.\r\nFirst, innovative and growing companies recognize that they are stronger in person at least most of the time.\r\nIn this persistent remote environment, employee attrition is at an all-time high.\r\nContrary to many of the media headlines, forward-thinking business leaders are connecting the dots between the great resignation and eroding corporate cultures.\r\nThus, companies are firming up plans for their return strategy and making long-term real estate decisions that they were not prepared to make just a few quarters ago.\r\nSecond, the migration of the Sun Belt has accelerated.\r\nCisco, Visa, Ark Invest and Tesla are just the latest examples.\r\nThere are more in the pipeline.\r\nThe rapid urbanization is places like Downtown Austin, Midtown Atlanta, in the south end of Charlotte, have changed the equation for companies previously located in more dense, larger cities in the Northeast and West Coast.\r\nSunbelt cities now offer a dynamic urban experience in addition to an attractive climate and a lower cost of living and doing business.\r\nIt's the best of both worlds.\r\nLastly, the flight to quality is intensifying.\r\nEarlier this week, I've toured our recently completed Norfolk Southern headquarters project with a local business leader.\r\nHis feedback, much better than working at home, he said.\r\nIt was simple and spot on.\r\nThe development includes innovative collaboration space, neighborhoods for private working, state-of-the-art technology and countless amenities, all in the heart of Midtown Atlanta.\r\nOur customers recognize that interesting and inspiring space will be a competitive advantage in retaining and recruiting talent as well as rebuilding culture and connectivity.\r\nAt Cousins, we have a unique and compelling strategy that positions us at the intersection of these trends.\r\nAs the market moves faster, we are responding.\r\nMost recently, we acquired Heights Union, a 294,000 square foot office property in Tampa for a gross price of $144.8 million.\r\nThe Heights neighborhood has emerged as one of Tampa's signature gathering spots providing a unique live, work, play experience.\r\nThe two 6-story buildings, which were completed in 2020 are highly amenitized, authentic and efficient.\r\nIncluding Heights Union, we have invested approximately $1.1 billion in new acquisitions and development since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nWe are excited about the RailYard in Charlotte, 725 Ponce in Atlanta, Domain nine in Austin and New Hawk in Nashville.\r\nThey are representative of the Office of the Future in our all differentiated products in their respective markets.\r\nDuring the same period, we have sold approximately $1 billion of noncore properties, including Hearst Tower and one South in Charlotte, and Burnett Plaza in Fort Worth.\r\nThe net result of these strategic transactions are value-add returns on a blended basis and a trophy portfolio positioned to capture outsized customer demand and a reduced capex profile.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have completed the Norfolk Southern headquarters project.\r\nThe development was a highly profitable development for Cousins and a great outcome for our customer, a true win-win.\r\nNonetheless, we are excited to transition to the other side of this unconventional transaction.\r\nThe declining development fee stream has created challenging year-over-year earnings comps and the 370,000 square foot lease expiration on December 31 at 1,200 Peachtree created uncertainty.\r\nLooking forward to 2022 and beyond, our story simplified, and we are already making great early progress on our releasing efforts at 1,200 Peachtree as we are approximately 40% committed including LOIs.\r\nRichard will touch on this more in a moment.\r\nIn closing, Cousins is well-positioned for the future.\r\nWe have assembled a trophy portfolio in fast-growing Sun Belt markets.\r\nWe have organic growth opportunities within the portfolio as we drive occupancy gains and rental rate increases.\r\nWe have external growth opportunities in our $663 million development pipeline.\r\nIn addition, we have a well-located land bank that can support another $2.6 billion in development, including over three million square feet of trophy office and over 1,500 multifamily units.\r\nImportantly, we have a rock-solid balance sheet that provides financial flexibility and a highly capable team to execute on the strategy.\r\nThey are the cornerstone of the company's success.\r\nThis quarter, we continue to see economic recovery in our core markets and along with it, an increase in leasing and transaction activity.\r\nIn short, our third quarter operational performance was strong.\r\nWhile the pandemic still remains and the delta variant delay the return to the office for some, we are encouraged by the demand for high-quality office space across our markets.\r\nDue to the delta variant, portfolio level utilization, as we measure it, did not significantly increase this quarter.\r\nWith that said, there is noticeably more activity and energy at most of our properties compared to last quarter.\r\nThis is evidenced by a 27% increase in transient parking revenue quarter-over-quarter.\r\nTurning to third quarter results.\r\nour total office portfolio lease percentage and weighted average occupancy came in at 91.3% and 89.8%, respectively.\r\nOur lease percentage increased 30 basis points this quarter driven by new and expansion leasing activity at Terminus and 3350 Peachtree in Buckhead and at Domain Point in Austin.\r\nConversely, weighted average occupancy declined 120 basis points with the impact of the previously disclosed move out of Anthem at 3350 Peachtree in Buckhead.\r\nAs for general leasing activity this quarter, our team and portfolio produced fantastic results.\r\nWe executed 43 leases totaling 597,000 square feet in the quarter, and new and expansion leases were accounted for 84% of total activity.\r\nNet effective rents were $24.06 this quarter, an improvement over the second quarter and $0.24 higher than our reported net effective rents for the full year of 2019.\r\nThe rent growth was outstanding this quarter as well with second-generation net rents increasing 23.1% on a cash basis.\r\nSimilar to this time last quarter, we are still seeing encouraging activity in our leasing pipeline, both for our existing portfolio and new development.\r\nTour volume in our portfolio was on a clear upswing in the

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF.\r\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.\r\nTherefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.\r\nMore detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\r\nNow let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.\r\nBefore I jump into our financial results, I want to highlight the entire CF team for amazing execution across all areas of our business.\r\nWe set all-time company best records for safety, ammonia production and sales volumes, despite the challenges that 2020 hurled at us.\r\nThere was no playbook for how to manage through a global pandemic, yet this team developed and implemented plans to keep our people safe along with everyone who came on to our sites.\r\nTo date, we have no known transmissions of COVID-19 within any of our facilities.\r\nOn the safety front, we ended the year with only four recordable injuries and zero lost time injuries across the entire network for the whole year.\r\nAs is typically the case, safe operations are also more productive.\r\nAnd we proved that again with an all-time ammonia production record of 10.4 million tons.\r\nOur sales and logistics team rose to the challenge and set all-time sales and shipping records of over 20 million product tons.\r\nTruly a remarkable performance by all.\r\nLooking ahead, we are very optimistic about 2021.\r\nAs Bert will describe in a moment, the global nitrogen pricing outlook is much more positive than a year ago.\r\nWith strong commodity crop prices and significantly higher energy prices in Asia and Europe, we are seeing a robust demand environment, coupled with a steeper global cost curve.\r\nThe current conditions in the Southern Plains in Midwest have thrown another crisis at us, but as usual, the team has done a fantastic job responding to and navigating through these new challenges.\r\nWe have been able to quickly adjust our plant operations based on close communications with our gas suppliers.\r\nDisruptions have been widespread across the US nitrogen industry and this should result in further tightening of nitrogen supply for the spring planting season in North America, additional support for an already strong 2021.\r\nLonger term, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our commitment to the clean energy economy.\r\nWe continue to advance discussions with technology providers and partners, and we have seen new opportunities develop since our announcement.\r\nThese underscore how broad the demand for green and low carbon ammonia will be, and also the value of our unique capabilities.\r\nThen Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook before I return for some closing comments.\r\nGlobal nitrogen dynamics today with low-cost producers like CF are the most positive they have been since 2014.\r\nStrong demand driven by high commodity crop prices and a steeper global cost curve are creating a tighter nitrogen supply and demand balance.\r\nAs a result, prices have risen significantly in recent months and are well above 2020 values.\r\nGlobal demand is robust and broad-based.\r\nFarmers in North America has seen nitrogen consuming coarse grains reach multi-year highs for both near term and futures contracts.\r\nFor corn, we have seen lower-than-expected supply and high global demand led by China.\r\nAs a result, the USDA is projecting that the corn stocks-to-use ratio for the marketing year-over-year will be at its lowest level since 2013.\r\nThis supports our projection of 90 million to 92 million planted corn acres in the US this year with upside potential.\r\nThrough the balance of the year, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil.\r\nWe expect the urea tender volumes in India this year will be well above the five year average and close to the 10 million metric tons of last year.\r\nFor Brazil, we project 2021 imports of urea to be approximately 6.57 million metric tons, similar to last year.\r\nAs demand was increasing, the cost curve steepened significantly.\r\nFrom July 2020 to July -- to December 2020, the Dutch TTF natural gas price and the Asian JKM LNG price both increased about five times greater than the US Henry Hub natural gas price.\r\nThis had a number of impacts.\r\nFirst, margin opportunities increased for low cost producers.\r\nSecond, the significant increase in energy prices for producers in Europe and Asia pressured their margins, not only leading to lower operating rates but creating demand for import ammonia into those regions.\r\nThis contributed to even tighter global market.\r\nOver time, we expect the global nitrogen market to tighten further and faster driven by several factors.\r\nIn the near term, the need to rebuild the stock of commodity crops will underpin demand growth.\r\nLonger term, a key driver will be emerging demand for ammonia for clean energy applications.\r\nWe believe this level of global demand will require more production from the highest cost plants until prices rise enough to incent greenfield construction in other parts of the world.\r\nWe are well positioned as we approach the spring application season and have the flexibility necessary to address any challenges that arise.\r\nWe believe that the recent weather conditions in the US, or [Phonetic] disruption that we've built our system to overcome.\r\nWe are looking forward to working with our customers and leveraging our optionality to ensure that these requirements are met as they make -- as our customers make their final preparations for spring.\r\nFor 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share.\r\nEBITDA was $1.32 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion.\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was approximately $750 million.\r\nThese results reflect year over year, global nitrogen -- lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower natural gas and SG&A costs compared to the year before.\r\nThe results also demonstrate our continued efficient conversion of EBITDA into free cash.\r\nAs you can see on slide 9, we converted more than 55% of our adjusted EBITDA into free cash in 2020, which is the highest rate among our peers.\r\nOur free cash conversion continues to support our capital structure and allocation priorities.\r\nThis will lower our gross debt to $3.75 billion.\r\nAs we remain focused on investment grade and positioning the company to execute our clean energy growth strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce gross debt over time.\r\nWe remain excited to invest in the clean energy growth opportunity given the expected return profile.\r\nWe will also continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic repurchases at attractive levels.\r\nAs we look ahead to 2021, I want to share some of our expectations for the year ahead.\r\nWe anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2021 will be in the range of $450 million.\r\nThis reflects a return to a normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities in the year ahead, and the first expenses associated with the Green ammonia project at Donaldsonville.\r\nWe also expect SG&A levels to return to a level closer to 2019 than 2020.\r\nOur annual cash interest expense will fall to $175 million with the repayment of the 2021 notes.\r\nWith our planned maintenance schedule and recent gas driven curtailments, we expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million to 10 million tons.\r\nThis, along with lower inventories to the start of the year will likely result in lower product tons

[/INST] # CF Industries reported a strong 2020 with net earnings of $317 million, despite challenges posed by the pandemic. The company set all-time records for safety, ammonia production, and sales volumes. Looking ahead, CF is optimistic about 2021 due to a robust global nitrogen pricing outlook driven by strong commodity crop prices and higher energy prices. The disruptions caused by weather conditions in the Southern Plains and Midwest are expected to further tighten nitrogen supply for the spring planting season, supporting the positive demand environment. Longer term, CF is excited about its commitment to the clean energy economy and the potential for green and low-carbon ammonia. The company plans to invest in its Green ammonia project at Donaldsonville and evaluate opportunities to reduce gross debt over time. CF anticipates capital expenditures of $450 million in 2021 and expects gross ammonia production of 9.5-10 million tons. Margins are expected to improve this year due to positive nitrogen pricing.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.\r\nActual results could differ materially from these statements.\r\nI will provide commentary on our Q2 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on the current operating environment and how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory.\r\nWe will then open it up for Q&A.\r\nAs usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.\r\nAs we report results at the halfway point of 2021, we remain pleased, but not satisfied with our performance so far as we navigate through what can charitably be described as a complicated year.\r\nFor both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we delivered growth in organic sales, net sales, operating profit and net income.\r\nThis is despite difficult comparisons as we lapped last years strength in categories like liquid hand soap and dish soap.\r\nWe are also dealing with the impact of COVID restrictions in several markets, economic and political uncertainty, strong competitive activity, and of course, significantly heightened raw material and logistics headwinds.\r\nWe expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our business through the second half of this year.\r\nBecause of that, we remain focused on delivering impactful innovation, leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to deliver on pricing and driving productivity up and down the income statement.\r\nAll of these are crucial to deliver long-term sustainable growth that will help us as we look to deliver TSR at the high end of our peer group.\r\nWe delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter, which marked our 10th consecutive quarter, delivering organic sales growth either in or above our targeted range of 3% to 5%.\r\nAs we have discussed before, the key to delivering against our long-term targets is delivering balanced growth, which we did once again in the quarter by delivering both volume and pricing growth.\r\nWe delivered growth in both developed markets with 3% organic sales growth and emerging markets, which delivered 7% organic sales growth.\r\nWe delivered organic sales growth in every division in North America.\r\nOur largest category, Oral Care, delivered organic sales growth of nearly 10%, with organic sales growth across toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes, and organic sales growth in every division.\r\nInnovation continues to be a vital contributor to our Oral Care business, as we benefit from new products across all of our divisions.\r\nProducts like Co by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste are all delivering consumer desired benefits and premiumizing our portfolio.\r\nPet Nutrition delivered organic sales growth of 15%.\r\nPersonal Care and Home Care declined on an organic sales basis year-over-year in the quarter as expected, but net sales remain above 2019 levels.\r\nNet sales increased 9.5% in the quarter, which was our highest net sales increased in almost 10 years.\r\nForeign exchange was a 4.5% benefit to net sales as we lap the peak of last year's COVID-driven strength in the dollar.\r\nAfter a strong gross margin performance in 2020 and in Q1, our gross margin declined in the second quarter due to the rapid acceleration of raw material costs across our business and the lapping of lower promotional levels in Q2 2020.\r\nWe took additional pricing in the second quarter, which will help offset raw material costs in the second half of the year and we will continue to layer in additional pricing where possible.\r\nWe expect raw material costs to remain elevated throughout 2021, but we do expect some sequential lessening of inflation as we get into the fourth quarter.\r\nOur efforts on premiumization and pricing, along with our focus on productivity, like our funding the growth initiatives, will also help us as we look to improve our gross margin performance.\r\nIn the second quarter, our gross profit margin was 60%, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year on both a GAAP basis and a base business basis.\r\nYear-to-date, our gross margin of 60.4%, down 10 basis points.\r\nAgain, that is on a GAAP and base business basis.\r\nFor the second quarter, pricing was 90 basis points favorable to gross margin, less than in the first quarter as we lapped lower promotional spending in the year-ago period when many of our markets reacted to COVID restrictions by pulling back on promotional activity.\r\nRaw materials were at 370 basis point headwind as we continue to see significant pressure from resins, fats and oils and agriculture-related costs, and many other materials.\r\nThis includes a slightly favorable transactional impact from foreign exchange.\r\nProductivity was a 200 basis point benefit.\r\nOur SG&A was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales for the second quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis.\r\nThis was primarily driven by an increase in logistics costs and also by a 30 basis point increase in advertising to sales.\r\nExcluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year as our net sales growth and savings programs drove leverage on our overheads.\r\nFor the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 2.5% on a base business basis.\r\nOur earnings per share was up 12% on a GAAP basis and up 8% on a base business basis.\r\nOur free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to lap very strong working capital performance in the year-ago period.\r\nAs we discussed previously, our capital expenditures are also up year-over-year as we invest behind growth, productivity and our sustainability strategy.\r\nA few comments on divisional performance.\r\nNorth American net sales declined 4% in the second quarter with organic sales down 4.5% and a modest benefit from foreign exchange.\r\nVolumes were down 8.\r\n5% in the quarter, driven by Home Care and Personal Care, which saw strong growth in the year ago period, driven by COVID-related demand.\r\nPricing across Home Care and Personal Care was positive as we worked to offset higher raw material costs.\r\nOral Care organic sales grew mid-single digits, driven by innovation and pricing.\r\nI mentioned Co by Colgate before, which is helping us further expand into the beauty and direct-to-consumer channels.\r\nWe are pleased with the initial performance of the Colgate Keep manual toothbrush.\r\nIt comes with an aluminum handle and by using our replaceable heads, consumers can use 80% less plastic compared to similarly sized Colgate toothbrushes.\r\nWe're also excited about our Tom's of Maine relaunch, which is bringing new graphics and advertising to a historic natural segment brand.\r\nOur logistics issues that we discussed on the first quarter call continue to negatively impact our promotional timing, but service levels have improved and we expect our promotional cadence will normalize as we go through the third quarter.\r\nLatin America net sales were up 12.5% with 8.5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point benefit from foreign exchange.\r\nAll three categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high teens.\r\nBrazil and Mexico both grew organic and net sales double digits in the quarter.\r\nOur strong innovation performance was led by core innovation behind Colgate Total Reinforced Gums in Mexico, which apparently sounds much better in Spanish and Portuguese than English and several Charcoal variance in Brazil.\r\nVolume was plus 2.5% in the quarter despite a sizable negative impact due to political unrest in Colombia, our third largest market in Latin America.\r\nWe believe this disruption, which negatively impacted our distribution network for some time is largely behind us, but political disruption will remain a risk, not just in Columbia, but in several markets.\r\nPricing was up 6% despite lapping lower promotional spending in Q2 20 Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Mark will review our first quarter results and provide our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter.\r\nAndrew will provide an overview of select financial items.\r\nInformation presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding.\r\nActual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.\r\nToday's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nPlease note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA.\r\nA reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as any other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.\r\nOur first quarter results were in line with our guidance and expectations.\r\nRevenue and earnings were down as forecasted, though earnings were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance.\r\nWe continue to expect a good second quarter and a strong full year.\r\nWe had two important product launches in the quarter, Overwatch Herbicide based on our Isoflex active in Australia and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. Isoflex is one of 11 new active ingredients we plan to launch this decade.\r\nBoth launches have exceeded our expectations and have delivered approximately $50 million of Q1 sales.\r\nIn March, we announced an important agreement with UPL to toll manufacture Rynaxypyr insect control in India and to distribute products based on the active ingredient in selected markets.\r\nIn the future, FMC will supply Rynaxypyr active to UPL for use in product formulations developed and marketed by UPL around the world.\r\nThis agreement is the next step in growing our important diamide franchise and accelerating FMC's long-term plans to expand the franchise in diverse geographies and crops with differentiated formulations.\r\nIt also reaffirms the strength of our patent portfolio that protects our diamide franchise, far beyond just the composition of matter patents.\r\nWe returned over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through our recently increased dividend and share repurchases.\r\nOur guidance for Q2 indicates an expected return to mid-single-digit growth on the top line, with slightly lower earnings growth because of higher costs compared to Q2 2020.\r\nThese higher costs are principally related to increasing raw materials and logistics.\r\nAdditionally, we will be spending more on SG&A and R&D compared to the abnormally low spend in Q2 2020.\r\nI'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business.\r\nAll our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed.\r\nOur research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic.\r\nWhile many of FMC's other employees continue to work from home, plans are in place to resume in-office operations where permitted by local authorities.\r\nFinally, we are all aware of the challenges India is facing with significant increases of COVID cases across that country.\r\nLast week, FMC announced it will donate seven pressure swing absorption oxygen plants to hospitals across five states in India to help address the rapidly increasing demand for medical oxygen.\r\nThis program focuses on rural areas where we are providing further community support.\r\nTurning to our Q1 results on Slide three.\r\nWe reported $1.2 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and a 5% decrease organically.\r\nAs planned, we saw slower sales in Brazil as we drew down channel inventories in that country as well as the shortfall in EMEA due to Brexit-related sales that occurred in Q4 2020.\r\nIn North America, we saw very good demand based on strong fundamentals in row crops and commodity prices, offset by a shift of diamide third-party sales to Latin America.\r\nIn Asia, double-digit sales growth in Australia, Japan and our Asian subregion drove revenue performance in that region.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA was $307 million, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.\r\nEBITDA margins were 25.7%, a decrease of 290 basis points compared to the prior year.\r\nAdjusted earnings were $1.53 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 17% versus Q1 2020, but also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.\r\nThe year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense.\r\nMoving now to Slide four.\r\nQ1 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year, driven by a 4% volume decrease and a 1% price decline.\r\nForeign currencies were a modest tailwind in the quarter on the top line.\r\nSales in Asia increased 18% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.\r\nWe had strong Overwatch Herbicide sales for cereals, and sales of our diamides were robust for fruit and vegetable and rice applications.\r\nInsecticides also performed well in Indonesia, helped by our recent expanded market access in that country, and improved weather helped sales across the ASEAN subregion.\r\nEMEA sales were down 4% year-over-year and 8% organically.\r\nWe had strong sales of diamides and other insecticides as well as fungicides, but these were more than offset by headwinds from the Brexit-related U.K. sales in Q4 that we described a quarter ago as well as discontinued registrations.\r\nIn North America, sales decreased 8% year-over-year.\r\nOur herbicide business grew double digits, partially due to the timing of some sales that shifted from Q4 to Q1 as well as the continued strength of Authority Edge and Authority Supreme herbicides.\r\nWe also had a strong launch in the U.S. of Xyway fungicide for corn and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops.\r\nThese were offset primarily by a shift of diamide third-party partner sales from North America to Latin America, as one of our key partners adjusted the way it purchases from FMC globally.\r\nThis was simply a move of purchasing location and not a change in demand.\r\nExcluding this shift, our North America sales were up low double digits.\r\nMoving now to Latin America.\r\nSales decreased 22% year-over-year and 13% organically.\r\nAs a reminder, we were facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America, where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020.\r\nBrazil's cotton business was very strong for us a year ago, which did not repeat this season as cotton hectares were down 15%.\r\nWe also proactively reduced channel inventory of FMC products as planned in Q1, improving our inventory situation in Brazil.\r\nAnd our Andean Zone subregion continued the momentum from 2020 with double-digit sales growth.\r\nTurning now to the first quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide five.\r\nEBITDA in the quarter was down $50 million year-over-year due to a very strong Q1 2020 comparison.\r\nVolume headwinds in Latin America and EMEA were partially offset by new product launches in Asia and North America.\r\nIn Latin America, we focused on reducing channel inventory to set ourselves up for a much stronger pricing environment in the second half of 2021.\r\nCost headwinds were slightly higher than expected, while FX headwinds were far lower than in the prior four quarters.\r\nTurning now to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021.\r\nWe continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up low single digits on a U.S. dollar basis.\r\nRelative to this time last year, commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher, and stock to use ratios are much improved.\r\nAll regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the negative impact from COVID on crop demand appeared to be modest.\r\nThe only change to our regional forecast is that we now forecast mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market versus low single-digit growth before.\r\nThi Please summarize this transcript in

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'll now discuss the financial results.\r\nWe reported revenue of $267 million during the first quarter of 2022, which represents an increase of 16%, compared to $230.1 million during the first quarter of 2021.\r\nThe increase was largely attributable to volume increases in our Fenestration segment, combined with higher prices related to the pass-through of raw material cost inflation.\r\nMore specifically, we realized net sales growth of 14.5% in our North American fenestration segment, 15.5% in our North American cabinet components segment, and 18.6% in our European fenestration segment, excluding the foreign exchange impact.\r\nWe reported net income of $11.2 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the three months ended January 31st, 2022, compared to $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share during the three months ended January 31st, 2021.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, net income increased by 25.9% to $11.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021.\r\nThe adjustments being made to earnings per share are for restructuring charges, loss on the sale of a plant, foreign currency transaction impacts, and transaction and advisory fees.\r\nOn an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter was essentially flat year over year at $24.4 million, compared to $24.3 million during the same period of last year.\r\nThe increase in earnings for the three months ended January 31st, 2022, was attributable to continued strong demand, operational efficiency gains, and increased pricing.\r\nHowever, the decrease in margin percentage was driven by inflationary pressures and time lags on material index pricing mechanisms.\r\nMoving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.\r\nCash used for operating activities was $21.7 million for the quarter, compared to $3.4 million for the same period of last year.\r\nDue to the typical seasonality in our business, free cash flow was negative in the first quarter of this year.\r\nIn addition, the value of our inventory increased further due to inflationary pressures, which had a negative impact on working capital.\r\nAs a reminder, we usually generate most of our cash in the second half of each year.\r\nOur balance sheet continues to be strong.\r\nOur liquidity position is solid, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was at 0.4 times as of January 31st, 2022.\r\nWe will remain focused on generating cash, paying down debt, and opportunistically repurchasing stock as the year progresses.\r\nHowever, based on improvements in labor performance, the expected continuation of our pass-through pricing strategy, conversations with our customers, and the latest macro data, we're now comfortable providing the following guidance for fiscal 2022.\r\nNet sales of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $135 million to $140 million; depreciation of approximately $31 million, amortization of approximately $15 million; SG&A of $115 million to $120 million, interest expense of $2 million to $2.5 million, tax rate of 28%, capex of $30 million to $35 million; and free cash flow of $55 million to $60 million.\r\nWhile we do expect some level of volume growth in our Fenestration segments for the remainder of the year, note that our current expectation is that revenue growth for the remainder of the year should be driven more by price, as opposed to volume, and we expect margin expansion to be second-half weighted.\r\nFrom a cadence perspective for Q2, we expect net sales to be up mid to high single digits year-over-year in each segment.\r\nHowever, due to inflation and the time lag associated with passing on price increases for most of our raw materials, we believe it will be a challenge to realize margin expansion in any segment in Q2.\r\nLooking ahead into the second half of the year, on a consolidated basis, we currently expect mid-single-digit net sales growth year over year in Q3 and Q4.\r\nIn addition, due to easier comps and the expected benefit from our pricing strategy, coupled with some volume growth in our fenestration segments, we expect to realize some margin expansion in Q3 and Q4.\r\nJoe's guidance was key during our transition into a pure-play building products company several years ago, and more recently, his mentorship and support proved invaluable, as I transitioned into the CEO role.\r\nI will now discuss results for the quarter and then conclude with a discussion on the macro environment and guidance.\r\nDemand was healthy across all product lines during the first quarter of 2022.\r\nVolume growth in our fenestration segments and higher prices in all segments, mostly related to the pass-through of raw material cost inflation resulted in revenue growth of 16% year over year.\r\nOn a consolidated basis, we estimate that revenue growth for the quarter was weighted approximately 10% due to an increase in volume and approximately 90% due to an increase in price.\r\nThe first quarter began with continued supply chain challenges and significant labor disruption caused by COVID absenteeism driven by the omicron variant.\r\nHowever, these issues started to subside toward the end of the quarter.\r\nThe rate of raw material cost inflation remains a challenge, as we typically see a 30 to 90-day time lag in passing these increases through to our customers.\r\nLooking at the individual segments, I will start with the North American fenestration.\r\nThis segment generated revenue of $146.6 million in Q1, which was $18.5 million or 14.5% higher than prior year Q1.\r\nStrong demand in our IG spacer and screen product lines, volume growth in vinyl fencing components, and price increases across all product lines were the main drivers of the growth.\r\nWe estimate that revenue growth in this segment was weighted approximately 45% due to an increase in volume and approximately 55% due to an increase in price.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA of $16.3 million in this segment was essentially flat versus prior year Q1.\r\nThe improved pricing, volume-related efficiency gains, and productivity-related improvements were more than offset by inflationary pressures on raw materials, which caused margin erosion of approximately 170 basis points for the quarter.\r\nHowever, our current expectation is for margin expansion in this segment later in the year, assuming that the rate of inflation subsides.\r\nOur European fenestration segment generated revenue of $58.9 million in the first quarter, which was $9.8 million or 20% higher than prior year.\r\nExcluding foreign exchange impact, this would equate to an increase of 18.6%.\r\nWe estimate that revenue growth in this segment was weighted approximately 20% due to an increase in volume and approximately 80% due to an increase in price.\r\nStrong demand in both IG spacers and vinyl extrusions combined with material-related price increases accounted for the strong performance year over year.\r\nThese favorable volume-related impacts and pricing actions were more than offset by inflationary pressure on raw material costs and by inefficiencies caused by the COVID-related absenteeism early in the quarter.\r\nAs such, adjusted EBITDA came in at $10.4 million for the quarter, which was $300,000 less than prior year and yielded margin compression of approximately 420 basis points.\r\nSimilar to our expectations for other segments, we do anticipate that margins will improve, as the year progresses, again, assuming that the rate of inflation subsides.\r\nOur North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $62.4 million in Q1, which was $8.4 million or 15.5% higher than prior year.\r\nVolumes decreased in this segment year over year, mainly as a result of customers' decisions to reduce overtime hours worked in their plants.\r\nIncreases in hardwood index pricing as well as discretionary pricing actions offset the volume and resulted in revenue growth year over year.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2 million for the quarter, which was $1.2 million less than prior year and resulted in margin co Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Both are now available on the Investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com.\r\nI am pleased to report that we continue to make great progress on all fronts as we rebound from the impact of COVID-19.\r\nWe knew at the onset of the pandemic that we would not be impervious to its economic impact, but we were confident that the high-quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio, combined with the strength of our balance sheet and ample liquidity would help us pull through and maybe even come out on the other side better off than at the beginning.\r\nWe continue to be optimistic as we meaningfully rebounded in 2021 and anticipate further growth in 2022 and beyond.\r\nThat's why we've aggregated the portfolio comprised of a well-balanced collection of office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties located in dynamic high barrier to entry markets, where we believe that the demographics, pent-up demand and local economies remain strong relative to others.\r\nOur properties are more resilient in our view to economic downturns as they are in the path of growth, education, and innovation and importantly can likely withstand the impact of long-term inflation, perhaps even benefit from the benefits of long-term inflation.\r\nAlong those lines during the past quarter, we used our liquidity to acquire two complementary and accretive office properties in Bellevue, Washington, a market that we remain very bullish on and in which we expect continued rent growth.\r\nMeanwhile, our development of La Jolla Commons III into an 11 story, approximately 210,000 square foot Class A office tower remains on time and on budget for Q2 or Q3 2023 delivery.\r\nWe are encouraged about the leasing prospects in the UTC submarket for high-quality, large blocks of space, where both tech and life science funding continues at record levels and same tenants continue to expand.\r\nBut we don't have specific news to share on that front at this time.\r\nThe same holds true for our One Beach Street development on the North Waterfront of San Francisco, which we believe to be a unique opportunity for a full building tenant with delivery expected in Q2 or Q3 of 2022.\r\nAdditionally, I'm happy to inform you that our Board of Directors has approved the quarterly dividend of $0.30 a share for the third quarter, which we believe is supported by our expectations for operations to continue trending positively.\r\nIt will be paid on December 23 to shareholders of record on December nine.\r\nAs we look at our portfolio, we are always reminded of the importance of owning and operating the preeminent properties in each of our markets.\r\nThat's why we focused on continuing to enhance our best-in-class community shopping centers to promote a better experience for our shoppers with the expectation that this will further strengthen our properties as the dominant centers in our submarkets.\r\nAnd we understand the importance of modern state-of-the-art amenities in our office projects, which assist our tenants in the hiring and retention of talent in what is currently a very competitive job market.\r\nWe feel strongly that consistently improving and monetizing our properties, including incorporating sustainability and health and wellness elements is critical to remaining competitive in the marketplace in order to attract the highest quality and highest credit tenants.\r\nMeanwhile, we are encouraged by our approximately 97% collection percentage in Q3, increased leasing activity across all asset classes, fewer tenant failures and bankruptcies than we expected and many modified leases hitting percentage rent thresholds sooner than expected and are collecting of approximately 96% of deferred rents due during the third quarter, all validating the strategies we implemented during COVID to support our struggling retailers through the government-mandated closures as we are fortunate to have the financial ability to do so.\r\nBriefly on the retail front, we've seen an improved leasing environment over the past few quarters with positive activity engagement with new retailers for many of our vacancies, including recently signed new deals with Columbia Sportswear, Williams-Sonoma, Total Wine and First Hawaiian Bank to name a few, and renewals with Nordstrom's, Petco and Whole Earth among others as well as many other new deals and renewals in the lease documentation process.\r\nRetailers are choosing our best-in-class locations to improve their sales, all the while we remain selective in terms of merchandising our shopping centers for the longer term.\r\nChris Sullivan and his team have done a tremendous job on that front despite some of the continuing headwinds at our Waikiki Beach Walk retail.\r\nOn the multifamily front as of quarter end, we were 96% leased at Hassalo in Portland, and 98% leased in San Diego multifamily portfolio.\r\nAll of the master lease units in San Diego that you've heard us discuss previously were absorbed by early August.\r\nThough multifamily collections have been particularly challenging in Portland due to COVID-related government restrictions, we have started receiving meaningful checks from government rental assistant programs to drive down our outstanding amounts owed and expect more checks to come.\r\nWe are confident that Abigail's strong leadership at San Diego multifamily and Tania's new energy at Hassalo will drive improvements at our multifamily properties, both operationally and financially.\r\nLast night we reported third quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.57, and third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.17.\r\nThird quarter results are primarily comprised of the following: actual FFO increased in the third quarter by approximately 11.4% on a FFO per share basis to $0.57 per FFO share compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily from the following four items: first, the acquisitions of Eastgate Office Park in Corporate Campus East III in Bellevue, Washington, on July seven and September 10, respectively, added approximately $0.023 of FFO per share in Q3.\r\nSecond, Alamo Quarry in San Antonio added approximately $0.017 of FFO per share in Q3, resulting from 2019 and 2020 real estate tax refunds received during the third quarter of 2021, which reduced Alamo Quarry's real estate tax expense.\r\nThird, decrease of bad debt expense at Carmel Mountain Plaza added approximately $0.005 per FFO share in Q3.\r\nAnd fourth, the Embassy Suites and Waikiki Beach Walk added approximately $0.012 of FFO per share in Q3 due to the seasonality over the summer months.\r\nLet me give you an update on our Waikiki Embassy Suites hotel.\r\nDue to the impact of the delta variant, Hawaiian Governor Ige made a formal announcement on the third week in August that if you have plans or are thinking of coming to Hawaii, please don't come until we tell you otherwise.\r\nIt was not a mandate, but it did create a detrimental impact to our visitors to Hawaii and resulted in huge cancellation starting in August and into September.\r\nOur results for Q3 at Embassy Suites hotel were expected to be much higher.\r\nOverall, occupancy, ADR and RevPAR continued to increase on heading in the right direction.\r\nAs of October 19, Governor Ige made another formal announcement to begin welcoming all essential and nonessential travel, starting November 1, 2021.\r\nWe look forward to welcoming the fully vaccinated individuals and ramping up our visitor industry.\r\nOn our Q2 earnings call, I mentioned that Japan, who was then approximately 9% fully vaccinated, is now over 65% fully vaccinated and is expected to hit 80% by November.\r\nAll emergency measures in Japan were lifted on September 30 and lifted the intensive antivirus measures.\r\nIt marks the first time since April that Japan is free of corona virus declarations and intensive measures.\r\nWe expect to start seeing the Japanese tourists beginning to slowly start revisiting the Hawaiian Islands beginning in November, including Waikiki.\r\nNow as we look Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # In the third quarter, the company reported an 11.4% increase in FFO per share to $0.57 due to office acquisitions, real estate tax refunds, reduced bad debt expense, and seasonality in hospitality. Key highlights include strong same-store cash NOI in office and retail segments, the 86% leased acquisition of Corporate Campus East III in Bellevue, and increased leasing activity across all asset classes. The company maintains a solid liquidity position of $522 million. For the full year 2021, the company projects FFO per share between $1.91 and $1.93, with a slight decrease in Q4 FFO per share due to non-recurring items, seasonality, and increased expenses. The company will provide 2022 guidance in February 2022. Office leasing activity remains strong, with comparable new and renewal leases reflecting rent increases of over 9% and 14% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. The company continues to invest in portfolio improvements and developments, including redevelopments in Portland and San Diego, to enhance occupancy and drive rent growth.</s>"}

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n s First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.\r\nIm Jason Bailey, Director of Investor Relations.\r\n; and Bryan Buckler, CFO of OGE Energy Corp.\r\nIn terms of the call today, we will first hear from Sean, followed by an explanation from Bryan of first quarter results.\r\nIn addition, the conference call and accompanying slides will be archived following the call on that same website.\r\nEarlier, we reported first quarter consolidated earnings of $0.26 per share, which includes utility earnings of $0.06 per share, earnings associated with our investment in Enable of $0.19 per share, and earnings at the holding company of $0.01 per share.\r\nWe've accomplished a lot, and I'm pleased to report that we've made great progress in mitigating the impacts of Winter Storm Uri.\r\nWe are back within the guidance range we reported last quarter, and we are not done.\r\nWe are one quarter into the year, and we're focused on a great year.\r\nOur efforts to mitigate the impacts of Uri are ongoing as we work consistently to deliver shareholder value.\r\nBryan will provide additional details when he discusses our financial results.\r\nWe've had a productive and busy first quarter, starting the year off by announcing our support of the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer.\r\nAnd as we work to finalize that merger agreement in February, our service territory experienced Winter Storm Uri, and I'm pleased to say that our operational performance during the storm was strong.\r\nOur employees and our generation fleet performed admirably, and our customers experienced minimal disruptions.\r\nImportantly, we performed our work safely, improving our year-over-year first quarter safety results by 60%, which is a great accomplishment when you consider that 2020 was our second safest year on record.\r\nAnd particularly when you consider that our members worked in some of the most difficult winter conditions imaginable during the storm.\r\nThen we quickly got to work on legislative and regulatory solutions to address the financial impacts of Uri.\r\nWe now have a regulatory asset for the recovery of the winter storm cost in Oklahoma and in Arkansas.\r\nWe now have securitization legislation in Oklahoma and in Arkansas.\r\nAnd we have filed for securitization in Oklahoma and in Arkansas.\r\nTurning to other positive regulatory outcomes in the first quarter.\r\nIn March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the settlement in our Third Formula Rate and new rates were implemented April 1.\r\nIn Oklahoma, under our grid enhancement mechanism, the work is going well.\r\nWe file regulatory reports each quarter as projects are placed in service.\r\nAnd I'm pleased to say that the entire program is going smoothly.\r\nOn the last call, I mentioned that we have a lot of really exciting projects in and around our communities in various stages of development.\r\nThe two projects I'm sharing today are only the first, and there are more to come.\r\nWe announced an innovative deal with Dobson Fiber to upgrade the resiliency and capacity of our utility communications network to accommodate new grid automation and mitigate the risk of wireless interference.\r\nThis is part of our continued grid enhancement efforts to deploy increased automation, monitoring and operational technologies.\r\nThis initiative enables us to essentially future-proof our communications network while saving more than 60% of our standard capital deployment and O&M costs.\r\nThose are just real savings for our customers.\r\nWe also announced an expansion of the Choctaw Nation/OG&E Solar Energy Center.\r\nAnd we're proud to continue our work with the Choctaw Nation and expand our commitment to renewable energy.\r\nThis commitment is based off customer-driven demand for our renewable energy offerings.\r\nWe now have included $25 million to our 2021 capital investment forecast to reflect the inclusion of these two projects in the first quarter.\r\nThese are just two examples of the kinds of innovative projects you can expect from us in the future.\r\nWe are seeing the recovery we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\r\nLast quarter, we stated our expectations for 2021 weather-normalized load being 2.4% above 2020 levels.\r\nAfter the first quarter, we still expect full year 2021 weather-normalized load to be at that level.\r\nAdding to our confidence around the return of load is the fact that even during the pandemic, we've continued our trend of strong customer growth, which is up 1.4% over the same period in 2020, driven primarily in our residential and commercial classes.\r\nAdd to this, the fact that in Oklahoma, gross receipts are up 38% for the month of April, adding to the confidence we have in our business.\r\nToday, as I've said before, our electric rates are lower than they were in 2011.\r\nAnd let me share an interesting data point.\r\nWhen adjusted for inflation, our rates are actually 14% below what they were in 2011.\r\nBusiness and economic development is active in our service territory.\r\nThese low rates are a significant driver of companies coming to or expanding their operations, including electrification in our service territory.\r\nSo far, this year, those efforts expect to bring an additional 50 megawatts of load by the end of 2021.\r\nThis combination of strong customer growth and outstanding business and economic development activity puts us on track for sustained load growth of at least 1%.\r\nWe will continue to work on the many opportunities that will bring more load, more jobs and more investment to our communities in Oklahoma and Arkansas.\r\nSo let me put all of this into perspective.\r\nWe've continued to achieve positive regulatory outcomes, we've added new innovative projects, we see strong customer growth.\r\nWe have some of, if not the lowest rates in the nation, combined with annual load growth and better unemployment rates than most of the nation.\r\nThis is all part of our great story that further supports our sustainable business model of growing revenues by attracting new customers, managing expenses by utilizing technology and becoming more efficient, this helps us maintain the low rates, which in turn attracts more customers.\r\nThis virtuous cycle continues.\r\nOur results this year will rest on our operational execution, and I'm very confident in our ability to achieve that.\r\nFor the remainder of the year, we will achieve final regulatory approval of cost recovery plans for Winter Storm Uri, submit integrated resource plans in Oklahoma and Arkansas, file our Fourth Formula Rate in Arkansas, including a request for an extension of its term, finished construction of the two solar farms, continue our grid enhancement investments in Oklahoma, which are on track to deliver results to our customers.\r\nAnd finally, we continue to prepare for our next Oklahoma rate case, which we plan to file later this year.\r\nSo we've accomplished a lot already in the first quarter, but we're still going.\r\nAnd this all sets us up for a great year in years to come.\r\nWe expect the transaction to close in 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the HSR clearance.\r\nOur intention to prudently exit our midstream investment remains the same, and we will provide information upon closing of the transaction.\r\nOn our last call, we talked about our solid compelling investment thesis, supported by a track record of performance.\r\nWe put in motion our vision to become a pure-play utility, targeting 5% earnings growth based off lower risk investments that will enhance our customers' experience.\r\nWe have some of the most affordable rates in the nation helping to drive economic growth in our communities.\r\nWeve made great progress toward getting back to our 2021 guidance.\r\nOur ability to meet guidance rests on our operational execution, and I'm confident in our ability to do so.\r\nOur company is strong, and while COVID and extreme weather have presented challenges, it's important to understand that we have always been determined to more than simply manage the downturn instead, set our Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We appreciate your time today.\r\nThis is how we measure and manage these divisions internally.\r\nThe combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed.\r\nThe supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2018 through 2021.\r\nWe are extremely pleased that our first quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance and reflect a broad-based recovery that's well under way.\r\nProtiviti's revenues grew 35% year-on-year reflecting continuing momentum across its wide array of service offerings, including very strong managed solutions with staffing.\r\nThis is Protiviti's 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains.\r\nOur staffing operations significantly outperformed their historical sequential trends, led by small and medium-sized businesses and permanent placement, which grew 22% sequentially.\r\nI continue to be impressed with the adaptability of our teams in navigating the new hybrid and remote work models with our clients and candidates, helping them grow and find meaningful work.\r\nCompanywide revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down 7% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis, and down 8% on an as adjusted basis.\r\nNet income per share in the first quarter was $0.98, increasing 24% compared to $0.79 in the first quarter a year ago.\r\nCash flow from operations during the quarter was $68 million.\r\nIn March, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $44 million.\r\nWe also acquired approximately 797,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $61 million.\r\nWe have 9.2 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan.\r\nOur return on invested capital for the company was 37% in the first quarter.\r\nLet's start with revenues.\r\nAs Keith noted, global revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter.\r\nOn an as adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18% year-over-year.\r\nU.S. staffing revenues were $759 million, down 19% from the prior year.\r\nNon-U.S. staffing revenues were $242 million, down 15% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis.\r\nWe have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.\r\nIn the first quarter, there were 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter one year ago.\r\nThe current second quarter has 63.4 billing days equivalent to the second quarter one year ago.\r\nCurrency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $17 million.\r\nThis impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points.\r\nNow, let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti.\r\nGlobal revenues in the first quarter were $397 million.\r\n$316 million of that is from business within the United States, and $81 million is from operations outside the United States.\r\nOn an as adjusted basis, global first quarter Protiviti revenues were up 35% versus the year-ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 37%.\r\nNon-U.S. revenues were up 26% on an as adjusted basis.\r\nExchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $6 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2 percentage points.\r\nProtiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.\r\nWe remind you that changes to the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A.\r\nPreviously, they were both classified as SG&A.\r\nOur historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measures of combined segment income.\r\nThis is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.\r\nThis is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP.\r\nTurning now to gross margin.\r\nIn our temporary and consultant staffing operations, first quarter gross margin was 38.8% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the first quarter one year ago.\r\nOur permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 11.2% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago.\r\nWhen combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 160 basis points compared to the year-ago first quarter to 45.6%.\r\nFor Protiviti, gross margin was 26.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.6% of Protiviti revenues one year ago.\r\nAdjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, gross margin for Protiviti was 26.9% for the quarter just ended compared to 26.3% one year ago.\r\nCompanywide SG&A costs were 30.3% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 29.4% in the same quarter one year ago.\r\nChanges in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue by 0.8% in the first quarter and decreasing SG&A by 2.4% in the same quarter one year ago.\r\nWhen adjusted for these changes, companywide SG&A costs were 29.5% for the quarter just ended compared to 31.8% one year ago.\r\nStaffing SG&A costs were 37.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in the Q1 -- in Q1 2020.\r\nIncluded in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 1% in the first quarter compared to income of 3% related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter one year ago.\r\nWhen adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 35.3% one year ago.\r\nFirst-quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues in the year-ago period.\r\nOperating income for the quarter was $139 million.\r\nThis includes $12 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets.\r\nCombined segment income was therefore, $151 million in the first quarter.\r\nCombined segment margin was 10.8%.\r\nFirst quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $93 million with a segment margin of 9.3%.\r\nSegment income for Protiviti in the first quarter was $57 million with a segment margin of 14.4%.\r\nOur first quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 32% a year ago.\r\nThe 2020 rate was elevated based upon the estimated lower coverage of non-deductible tax items due to lower pandemic-impacted revenues.\r\nMoving on to accounts receivable.\r\nAt the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $800 million, and implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 51.4 days.\r\nBefore we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days.\r\nOur temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues down 12.5% versus the prior year, compared to an 18.9% decrease for the full quarter.\r\nRevenues for the first two weeks of April were up 9% compared to the same period one year ago.\r\nPermanent placement revenues in March were up 24.2% versus March of 2020.\r\nThis compares to an 8.1% decrease for the full quarter.\r\nFor the first three weeks of April permanent placement revenues were up 154% compared to the same period in 2020.\r\nWe provide this information so that you have insight into some of the

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from these expectations.\r\nAll of these documents are available on our website at brunswick.com.\r\nOur businesses had another outstanding quarter.\r\nWe closed the first half of 2021 by delivering record results as a result of continuing strong retail demand, outstanding operational performance and success in mitigating material supply and labor challenges.\r\nAll of our businesses delivered exceptional growth during the quarter.\r\nOur Propulsion business continued to realize strong outward market share gains, leveraging the strongest product lineup in the industry.\r\nOur Parts and Accessories businesses continued to benefit from robust aftermarket demand, driven by elevated boating participation.\r\nAnd our Boat business posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins despite significant supply chain, transportation and labor challenges.\r\nRobust retail demand for our products in the first half of the year has driven field inventory levels to the lowest level in decades at approximately nine weeks on hand.\r\nAnd we are progressing our efforts to efficiently increase capacity across several of our facilities to satisfy orders from our global customer base and begin to replenish the pipeline.\r\nAs many of you know, we've also had a busy few months on the M&A front.\r\nAt the end of the quarter, our Advanced Systems Group significantly expanded its product and brand portfolio by announcing the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Navico, an industry leader in marine electronics.\r\nIn addition, we announced in early July that Freedom has expanded into Spain through the acquisition of Fanautic Club.\r\nI'll touch on both these exciting transactions later in our discussion.\r\nGiven the unique demand and inventory environment, together with continued strong boat usage through the prime season, which drives P&A sales, we have improved visibility on our ability to deliver against an extremely favorable outlook for the remainder of 2021.\r\nAnd consequently, we have increased our 2021 guidance.\r\nBefore we discuss the results for the quarter, I wanted to share with you some updated demographic insights through the first half of 2021 and comparisons with the favorable trends we experienced in 2020 versus 2019 in the industry.\r\nI'm happy to report that we are not seeing any change in the significant metrics we shared with you during our first quarter earnings call in April.\r\nBrunswick's average boat buyer age continues to be two years younger than the industry average.\r\nAdditionally, Brunswick's first-time boat buyers continue to be younger than our overall boat buyer demographic and three years younger than the industry.\r\nFirst-time boat buyers are trending more female than they did in 2020, and Brunswick over-indexes to the industry by approximately 800 basis points.\r\nIn Freedom Boat Club, the average Freedom member continues to be almost three years younger than our typical boat buying customer and female Freedom members make up approximately 35% of our member base.\r\nWe continue to outperform the industry in attracting younger and more diverse first-time boat buyers, positioning us for very strong growth in years to come.\r\nThese trends are an extremely important validation of our strategy to secure a healthy future for Brunswick and are also favorable for the entire marine industry.\r\nI also wanted to share with you some awards that Brunswick received during the second quarter that provide more strategic proof points.\r\nBrunswick received 6, 2021 boating industry top product awards, including for the Mercury Marine V12 600-horsepower Verado and the Sea Ray 370 Sundancer Outboard we highlighted recently, but also for our Bayliner Element M15 entry-level boat, BEP's Smart Battery Hub, Attwood's Sahara Mk2 automatic bilge pump, and MotorGuide's Xi3 Kayak Trolling Motor.\r\nBrunswick has also been recognized by Forbes for the second year in a row as one of the best employers for women and ranked second overall in the engineering and manufacturing category.\r\nThe winners were chosen based on a survey of 50,000 US employees working for companies employing at least 1,000 people in their US operations and only 300 companies made the final list from the thousands of companies that were considered for the honor.\r\nFinally, Brunswick recently had three employees and a Freedom Boat Club franchisee, Bev Rosella, honored with a Women Making Waves Award from Boating Industry Magazine.\r\nWe are very proud of these women leaders.\r\nAs you know, equal opportunity, inclusion and diversity are cornerstones of our culture.\r\nI'll now provide some second quarter highlights on our segments and the overall marine market.\r\nOur Propulsion business continues to gain significant retail market share in outboard engines, especially in the higher horsepower categories, where we have focused higher levels of investment in recent years.\r\nFor the first half of the year, Mercury has gained share in each horsepower category over 75-horsepower, with outsized gains in nodes in excess of 200-horsepower.\r\nI'm also pleased to announce that we began shipping the new 600-horsepower V-12 Verado engine in late June, and as anticipated, demand has been extremely strong.\r\nWe're essentially sold out of the V-12 production slots for the remainder of 2021.\r\nAnd we estimate that just during the back half of 2021, we will sell more outboard engines in this above 500-horsepower class that was sold in the entire prior history of the outboard industry.\r\nGiven the surging demand in the current environment and new product launches planned in the coming years, Mercury is accelerating additional capacity investments at its primary manufacturing center in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, in order to maximize its ability to serve the market and capture further share.\r\nOur Parts and Accessories businesses experienced significant topline and earnings growth and significantly overdrove expectations in the quarter due to outstanding execution, robust aftermarket demand driven by elevated boating participation and favorable weather conditions in many areas.\r\nThe Advanced Systems Group, which has a larger OEM component to its business and also serves certain non-marine segments, benefited from prior year comparisons as a result of Q2 2020 customer COVID-related plant shutdowns.\r\nAs a result, ASG realized significant growth across all product categories and delivered strong operating margins that were accretive to the overall segment.\r\nFinally, as I mentioned earlier, in late June, our Advanced Systems Group strengthened its product and brand portfolio and significantly expanded its scale and capabilities by announcing the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Navico.\r\nThis action will further accelerate our ACES strategy and will enhance our ability to provide complete innovative digital solutions to our consumers and comprehensive integrated systems offerings to our OEM customers.\r\nWe believe this transaction will close in the second half of 2021.\r\nOur Boat segment had another outstanding quarter, posting its second consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins despite significant supply chain uncertainty, while delivering output consistent with our production plans for the year.\r\nWe ended the second quarter with historically low pipeline inventory levels due to consistent strong retail demand for our products.\r\nGiven the continued robust retail demand and our dealers' continued desire to take all available product, our 2021 production slots are now sold out for the calendar year, with five brands completely sold out through the 2022 model year.\r\nIn fact, the sum of our wholesale orders for 2022 model year product is already roughly equal to our projected 2021 full year wholesale Boat Group revenue.\r\nWe continue to hire additional new production employees at most facilities to maintain production consistent with our stated plan Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # Brunswick Corporation's outstanding performance continued in Q2 2021, driven by strong retail demand and exceptional operational execution. All business segments posted robust growth, with Propulsion gaining market share in outboard engines and Parts & Accessories benefiting from a surge in boating activities. The Boat segment delivered another quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins. Despite supply chain challenges, Brunswick has efficiently managed disruptions and maintained production schedules. The company has increased its 2021 guidance, projecting adjusted operating margin growth of 150-180 basis points, net sales between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $8. Brunswick's favorable demographic trends, including a younger and more diverse boat buyer base, position the company for future growth. The expansion of its product and brand portfolio through the acquisition of Navico further strengthens its ACES strategy. With robust retail demand and strong production plans in place, Brunswick anticipates a positive second half of 2021 and continued growth in the years to come.</s>"}

rightsizing our store fleet; expanding our digital and technology teams; adding to our vendor and regional carrier networks; and investing in marketing with an emphasis on digital and social.\r\nThroughout the late spring and summer, our customers took advantage of the warm weather and an increase in social activities.\r\nWe were there for all their outfitting needs.\r\nProduct acceptance was strong across brands, continuing momentum from the past several quarters.\r\nOnce again, we reduced markdowns and promotions, tightly managed inventories, and made strategic investments across marketing, technology and fulfillment to support near- and long-term growth.\r\nOur proven playbook worked and we achieved our best second quarter operating income and operating margin since 2008.\r\nBefore I turn to results, just a quick PSA.\r\nAs we continue to lap significant impacts from COVID, we will be providing comparisons to both second quarter 2020 and 2019 where applicable.\r\nAnd due to temporary COVID-driven store closures last year, we do not plan to disclose comparable sales.\r\nSecond quarter total sales rose 24% to last year and we were up 3% compared to Q2 2019.\r\nOur largest market, the US, led with sales up 31% on a one-year and 11% on a two-year basis.\r\nResults speak to customer retention and spend and to new customers discovering our brands.\r\nBy channel, total global store sales rose 55% from last year and we're down 20% from 2019.\r\nI'm very proud of our stores performance, which was achieved despite permanent closures as well as ongoing restrictions in EMEA.\r\nAs a reminder, during fiscal 2020, we proactively closed 137 locations, removing 1.1 million under productive gross square feet from our store base.\r\nWe continue to execute against our number one transformation initiative, Global Store Network Optimization, to further align with our customers' shifting shopping behaviors.\r\nEven with aggressive store sales growth, digital did not skip a beat and remained a solid as stores reopened.\r\nDigital sales held steady to 2020 levels and grew 52% from 2019.\r\nResults are further proof of our ongoing evolution into a digital-first global omnichannel retailer and should yield sustainable operating margin benefits.\r\nOur total sales growth has been healthy as evidenced by our significant gross margin expansion.\r\nFor the quarter, we achieved our best Q2 gross margin rate since 2009.\r\nOur total Company gross margin rate increased 450 basis points on a one-year and 590 basis points on a two-year basis.\r\nWe reduced the depth and breadth of promotions compared to last quarter and last year.\r\nWhile customer reaction to products has continued to be strong, we have not and will not step away from our inventory discipline.\r\nThis is one of the key COVID learnings we will continue to apply going forward.\r\nReflecting our strong top line and gross margin performance, combined with ongoing tight expense controls, our operating margin rate was over 1,100 basis points compared to last year and 1,800 basis points compared to Q2 2019.\r\nThough we benefited from a good consumer environment, especially in the US, our results also reflect the body of work done by our global teams to dramatically improve our product, voice and experience.\r\nSince I became CEO in 2017, our brands have evolved with our customers and we have focused on being there and supporting them for all their lifestyle needs.\r\nSpeaking of those lifestyle needs, let's take a moment to talk about some major fashion wins that applied companywide.\r\nMany have asked me about the current denim cycle.\r\nThere is a ton of newness and interest in jeans and it has been great for our brands, especially as it is one of our top three categories on an annual basis and even more important in the back half of the year.\r\nOur teams have done an absolutely amazing job staying on top of current denim trends.\r\nWe are viewed as a premier denim destination with newer styles representing over 40% of our jeans volume, up from 25% last year, and our customer is not waiting for sales to get what they want.\r\nIn the second quarter, we reduced promotions within this category well below 2020 and 2019 level.\r\nWe have [Phonetic] high-rise, wider legs, including mom, dad, straight and flare;

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.\r\nThese materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.\r\nThese statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.\r\nInformation about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.\r\nI'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through the results and our outlook.\r\nFirst, Q2 was an outstanding quarter.\r\nWe grew revenue 22%, earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year.\r\nAdditionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog, up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2.\r\nSecond, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter.\r\nIn Products and Systems Integration, revenue was up 24% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies.\r\nAnd in Software and Services, revenue was up 19%, and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.\r\nThis strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission-critical integrated ecosystem.\r\nAnd finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.\r\nOur Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion, up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX.\r\nThe GAAP operating earnings were $370 million, and operating margins were 18.8% of sales compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter.\r\nNon-GAAP operating earnings of $482 million, up $123 million or 34% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.4% of sales, up from 22.2% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, inclusive also of higher costs related to employee incentive compensation this year.\r\nGAAP earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $0.78 in the year ago quarter.\r\nThis increase was primarily due to increased sales volume, improved operating leverage, a lower tax rate related to the release of valuation allowance and lower reorganization charges in the current quarter.\r\nNon-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 compared to $1.39 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments.\r\nopex in Q2 was $477 million, up $51 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.\r\nTurning to cash flow.\r\nQ2 operating cash flow was $388 million compared with $209 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $326 million compared with $155 million in the prior year.\r\nThese increases in cash flows were primarily due to higher sales and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash taxes.\r\nCapital allocation for Q2 included $121 million in cash dividends, $102 million in share repurchases at an average price of $206.85 per share and $62 million of CapEx.\r\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt and redeemed $324 million of outstanding senior notes due in 2023.\r\nSubsequent to quarter end, we acquired Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, and we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolve, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution.\r\nMoving to our segment results.\r\nQ2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security.\r\nRevenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million.\r\nOperating earnings were $194 million or 16.2% of sales, up from 13.5% in the prior year on higher sales and improved operating leverage, inclusive of higher costs related to incentive compensation.\r\nSome notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include a $37 million P25 order for the Kentucky State Police, a $36 million P25 upgrade for a state in the US, a $30 million P25 order from MARTA in Atlanta, a $29 million P25 devices order for a large US state and local customer, and a $5 million video security order, our largest single fixed video order from a US federal customer to date.\r\nMoving to the Software and Services segment.\r\nQ2 revenue was $773 million, up 19% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.\r\nRevenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $9 million.\r\nOperating earnings were $288 million or 37.2% of sales, up 210 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, improved operating leverage and also inclusive of higher compensation related incentives this year.\r\nSome notable Q2 wins in this segment include, an $18 million French MOI body-worn camera frame agreement, a $15 million license plate recognition software extension with US based customer, a $10 million P25 multiyear services extension for Ohio's statewide network, and a $10 million P25 maintenance renewal with the US federal customer.\r\nAdditionally, we launched Command Central Suite, Public Safety's, first cloud-native 911 case-call to case closure solution.\r\nLooking at our regional results, North America Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software.\r\nInternational Q2 revenue was $659 million, up 25%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software.\r\nWe saw strong growth in EMEA during the quarter, while in Asia Pac growth was minimal as the region continues to navigate impacts from COVID-19.\r\nEnding backlog was a Q2 record of $11.2 billion, up $741 million compared to last year, driven by $660 million of growth in North America and $81 million of growth internationally.\r\nSequentially, backlog was down $57 million, driven by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN, partially offset with growth in LMR products.\r\nSoftware and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multiyear service contracts.\r\nAnd sequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven again primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.\r\nProducts backlog was up $484 million compared to last year and $73 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.\r\nTurning to our outlook.\r\nWe expect Q3 sales to be approximately up 10% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.09 and $2.14 per share.\r\nThis assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24% a year.\r\nAnd for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9%, and we now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share.\r\nThis increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.\r\nI thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call.\r\nFirst, our results for the quarter were excellent.\r\nWe achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well.\r\nAdditionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the continued s Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before we begin, I'd like to review the safe harbor statement.\r\nDuring the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nAdditionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call.\r\nWe do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information.\r\nI will now turn the conference over to our president and chief executive officer, Matthew Lambiase.\r\nI'll make some brief comments, then Mohit will discuss the changes in the portfolio and Rob will then review our financial results.\r\nI believe the first six months of 2020 will go down in the financial history books as one of the most volatile periods in modern times.\r\nThe U.S. economy went from excellent to dismal in the span of just a few months and the financial markets, especially fixed income, experienced record volatility and record intervention from the government.\r\nIn our space, many levered investors were caught off guard by the swiftly falling asset price, and they were forced to sell at the low point of the market.\r\nFortunately, Chimera was able to navigate through this difficult period by executing transactions which enabled us to retain our high-yielding and unique mortgage credit portfolio.\r\nIt's important to understand that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to recreate our portfolio in the current low interest rate environment and its retention affords Chimera the ability to pay a meaningful dividend, which we would not have if the assets had been sold.\r\nIn the quarter, we took several actions that helped us augment our liquidity.\r\nWe issued a $374 million three-year convertible bond, we entered into a $400 million three-year revolving loan facility arranged by Ares Capital and we executed three new mortgage securitizations, totaling over $1 billion, which significantly reduced our loan warehouse exposure and helped reopen the mortgage securitization market, which is a primary source for Chimera's long-term financing.\r\nAdditionally, during the period, we negotiated longer-term and non-mark-to -- longer-term and non-mark-to-market repo finance facilities for our mortgage loans and credit-related assets.\r\nWe now have approximately 75% of our credit borrowings on longer-term facilities and over 50% of them have no mark-to-market or limited mark-to-market arrangements.\r\nWhile these actions have had the short-term effect of increasing financing costs, we believe the benefits over the long-term are significant.\r\nWe've strengthened our balance sheet, enabling us to further withstand additional market volatility, continue to produce attractive spread income and to make new investments when we see attractive asset opportunities.\r\nThis position is enviable, given the uncertain economic conditions and the low return environment that we're currently operating within.\r\nThe Federal Reserve has stated that they expect to keep the Fed funds rate zero bound for the next two years and that they will continue to buy large quantities of assets to support the financial markets and the U.S. economy.\r\nWe are present -- presently witnessing the effects of these actions.\r\nThe 10-year treasury yield is now roughly 55 basis points and a rate on a new 30-year mortgage dipped below 3% for the first time in history.\r\nCurrent market expectations are that we'll be in this low rate environment for several years to come, and that the returns on all financial assets will be also low into the future.\r\nWhile the Federal Reserve's asset purchases have not been directly focused on residential mortgage credit, their purchases have started solidifying the markets and senior mortgage bonds have witnessed significant price appreciation.\r\nWe would expect that over time, deeper credit subordinate residential bonds could see similar moves.\r\nChimera's portfolio of higher-yielding legacy assets should become ever more valuable as the Fed continues to buy assets and returns in the market become ever more scarce.\r\nResidential mortgage credit, due to the size of the market and the slow recovery of pricing, offered some of the best opportunities in the fixed income market.\r\nThe economics for loan securitization continues to be attractive as the credit curve remains steep.\r\nSenior front-end bonds are well bid, creating an opportunity to securitize loans and retain higher-yielding, back-end subordinate investments.\r\nThese subordinated bonds have high relative yield and the potential for meaningful appreciation should markets normalize.\r\nWe have executed three securitizations in the period and retained the subordinate tranches from those deals.\r\nLooking forward, we believe that there will be ample supply of loans for sale from the GSEs and banks, and this supply will create opportunities for us to make new investments for our portfolio.\r\nGiven the current low yield and low return environment, we think being able to create investments through securitization will allow us to continue to produce attractive results in this challenging market.\r\nWhile this has been a very difficult period to navigate through, we believe Chimera is well-positioned for the future.\r\nWe have materially reduced our exposure to mark-to-market risk on our repo financings, which should help us manage through bouts of volatility in the future.\r\nWe have been able to retain our legacy portfolio of assets, which will allow us to continue to produce meaningful dividends for our investors in what may be an extended period of low interest rates.\r\nThe retained portfolio also has the potential for book value appreciation if pricing returns to historical levels.\r\nAnd finally, we believe there are attractive opportunities currently available in the residential loan market and we have a team and a history of being able to use securitization to successfully create high-yielding investments for our portfolio.\r\nAs a result of unprecedented monetary and fiscal support provided by the government, the second quarter saw a material improvement in both the equity and fixed income markets.\r\nParts of the equity markets are flat to up year-to-date while treasury rates were stable in Q2.\r\nWith rates stable and the Fed rhetoric for a lower rate for the foreseeable future, volatility has subsided.\r\nThe crowding out effect created by the Fed's market intervention has been positive for all highly rated fixed income securities.\r\nThe Federal Reserve was mostly focused on agency securities and did not purchase residential mortgage credit.\r\nThe shortage of legacy credit assets available, after a slow start in April, new issue securitization volumes were brisk in the second quarter.\r\nSenior tranches of securitized residential product improved steadily with the strongest performance in the latter half of the second quarter.\r\nDuring the quarter, we focused on the liability side of our balance sheet and entered into three non-mark-to-market facilities to finance $2 billion of our non-agency portfolio.\r\nIn addition, we have limited mark-to-market on $611 million of non-agency securities.\r\nAs a result of these transactions, approximately 54% of our non-agency borrowings are not subject to full mark-to-market risk.\r\nAs of quarter end, the weighted average term to maturity has increased to 698 days from 223 days in the first quarter.\r\nTo reduce the risk on our warehouse lines, we completed three securitizations, totaling approximately $1.1 billion in seasoned, reperforming mortgage loans.\r\nMoving loans from warehouse to securitization is an important aspect of our portfolio strategy as it reduces the mark-to-market risk and improves risk metrics for the company.\r\nAfter the completion of this quarter's securitization, our residential mortgage loan warehouse stands at $263 million and is financed for one year without mark-to-market risk.\r\nCIM 2020-R3 issued in May had $438 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 5.28% and a weighted average loan age  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph

and Kristina Salen, WWE's Chief Financial Officer.\r\nTheir remarks will be followed by a Q&A session.\r\nActual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them.\r\nAdditionally, the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nAs you can see we're generating some pretty strong financial results in a very challenging environment.\r\nWe continue to produce content, we never missed a week in terms of producing content.\r\nIt shows the flexibility and our commitment to our audience, which we will always have.\r\nWe transitioned our flagship programs through our training facility.\r\nAnd then of course, to the Amway Center and then continued on to to what -- to something we called the ThunderDome was a great name, any event, it's a -- most of you have seen it.\r\nAnd there's nothing like it on television allows us to have live fans.\r\nThey're just not in seats.\r\nAnd some of the other things I do want to mention.\r\nCertainly, we -- our multi-year agreement with NBC U is on the big box service.\r\nTo my knowledge, I don't think there's any really big deal that's been announced ever since the COVID stuff began.\r\nI really think that's pretty extraordinary on their part, and definitely on our part as well.\r\nAnd again, we just -- this agreement is really awesome for our WWE fans, our W Universe, as we call it, it's just gives them more -- more value, not just the WWE 999, which is a great value for what we do.\r\nBut then again, they for less money, they pick up our, our network, as well as all sorts of entertainment.\r\nSo it's great for our fans.\r\nI think that Nick and Stephanie and Kristina are going to provide a little more perspective on this development.\r\nLooking ahead to 2021.\r\nNow, we expect to continue to manage the challenges of the COVID environment, and it continues on.\r\nWe no doubt will expect a gradual return to ticketed audiences.\r\nAnd that is something that, sure, OK, we have live events, but live events make any money, you're going to get 20% capacity, 30%, 50%, whereas you breakeven, and so best to be determined by anyone who's in the live event business and hardly anyone has a handle on exactly when that's going to happen.\r\nNonetheless, we are ready.\r\nWe are the most flexible, adaptable media company in the world.\r\nWe can turn something around as far as a live event in six weeks.\r\nAnd it just speaks to our ability to innovate as a media company and continue to, in this current environment, create long term value.\r\nSo that's generally pretty much where we are.\r\nAnd, Nick, take it away.\r\nA week and a half ago, we made what we believe was a big announcement regarding WWE and Peacock.\r\nStarting on March 18, the entire WWE Network and its content will shift to Peacock in the United States.\r\nThis includes WrestleMania, our vast library and all of our pay-per-view events, starting with Fastlane on March 21.\r\nAs part of this partnership, WWE will maintain access to valuable audience data.\r\nAs we all know, Peacock is free to Comcast, Xfinity and Cox Cable customers.\r\nSo watching Fastlane and subsequently WrestleMania on April 10 and 11th will be free to all of those consumers.\r\nAdditionally, WWE Network will be available for $4.99 a month on the ad supported Peacock tier, which is half the price that Vince just mentioned, of $9.99 a month.\r\nThe price we have been charging for WWE Network in the United States and will continue to be no upcharge of any kind, for any of our events.\r\n499 price is the all in price for our great library and pay per view in ring action.\r\nIn addition to the office Saturday Night Live, Modern Family to dick wolf franchises, the English Premier League and the Olympic Games.\r\nI believe the last time we all spoke in October; we collectively discussed how the recent org structure changes at NBC, you and Disney are indicative of the fact that streaming had become a top priority for both companies.\r\nMany months in advance of those org structure changes, we started to engage in deep conversations with multiple buyers in the marketplace about a potential deal.\r\nUltimately, we felt like the partnership with Peacock was the right move at the right time for our fans and shareholders.\r\nIt was Vince McMahon and WWE who were the first movers from closed circuit to pay per view.\r\nIt was Vince and WWE that were the first movers out of pay per view and into the SVOD world in 2014.\r\nAnd WWE is now again the first mover from a stand-alone SVOD for partnering with a media conglomerate that has tremendous assets, reach and promotional power.\r\nWith the Peacock deal closed domestically, our focus now shifts to international markets.\r\nIn addition to distributing our great domestic content internationally, our focus is to also develop content that is specifically targeted to fans in certain international territories.\r\nTwo examples of this I'd like to discuss here today.\r\nWe recently produced a two hour in ring special with our partner in India, Sony, which featured our developing Indian Superstars.\r\nThe event, which premiered across Sony's platforms on India's Republic Day was available on Sony TEN one, Sony TEN three and Sony MAX, which have a combined reach of 50 million households, as well as on Sony's streaming platform SonyLIV.\r\nThe event took place at the WWE ThunderDome to an all Indian virtual audience.\r\nIt was announced in Hindi and English, and incorporated stunning and contemporary elements of Indian culture.\r\nThe international music sensation known as Spinning Canvas, executed an amazing performance in honor of India's national holiday.\r\nWe await for live plus seven numbers, which will obviously substantially add to the total viewership number.\r\nWe believe this event will further grow our product in India, which is already a robust WWE market and demonstrates our commitment to our partner, Sony, and our WWE fans in India.\r\nThis event is a credit to Vince, Paul Levesque, otherwise known as Triple H and the entire creative and production team who put together this event during a pandemic, while also producing three to four other live in-ring shows a week.\r\nYou can look forward to more from us in India along these lines.\r\nThe second area of our international focus is Latin America and localizing content tailored toward that region.\r\nA key part of our strategy is bringing in authentic talent who resonate with particular international markets.\r\nYou may have seen or read that on the Royal Rumble pay-per-view this past Sunday, Puerto Rican Superstar Bad Bunny performed his new hit single Booker T, which is based on our WWE Hall of Fame Superstar of the same name.\r\nAn internationally acclaimed recording artist, Bad Bunny's songs were streamed on Spotify more than 8.3 billion times in 2020, helping to make him the most streamed artist in the world that year.\r\nThen low and behold, at the instigation of one of WWE's up and coming Puerto Rican stars, Damian Priest, Bunny got physically involved later in the night, setting the stage for future storylines.\r\nAs of this past Wednesday, this collaboration has led to over 35 million total video views and 2.5 million engagements across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\r\nTotal media impressions to date are nearly 170 million, and it was reported on by the top sports and entertainment properties ranging from ESPN to Rolling Stone to Telemundo to TMZ.\r\nAnd within 24 hours, the co-branded Bad Bunny WWE merchandise became the hottest selling drop we've had on record on our e-commerce platform, WWE Shop.\r\nAn idea which was born simply from seeing the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine last October, has evolved into one of the most engaging pop culture collaborations in our history, with a targeted focus on the Latinx community.\r\nLook for more of us in the -- look for more of this, excuse m Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # WWE highlighted its financial performance in a challenging environment, reporting record revenue and profit for the year. A key development is its strategic partnership with NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service, which will host WWE Network content starting March 18. This deal provides greater value to subscribers and expands WWE's reach to over 33 million Peacock users. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, WWE remained committed to producing content, transitioning its flagship programs to the ThunderDome and later Tropicana Field for live virtual fan experiences. The company anticipates a gradual return to ticketed live events but estimates a revenue loss of over $90 million due to the pandemic. However, TV production costs will increase with the ThunderDome's continued use and the return of furloughed employees. WWE projects adjusted OIBDA for 2021 between $270 million and $305 million, with revenue growth offset by increasing expenses. The company also emphasized its financial outlook in a post-COVID world, noting that TV production costs may decline but will likely remain higher than pre-pandemic levels due to schedule adjustments. Despite the challenges, WWE believes it is well-positioned for long-term success and will continue to innovate across all business lines.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nBefore we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2.\r\nDiscussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\r\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.\r\nAs a reminder, we've entered the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction.\r\nSo we will not be able to comment on our spectrum holdings or strategy.\r\nNow let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter.\r\nIn the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis.\r\nReported results include a net pre-tax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pre-tax charge of approximately $247 million, which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and $103 million related to a severance charge for voluntary separations under our existing plans.\r\nExcluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the third quarter compared to $1.25 a year ago.\r\nPlease note, our results include two months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo funds closed on September 1.\r\nWe had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth.\r\nThis was supported by a strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth.\r\nThis definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high quality offerings.\r\nAs I said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our number one position in the market.\r\nOur strategy remains unchanged, and we're delivering on everything we promised.\r\nAnd we're gaining momentum on all of five vectors of growth.\r\nWe are more passive to grow than antibody else and we're confident with our growth targets for outer years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter.\r\nAs an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year.\r\nWe now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high-end of our prior guidance.\r\nAnd adjusted earnings per share or $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35.\r\nWe remain on track to achieve our targeted capex levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption into the supply chain.\r\nOur team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band build and that we have devices that our customer wants.\r\nOur operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in industry, which I've been so impressed by since I joined Verizon.\r\nAnd in times like these, it matters.\r\nLet's talk about business.\r\nWe continue to provide a best-in-class experience across the board.\r\nOn the network front, third-parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience.\r\nThis includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and JD Power for the 27th consecutive time.\r\nOur network team is doing a great job.\r\nOn the commercial front, we've got great momentum in the 5G adoption with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G capable device.\r\nThis is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before.\r\nFor context, 12 months of the 4G launched, 10% of the devices were on 4G.\r\nLess than 12 months after 5G DSS launch, more than the double were on 5G devices, and it's growing at the rapid pace.\r\nThis combined with our millimeter wave strategy is an important combination, and that is paying off.\r\nIn the third quarter, the total millimeter wave usage more than double sequentially.\r\nWe're doing more gigabit of usage in a month now than we did in all the first quarter.\r\nIn some or more established build outs, we're seeing more than 20% of usage of millimeter wave.\r\nAnd we are on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year end.\r\nFor Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios.\r\nAnd finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with the sale of the Verizon Media Group in September depending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bonds, which is a vital step toward our net-zero goal in 2035.\r\nAll this was accomplished in tandem with a strong quarter results.\r\nWhen it comes to the finances, we are on track to meet and exceed all our 2021 guidance.\r\nWe expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-Band.\r\nWe continued to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios.\r\nWe have a diversified path to revenue growth with all five vectors contributing.\r\nEBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year.\r\nAnd on an adjusted basis, earnings per share was up 12.8%.\r\nOur capital allocation stands firm.\r\nWe invest in our business to create shareholder value.\r\nWe continued to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15th consecutive year.\r\nAnd Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction.\r\nAs we said last quarter, our guidance raise is broad-based and across all our five vectors of growth.\r\nConsumer segment EBITDA increased by 2% driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth.\r\nThe service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher valued price plans as well as high quality net adds, but our growth is more than that.\r\nMuch of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and Mobile Edge Compute.\r\nOur strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to detect for our customers includes Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G, millimeter wave and C-Band.\r\nWhen it comes to the Mobile Edge Compute, we are the Mobile Edge Compute leader, both in public and private.\r\nAnd we just announced a private Mobile Edge Compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with.\r\nAnd this just scratches the surface on how we'll continue to utilize our assets.\r\nWe're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band.\r\nBefore I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion.\r\nWe are on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G.\r\nTo date, 5G Home is in 57 markets and the 4G LTE Home in over 200 markets across all 50 states.\r\nIn addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance of Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint.\r\nWe are on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year.\r\nYou can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 '21 earnings call.\r\nAnd now, Matt, over to you.\r\nI'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance.\r\nAs we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself, but on a high value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward.\r\nBy delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we receive from every connection.\r\nAs you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results.\r\nIn the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The company undertakes no obligation to update this information.\r\nWhitestone's third quarter earnings news release and supplemental operating and financial data package have been filed with the SEC and are available on our website www.\r\nwhitestonereit.com in the Investor Relations section.\r\nNow over to Jim Mastandrea, our Chairman and CEO, to update you on our third quarter results.\r\nOperating portfolio occupancy increased to 90.2% from 89.9% last quarter and annualized base rent increased to $20.41 from $19.95 last quarter.\r\nOur overall foot traffic at our centers in 3Q '21 was 35% higher than the same quarter in 2020.\r\nWith the resurgence of the COVID through its delta variant, we maintained a steady, but slightly lighter pattern versus 2Q '21.\r\nWe continue to experience active recurring traffic from existing and new community members visiting our centers as population shifts continue with the ongoing migration from corporations and individuals to Arizona and Texas.\r\nRegarding our financial performance for the quarter, revenue grew by 9% to $32.4 million this quarter compared to $29.9 million in 3Q '20.\r\nSame-store net operating income growth of 7% in this quarter and 8% in Q2 was driven by increases in occupancy and annual base rent per square foot as previously noted, as well as positive leasing spreads.\r\nA key financial indicator for REIT is FFO.\r\nFunds from operations core was $0.25 per share and $0.75 per share in the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 respectively.\r\nAlong with this noted growth, we continue to make progress toward one of our long-term goals of deleveraging the trust.\r\nWe reduced our debt to EBITDA, which is now 8.1 times down from 9.4 times a year ago.\r\nEqually important to the trust is our dividend, which we consider sacred.\r\nRegarding our quarterly dividend, we now have paid dividends to our shareholders for the 134th consecutive months since our IPO.\r\nOur dividend yield of 4.3% remains at a premium and our payout ratio to FFO core is exceptionally strong at 42%.\r\nThis quarter we reactivated our external growth plan with the acquisition of Lakeside Market in Plano, Texas at a purchase price of $53.25 million.\r\nImportantly, this acquisition did not require any additional corporate overhead, which is a key component toward our attaining economies of scale.\r\nAlong with this acquisition, we're actively pursuing additional properties in our strong pipeline of assets in Austin, Dallas and Phoenix.\r\nLooking at our current portfolio, we now have 4.6 million of our 5.1 million square feet of space leased.\r\nOur approximately 1,500 tenants' average lease space is 3000 square feet per tenant, complemented by a mix of larger square footage leases by our grocery anchors.\r\nOur strong tenant relationships and rigorous vetting process ensures the quality of our revenue for our portfolio and stability of our cash flow.\r\nI would like to point out that our tenant improvement costs to bring a new smaller tenant into one of our centers is much lower per square foot than the cost of a big box tenant.\r\nBy doing so, we spread our risk among a group of tenants in a relatively the same space as a larger tenant, achieve higher rent per square foot, annual escalators of 2% or 3% and some of our tenants pay percentage lease of revenues.\r\nIn addition, typically our tenants pay taxes, insurance and common area maintenance.\r\nOur strong leasing activity is one of the key drivers and performance this quarter.\r\nSome important metrics to highlight that our new lease count for 3Q '21 is 38 versus 35 in the prior quarter and 32 in the prior year.\r\nOur leasing spreads for 3Q '21 are 5.4% versus 3.1% in the prior quarter and 2.9% in the prior year, both of which are moving in a positive direction.\r\nIn summary, the update I've shared with you today highlights, in particular, our business model continues to perform exceptionally well.\r\nOur leasing strategy focusing on entrepreneurial tenants continues to produce consistent results.\r\nAnd most notably, we are continuing to make good progress to achieving our long-term goals.\r\nWhile we are pleased with our continued improving performance, we know that the work ahead of us is cut out, but our team remains committed to serving our shareholders and increasing long-term value.\r\nI appreciate the opportunity to share some great results for the third quarter.\r\nDuring the quarter, our best-in-class geography and strategically designed tenant mix have produced strong top line and bottom line growth, and our long-term focus and day-to-day execution have allowed us to make significant progress toward our long-term goals of scaling our infrastructure and improving our overall debt leverage.\r\nThe MSAs that we operate in, continue to see significant population migration and corporate relocations producing jobs from other areas of the country.\r\nThis is best evidenced by record leasing activity, occupancy and annualized base rent growth, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter topline revenue, NOI and FFO growth, robust leasing spreads, strong same-store NOI growth, reduced debt levels and interest cost resulting in improved debt leverage metrics and greater scale of our G&A infrastructure.\r\nTotal revenue was $32.4 million for the quarter, up 6% from the second quarter and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.\r\nThe revenue growth was driven by a sequential 0.3% increase in same-store occupancy from Q2 and a 1.2% improvement compared to Q3 of 2020.\r\nWe are also benefiting from our ABR per square foot, rising 2.3% sequentially and 5.3% from a year ago along with lower and collectability reserves.\r\nProperty net operating income was $23.2 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.\r\nQ3 same-store NOI increased 7% from Q3 of 2020.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $0.06 per share, up from $0.02 per share in the prior year quarter.\r\nFunds from operations core was $0.25 per share in the quarter, up 9% from the second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date FFO core per share was $0.75 per share, up 9% from the same period of 2020.\r\nOur leasing activity in the quarter continued to build on our very strong first and second quarters, with 38 new leases, representing 90,000 square feet of newly occupied spaces.\r\nOur new leasing activity for the nine months was 56% higher on a square foot basis than 2020 and 48% higher than 2019.\r\nOn a total lease value basis, our new leasing activity for the nine months was 112% higher than 2020 and 191% higher than 2019.\r\nLeasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been a positive 8.5% over the last 12 months and third quarter leasing spreads increased by 5.4% on new leases and 14.1% on renewal leases signed.\r\nOur annualized base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis at the end of the quarter grew 2.3% to $20.41 from $19.95 in the previous quarter and increased 5.3% from a year ago.\r\nTotal operating portfolio occupancy stood at 90.2%, up 1.2% from a year ago and up 0.3% from the second quarter.\r\nIncluding our newest acquisition Lakeside Market, our total occupancy is 89.9%, up 1% from a year ago.\r\nOur collections continued to be very strong in the third quarter, reflecting the overall high collection levels and collections on tenants classified as cash basis.\r\nOur tenant receivables decreased by $1 million, an improvement of 4.4% from year-end 2020.\r\nOur interest expense was 4% lower than a year ago, reflecting our lower net debt.\r\nAt quarter end, we had $22 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable.\r\nIncluded in this amount is $17.8 million of accrued straight-line rents and $1.3 million of agreed upon deferrals.\r\nOur agreed upon deferral balance is down 43% from year-end reflecting tenants honoring their payment plans.\r\nTurning to our balance sheet.\r\nSince early last year, we have implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity.\r\nOur total net debt was $616.6 million, down $20.5 million from a year ago, improving our debt to gross book real estate c Please summarize this transcript in exactly one

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm Steve Rolfs, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sensient Technologies Corporation.\r\nDuring our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide investors with additional information to evaluate the Company's performance and improve the comparability of results between reporting periods.\r\nThese non-GAAP financial results should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.\r\nOur actual results may differ materially, particularly in view of the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental attempts at remedial action and the timing of a return of more normal economic activity.\r\nWe urge you to read Sensient's filings, including our 10-K, our second quarter 10-Q and our forthcoming third quarter 10-Q for a description of additional factors that could potentially impact our financial results.\r\nPlease bear these factors in mind when you analyze our comments today.\r\nDue to changes we have made to our portfolio and the divestitures we announced last year, we are updating our group and product lines.\r\nThe most notable change is that our flavors and fragrances segment will now be named the flavors and extracts segment.\r\nYou will also notice some small changes to the names we use for some of our product lines.\r\nSensient's focused portfolio strengthens our ability to service the food, pharmaceutical and personal care markets.\r\nWe will continue to report the three divested product lines of fragrances, yogurt fruit preparations and inks as long as these product lines impact our comparisons.\r\nNow we'll hear from Paul.\r\nAnd I'm pleased to report that results were in line with our expectations and our overall guidance for the year.\r\nI'm very pleased with the continued revenue and profit growth in our flavors and extract group as well as our food and pharmaceutical business in the color group.\r\nOur Asia Pacific group also posted solid profit growth in the quarter.\r\nOverall, each of our groups performed well despite the adverse impact of COVID-19.\r\nCOVID-19 continues to be a net negative to the Company.\r\nThe market decline in the makeup industry continues to impact the color group's personal care business.\r\nAnd on a geographic basis, we continue to see headwinds in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America.\r\nIn the midst of this pandemic, we have ensured our employees are safe and healthy, our facilities remain open, our supply chain remains strong and we have delivered our products on time to our customers.\r\nBased on current trends, I expect that we will deliver on our earnings per share outlook for the year as the foundation of our business remains strong.\r\nOur focus over the years on customer service, on-time delivery and sales execution has led to a high level of revenue from new product wins during the second half of 2019 and the first half of this year.\r\nFurthermore, as the pandemic continues and new product development at certain companies has slowed, we have focused on regaining lost business and gaining share at our customers.\r\nThis focus, coupled with lower overall sales attrition, is paying off in our results and should continue to benefit future periods.\r\nLast year at this time, we announced three divestitures.\r\nIn the second quarter, we completed the sale of inks.\r\nAnd I'm pleased to say that we completed the sale of the yogurt fruit prep business during the third quarter.\r\nThis is our second completed divestiture in 2020, and I am optimistic that we will complete the divestiture of fragrances in the near future.\r\nAs I mentioned last year, the divestiture of these three businesses allows us to focus on our key customer markets, food, pharmaceutical and personal care.\r\nI'm very pleased with the progress of our flavors and extracts group this year.\r\nThe group had an impressive quarter with adjusted local currency revenue growth of 13% and profit growth of 24%.\r\nThis is the third straight quarter of revenue growth, which has resulted in continued profit and margin improvement.\r\nThis growth is based on the group's focus on sales execution, which has resulted in a high win rate, a focus on retaining existing business and an overall decline in the group's attrition rate.\r\nAdditionally, the group's focus on transitioning the product portfolio to more value-added solutions and the reduction of its production cost structure from restructuring and ongoing initiatives is complementing the revenue growth and the overall improvement in the group's profit and margin.\r\nWithin the flavors and extracts group, the natural ingredients business had another strong quarter with local currency sales growth of 14.5% as a result of strong demand for seasoning, snacks and packaged foods.\r\nThis business has a solid foundation to deliver a consistent and reliable supply of high-quality natural ingredients to its customers.\r\nFlavors extracts and flavor ingredients also had a nice quarter, up 12% in local currency.\r\nThe business' strong technology platform in flavor modulation and enhancement, its clean label solutions and its applications expertise are leading factors in the growth of this business.\r\nOverall, the flavors and extracts group's operating profit margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter.\r\nLong term, I expect mid-single digit revenue growth with continued margin improvement for the group.\r\nNow turning to colors.\r\nRevenue for food and pharmaceutical colors was up low-single digits for the quarter.\r\nThe group continues to see solid demand for natural colors in the market.\r\nThere's also strong consumer interest in functional natural extracts and nutraceuticals, and the group's product portfolio and innovation are well positioned to support this demand.\r\nDespite the continued growth in food and pharmaceutical colors, revenue in personal care continues to be down as a result of the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the color makeup market.\r\nThe demand for makeup in Europe, North America and Asia continues to be down substantially for the year.\r\nGiven the uncertainty with COVID-19 and ongoing restrictions, I anticipate challenges for this cosmetics product line to continue.\r\nThe color group's adjusted operating profit increased 3% in the quarter.\r\nFood and pharmaceutical colors had a great quarter, generating profit growth of more than 20% and about 15% for the first nine months of 2020.\r\nHowever, the lower demand for makeup and other personal care products continues to be a drag on the group's profit performance.\r\nOverall, the color group's operating profit margin increased 110 basis points in this quarter.\r\nLong term, I continue to expect mid-single digit revenue growth from food and pharmaceutical colors as well as personal care once demand normalizes from the impacts of COVID-19.\r\nWe've made good product -- progress in our Asia Pacific group this year.\r\nSimilar to flavors and extracts and colors, the group has focused on sales execution and building a stronger customer service and technology-driven organization.\r\nThe group has created a solid infrastructure and has been focused on localizing production.\r\nDuring the quarter, the group had solid sales growth in certain regions.\r\nHowever, this growth was offset by declines in other regions, as government COVID-19 restrictions continue to significantly impact many sales channels.\r\nThe group had another strong quarter of profit growth, up approximately 15% in the quarter and 17% for the first nine months of 2020.\r\nThe group's operating profit margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter.\r\nThis was the third straight quarter of strong profit improvement.\r\nThe Asia Pacific group is well positioned for long-term growth.\r\nAnd I anticipate that as certain COVID-19-related restrictions ease, the group will resume mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth.\r\nOverall, I'm very pleased with the results of our groups this year.\r\nOur flavors and extract group is having a great year, and the  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

rentals of 2%; and financing of 16%.\r\nGross profit of $301 million improved about $17 million over prior year on growth across all segments.\r\nGross margin was 33%, which was slightly down from the same period last year, but an improvement from the last two quarters.\r\nSG&A was $236 million and approximately $3 million higher than prior year.\r\nSG&A was 26% of revenue, which was nearly a two point improvement over prior year.\r\nWithin SG&A, corporate expenses were $56 million, which was up about $7 million from prior year, largely due to higher employee variable related costs.\r\nR&D was $11 million or 1% of revenue, which was up approximately $4 million from prior year.\r\nDuring the quarter, we received the remaining insurance proceeds of $3 million for the Ryuk Ransomware attack.\r\nEBITDA was $96 million, an increase of $6 million over prior year, and EBITDA margin was 11%, which was flat to prior year.\r\nEBIT was $56 million, an increase of $8 million over prior year, and EBIT margin was 6%, which was a slight increase over prior year.\r\nInterest expense, including finance interest was $36 million.\r\nOur tax provision was a benefit of about $300,000 and includes a benefit related to a U.K. tax legislation change, which also contributed about $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter.\r\nShares outstanding were approximately 179 million.\r\nLet me now turn to each segment's performance.\r\nIt is important to note that the year-over-year comparison includes the impact of COVID.\r\nPrior year results saw a positive impact on e-commerce revenue and an adverse impact on SendTech and Presort.\r\nAs such, I will also provide growth rates from 2019 to 2021 for the larger transactional parts of our business.\r\nWithin e-commerce, revenue grew 3% to $418 million and also grew from first quarter levels.\r\nThe revenue growth over prior year was driven by our cross-border services and partially offset by lower domestic parcel and digital services.\r\nDomestic parcel volumes were $44 million in the quarter.\r\nCompared to the second quarter of 2019, e-commerce revenue grew 48%.\r\nDemand for our services continues to be strong as new business signings accelerated from the first quarter as we're getting merchants onboarded for peak season while balancing demand from current clients.\r\nWe also continue to have success with bundling our services which now represents close to 50% of all new business.\r\nEBITDA for the quarter was $8 million.\r\nEBIT was a loss of $11 million.\r\nBoth EBIT and EBITDA were meaningful improvements from prior year.\r\nWe also made significant progress sequentially where second quarter's EBIT margins improved nearly 400 basis points as compared to first quarter, as we were able to improve our productivity and work through some of the residual impact from last year's peak that we saw earlier in the first quarter.\r\nWe continue to work to improve service levels and make progress against our productivity initiatives within our domestic parcel services.\r\nWhile still dealing with industrywide concerns around high transportation costs and a competitive labor market.\r\nWe made progress on several unit economics as compared to the first quarter, with the greatest being around labor and transportation cost per piece.\r\nWe saw a reduction in our labor cost per piece in part due to the contribution of our new management talent, along with the maturation of our existing workforce.\r\nParcels processed per hour continued to improve from first quarter levels.\r\nTransportation cost per piece also improved versus prior quarter as we continue to better optimize our shipping lanes.\r\nOur improvement in execution, coupled with better network balancing are certainly yielding results.\r\nWe continue to invest in automation, including high-end sorters in our larger facilities and sort-to-light automation in our midsized facilities.\r\nWe also announced our partnership with Ambi Robotics last month, which we will be rolling out across our network over the next few years.\r\nThese initiatives take time to integrate, train our employees and produce results.\r\nAnd while we're seeing some early benefits, we expect to yield additional benefits d Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Today, I'm joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan.\r\nPlease join me on Slide two.\r\nTurning to Slide three.\r\nI'd like to briefly highlight that Emerson has been publishing a corporate social responsibility report for many years now.\r\nWe have renamed the report The Emerson Environmental, Social and Governance Report and are excited to highlight all of the goals, momentum and global standards that our organization is working toward.\r\nIn particular, our environmental sustainability framework, greening of Emerson, by Emerson and with Emerson, captures our internal sustainability efforts, our enablement of our customer sustainability journeys through our products and solutions and our collaboration efforts with various sustainability stakeholders.\r\nI encourage you to review the document next month when it is published.\r\nI'd like to briefly mention our recent Emerson Exchange Virtual Series, which took place from November through March.\r\nEmerson Exchange is a chance for our customer base to interact with other users, industry experts and Emerson technology leaders.\r\nDespite the obvious in-person limitations of the pandemic, Emerson had a tremendously successful virtual engagement with customers, focusing on digital transformation, sustainability, technology and many other topics.\r\nThis virtual framework dramatically expanded the reach of this already very popular user event.\r\nDue to the success of the hybrid format, we will likely be adopting such a format going forward.\r\nMore details to follow as the time and place for the next Emerson Exchange event is finalized.\r\nOver to you, Lal.\r\nI would like to say a few things before passing it on to Frank.\r\nFirstly, to our global team, three things.\r\nThis was one that was delivered based on strong execution, which required agility and creativity as we jumped over a number of hurdles over the last three months.\r\nThe result was top-class profit leverage over 40% across our operations, well done by everyone.\r\nMomentum is building, and it's more broadly today and across a large number of our markets than it was three months ago.\r\nThis expansion across both platforms, now as the cycle expands, will enable us to make critical technology investments, building on our strong differentiation and customer relevance.\r\nYou energize me every day in the journey and on the journey that we're taking together.\r\nSecondly, I would like to recognize David Farr, who stepped -- whose Board service concluded today after more than 20 years.\r\nJim is a highly qualified independent director who is extremely passionate about people, culture and the future of Emerson.\r\nI look forward to working alongside Jim and our entire Board.\r\nFrank, over to you.\r\nWe had a strong quarter, and I'd like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides.\r\nThe strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end markets, combined with the benefits from our cost reset actions, drove strong operating performance and strong financial results in the second quarter.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.97, ahead of our guidance midpoint of $0.89 and representing 9% growth versus the prior year.\r\nDemand strengthened significantly with sales ahead of expectations at 2% underlying growth and March orders toward the high end of expectations at 4% underlying growth.\r\nWithin that growth number for the orders, significantly, Automation Solutions continues its steady improvement in both orders and sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across all its lines of business and in all geographies with 11% sales growth and 21% orders growth for the trailing three months through March.\r\nThe cost reset benefits for the program that we implemented almost two years ago are being realized as planned, driving adjusted segment EBIT growth of 15% and 150 basis points of increased margin to 19.1%.\r\nAdditionally, cash flow continues to be strong, up 37% year-over-year with free cash flow up nearly 50%.\r\nThis represents 125% conversion of net earnings.\r\nWe continue to execute on the remaining elements of our cost reset actions.\r\nWith the bulk of it behind us at this point, we initiated $21 million of additional restructuring in the quarter.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide, if you would, for comments on the EPS, the earnings per share bridge.\r\nOperational performance was very strong in the quarter, adding $0.14 to adjusted EPS.\r\nAs we guided in February, stock compensation was a significant headwind in the quarter due to the mark-to-market impact, which was caused by the difference in the share price at the end of last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter.\r\nOf course, you'll recall that last year, share prices in general were all severely depressed with the onset of COVID and we closed last year's second quarter at $48 versus $90 this year.\r\nAnd that headwind was within $0.01 of the guidance that we gave you in February.\r\nTax, currency and other miscellaneous items netted to about $0.04 of tailwind and a small impact from share repurchase.\r\nSo in total, again, adjusted earnings per share was $0.97 versus the guide of $0.89.\r\nPlease go to the next slide for comments on the P&L.\r\nSo as I mentioned, underlying sales growth exceeded expectations at 2% and it was 6% on a reported basis, including acquisitions and currency.\r\nGross profit slipped just a bit, 10 basis points, mainly due to business mix, given the growth in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business.\r\nSG&A increased by 10 basis points, but the real story here is that excluding the stock compensation impact, operationally, it was down 220 basis points, indicative of the magnitude of the cost reduction activity and the flow-through of the benefits.\r\nWe had very strong leverage on SG&A, and the spend was actually down year-over-year when you exclude the impact of the stock comp.\r\nAdjusted EBIT margin was 18.2%, and our effective tax rate was within one point of last year.\r\nShare count at 603 million.\r\nAnd again, adjusted earnings per share at $0.97.\r\nIf you please turn to the next slide, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow.\r\nAdjusted segment EBIT increased 15% with the margin increasing 150 basis points to 19.1%, as I said earlier.\r\nLeverage on the volume and cost reset benefits offset the material cost headwinds that we did see in the quarter.\r\nAgain, stock comp was nearly a $100 million headwind.\r\nIt was partially offset by some other corporate items.\r\nAdjusted pre-tax earnings were down 20 basis points to 17.3%, again, as the impact of the mark-to-market on the stock comp [Indecipherable].\r\nOperating cash flow was very strong, almost a record again at $807 million, up 37%.\r\nFree cash flow at $707 million was up 48%, driven by the strong earnings and favorable balance sheet items.\r\nLastly, trade working capital was down to 16.8% of sales as the impact and the distortions from the COVID-related volume decline are beginning to normalize and as the businesses do a good job managing inventory as we return to growth.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide, we'll go through Automation Solutions.\r\nOrders continue to turn upward here.\r\nWe were at negative 5% on a trailing three-month basis, making good progress, and we're on the trajectory that we have been mapping out for several months.\r\nUnderlying sales were above expectations at negative 2%, and we're encouraged to see the continued sequential improvement in order rates underpinning the sales.\r\nChina was very strong, and they were favorable comps, but also due to good strength in discrete, chemical and energy markets.\r\nOur demand in North America improved sequentially, but it did lag other world areas.\r\nHowever, there are noteworthy pockets of growth, very encouraging signs in both discrete, life science, foo Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

Despite challenges from unprecedented input cost increases and elevated stock compensation, the company raised its full-year guidance to $3.90 plus or minus $0.05 in adjusted earnings per share. Underlying sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by robust demand in Commercial & Residential Solutions (11% growth) and early signs of recovery in Automation Solutions.

things that we've accomplished together over the past several years, none of this would have been possible.\r\nI've enjoyed getting to know many of you over the past several months and I have consistently been impressed with your positive attitude and exceptional professionalism.\r\nWe're so excited to have you join us as we embark on this new era of excellence.\r\nThis merger has been transformative for all of us yet our model remains unchanged.\r\nWe are one team with one focus.\r\nAs we began to come out of the depths of the pandemic, we talked about how KRG was positioned to seize upon any opportunities that may present themselves.\r\nIt was that very same posture that made the merger with RPAI possible resulting in one of the largest open-air owners in the country.\r\nYet despite the unprecedented stress and dislocation caused by COVID and despite the immense undertaking of completing the merger that impacted every single person at KRG, we were still able to produce a phenomenal quarter of results.\r\nIt all goes back to our 3 Ps, Properties, Processes and People and we absolutely excel on all 3 fronts.\r\nThe quality of our results also speaks volumes about the health of the retail environment.\r\nThe long-term viability of open-air retail real estate and the durability of our cash flows.\r\nOur property serve not only as a last-minute last mile fulfillment hub for retailers but as an access point for consumers and communities.\r\nThe demand for our great real estate is evident, not only in traffic which is up versus 2019, but also in the accelerated leasing volumes and resulting spreads.\r\nWe signed approximately 5,000 square feet in the third quarter including 7 anchor leases, 3 lease for grocers.\r\nIn the past 2 quarters, we leased over 1.2 million square feet which are unprecedented levels for our legacy portfolio.\r\nBlended lease spreads were 20.7% and 13.4% on a GAAP and cash basis respectively.\r\nOur lease rate continues to rebound.\r\nIt is now at 92.8% for the portfolio.\r\nThis 130 basis point increase from last quarter is another indication of the continuing recovery in our operation and -- operational and financial performance.\r\nThe outsize leasing volume continues to widen our total retail portfolio leased to occupied spread to 400 basis points with current sign not-open NOI of approximately $14 million.\r\nTogether with the legacy RPAI portfolio, we have signed not-open NOI of approximately $33 million.\r\nSaid another way, our stock is significantly undervalued.\r\nOne of the drivers behind the widening lease to occupied spread is the success, we are experiencing in our Anchor Acceleration program.\r\nWe signed another 5 anchor leases this quarter for a cumulative total of 12 anchor leases since the program's inception.\r\nThese 12 leases are expected to generate average cash yields of over 26% with comparable spreads of 14% on a cash basis.\r\nWhile the program as far from over, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made.\r\nLet's turn to a topic I'm sure you're all focused on.\r\nThe merger of RPAI and KRG is a great strategic match that lines up perfectly with many of the macro trends we're seeing impacting our industry.\r\nFirst, as is with everything in KRG, it's about the real estate.\r\nAs you can see from our operating results, our top quality assets are benefiting from being in high-growth, warmer and cheaper markets.\r\nThese low tax and business-friendly geographies continue to benefit from the highest population growth and corporate relocations.\r\nThis merger more than doubled the GLA and ABR that KRG owns in those markets.\r\nWe now have nearly 60% of our ABR in warmer and cheaper markets, 40% of which belongs in Texas and Florida alone.\r\nAn added benefit of the merger is that establishing a significant presence in select strategic gateway markets.\r\nThe combined portfolio now has 26% of value in superzip [Phonetic] neighborhoods, the second highest percentage in the sector.\r\nAdditionally, our portfolio of mix of predominantly grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers are now complemented by a vibrant mixed use assets, thereby providing greater optionality to help serve both retailers and consumers.\r\nMany of these mixed-use and lifestyle assets have experiential components that were disproportionately impacted by COVID and now are seeing a significant resurgence in demand, while customers reembrace the live, work and play environment.\r\nA final benefit, I'd like to point out is that KRG is now a top 5 open-air shopping center REIT.\r\nThe increased scale provide numerous operational and capital market benefits.\r\nOn the operational side, we'll be better able to serve retailers by having a balanced variety of additional high-quality assets.\r\nWe also believe the combined operations platform will lead to increased NOI margins across the portfolio.\r\nOn the capital market side, KRG will become a serial issuer of public bonds that will lower our debt cost and improve our risk profile.\r\nLikewise, the larger equity market cap will make our stock more liquid and expand the universe of potential equity investors.\r\nIn addition to the accretion from the merger, synergies will create a significant economic impact from the merger and Heath will address those momentarily.\r\nThat being said, we are just as excited about the value of our new entitled land.\r\nOur development philosophy has never been nor will it ever be a mandate.\r\nWe evaluate each project based on the needs of the underlying real estate, the timing of the development cycle and the resulting risk-adjusted returns.\r\nGiven this mantra, there are times where we may decide it's better to wait or take on a partner to pursue alternatives.\r\nOne example is The Corner.\r\nWe entered into a 50-50 joint venture to develop 285 apartment units and 24,000 square feet of ground floor retail.\r\nIn doing so KRG sold the land to the venture, will earn development fees and is expected to contribute no additional capital.\r\nWe will use this discipline to examine all of our real estate included -- including the newly acquired entitled land and determine the best course of action for each opportunity to maximize shareholder value.\r\nNo matter what of course of action -- course of action we will take, we will always keep in mind our best-in-class balance sheet.\r\nAs part of our due diligence, we had a third party value each of the entitled land parcels.\r\nWe believe the approximate value of this entitled land as is with no additional spend is between $125 and $180 million.\r\nThat represents a tremendous opportunity for KRG to showcase our capital allocation part.\r\nRegarding the integration of the merger, we are making excellent progress.\r\nWe were able to hit the ground running on day 1 due to our pre-close planning.\r\nWe not only determine what the combined team would look like, but each business unit had multiple meetings and established both how to integrate the team, their systems and how to operate going forward.\r\nNo integration of 2 companies is flawless but we are very pleased where we are to date.\r\nThis is a testament to our people.\r\nWe are a premier open-air shopping center REIT and I'm proud of the progress our team has made.\r\nKRG remains committed to its primary focus of continuing to grow operating cash flows.\r\nThe completed merger paired with a strong quarter of operational results is another step in the right direction.\r\nI can't emphasize enough how excited I am about the processes, properties and especially the people of KRG.\r\nI  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

The merger has significantly increased KRG's assets, with nearly 60% of ABR now located in these desirable regions, including 40% in Texas and Florida alone. Additionally, the portfolio now includes a mix of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers complemented by mixed-use assets. Notably, the blended lease spreads improved to 20.7% (GAAP basis) and 13.4% (cash basis), and leasing volumes remain strong with a signed not-open NOI of approximately $33 million for the combined portfolio. The integration of the merger is progressing well, with $21 million of annualized GAAP savings already achieved. Stand-alone Q3 results were strong, with NAREIT FFO per share of $0.25 and FFO as adjusted of $0.33. KRG's solid balance sheet and liquidity position were further enhanced by a Fitch Ratings upgrade to triple B with a stable outlook.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Our exceptional performance this quarter, among the broader market recovery, demonstrates the strengths of our global platform, resilient business model and continued operational and strategic execution of our long-term plan.\r\nFurther, we continue to advance our sustainability agenda and development of our related market-leading product capability.\r\nOur most recent responsible real estate survey reaffirm that reducing the environmental impact is a key priority across the industry for both real estate occupiers and investors.\r\nWe take pride in our 2020 JLL Global Sustainability Report, which highlights our latest initiatives including our commitment to net 0 carbon emissions by 2040 across all areas of operation, including client sites management globally as well as our need to be fully equipped to help clients in their own journey.\r\nWe changed the name of our Corporate Solutions Group to Work Dynamics to more clearly reflect that our technology-enabled and wide-ranging services help our clients enhance the productivity of their people as employees are increasingly empowered to make the decisions on how and where they work.\r\nOur suite of solutions also benefits the performance of their portfolios and help them realize their sustainability and broader ESG goals.\r\nI'd like to express my gratitude for our employees who continue to work diligently and provide outstanding service to our clients and community.\r\nThe pace of activity increased sharply throughout the first half of the year, leaving many of our teams over extended.\r\nThe tireless efforts and its ongoing challenges and uncertainties embody the strong culture of teamwork and collaboration at JLL.\r\nLet me briefly touch on the future of office, subject being closely analyzed by our best-in-class research team.\r\nWhile the actual long-lasting effects of the pandemic remain unclear, there are a couple of key points I would like to highlight.\r\nThe first is that the office will remain the center of the work ecosystem.\r\nWe believe that the pandemic has reinforced the important role that the office can play in fostering and cultivating each company's unique culture and innovation.\r\nThe second point is that employees are increasingly expecting, if not demanding, additional flexibility and the ability to choose where and how they work, leading to the doable presence of hybrid work.\r\nThese demands have also been coupled with health, wellness and safety becoming top of mind for employees.\r\nAs a result, employers are now increasingly evaluating holistic approaches to address these demands, which often require considerable investment into existing and new office space.\r\nWe imagine workspaces which serve to not only attract and retain employees but also enhance their sense of safety and well-being are becoming a new currency in the war for talent.\r\nThis leads me to conclude that the initial net impact on future space demand and footprints for investment-grade office buildings will be relatively minor.\r\nWe believe that the combination of growth from job creation, dedensification and the addition of collaboration space will broadly offset any anticipated reductions in workspace as companies continue to embrace hybrid work models.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that given the world-class capabilities of our project management business, we are well positioned to benefit from accelerated demand for these services as we assist our clients as they embark upon these transformations.\r\nThe increasing complexity required to create these global integrated workplace transformation will in turn demand more technology across not only the operations of the building but the entire ecosystem.\r\nWe are encouraged that our significant investment in technology and our desire to provide client access to leading-edge technology results in a significant competitive advantage.\r\nThe power of data leading to better decision-making will allow JLL to be in the center of this ecosystem.\r\nWe continue to work diligently with our clients as a strategic advisor as they transition to the new post-pandemic normal and assist in the development of hybrid work models centered around employee satisfaction and productivity.\r\nTurning to the market environment.\r\nTransaction activity saw sharp recoveries across the world.\r\nJLL's research reports that the tentative signs of improvement in global office leasing activity witnessed in the first quarter have solidified and continued throughout the second quarter.\r\nQuarterly global leasing volumes were 44% higher than a year ago.\r\nHowever, they are still 36% below Q2 2019.\r\nAcross all the three regions, quarterly leasing volumes are below where they were in 2019 with the U.S., the hardest hit at a 44% decline, while Europe and Asia Pacific recorded declines of 32% and 21%, respectively.\r\nOur tenant pricing conditions persist in most markets.\r\nWe are seeing a noticeable stabilization and headline rates.\r\nThe recovery across capital markets broadened in the second quarter with global transaction volumes marking a 103% increase on the trough a year ago and a 2% increase from Q2 2019.\r\nEach region posted significant year-on-year gains in transaction volumes with activity is particularly robust in markets with sectorial diversity and opportunities of scale.\r\nAllocations to the real estate sector are strengthening as lender diversity and risk appetite trend toward pre-pandemic normalcy.\r\nAssuming no major setback in the global fight against COVID-19, the positive trends recorded in the second quarter are anticipated to carry on in the second half, fueling continued recovery across the commercial real estate industry and global macro economy.\r\nFor that backdrop, I'm pleased to turn the attention toward our second quarter performance.\r\nOur exceptional results reflect the continued momentum across our business that we have witnessed since the depths of the pandemic.\r\nWe delivered excellent second quarter top and bottom-line performance, standard operating margins and continue to execute on our long-term strategy.\r\nConsolidated revenue rose 18% to $4.5 billion and fee revenue increased 41% to $1.8 billion in local currency.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA of $332 million represented an increase of over 200% from the prior year, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 18.5% from 8.3% in local currency, driven by the significant recovery of our transaction-based service lines, cost mitigation actions taken in 2020, realization of growth initiatives and select discrete items.\r\nAdjusted net income totaled $220.1 million for the quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $4.20.\r\nOur transaction-based service lines recorded significant growth across all three regions.\r\nLeasing benefited from strong demand in the industrial and life sciences sector while industrial and multifamily debt origination were key drivers for Capital Markets outperformance.\r\nWe recently passed the two-year anniversary of our acquisition of HFF and are pleased that the acquisition has delivered on both our strategic and financial ambitions despite the pandemic.\r\nAll of the key secular trends driving growth in our industry is increasing capital flows to real estate.\r\nThe addition of the HFF platform with its market-leading position in the U.S. allows us to not only become a top two player in the U.S. capital markets business but also cements the strengths of our global platform to forge greater ties with the world's largest investors.\r\nI also would like to provide an update on the financial synergies we projected when the HFF acquisition transaction was announced in 2019.\r\nA year ago, we achieved our first 12-month synergy target of $28 million despite unforeseen pandemic headwinds.\r\nHaving just passed the two-year anniversary of the acquisition, I'm pleased to say that we have achieved our target $50 million of synergies on a run rate basis, which we had originally predicted within a two- to three-year time frame.\r\nThe strong recovery in our transaction-based Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

McCool Jr. continues to achieve production milestones in support of launch early next year.\r\nAt Newport News, there were no significant contract awards to highlight for the quarter, so I will go right on to program status.\r\nCVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 83% complete, and the team remains focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones.\r\nCVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 90% complete, and the team remains focused on achieving key test program milestones to support redelivery to the Navy, which is planned for next year.\r\nOn the DCS program, the team completed shipment of the final module of SSN 797 Iowa during the quarter.\r\nIn addition, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year, and SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float-off milestones as planned in the second half of this year.\r\nAnd finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena is on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year.\r\nAt Technical Solutions, contract awards of REMUS 300 unmanned underwater vehicles during the quarter to the U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy affirmed the flexibility and modularity of these units.\r\nTS was also recently awarded a $273 million cost plus fixed fee indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to support maintenance and planning for the overhaul and repair of equipment and systems associated with the Navy aircraft carriers and West Coast Navy surface ships.\r\nIn addition, TS was awarded a contract with a 1-year base period and four 1-year options with a total potential value of $346 million to provide a variety of aircraft and operational support services for USAFRICOM, included planning, management, maintenance, logistics and airlift airdrop services and emergency medical care.\r\nExecution within Technical Solutions remains consistent with expectations except for delays in awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs, which we expect to be resolved by the end of the year.\r\nAs I close, note that we have included upcoming key program milestones on slide five.\r\nThere are no changes from what we have previously provided other than designated those milestones that have been completed with the checkmark.\r\nToday, I'll briefly review our second quarter results.\r\nThis was primarily due to the growth of Newport News and Ingalls and was partially offset by a decline at Technical Solutions due to the portfolio shaping actions we have taken.\r\nSegment operating income for the quarter of $169 million increased $174 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 7.6% compared to a segment operating margin of negative 0.2% of the second quarter of 2020.\r\nThe prior year results were negatively impacted by the Virginia-class submarine program performance as well as impacts related to COVID-19.\r\nOperating income for the quarter of $128 million increased by $71 million from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.7% increased 293 basis points.\r\nThese increases were primarily driven by the segments I just mentioned, partially offset by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment.\r\nThe tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.9% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nThe increase in the tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to research and development tax credits recorded in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nNet earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nExcluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020.\r\n Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

with GAAP.\r\ndollargeneral.com under News & Events.\r\nAs a testament to their efforts, our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting strong underlying performance across the business, which we believe was enhanced by the most recent round of government stimulus payments.\r\nThe quarter was highlighted by net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories, a 208 basis point increase in gross margin rate and double-digit growth in diluted EPS.\r\nDespite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, we are increasing our sales and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2021 to reflect our strong first quarter performance.\r\nJohn will provide additional details on our outlook during his remarks.\r\nAs always, the health and safety of our employees and customers continue to be a top priority while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve.\r\nAnd we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the US population.\r\nOverall, we are executing well against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.\r\nNow let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter.\r\nAs we lapped our most difficult quarterly comp sales comparison of the year, net sales decreased 0.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by a comp sales decline of 4.6%.\r\nNotably, comp sales on a 2-year stack basis increased a robust 17.1%, which compares to the 15.9% 2-year stack we delivered last quarter.\r\nOur first quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by growth in average basket size.\r\nAnd while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average they continue to spend more with us compared to last year.\r\nFrom a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales increased 5.7% in February despite a headwind from inclement weather across the country.\r\nFor the month of March, which represents our most difficult monthly sales comparison of the year, comp sales declined 11.2%.\r\nImportantly, beginning in mid-March and in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw a meaningful acceleration in sales relative to the first two weeks of the month, especially in our nonconsumable categories.\r\nComp sales declined 4.3% in April, and while year-over-year growth in nonconsumable sales moderated in comparison to March, they were positive overall despite a more challenging lap.\r\nOverall, each of our three nonconsumable categories delivered a comp sales increase for the quarter.\r\nOf note, comp sales growth of 11.3% in our combined nonconsumable categories and 29.8% on a comparable 2-year stack basis significantly exceeded our expectation and speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum in these product categories, enhanced by the benefit from stimulus.\r\nOnce again this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.\r\nImportantly, we continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers acquired over the past several quarters and are working hard to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.\r\nIn addition, we recently published our third annual Serving Others report, which provides context related to our ongoing ESG efforts as well as new and updated performance metrics, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead.\r\nCollectively, our first quarter results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.\r\nWe operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and believe we are well positioned to continue advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\r\nAs a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock even more growth opportunities as we move forward.\r\nIn short, I feel very good about the underlying business and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\r\nNow that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details.\r\nUnless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\r\nAs Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which we believe was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant benefit to sales, particularly in our nonconsumables categories from the most recent round of government stimulus payments.\r\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.8% in the first quarter.\r\nAs Todd noted, this was an increase of 208 basis points and represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion.\r\nThis increase was primarily attributable to: higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, a greater proportion of sales coming from our nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales.\r\nThese factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs, which were primarily driven by higher rates.\r\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 22%, an increase of 152 basis points.\r\nThis increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales, the most significant of which were store occupancy costs, disaster expenses related to winter storm Uri, retail labor and depreciation and amortization.\r\nMoving down the income statement.\r\nOperating profit for the first quarter increased 4.9% to $908.9 million.\r\nAs a percentage of sales, operating profit was 10.8%, an increase of 56 basis points.\r\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% and compares to 22.2% in the first quarter last year.\r\nFinally, earnings per share for the first quarter increased 10.2% to $2.82, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 38% over a 2-year period.\r\nTurning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders.\r\nMerchandise inventories were $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 24.2% overall and a 17.6% increase on a per store basis as we cycled a 5.5% decline in inventory on a per store basis, driven by extremely strong sales volumes in Q1 2020.\r\nIn anticipation of a more challenging supply environment, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories to better support the sales momentum we were seeing in the business.\r\nAnd while out of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with the overall quality of our inventory.\r\nThe business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $703 million, a decrease of 60% but which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 11% over a 2-year period.\r\nThis decrease was primarily driven by higher levels of improving inventory positions, including the pull forward of certain inventory purchases I mentioned earlier.\r\nTotal capital expenditures for the quarter were $278 million and included: our planned investment Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

officer, Olivier Leonetti.\r\nIn discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITA, and EBIT exclude restructuring as well as other special items.\r\nAdditionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis.\r\nLet's get started on Slide 3.\r\nWe are off to a strong start in fiscal 2022 with solid Q1 results, as our teams across the world continue to demonstrate best-in-class execution, delivering both strong financial performance for the enterprise and smart innovative solutions our customers demand to ensure a safe, healthy, and sustainable spaces.\r\nOur service activity in the quarter accelerated from both in orders and revenue perspective, and we are making great strides across all of our vectors of growth.\r\nDecarbonization, healthy buildings, and smart buildings.\r\nI'm incredibly proud of how the team is operating in what still remains an incredibly challenging environment, as we continue to face headwinds from supply chain and labor constraints in various dislocations caused by the latest variant of COVID-19.\r\nAs the recovery in our end markets expands, I have been continuously encouraged by the underlying demand trends we are witnessing as evidenced by high single-digit order and revenue growth this quarter.\r\nIn the $10.5 billion backlog we have built, which increased 10% on a year-over-year basis.\r\nWhat has been equally as encouraging is the drivers of this demand have been the retrofit replacement of equipment in service offerings required to achieve higher indoor air quality, cost reduction, and energy efficiency goals, which perfectly aligns with our portfolio of end-to-end digital solutions and services.\r\nWe continue to advance our initiatives to accelerate growth and transform our service business.\r\nQ1 was another quarter of solid revenue and order growth, and we continue to drive our attachment rate higher with a multifaceted approach, including a number of digitally enabled solutions.\r\nAdditionally, there are significant actions underway across the organization to optimize the efficiency of our cost structure, and we remain on track to deliver $230 million in productivity savings this year.\r\nWe had another quarter of strong free cash flow performance, as Olivier will share with you later, this has allowed us to continue to fund organic reinvestment in our business as well as share repurchase in M&A activity, all three of which remain top priorities.\r\nOver the next several slides, I will update you on some of the strategic growth vectors we continue to highlight and all of these are supported by the global mega trends that will drive demand within the building sector for the next decade plus.\r\nAs we have said in the past, we truly believe we are among the best-in-class when it comes to the ability to deliver fully integrated solutions designed to address the challenges associated with these trends.\r\nBased on our performance in Q1 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our earnings per share guidance for the year.\r\nDuring the quarter, we were honored to be recognized for our leadership in sustainability and ESG as well as our innovations in smart building platforms.\r\nWe received our eighth consecutive ranking in the Corporate Knights Global 100 most sustainable corporations in the world.\r\nWe were recognized by Sustainalytics for managing material ESG issues, and we are one of 45 companies globally to receive his Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales' inaugural Terra Carta Seal.\r\nIn terms of smart buildings, I was humbled to receive, on behalf of the company, the IoT Company's CEO of the Year Award from IoT Breakthrough.\r\nThis award is a reflection of the work of our entire digital and OpenBlue teams, engineering, development, sales, service, and marketing.\r\nLastly, we were also recognized by Verdantix for having the most prominent IoT platform for smart buildings in 2022, having achieved market-leading scores in several key categories.\r\nOur service business continues to perform well.\r\nWe are seeing good traction on our initiatives to accelerate growth and increased recurring revenues.\r\nWe are also seeing encouraging trends in the adoption of our OpenBlue digital service offerings.\r\nOverall, service revenues in the quarter were up 5% with broad-based growth across all regions.\r\nOrders were up 7%, led by low double-digit growth in North America with strength across our applied commercial HVAC and fire & security platforms.\r\nWe expect a 400 to 500 basis point improvement in our attach rate for the full year and ended Q1 at approximately 41%.\r\nTurning to Slide 6.\r\nIt goes without saying that sustainability is at the heart of everything we do.\r\nThere are tremendous efforts underway in all parts of the world to decarbonize and it has become very clear that buildings play a pivotal role in these efforts.\r\nWe were pleased to see the recent announcement from the Biden administration forming a new National Building Performance Standards Coalition consisting of more than 30 state and local governments across the U.S., incentivizing the development of healthier, lower carbon emitting buildings.\r\nBuilding performance standards are among the core policy initiatives we have flagged as primary demand drivers for decarbonization and achieving net zero.\r\nThis major announcement by The White House is the latest in a number of regulatory actions taken by the local and national governments globally in support of decarbonizing economies, and more specifically in support of accelerating progress toward net zero buildings.\r\nThese standards will mandate stringent carbon reduction requirements for new and existing buildings in the U.S., including financial penalties for noncompliance.\r\nThe official adoption of these standards would represent an important step toward the formation of the $240 billion decarbonization industry, we expect through of 2035.\r\nMoving to Slide 7.\r\nWe recently launched our latest offering under the OpenBlue healthy buildings portfolio, indoor air quality as a service.\r\nThis is the industry's first dedicated as-a-service model for delivering indoor air quality.\r\nThis offering allows us to combine our traditional

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Core in this case means designated financial metrics excluding the impact of the recent S::can and ATI acquisitions.\r\nWe believe this reference point is important for year-over-year comparability.\r\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, delivering sales and earnings per share growth, margin expansion, and robust cash flow.\r\nMost exciting we experienced record order rates for our smart water solutions across both lines of business as the underlying growth drivers for our digital solutions are embraced by customers.\r\nThe well-publicized and widespread electronic supply shortages limited our conversion of these record orders into sales in the quarter.\r\nTempering core sales growth but resulting in a record-high order backlog heading into the second quarter, which bodes well for the balance of the year.\r\nOur recent acquisitions delivered strong top-line results with net profitability muted as expected as a result of purchase accounting items.\r\nOverall, our acquisition integration activities are progressing as expected.\r\nI'll talk about the current environment and our outlook later in the call.\r\nAs you can see on Slide 4, total sales for the first quarter were $117.8 million compared to $108.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of 9%.\r\nIn utility water, overall, sales increased 12% reflecting the addition of the s::can and ATi acquisitions, which contributed approximately $10 million of sales in the quarter.\r\nExcluding acquisitions, core revenues in the utility water product line were essentially flat year-over-year despite record orders due to the Internet and electronic supply component shortages and logistics challenges that limited manufacturing output.\r\nScarce capacity of electronics is a pervasive market issue impacting many industries and is not isolated to Badger Meter.\r\nWe did experience growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing actions.\r\nAs Ken noted, we ended the quarter with strong order momentum and a record backlog, which gives us confidence in our sales outlook moving forward.\r\nAs expected the flow instrumentation sales rate of change improved sequentially from down 10% last quarter to down 3% year-over-year, with the majority of end markets served experiencing recovering demand trends.\r\nWe expect to return to overall growth moving forward as a result of improving demand conditions and easier comparisons.\r\nWe are pleased with the operating profit improvement delivering a 30 basis point increase in margins to 15.1% from 14.8% in the prior year.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was 41.9%, up a healthy 200 basis points year-over-year.\r\nThe core business delivered higher gross margins due to positive sales mix, namely higher SaaS revenues along with favorable pricing, which continued to offset the impact of higher brass costs in the quarter.\r\nMargins also benefited from favorable acquisition mix.\r\nYou may recall from last quarter we described the water quality acquisitions of s::can and ATi as having higher than line average gross margins combined with higher SEA as a percent of sales and therefore with a net EBITDA range for the combined businesses in the mid-teens.\r\nThe positive acquisition mix benefit to gross margins was muted by the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in the quarter, but that's mostly behind us moving forward.\r\nCopper prices continued their upward trajectory after our last earnings call in late January when they were averaging approximately $3.60 a pound to now near $4.20 a pound.\r\nThis obviously increases the potential cost headwind for the year that we had estimated at $4 million to $5 million to closer to $7 million to $8 million on a year-over-year basis if it were to stay in that $4.20 range.\r\nWe have executed well in implementing appropriate pricing mechanisms to offset this inflation as evidenced by our first quarter results and will continue to remain nimble and actively addressing inflation.\r\nTurning to SEA expenses, the first quarter spend of $31.6 million increased $4.3 million from the prior year.\r\nThis includes a full quarter of SEA spending for both s:can and ATi along with the higher level of acquired intangible asset amortization.\r\nBeyond the impact of acquisitions, higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower travel trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses, the decrease of which we will anniversary starting next quarter.\r\nThe income tax provision in the first quarter of 2021 was 22.2%, slightly lower than the prior years' 25.6% rate.\r\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.47 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 15% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.41.\r\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 24.3% down from 25.5% at calendar year-end despite the addition of ATi, largely due to working capital initiatives in the quarter.\r\nOur free cash flow of $28.8 million was consistent with the prior year.\r\nIn early January we deployed $44 million net of cash acquired for ATi and currently have cash on the balance sheet of approximately $51 million.\r\nAlong with the untapped revolver, we have significant financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies.\r\nTurning to Slide 5.\r\nWe don't provide guidance but believe it is important to bring awareness to the increased level of unevenness we're likely going to see in our top line as this year unfolds.\r\nI want to spend just a minute highlighting comparative sales data to provide a clear picture of the varied influences on the quarterly sales growth trend lines and discuss the optimism we have for our results for the remainder of the year and beyond.\r\nThis chart depicts the quarterly sales growth rate of our core business in 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021.\r\nAs you can see by the various call-out boxes, we had some specific dynamics in 2020 with COVID and now in the first quarter of 2021 that we need to be mindful of as we look at the rest of the year comparisons.\r\nNamely, we will have an easier comp for our upcoming Q2 versus the 2020 COVID lockdowns combined with a portion of the record backlog converting to sales given the anticipation for some modest improvement in electronic supply.\r\nAs we move into Q3, we'll have a difficult comparison based on the post-COVID lockdown order rate and manufacturing recovery last year.\r\nThe bottom line to all of this is that we continue to have strong momentum and robust bid activity, order rates and backlog consistent with our long-term outlook for mid-single-digit growth.\r\nFrom a top line standpoint, the acquisitions are performing in line with their historic growth patterns and our integration teams are working to begin putting the steps and processes in place to realize future growth synergies.\r\nTurning to our outlook.\r\nThe underlying market drivers for smart water solutions remain intact and in fact, as we've discussed, COVID has spotlighted the benefits of AMi for common utility challenges such as remote work efficiencies and regular and automated consumer engagement tools.\r\nWater quality and security concerns also are driving accelerating interest in our real-time digital solutions.\r\nWe saw evidence of that during the recent climate events in Texas and other Southern U.S. States which experienced the debilitating deep freeze with a number of customers describe the real-life benefits of having our cellular AMi solution deployed which remained in service due to the criticality and cellular networks.\r\nThese utilities were able to obtain real-time mission critical data which help identify potential main breaks, pipe freezes and bursts keeping safe water supply available for their end consumers.\r\nNow surprisingly, one of the most common outlook questions we get from investors relates to the potential impact of the recent infrastructure proposal from the Biden administration, specifically the portion of the plan that calls for $56 billion of spending to upgrade  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n They will be joined by Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President, Real Estate and Finance.\r\nWe appreciate you taking the time to join us.\r\nI'm pleased to report that Choice Hotels continued to deliver strong RevPAR growth in the third quarter that once again significantly outperformed the industry.\r\nWe also continue to gain share across all segments in which we compete.\r\nAs a result of these performance trends, we expect to surpass 2019 RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA levels for full year 2021.\r\nBy continuing to implement our long-term strategy, we have positioned Choice Hotels to further benefit from post-pandemic trends that favor leisure travel, limited service hotels and longer stays.\r\nAdditionally, our business traveler demand has returned to levels similar to the third quarter of 2019.\r\nThe third quarter was exceptional, our strongest quarter of the year.\r\nOur RevPAR increased 11.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, surpassing our prior quarterly RevPAR guidance.\r\nIn fact, RevPAR has now exceeded 2019 levels for five consecutive months, with trends continuing into the fourth quarter.\r\nFor over 1.5 years, we've maintained significantly higher RevPAR index share gains against the competition compared to 2019.\r\nWe continued this trend in the third quarter, increasing RevPAR index versus our local competitors by nearly four percentage points as compared to 2019, reflecting continued growth in both weekday and weekend RevPAR index as reported by STR.\r\nChoice's ability to continue to gain share even as the broader industry recovers, demonstrates that our strategic investments are paying off and gives us further confidence in our future revenue trajectory.\r\nBecause of our strategic investments, both before and during the pandemic, we are in a stronger position today to capitalize on outsized growth opportunities over the long term, which we expect will create value and drive our performance to new levels.\r\nWhat's most impressive is that we continue to drive strong performance through both rate improvement and occupancy share gains.\r\nChoice's average daily rate growth has been stronger than the industry in the third quarter due to our new revenue management tool and broader capabilities.\r\nIn addition, our robust merchandising strategy has allowed us to drive occupancy share gains versus our local competitors.\r\nWe continue to make major investments that are enhancing our owners' performance and contributing to our brand's outperformance.\r\nEarlier this year, we launched our new revenue management capability designed to improve the ability of our franchise owners to effectively drive top line revenue.\r\nThis tool marks a step change improvement that we were able to put in the hands of our franchisees at a critical juncture in the recovery.\r\nAs the first mobile-enabled revenue management app, it allows our franchisees to more effectively manage their channels rates and inventory by adapting to local market trends in real time through repricing and competitive rate shopping multiple times during the day, and they can do this from virtually anywhere.\r\nThis enhanced capability has contributed to choice taking significant RevPAR index share specifically driving average daily rate index gains versus local competitors, and we expect this trend to continue.\r\nThe acceptance of rate recommendations by our franchisees has been significantly higher than our prior tool, demonstrating our owners' confidence in the solutions that we are providing.\r\nThis tool, combined with expert advice from our experienced revenue management consultants is helping our franchise owners to swiftly execute the right pricing strategy, which is particularly important in an inflationary environment.\r\nAt the same time, we continue to improve the unit economics for our franchisees, concentrating on investments like housekeeping upon request that lower their cost of ownership while driving continued performance improvements.\r\nRecently, we deployed a new digital registration capability, which is integrated with our property management system.\r\nThis cost-effective cloud-based solution is designed to simplify the hotel registration process for front desk staff, save on labor, speed up check-in and improve our guests' overall experience.\r\nMoreover, our recent brand investments are designed to appeal to the guest of tomorrow while providing a compelling return on investment for our franchisees.\r\nJust a few weeks ago, we introduced a new Cambria hotel prototype option designed for secondary and leisure markets.\r\nWe're excited about the future growth opportunity for Cambria as we expect this prototype will allow developers the flexibility to build at a reduced cost, expanding the markets available for growth while retaining our design forward experience.\r\nI will now provide a brief update on our key segments, where 11 out of our 12 brands achieved RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors in the third quarter as compared to 2019.\r\nOur strategic investments in the extended-stay segment allowed us to quadruple the size of the portfolio over the past five years to reach 467 domestic units with a domestic pipeline of nearly 310 hotels.\r\nThis segment, a significant growth engine for the company, expanded by over 45 hotels in the third quarter year-over-year and now represents over 10% of our total domestic rooms.\r\nIn addition to strong unit growth, we've also driven impressive RevPAR growth across our extended stay brands.\r\nSpecifically, when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our extended-stay portfolio grew RevPAR a by over 18%, driven by occupancy levels of 82% and a 9% increase in average daily rate.\r\nAnd outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by over 20 percentage points.\r\nThe WoodSpring Suites brand celebrated a key milestone with the recent opening of its 300th hotel.\r\nThe brand's pipeline expanded by over 20% year-over-year as of the end of September, reaching nearly 160 domestic hotels which further exemplifies developer demand for this brand, given its cycle resilience.\r\nWe expect that WoodSpring's robust pipeline will provide a strong platform for future growth of the brand.\r\nBroadly speaking, we are pleased with the significant increase in developers' interest in extended stay projects.\r\nIn the third quarter, we executed two dozen extended-stay domestic franchise agreements, an 85% increase year-over-year and a 20% increase compared to 2019 levels.\r\nIn addition, the first hotel for our newest extended-stay brand, Everhome Suites is currently under construction and scheduled to open next summer, with nearly 20 additional projects already in the pipeline.\r\nOur mid-scale brands, which represent over 2/3 of our total domestic room portfolio and approximately half of the total domestic pipeline continued to outperform the segment's RevPAR growth.\r\nOur mid-scale and upper mid-scale portfolio grew RevPAR by nearly 10%, driven by average daily rate growth of over 9% and outpaced the industry's mid-scale and upper mid-scale segment growth by nearly seven percentage points when compared to third quarter 2019.\r\nOur flagship brand, Comfort, recently celebrated the highest number of conversion hotel openings since 2014, while increasing new construction agreements threefold in the third quarter year-over-year.\r\nThe Comfort brand's domestic unit growth of over 2% and and RevPAR index outperformance versus local competitors demonstrate the attractiveness of this iconic brand to hotel developers and guests alike.\r\nOur upscale portfolio achieved impressive growth in the third quarter year-over-year as we increased our domestic room count by nearly 22%, driven by both Cambria and the Ascend Hotel Collection.\r\nThe upscale portfolio also achieved a record for domestic openings in the first three quarters of the year.\r\nThe Cambria brand continued its positive momentum,

Officer.\r\nToday, we will discuss key business developments and review our financial results.\r\nPlease review the safe harbor comments and disclosure of our use of non-GAAP financial measures included in those materials.\r\nWe appreciate your interest in O-I Glass.\r\nWe're very pleased with our performance during the second quarter.\r\nWe reported adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.\r\nResults exceeded our guidance range and reflected a stronger-than-expected shipment levels as well as favorable ongoing operating performance.\r\nWe continue to see favorable performance across key business levers.\r\nShipments improved 18% and production rebounded 27% compared to the prior year, which was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.\r\nThe strong demand also reflected consumer preference for healthy, premium and sustainable glass packaging as markets reopen.\r\nFurthermore, the benefit of higher selling prices substantially offset the rated cost inflation and continued favorable operating performance was driven by the positive contribution of our margin expansion initiatives.\r\nSecond quarter cash flow was also very strong as a result of solid operating performance.\r\nAs I noted last quarter, O-I has reached an inflection point.\r\nWe have seen a step change improvement in our ability to consistently perform and deliver on our commitments, which is underpinned by advanced capabilities across many disciplines developed over the last few years.\r\nI believe current quarter results underscore this view.\r\nAs I will discuss shortly, we continue to advance our bold plan to change O-I's business fundamentals.\r\nIn addition to better-than-expected earnings and cash flow, I'm very pleased with the progress we made advancing our strategy.\r\nOur margin expansion initiatives are exceeding our expectations, and we achieved a major milestone with MAGMA this past quarter.\r\nLikewise, we continue to rebalance our business portfolio and advance our efforts to resolve our legacy asbestos liabilities.\r\nAs we look to the future, we remain optimistic about our business outlook.\r\nWe expect third quarter adjusted earnings will approximate $0.47 to $0.52, which is a significant improvement from the prior year.\r\nOur full year earnings and cash flow guidance has improved.\r\nWe now anticipate full year earnings of between $1.65 and $1.75 per share and $260 million of cash flow.\r\nLet's move ahead to slide four to discuss recent volume trends.\r\nAs you can see on the chart, second quarter shipments were up significantly over the prior year, which was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.\r\nTotal shipments increased 18% this year compared to a 15% decline last year.\r\nIn the Americas, second quarter shipments were up 17%, with all geographies improving from the prior year.\r\nThe rebound was most pronounced in Mexico and the Andeans, which were significantly disrupted in 2020.\r\nIn Europe, shipments were up 22% and all geographies improved double digits from last year.\r\nWhile the pandemic was very disruptive, underlying trends point to a stable or modestly improving demand.\r\nFor example, second quarter shipments were in line with 2019 levels, reflecting a return to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nGlass has proven to be very resilient despite significant market volatility.\r\nThis includes supply chain disruptions, transportation challenges and major channel shifts between retail and on-premise consumption patterns.\r\nThe chart on the right illustrates how food and beverage consumption patterns should evolve across channels over the next 18 to 24 months.\r\nAs you can see, on-premise consumption is expected to rebound after the depths of the pandemic, while retail purchases should remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nWhile we first shared these analysis last quarter, the evolution of packaging demand over the past couple of quarters, supports these trends and continues to reinforce the projected consumption patterns in this chart.\r\nAs we look to the future, we expect continued volume growth.\r\nWhile markets had already rebounded well in the third quarter of last year, we expect our shipments to be flat to up 1% in the third quarter of this year.\r\nReflecting solid demand year-to-date, we have increased our full year 2021 growth outlook.\r\nWhile our prior guidance called for 3% to 4% growth, we now expect growth of between 4% and 5% in 2021.\r\nIn addition to a strong operating performance, we also achieved a number of key milestones during the first half of the year as we continue to advance our strategy.\r\nOn this page, we released our 2021 priorities as well as some highlights on our progress.\r\nI'll touch base on each of our three platforms.\r\nFirst, we aim to expand margins.\r\nWe have targeted $50 million of initiative benefits as well as continued performance improvement in North America.\r\nWe have made good initial progress with our margin expansion initiatives.\r\nBenefits totaled $40 million during the first half, and we now expect to exceed our original $50 million target for the full year.\r\nNorth America in turn has demonstrated a strong resilience responding to severe weather, high freight inflation and a tight supply chain situation, and sales volumes are comparable to 2019 levels.\r\nNext, we seek to revolutionize glass.\r\nTo support this, we successfully validated several technology milestones for MAGMA Generation one line in Germany as well as continue to advance our Glass Advocacy campaign and reposition ESG.\r\nSimilarly, we remain on track to pilot the Generation two MAGMA line in the Streator, Illinois, in the second half of the year and continue to make solid progress developing Generation three.\r\nAdditionally, we're actively working on a R&D lightweighting program we call Ultra, targeting significant container weight reductions to improve even further the convenience and sustainability profile of glass.\r\nO-I's Glass Advocacy campaign aims to rebalance the dialogue about glass.\r\nOur digital marketing campaign is well underway with over 660 million impressions program to date and the campaign has reached over 80 million people across the U.S.\r\nWe are building a community of glass advocates, who regularly engage with our content, which demonstrates the relevance of our message.\r\nLike in our technology developments, we are very encouraged by the positive response and progress made, and we'll continue to advance these marketing efforts.\r\nI'll touch on ESG momentarily.\r\nThird, we will continue to optimize our structure.\r\nThis includes a number of efforts ranging from portfolio adjustments, improving the balance sheet, simplifying the organization and addressing legacy liabilities.\r\nRegarding our divestiture program, we have completed or entered into agreements for $930 million of assets sales to date.\r\nSo we are over 80% of our way toward our targeted divestitures by the end of 2022.\r\nAs John will expand, on our cash flow during the first half of the year was quite favorable given historic seasonal business trends, reflecting very good working capital management, which support debt reduction.\r\nIn March, we entered into a long-term strategic agreement with Accenture to manage our global business services activities, and we completed the first phase of this transition in July.\r\nIn addition to reducing G&A cost, we expect to accelerate capability enhancement by leveraging world-class processes and technologies.\r\nAs you know, we reached an agreement in principle back in April for a fair and final resolution to our legacy asbestos-related liabilities.\r\nEfforts to complete the reorganization for Paddock are proceeding as expected.\r\nBefore I turn over to John, let me add a few comments on sustainability.\r\nAt O-I, our ESG and sustainability vision is holistic, grounded in innovation and touches every part of our business.\r\nIn our vision, we see a future where the innate circularity of glass meets O-I's disrupti Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using

our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions.\r\nIn January, we announced an agreement to acquire Abel Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter.\r\nWe actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses, as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders.\r\nMoving to Slide 7.\r\nAs I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture, focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation toward the most important needs of their customers.\r\nOur culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities.\r\nTo that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day.\r\nLast month, the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts.\r\nIDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company.\r\nThe foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved, disadvantaged people of color in our communities.\r\nThis donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving.\r\nIn addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers, and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people.\r\nThis month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world.\r\nThe feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion.\r\nDeveloping a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority.\r\nAs part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year.\r\nWe will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation.\r\nYou have my commitment on that.\r\nTurning now to our commercial results on Slide 8.\r\nBroad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth-quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year.\r\nWe entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third-quarter improvement, and that continued into the fourth quarter.\r\nExcluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year over year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter.\r\nFMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses, continued strength in agriculture, and recovery in industrial day rate businesses.\r\nHST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses.\r\nFinally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter.\r\nDispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes BAND-IT after a strong bounce back in the third quarter, continued to improve based on auto market strength.\r\nAnd Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines.\r\nA year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX.\r\nWe have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors.\r\nWe then faced the onset of the pandemic, and we responded to it with purpose.\r\nAs we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels.\r\nThe actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well-positioned as we move into 2021.\r\nTurning to Slide 9.\r\nWe provide our current outlook for primary end markets.\r\nIn our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter, further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter.\r\nWe see this increase driven largely by opex needs of our customers.\r\nWe continue to see large capital projects remain on hold.\r\nWe anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again.\r\nBut t Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We will start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter, then Jack will go through the operating results and the segments, our balance sheet and cash flow, and guidance for the second quarter.\r\nI will then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session.\r\nBut before we proceed, Jack will now cover the safe harbor language.\r\nThese statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs.\r\nIt has been one year since we first referred to the unfolding uncertainty of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns in many of our markets.\r\nAt that time, we all had little idea of the magnitude of what lay ahead or what the road to recovery in the most challenging operating environment in our history would look like.\r\nFrom that moment on we were determined to mitigate the impact on our financial results with early and strong actions and continue our investments in strategic initiatives, so we emerge stronger when the pandemic ends.\r\nThose priorities have enabled us to start 2021 in a good position as we see that the signs of recovery continue to play out in many markets.\r\nThat said, the recovery is uneven and although many markets are steadily strengthening other markets, particularly in Europe, continue to experience COVID-19 related difficulties, which are resulting in the need for more restrictions and which is impacting the rate of recovery.\r\nOverall, we believe we are heading in the right direction and expect continued improvement.\r\nTurning to our financial results.\r\nIn the first quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency.\r\nWe saw increased demand in many of our key markets and this resulted in a better than expected financial performance.\r\nOn a reported basis, we recorded an operating profit for the quarter of $98 million.\r\nExcluding restructuring charges in the prior year, operating profit was up 8% in constant currency, marking a significant sequential improvement from the operating profit decline of 24% in the fourth quarter.\r\nOperating profit margin was 2%, up 120 basis points from the prior year on a reported basis, and after excluding restructuring charges in the prior year operating profit margin increased 10 basis points.\r\nEarnings per diluted share was $1.11.\r\nExcluding restructuring charges in the prior year period, this reflects a constant currency increase of 28%.\r\nThe improving demand for our services also correlates to the recent results of our Q2 2021 ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey, which indicated broad-based improvements in hiring intentions by employers.\r\nOur survey of 42,000 employers in 43 countries noted positive net employment trends across the majority of markets, a markedly different and improved outlook compared to the same time last year.\r\n77% of employers anticipate returns to pre-pandemic hiring levels before the end of 2021, which is also a significant improvement from previous quarter surveys.\r\nAmong the major markets, the U.S. topped the list in terms of overall hiring intentions for the second quarter.\r\nAs the demand for skilled workers continues to strengthen, technology-related roles continue to be in demand as has been the case throughout much of the crisis.\r\nHowever, we are now seeing strengthening demand also for talent within the manufacturing sectors as evidenced by the strong manufacturing PMI data in March.\r\nEven the industries most impacted by the pandemic, hospitality, entertainment, and airlines are showing positive signs of rehiring with indications they will see significant increases in the second half of this year.\r\nLogistics also shows no signs of reverting back to pre-crisis levels as the consumer shift to online retail is likely structural.\r\nAs workplaces reopen and workers return in phases, we are seeing demand for HR skills, especially with a greater focus on hiring and wellbeing.\r\nAnd this is evidenced in the significantly improved demand for our RPO services.\r\nOrganizations that were reducing staff levels in 2020 are now seeking strategic and operational flexibility as they optimize their workforce plans, reassess talent needs, and implement hybrid work models.\r\nWe are well-positioned to provide the expertise and services to meet this rising demand.\r\nRevenues in the first quarter came in above our constant currency guidance range.\r\nOur gross profit margin came in at the midpoint of our guidance range.\r\nOur operating profit was $98 million representing an increase of 161% or 146% on a constant currency basis.\r\nExcluding restructuring charges in the prior year, operating profit increased 14% or 8% on a constant currency basis.\r\nThis resulted in an operating profit margin of 2%, which was 50 basis points above the high end of our guidance.\r\nBreaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 6%, our constant currency revenue increased 1%.\r\nAfter considering net dispositions and fewer billing days, the organic days adjusted revenue increase was 2%.\r\nThis represented a significant improvement from the fourth quarter revenue decline of 6.5% on a similar basis.\r\nTurning to the earnings per share bridge on Slide 4.\r\nEarnings per share was $1.11, which significantly exceeded our guidance range.\r\nWalking from our guidance mid-point, our results included improved operational performance of $0.42, slightly lower than expected foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of $0.01, a slightly better than expected effective tax rate that added $0.01 and a lower weighted average share count from share repurchases that also added $0.01.\r\nLooking at our gross profit margin in detail, our gross margin came in at 15.6%.\r\nUnderlying staffing margin contributed to a 10 basis point reduction.\r\nA lower contribution from permanent recruitment also contributed 10 basis points of GP margin reduction, which was offset by a higher mix of MSP gross profit on very strong growth in the quarter.\r\nNext, let's review our gross profit by business line.\r\nDuring the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 63% of gross profit, our Experis professional business comprised 21% and Talent Solutions brand comprised 16%.\r\nDuring the quarter, our Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit growth of 2%.\r\nThis was a significant improvement from the 11% decline in the fourth quarter.\r\nGross profit in our Experis brand declined 6% year-over-year during the quarter on an organic constant currency basis, which represented an improvement from the 14% decline in the fourth quarter.\r\nTalent Solutions includes our global market-leading RPO, MSP, and Right Management offerings.\r\nOrganic gross profit increased 6% in constant currency year-over-year, which is an improvement from the 1% growth in the fourth quarter.\r\nThis was primarily driven by our MSP business with double-digit GP growth.\r\nOur RPO business experienced significant improvement during the quarter and crossed back to low single-digit percentage growth in gross profit.\r\nOur Right Management business continues to see a run-off in previous outplacement activity as recovery strengthens and experienced a reduction in gross profit of about 1% year-over-year.\r\nOur SG&A expense in the quarter was $670 million and represented a 2% decline on a reported basis from the prior year.\r\nExcluding restructuring charges in the prior year, SG&A was flat on a constant currency basis.\r\nCurrency changes reflected an increase of $35 million.\r\nThe remaining underlying decrease was driven by $1 million from net dispositions and $2 million of operational cost reductions.\r\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue represented 13.6% in the first quarter reflecting first quarter seasonality in revenues.\r\nThe Americas segment comprised 20% of consolidated revenue.\r\nRevenue in the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 1% in constant currency.\r\nOUP was $44 million.\r\nExcluding restructuring costs in the prior year, OUP increased 52% in constant currency Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website.\r\nWe'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call today.\r\nThis cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nWe also have other company representatives available for a Q&A session after Lisa and Steve provide updates.\r\nSlide four shows our quarterly financial results.\r\nIDACORP's 2021 third quarter earnings per diluted share were $1.93, a decrease of $0.09 per share from last year's third quarter.\r\nEarnings per diluted share over the first nine months of 2021 were $4.20, which were $0.25 above the same period last year.\r\nThe year-to-date earnings are the highest in the history of the company over the first 9 months of the year.\r\nToday, we also tightened our full year 2021 IDACORP earnings guidance estimate upward to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize in 2021 any of the additional tax credits that are available to support earnings under its Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation.\r\nThese are our estimates as of today, and they assume normal weather conditions and a continued return to more normal economic conditions over the balance of 2021.\r\nI will begin by addressing the robust economic growth we continue to experience in Idaho Power service area.\r\nYou'll see on slide five that customer growth has increased 2.9% since September 2020.\r\nWe believe that quality of life, a business-friendly environment and reliable affordable energy from Idaho Power continue to attract a steady influx of business and residential customers, to the benefit of both our company and the local economy.\r\nAnd while the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic linger, we continue to see a return to normal operations for most of our commercial and industrial customers.\r\nAs of the end of September, unemployment in our service area was 2.6% compared to the current rate of 4.8% nationally.\r\nTotal employment in our service area has increased 3.3% over the past 12 months.\r\nMoody's forecasted GDP now calls for economic growth of 6.1% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022.\r\nWe are encouraged by this growth trend and forecast, especially considering the challenges we have all faced over the past 18 months.\r\nAt the local level, we are grateful to see businesses continue to bounce back from the various impacts of the pandemic.\r\nIdaho Power continues to experience a strong volume of potential customers interested in expanding in our service area.\r\nMany prospective projects are expressing a need for rapid speed to market and are seeking existing buildings versus greenfield construction.\r\nThis demand is fueling significant industrial spec development to construct shell buildings ranging from 50,000 to 250,000 square feet.\r\nWhile a number of local developers are building out industrial parks, several nationally recognized developers are making large investments in anticipation of ongoing growth in Idaho's industrial sector.\r\nAs you may know, Idaho Power serves a large dairy industry and the state of Idaho ranks as the third largest dairy producing state in the U.S. We've recently received a number of inquiries for dairy waste to energy projects that use electricity as part of the process to produce renewable natural gas that is placed into pipelines.\r\nOne such project announced this month by Shell Oil Products U.S. will construct a waste to energy natural gas facility at a large dairy operation in Southern Idaho.\r\nThe plan is for the gas to be shipped by pipeline from Idaho to California.\r\nYou'll recall that this summer brought extreme high temperatures to our region, which combined with customer growth led to record energy demand.\r\nIdaho Power hit a new all-time peak load of 3,751 megawatts on June 30, and exceeded the previous peak load more than 60 separate hours during June and July, as the weather remained hot and dry over most of the summer.\r\nThis led to strong sales across most customer classes.\r\nThe benefits of those sales were offset somewhat by Idaho Power's portion of the associated higher power supply costs, in part, because energy was at a premium across much of the West, due to the persistent hot dry conditions.\r\nIt was a challenging summer, and we learned some valuable lessons, and I am so pleased to see that both our people and our grid were up to the task.\r\nWe anticipate sustained growth in the demand for electricity, a challenge that is amplified by constraints in the transmission system impacting our ability to import energy into Idaho Power system, especially during peak load period.\r\nAs a result, we will need new resources to serve customers and maintain system reliability.\r\nLast quarter, I mentioned, Idaho Power had issued a request for proposal to add 80 megawatts of new resources by summer 2023 and expects to issue an additional RFP in late 2021 or early 2022 to meet anticipated needs beyond 2023.\r\nBased on our efforts to address the 2023 projected load deficits, you'll see on slide six that we now could potentially add approximately $100 million in additional capital expenditures related to the 80-megawatt project during the current 5-year forecast window.\r\nThese new resources will be in addition to the 120-megawatt solar project scheduled to come online at the end of next year, and the Boardman to Hemingway 500-KV transmission line that will enable an increased import of energy from across the Pacific Northwest as soon as 2026.\r\nOur 2021 integrated resource planning efforts are focused on ensuring we continue to deliver reliable affordable clean energy for our growing customer base from diverse resources.\r\nOn the regulatory front, I would like to provide an update on our recent request to accelerate depreciation for the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant.\r\nLast quarter, I mentioned our filing with the Idaho Commission to increase rates $30.8 million in December of this year.\r\nIn September, PacifiCorp, our co-owner and operator of the Jim Bridger plant, submitted an IRP to the Idaho Commission that contemplates ceasing coal-fired generation in units 1 and 2 in 2023, and converting those units to natural gas generation by 2024.\r\nAt a public meeting this week, the Idaho Commission approved a joint motion to suspend the Idaho power's rate request, while the parties assess this option and environmental compliance requirements for the plant.\r\nWe expect to resolve the uncertainties in this case before the end of 2021.\r\nI'd also like to share a brief update on the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line project.\r\nIn July, Idaho Power awarded contracts for detailed design, geotechnical investigation, land surveying and right-of-way option acquisition for B2H.\r\nThat work commenced during the third quarter.\r\nGiven the status of ongoing permitting activities and the construction period, Idaho Power expects the in-service date for the transmission line will be no earlier than 2026.\r\nI have also mentioned on previous calls at Idaho Power and our co-participants are exploring several scenarios of ownership, asset and service arrangements aimed at maximizing the value of the project for each of the co-participants customers.\r\nAny changes regarding the ownership structure would be addressed through amended or new agreements for future phases of the project.\r\nWe hope to be able to share more detailed updates in the near-term.\r\nGiven the expected increase in capital spending along with the current growth projection and other factors, Idaho Power could file a general rate case in Idaho and Oregon within the next couple of years.\r\nSteady customer growth, constructive regulatory outcomes, effective cost management, and economic conditions, all play significant roles as we refine the need and timing of a future general rate case.\r\nSlide seven shows a recent outlook of precipitation and weather from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\r\nCurrent weather proj Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

results could differ materially.\r\nWith Josh and me on the call today are Mark Olear, our Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Dickman, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nI will lead off today's call by providing an overview of our performance for the third quarter of 2021 and highlight the company's investment and capital markets activities.\r\nAnd then I'll pass the call to Mark and Brian to discuss our portfolio and financial results in more detail.\r\nThe net result of our well-positioned in-place portfolio and the continued execution of our active and accretive investment program was a 5.8% increase in total revenues, a 13.2% increase in adjusted funds from operations, and a 6.4% increase in AFFO per share.\r\nThe company benefited from the stability of its portfolio of convenience and automotive retail assets, which continued to perform well, meaning that we had another quarter of full rent collections, including all amounts owed to us as a result of our 2020 COVID-related rent deferments.\r\nThe success of our investment strategies year-to-date has been a key contributor to our earnings growth.\r\nWe invested $61.1 million in 25 properties during the quarter, and another $8.8 million just after quarter-end, bringing our year-to-date total investment activity to more than $144 million.\r\nThis accelerated pace of investment activity was highlighted by our ability to bring new high-quality tenants into our portfolio, including Flash Market with sites located across the Southeastern U.S. and Splash Carwash, whose footprint spans the Northeast.\r\nWe also continue to successfully execute on our multiple investment strategies, which include [Indecipherable] leasebacks, accretive acquisitions of net leased properties, and development funding for new industry assets.\r\nIn addition, rent commenced on three redevelopment projects during the quarter including our second and third projects, with 7-Eleven for remodeled C&G locations in the Baltimore and Dallas-Fort Worth MSAs, bringing our completed projects to 22 since the inception of our redevelopment program.\r\nWe also announced yesterday that we successfully amended and extended our $300 million credit agreement, which now will mature in October 2021.\r\nThe improved terms of our facility further validate the company's platform and strong performance over the last several years.\r\nWhen combined with our active ATM program, which we've used to raise more than $50 million this year, and our strong balance sheet, we continue to have access to capital and the right credit profile to support our growth objectives.\r\nGiven our performance year-to-date, I am pleased that our Board approved an increase of 5.1% in our recurring quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share.\r\nThis represents the eighth straight year with a dividend increase.\r\nOur Board believes this annual increase is appropriate, as it maintains a stable payout ratio and is tied to the company's growth over the past year.\r\nFurthermore, we are again pleased that our year-to-date accretive investment activity has positioned the company to raise its 2021 AFFO per share guidance.\r\nI want to reiterate our commitment to effectively executing on both new investment activity and the active asset management of our portfolio.\r\nOur teams continue to work diligently to source and underwrite new opportunities to invest across our target asset classes including convenience stores, car washes, automotive-related retail properties in strong metropolitan markets across the country as well as to unlock embedded value through selective redevelopments.\r\nWe believe our success year-to-date demonstrates our ability to source opportunities that align with our investment strategies, and that will continue to drive additional shareholder value.\r\nAs of the end of the third quarter, our portfolio includes 1,011 net lease properties, five active redevelopment sites, and five vacant properties.\r\nOur weighted average lease term was approximately 8.8 years, and our overall occupancy, excluding active redevelopments, remains constant at 99.5%.\r\nOur portfolio spans 36 states across the country plus Washington, D.C., and our annualized base rents, 63% of which come from the top 50 MSAs in the U.S., continue to be well covered by our trailing 12-month tenant rent coverage ratio of 2.6 times.\r\nIn terms of our investment activities, we had a highly successful quarter in which we invested $61.1 million in 25 properties.\r\nSubsequent to the quarter-end, we acquired two additional properties for $8.8 million, bringing our year-to-date investment activity to $144.5 million across 82 properties.\r\nWe completed two transactions in the convenience and gas sector during the quarter.\r\nThe first was a 15 property sale-leaseback with Flash Market, a subsidiary of Transit Energy Group.\r\nIn this transaction, we invested $35.1 million to acquire the properties, which are located throughout the Southeast United States with a concentration around the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina MSA.\r\nProperties acquired have an average store size of 3,600 square feet and an average property size of 1.7 acres.\r\nIn addition, 53% of the properties have sub-tenancies with either quick-serve restaurants or auto service operators.\r\nWe also completed our first development funding project with Refuel in the Charleston, South Carolina MSA.\r\nOur total investment in the project was $4.5 million, including our final investment of $1.1 million during the third quarter.\r\nAs per the terms of our development funding transactions, we acquired the property upon completion of development in conjunction with our final funding payment and simultaneously entered into a long-term triple net lease.\r\nIn the carwash sector, we completed three transactions in the quarter.\r\nWe acquired two newly constructed properties from WhiteWater Express carwash in Michigan for $7 million.\r\nThese properties were added to our existing unitary lease with WhiteWater.\r\nWe also acquired two additional properties for an aggregate purchase price of $8 million, which are leased to Go Car Wash in San Antonio, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada MSAs.\r\nAdditionally, we acquired our first property with Splash car wash, which is located in New Haven, Connecticut MSA.\r\nOur purchase price was $4 million for the property.\r\nIn the auto service sector, we acquired our first Mavis Tire property.\r\nWe invested $4.6 million to acquire the properties in the Chicago, Illinois MSA.\r\nGetty also advanced $1.2 million of development funding from three new industry convenience stores with Refuel in the Charleston, South Carolina MSA, bringing the total amount funded by Getty for these projects to $8.9 million at quarter-end.\r\nAs part of this transaction, we will accrue interest on our investment during the construction phase of the project, and we will expect to acquire the properties via sale-leaseback transaction upon completion and final funding.\r\nThe weighted average initial lease term of our completed transactions for the quarter was 14.6 years, and our aggregate initial cash yield on our third quarter acquisitions was 6.7%.\r\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we acquired two properties in the Boyington, Vermont MSA from Splash Carwash.\r\nPurchase price was $8.8 million, and the cap rate was consistent with our year-to-date acquisition activity.\r\nWe ended the quarter with a strong investment pipeline and remain highly committed to continuing to grow our portfolio of convenience and automotive retail real estate, and we expect to pursue that growth through continued sourcing of direct sale-leaseback, acquisitions of net lease properties, and development funding for new-to-industry assets.\r\nMoving to our redevelopment platform.\r\nDuring the quarter, we invested approximately $331,000 in both completed projects and sites, which remain in our pipeline.\r\nIn addition, rent commenced on three redevelopmen Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This is the Diebold fourth-quarter earnings call for 2019.\r\nFor your benefit, we posted slides which will accompany our discussion today.\r\nAnd our slides are available on the investor relations page of dieboldnixdorf.com.\r\nIn the supplemental schedules of our slides, we have reconciled each non-GAAP metric to its most directly comparable GAAP metric.\r\nAdditional information on these factors can be found in company's SEC filings.\r\nAnd now, I'll pass the mic to Gerrard.\r\n2019 was a good year for the company as we executed on our DN Now transformation initiatives and delivered financial results which were in line or better than our expectations.\r\nTo set the stage a bit, I want to reflect for a moment on where we were one year ago.\r\nWe were in the early stages of streamlining our operating model and simplifying our portfolio and we have clear goals for strengthening our balance sheet.\r\nFast forward to today, after year 1 of DN Now and we have met or exceeded on every commitment we made and are on track for future targets.\r\nAs shown on Slide 3, we reported total revenue of just over $4.4 billion which was within our initial range, and our results also included substantial currency headwinds of approximately $150 million.\r\nWe delivered adjusted EBITDA of $401 million which was within our initial outlook from February of 2019, and which represents a 25% increase over 2018.\r\nAnd also included a foreign exchange impact of approximately $7 million.\r\nMost importantly, we exceeded our free cash flow target, generating $93 million versus our initial expectation of breakeven.\r\nIn line with our focus, these results demonstrate meaningful improvements in profitability and cash flow.\r\nWe increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 280 basis points to 25.2% with strong margin expansion in all three segments and business lines.\r\nOur progress enabled DN to boost its adjusted EBITDA margin by 210 basis points to 9.1%.\r\nFree cash flow increased by $256 million.\r\nAnd unlevered free cash flow jumped by $315 million reflecting our companywide focus on driving both operating and net working capital efficiencies while delivering these against the backdrop of significantly stronger customer satisfaction levels.\r\nOur progress reduced our leverage ratio by more than a full turn, ending 2019 at 4.4 times.\r\nWith this progress, our core business has a stronger foundation yielding a more focused and efficient company.\r\nI'm extremely pleased with how the entire team at DN focused on our shared goals.\r\nIt is because of our people that we are executing in line with our plan.\r\nOn Slide 4, you'll see a list of operating achievements for 2019.\r\nFor our banking customers, we enhanced our differentiation by launching our next-generation platform called DN Series, the most IoT-enabled platform on the market.\r\nWe also introduced a new cloud-based analytics platform called the AllConnect data engine, through which we will further differentiate our services capabilities.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, key wins included a multimillion dollar global agreement for dynamic software and DN Series ATMs with Citibank.\r\nIn Belgium, we won a multiyear ATM-as-a-Service agreement to update and maintain approximately 1,560 ATMs with a joint venture called JoFiCo.\r\nOur end-to-end solution features our DN series units, a common DN dynamic software stack and cloud-based analytics from our AllConnect DataEngine.\r\nBanking product orders in Q4 declined year over year as we're up against a strong result from the fourth quarter of 2018 especially in Latin America.\r\nAs we enter 2020, we expect some easing of demand from large North American banks as they complete their upgrade efforts.\r\nIn the retail segment, we increased our retail self-checkout shipments by more than 50% in 2019.\r\nMore recently, a leading market research firm in our space, retail Banking Research, recognized Diebold Nixdorf as the largest self-service kiosk provider in the world.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, we won a new $6 million contract at the U.S. value retailer for kiosks and dynamic software.\r\nContinued growth in self-checkout orders and the easing of point-of-sale orders were in line with expectations in the quarter.\r\nAs the market for point-of-sale solutions evolves, D&S responding with introduction of an all in one point-of-sale system that brings together the latest technology in the stylish space saving design.\r\nImportant wins in the quarter included a $15 million contract with the Swiss gaming cooperative for 5,000 point-of-sale terminals, and a new 3-year $14 million agreement with a European do-it-yourself retailer to refresh the end-to-end customer checkout experience at several hundred stores spanning 12 countries.\r\nWhen I reflect on 2019, the greatest accomplishments are those which require coordination across large sections of the company.\r\nFor example, we're very encouraged by the broad-based success of our services modernization plan which includes proactively upgrading hardware of software on more than 140,000 terminals and implementing standard practices globally.\r\nSimilarly, we have substantially increased our product gross margins by streamlining our manufacturing footprint, improving product pricing strategies and optimizing the number of ATM models.\r\nIn addition, we dramatically improved the efficiency of our inventory levels, collections and payables which added $110 million to our cash flow and our improving performance led to a successful extension of nearly $800 million of credit in August.\r\nWith these accomplishments in the books, we enter the second year of our DNA transformation with momentum across our efforts and confidence in our strategic direction.\r\nSlide 5 summarizes our key DN Now initiatives which are positively impacting both the quality of revenue and the efficiency of operations.\r\nOur execution momentum gives us confidence to increase our targeted gross savings from $400 million to $440 million through 2021.\r\nI'll comment briefly on several initiatives that have been in place for several quarters.\r\nFirst, the transition to our new operating model is complete and about $100 million of savings have been realized in 2019.\r\nNext, we'll continue to simplify our product portfolio and further optimize our manufacturing footprint.\r\nHeading into 2020, our focus is squarely on realizing the benefits from our next-generation banking solution, the DN Series.\r\nEarlier in the call, I spoke about the actions and significant achievements of our services modernization plan.\r\nWhile we're pleased with our progress, we believe there is further room to improve service delivery and operating efficiency.\r\nIn addition, we launched a new series of actions called software excellence aimed at improving our software operations and gross margins.\r\nWe are enhancing professional services delivery by optimizing our resources and improved presales scoping.\r\nWithin our software products, we're simplifying our offerings and placing a greater emphasis on software development effectiveness.\r\nOur efforts to reduce general and administrative expenses picked up steam in Q4, and are expected to deliver meaningful savings in 2020 as we build a fit-for-purpose support structure for our business.\r\nI've already mentioned our 2019 success on net working capital, and we are continuing to pursue efficiencies on this important metric.\r\nThe final initiative on this slide is divesting non-core assets, enabling us to focus on businesses that meet our return hurdles, creating value for shareholders.\r\nIn 2019, we divested or shut down a half a dozen businesses which generated about 2% of revenue.\r\nDuring Jeff's remarks, he will discuss our focus on revenue quality in greater detail, including two additional transactions which further simplify the company's business operations, enhance liquidity and reduce risk.\r\nOn Slide 6, I'll discuss the progress we're making to simplify our product portfolio.\r\nWe successfully reduced the number of ATM terminals by about 30% in 20 Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n So we're going to have a robust Q&A session.\r\nSo let's move to page three.\r\nThe business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover.\r\nFirst, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business, which we needed to operationally deliver against.\r\nSecond, we had to work closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability.\r\nWe are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in a robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2.\r\nLet's take a look at the metrics.\r\nTotal revenue was up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period.\r\nClearly, the quarter benefited from a good order backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and the largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company.\r\nThis performance clear indication that our product portfolio was attractive and often under-appreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.\r\nOrder rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase.\r\nThe growth was broad-based with all five segments contributing to the increase.\r\nThis resulted in the seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%.\r\nSince our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it is upon it's -- it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full-year demand.\r\nI'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment.\r\nThere are several factors driving healthy customer activity, including pent-up demand from last year as a result of low starting channel inventories in certain sectors.\r\nImportantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking in inflationary pre-buy, and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected in our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%.\r\nSo put succinctly, it's not pre-buy if we don't remove it from the full-year revenue estimates.\r\nStill early in the year and we will continue to produce to meet customer demand and watch our backlog and order patterns carefully [Phonetic].\r\nWe'll have more color on the drivers of demand and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains, as we progress through the year.\r\nFor now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace.\r\nBut we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year.\r\nLet's move to profitability.\r\nQ1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin of 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter.\r\nThis was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered positive pricing [Phonetic] and continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds.\r\nStrong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period.\r\nWith a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism.\r\nStrong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust topline outlook and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges.\r\nWith that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12% all in revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step up compared to our prior guidance.\r\nI will skip slide four, which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter.\r\nSo let's move to slide five.\r\nEngineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly through a comparable period.\r\nVehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines.\r\nIndustrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking, and aerospace and defense shipments were solid.\r\nThe business remains booked well into the second half of the year.\r\nAs expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrained shipments in the quarter.\r\nWe have forecasted this business to be levered toward H2 and order trends and backlog reflect that.\r\nSame dynamic for industrial winches with revenue down in the quarter.\r\nBut recovery in order rates, we expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year.\r\nMargin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio.\r\nAnd Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling as well as our software and systems business in Europe.\r\nActivity in China remains subdued.\r\nOrder backlogs are up 13%, and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year.\r\nThe segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions of mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.\r\nSales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically.\r\nThe core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia, but was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic.\r\nWe also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales.\r\nTextile printer sales remained soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID.\r\nInk consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates, and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline in new printer sales as the quarter progressed.\r\nMargins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter.\r\nPumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components.\r\nOrder rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong.\r\nIndustrial pumps had a solid quarter, driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand.\r\nAnd polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the U.S. Precision components was down in the quarter though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remains impacted.\r\nAdjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing.\r\nThis team has moved the segment to best-in-class topline and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development and innovation management and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions.\r\nIt's a world-class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.\r\nRefrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year posting 18% organic growth.\r\nRevenue on new orders in beverage can making more than doubled

Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received three nominations.\r\nSummer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations.\r\nAs you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2, and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film.\r\nIn Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye, and returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series, The Book of Boba Fett.\r\nOur general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality.\r\nIn fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly a quarter of the industry's best-reviewed shows.\r\nAnd Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieve a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes.\r\nThat includes Abbott Elementary, the first freshman broadcast comedy to earn the 100% Certified Fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009.\r\nOur success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret.\r\nHowever, it's often lost that the depth, breadth, and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services.\r\nIn fact, six of the 10 most-watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team.\r\nAnd general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand.\r\nGoing forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority.\r\nIn fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Black-ish, and The Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service.\r\nRounding out our content focus is, of course, sports.\r\nSporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television, accounting for 95 of the 100 most-watched live broadcast in 2021.\r\nAnd ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our four major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli.\r\nAnd I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and his Omaha Productions company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season.\r\nWhile multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels.\r\nIt extends to sports betting, gaming, and the metaverse.\r\nIn fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with their favorite sporting events, stories, teams, and players.\r\nTurning to distribution results.\r\nThe continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout.\r\nOur success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions, and new market launches.\r\nThe remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios' Moon Knight in March.\r\nAnd the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including two Star Wars series: Andor and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25.\r\nWe'll debut two Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2.\r\nAs I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024.\r\nChristine will provide more detail into our theatrical results.\r\nHowever, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters.\r\nAnd given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\r\nThat said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed.\r\nAnd we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise.\r\nThis quarter, audiences proved us right as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families' continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance.\r\nWith outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest title to cross 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by stor Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n I'm here with James Quincey, our chairman and chief executive officer; and John Murphy, our chief financial officer.\r\nBefore we begin, please note that we've posted schedules under the Financial Information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.\r\nYou can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of gross and operating margins.\r\nPlease limit yourself to one question.\r\nIf you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue.\r\nIn what remains a highly dynamic environment, our first-quarter results show promising signs that a broader recovery is on the horizon.\r\nWe're encouraged by early results in markets where mobility is on the rise.\r\nThen I'll hand over the call to John to discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we'll continue to deliver on our objectives over the course of the year.\r\nIn the first quarter, we positioned our business for recovery while executing against our emerging stronger agenda, equipping our system to win.\r\nAt the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets.\r\nWe moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way, and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns.\r\nDuring the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated.\r\nLeveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter.\r\nAnd while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid-February, trends have improved since then.\r\nWe're pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March of 2019 prior to the pandemic.\r\nWe continue to see ongoing strength in at-home channels, offset by away-from-home trends which have improved sequentially but remain pressured relative to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nWe're working with our customers and bottling partners to sustain at-home momentum and capture improving away-from-home demand.\r\nFor example, in Latin America, our Prospera program with our bottlers helps the traditional trade thrive through assistance with their marketing efforts, resulting in outperformance in this critical channel.\r\nIn Great Britain, we launched Open, a business accelerator program to support pubs, bars, and cafes.\r\nIn North America, our use of mail bundles is driving incidents in pickup and delivery transactions with food service customers.\r\nIn 2020, we gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels, offset by negative channel mix.\r\nThis continues to be the dynamic affecting our share year to date.\r\nThrough our ongoing initiatives and as away-from-home demand improves over the course of the year, we'll seek to build on these wins in 2021.\r\nThere are clear opportunities to reaccelerate share positions as the recovery plays out and we'll invest to drive momentum with focus and flexibility.\r\nIn market at the forefront of the recovery, we've seen early signs that our actions taken during the pandemic are helping us outpace recovery.\r\nIt's important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world.\r\nMany markets haven't yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions.\r\nLooking around the world, in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels.\r\nStrong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions, and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers.\r\nDespite the unexpected state of emergency earlier in the year, Japan expands its successful RGM initiatives geographically and across brands to help drive improvements later in the quarter.\r\nIn EMEA, vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than anticipated and many countries have been impacted by ongoing lockdowns.\r\nIn Eurasia and the Middle East, brand Coke recruited 4.4 million consumers through affordability packages and a focus on at-home occasions.\r\nNew marketing campaigns drove improvement in flavored Sparkling soft drinks, and Fuze Tea reached an all-time-high value share in Turkey.\r\nIn Africa, mass vaccination is expected to take longer than the developed markets.\r\nAnd despite ongoing volatility, Africa worked closely with our bottlers to deliver volume growth that by stepped-up execution through cooler placement and affordability packs like returnable glass bottles.\r\nIn North America, the year is off to a good start.\r\nOngoing strength in at-home channels was driven by core brands in our Sparkling portfolio, as well as Simply, fairlife, and Gold Peak all with encouraging results.\r\nAway-from-home began to approve in March as vaccinations and mobility picked up.\r\nIn Latin America, we leveraged our core brands, digital initiatives, and refill packages to recover ahead of the economy and our industry

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement.\r\nWe appreciate you joining us for our 2021 year-end earnings call.\r\nMoving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call.\r\nI'll highlight key achievements we made throughout the year, including our progress in strategically repositioning PPL for future growth and success.\r\nTurning to Slide 4.\r\nI'm incredibly proud of how our team performed and what was truly a remarkable year for PPL.\r\nAs we began a new century in our company's history, we took bold steps to strategically reposition PPL as a US-focused energy company committed to sustainable growth and well-positioned to lead the clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers.\r\nWe completed the sale of our UK utility business in June.\r\nAchieving exceptional value at almost $11 billion while eliminating risks associated with foreign operations.\r\nWe then took steps to strengthen PPL's balance sheets by reducing $3.5 billion of our holding company debt, which provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward.\r\nWe advanced our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric, which will expand and diversify our US presence, add another high-quality regulated utility to our portfolio, and create additional opportunities to leverage our proven operating model to drive value for customers and shareowners.\r\nWe anticipate receiving a final order from the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers with respect to the acquisition by March of 2022.\r\nWhile strategic repositioning was a key priority in 2021 to set PPL up for long-term success, we also remain focused on achieving our near-term objectives.\r\nIn 2021, we continued our track record of earning equity returns that were in line with those allowed by our regulators.\r\nWe also achieved constructive regulatory outcomes in 2021 with the settlements on the Pennsylvania FERC ROE challenge and the rate case in Kentucky, which will provide added stability and predictability to our plan over the next several years.\r\nWe also returned over $2 billion to share owners through dividends as well as share repurchases, which included the completion of our targeted $1 billion in share buybacks through December 31.\r\nAnd true to our mission, we delivered energy safely, reliably, and affordably for our 2.5 million customers in the United States.\r\nAnd as the pandemic refused to yield, we stayed resilient acted responsibly to protect our employees, and remain focused on continuous improvement.\r\nFrom Kentucky to Pennsylvania, we delivered exceptional service throughout 2021.\r\nWe maintain transmission and distribution reliability as well as generation availability that was among the best in the industry.\r\nDespite PPL electric utilities experiencing significant storms during 2021, it maintained top quartile performance for safety, which measures the average number of outages our customers experienced.\r\nMeanwhile, our Kentucky operations posted their second-best year on record for the state.\r\nWhen severe weather struck either in Pennsylvania or Kentucky, we responded quickly and effectively.\r\nFor example, after December tornadoes tore through portions of our service territory in Kentucky damaging or destroying more than 500 transmission and distribution poles.\r\nWe restored power to most customers within 48 hours.\r\nSimilarly, when the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through our Pennsylvania service territory, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers, we mobilized quickly and effectively to get the lights back on as soon as possible.\r\nOur restoration performance in the wake of Hurricane Ida was recognized with an EEI Emergency Response Award.\r\nThis performance is the result of the investments we've made in our grid and our dedicated employees who pride themselves on delivering a superior level of service each day.\r\nAnd that service was once again reflected in our customer satisfaction scores.\r\nWe were honored to receive four new JD Power awards in 2021 for electric utility residential and business customer satisfaction with PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both ranking highest among similarly sized utilities in their respective regions.\r\nAnd following an independent survey of customers at 140 of the largest utilities in the US, PPL Electric and Kentucky Utilities were recognized by Escalent as two of the most trusted utility brands in the nation.\r\nAcross PPL, we also continue to foster a culture of innovation, investing in advanced technology and data analytics to deliver industry-leading reliability and enterprisewide cost efficiencies.\r\nThis resulted in multiple industry awards in 2021, including the use of dynamic line rating, technology, and the use of data analytics to better target vegetation management.\r\nWith an eye toward keeping reliability strong and empowering our customers, we also continue to invest in the future.\r\nThis included executing more than $2 billion in infrastructure improvements to further strengthen grid resilience, modernize our networks, incorporate advanced technology, and pave the way for increased electrification and renewable energy in our service territories.\r\nTurning to Slide 5.\r\nOver the past year, we also delivered on our commitments to deliver a sustainable PPL for our shareowners, employees, and the communities we serve.\r\nWe made significant progress in advancing our clean energy strategy.\r\nWe adopted a net-zero carbon emissions goal, accelerated our interim emissions reduction target to 70% from 2010 levels by 2035 and 80% by 2040.\r\nAnd we also accelerated our coal plant retirements scheduled.\r\nSeparately we announced the commitment of over $50 million in new investment to fund research and development in the clean energy space with our planned investment in EIP and EPRI's low carbon resources initiative.\r\nWe also launched a new partnership to study carbon capture at a natural gas combined cycle power plant and reached new agreements to provide an additional 125 megawatts of solar power to major Kentucky customers.\r\nIn November, we published our latest comprehensive climate assessment report, which highlights the risks associated with climate change and the opportunities in responding to it and evaluating potential future emissions under multiple scenarios.\r\nThis included a scenario consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\r\nOur climate assessment outlines our clean energy strategy and goals to enable a responsible transition that balances our commitments to the environment, our customers, our employees, and our communities.\r\nLG and KU also submitted their triannual joint Integrated Resource Plan, which reflected a significant increase in projected renewable additions in the 15-year planning horizon compared to our prior plan.\r\nWe expect the trend of more rapid decarbonization of our generation fleet in Kentucky to continue with further improvement in cost and technology for renewables, as well as other clean energy technologies.\r\nIn addition to our focus on advancing our clean energy transition, we also remain very engaged in the communities we serve and with our employees throughout 2021.\r\nWe continue to move PPL forward by creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace.\r\nWe implemented an enterprisewide diversity equity inclusion strategy, adopted DEI commitment, increased diversity within our leadership ranks, overall workforce in the board, and we expanded our support for social justice and equity initiatives in the communities we serve.\r\nIn addition, we continue to create new opportunities for business resource groups for employees of all backgrounds and experiences to collaborate, share perspectives, and contribute to PPL's success.\r\nOur strong commitment to diversity and inclusion received recognition from multiple organizations in 2021, with PPL being named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality and disability inclusion, as well as a Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\r\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.\r\nThey will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.\r\nAlso in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nWe are very pleased to report first quarter core income $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior-year quarter, despite our highest ever level of first quarter catastrophe losses.\r\nThe higher level of core income for the quarter was driven by very strong underlying underwriting income as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, all of which more than offset the record level of catastrophe losses.\r\nUnderlying underwriting income of $735 million pre-tax was nearly 25% higher than in the prior-year quarter driven by an increase in net earned premiums to $7.4 billion and an underlying combined ratio, which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 89.5%.\r\nWe are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all three of our business segments.\r\nIn Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved by more than three points, which again included the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends.\r\nOn Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both benefited from higher earned premiums with continued strong margins.\r\nTurning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating net investment income of $590 million after-tax for the quarter, up 14% from the prior-year quarter.\r\nThese results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 9% over the past year after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders.\r\nDuring the quarter we returned $613 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $397 million through share repurchases.\r\nIn recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in our business, I'm pleased to share that our board of directors declared a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.88 per share, marking 17 consecutive years of dividend increases, with a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period.\r\nOur board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.\r\nWe remain pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies.\r\nDuring the quarter, we grew net written premiums by 2% to $7.5 billion.\r\nOur premium growth once again reflects strong renewal premium change and retention in each of our three segments.\r\nIn Business Insurance, renewal premium change increased to 9.2%; its highest level since 2013 and 4 points higher than the prior year quarter, while retention remained strong.\r\nIn workers' compensation, pure renewal rate change was slightly negative, but continued on an improving trend.\r\nWorkers' comp renewal premium change, which includes exposure, was positive for the first time in a number of quarters.\r\nBoth renewal rate change, annual premium change in every other product line were near or above recent record highs.\r\nNet written premiums in Business Insurance were down a little bit year over year, driven overwhelmingly by the workers' comp product line, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic on payrolls, as we're comparing a pandemic-impacted quarter in the current year to a largely pre-pandemic quarter in the prior year.\r\nBond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 9%, driven by a renewal premium change of nearly 11% in our management liability business, while retention remained strong.\r\nAcross our commercial businesses, the pricing environment continues to be rational and favorable with written pricing well above estimated loss cost trends.\r\nOverall pricing levels continue to be near record levels, and while margins have improved, given the continued headwinds impacting returns for the industry, we expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trend for some time.\r\nTurning to Personal Insurance, production was excellent in the quarter.\r\nNet written premiums increased by nearly 7%, driven by renewal premium change of almost 8% in our homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both auto and home.\r\nNew business for both auto and home combined was up 17% compared to the prior year quarter, which is the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in new business, demonstrating the ongoing success of our product, distribution, and customer initiatives.\r\nSome number of years ago and consistent with our approach generally of recognizing, assessing, and addressing trends rapidly, we took decisive action in anticipation of continued weather volatility.\r\nOur efforts started with talent.\r\nWe added experts in data science, meteorology, geophysics, and environmental engineering, among others, to our cat management organization.\r\nWe also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise.\r\nWe have incorporated the results into our product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation, and claim response.\r\nThe insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor cat models with our own sophisticated peril by peril view.\r\nThis gives us a refined granular view of cat risk, incorporating proprietary variables, such as complex roof characteristics, tree and brush [Phonetic] density and location intelligence down to the parcel level.\r\nThese variables are incorporated into our product development enhancing segmentation.\r\nThey are also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions.\r\nIn terms of our claim response, our data scientists and other experts have developed geospatial tools, artificial intelligence, and analytic models to facilitate a more effective tailored deployment of claim resources.\r\nThis has resulted in a more satisfying experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us.\r\nTaken together, these efforts have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes.\r\nWhile there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, over the past five years, our share of property catastrophe losses relative to total property catastrophe losses for the domestic P&C industry have declined significantly compared to the five years prior to that.\r\nOur property cat losses over the past five years have also been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share.\r\nAdvancing our understanding of the risk and reward of catastrophe underwriting is an ongoing effort for us.\r\nAs a footnote but importantly, we've made these and other strategic investments in our business while we improved our expense ratio.\r\nTo sum up, the strength of our underwriting and investment expertise enabled us to deliver strong profitability this quarter, notwithstanding the severe winter weather.\r\nAs a result, we're off to a terrific start for the year.\r\nWe are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all three of our business segments.\r\nOur proven strategy, strong track record of execution, leading analytics, talent advantage give us confidence that we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers.\r\nCore income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 11.1%.\r\nThe increase in core income resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlying underwriting results, and increased net investment i Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n On our call today, we have Ned Rand, President and CEO; Dana Hendricks, Chief Financial Officer; Mike Boguski, President of our Specialty Property and Casualty lines; and Kevin Shook, President of our Workers' Compensation Insurance operations.\r\nNed, the floor is yours.\r\nWe closed the NORCAL transaction on May five, roughly halfway through the reporting period, and the financial teams of our newly combined organization did a great job getting everything ready to report our results.\r\nWe've made excellent early progress on our integration plan and already NORCAL is proving its value as we expand our operating model to a truly national platform.\r\nAs I said in the release yesterday, closing the NORCAL transaction was a transformative event for ProAssurance and the combined companies are off to a strong beginning.\r\nAs you will hear from both Mike and Kevin, the strategic changes we've made over the past two years are beginning to show through, and I'm very encouraged by the results of the second quarter.\r\nWe remain in an uncertain environment due to the continuing effects that pandemic has had on our healthcare and civil court systems and as workplaces navigate the return to work to an office environment.\r\nIn spite of these uncertainties, I am confident we have the right team in place, especially as we add in our colleagues from NORCAL to succeed as we move forward.\r\nThe NORCAL acquisition was, of course, the most impactful item in the quarter, and we'll get to that in a moment.\r\nBut first, I think it's important to answer the question of, excluding the noise from the transaction, how did we do this quarter?\r\nIn short, it was a good quarter.\r\nWe expected significant improvement year-over-year just by nature of the adverse events booked in the year ago period, and we saw that improvement and then some.\r\nOur Specialty P&C business continues to show improvement with strong rate gains, solid retention and top line growth.\r\nLloyd's turned in an excellent result at a little over $4 million.\r\nOur Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Sale Reinsurance businesses both produced underwriting income in a very challenging marketplace, with their expense ratios benefiting from the restructuring completed last year.\r\nFinally, we saw excellent returns from our investments in LPs and LLCs, driven by the market increase in the first quarter.\r\nRecall, those investments are typically reported on a quarter lag.\r\nAll told, a solid result as we continue to execute strategies that drive steady incremental improvement.\r\nNow for the results for the quarter.\r\nWe will be filing our 10-Q on or before Monday, which will provide a great look into exactly how NORCAL contributed to the quarter and the effects of transaction accounting.\r\nI'll address certain of those impacts throughout my remarks today.\r\nAt the consolidated level, we reported net income of $92.1 million in the second quarter or $1.70 per diluted share, driven by a gain on bargain purchase of $74.4 million related to the NORCAL acquisition, partially offset by $20.3 million of pre-tax transaction-related costs.\r\nBecause these one-time items are unique and unusual in nature and non-indicative of regular operations, they are excluded from operating earnings and segment reporting.\r\nWe reported non-GAAP operating income of $26.6 million or $0.49 per share, again, driven by strong performance from our LP and LLC investment portfolio and meaningful year-over-year improvement in our underwriting results.\r\nAll segments contributed to our profitability this quarter.\r\nConsolidated gross premiums written increased nearly 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by the addition of NORCAL's premium to our Specialty P&C results, as well as $14 million of new business written in the quarter from our core operating segments.\r\nOur consolidated current accident year net loss ratio was 81.9%, a year-over-year improvement of 28.1 points, primarily attributable to the adverse effect of losses associated with significant events in the second quarter of last year in Specialty P&C.\r\nMore importantly, that improvement also reflects the continued benefits of our reunderwriting efforts.\r\nWe recognized net favorable development of $13.8 million in the current quarter, driven largely by the Specialty P&C segment, which included $2.1 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment on NORCAL's assumed reserve.\r\nOur consolidated underwriting expense ratio increased in the quarter to 32.3%, driven by the pre-tax transaction costs associated with our acquisition of NORCAL.\r\nExcluding those transaction costs, the expense ratio in the quarter was 23.8%, reflecting the continued impact of restructuring efforts, but also included the impact of certain purchase accounting adjustments.\r\nAs a part of purchase accounting, we wrote off NORCAL's capitalized DPAC asset on the acquisition date.\r\nAs a result, DPAC amortization expense for NORCAL in the second quarter was only $900,000 and represented expenses capitalized and subsequently amortized since the acquisition.\r\nThis amount is approximately $6.3 million lower than would be considered normal.\r\nIn our Form 10-Q, we will provide a detailed breakout of the various items affecting our expense ratio in the quarter to help our readers arrive at a run rate.\r\nFrom an investment perspective, our consolidated net investment result increased year-over-year to $29.3 million, driven by $11.9 million of income from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, which were driven by the results of our investments in LPs and LLCs, as previously discussed.\r\nConsolidated net investment income was $17.4 million in the quarter, down slightly from the year ago period, primarily due to lower yields from our short-term investments in corporate debt securities, due to the current low interest rate environment.\r\nThis decrease was partially offset by $2.7 million of net investment income from additional invested assets that came over from the NORCAL acquisition.\r\nThey've done a great job.\r\nMike, congratulations on a significant improvement in Specialty P&C this quarter.\r\nWhat can you tell us about the results?\r\nI want to start by extending congratulations to the Specialty P&C team for the continuing turnaround of our operating results, over the past two years to achieve an operating profit, the close of the transaction with NORCAL and the great start to integration of the companies.\r\nWe are proud of all that has been accomplished and look forward to a bright future with our new team members and business partners at NORCAL.\r\nThe significant year-over-year improvement in the segment's results was driven by several components.\r\nPrimarily, the comprehensive business strategy executed since 2019 to address our operating and underwriting results and the resulting reunderwriting and rate strengthening efforts in our legacy HCPL business.\r\nWe recorded improvement in operating metrics for all lines of business in the segment, including higher premium retention, continued rate gains, a reduced expense ratio and a lower current accident year loss ratio.\r\nMost material to the improved results for the quarter was the impact of certain adverse events recorded in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nHowever, we recorded improvement in the current accident year net loss ratio, even excluding those adverse events, a direct result of the continued benefits of our HCPL reunderwriting efforts.\r\nAlso contributing to profitability in the quarter was $10.5 million of net favorable reserve development spread relatively evenly across lines of business within the segment.\r\nJust a brief aside before we move on from the loss ratio.\r\nThe reduction in HCPL claims frequency observed in 2020 has continued into 2021 thus far, as courts and jury trials in most places have yet to return to normal schedules.\r\nWe remain cautious in recognizing these favorable frequency trends in our current accident year loss pick due to the long-tailed natu Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

we have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well and we are driving several technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and pollutants.\r\nAn example of this is our Green Friction technology which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90% an incredible milestone and significantly improving the quality of the air in our metros.\r\nWe're also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network; a great example of this and a solution of growing interest among Class 1 customers is Trip Optimizer Zero-to-Zero.\r\nThese advanced technology allows an operator to autonomously start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control.\r\nIt builds on Trip Optimizer's proven performance which has saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year.\r\nLooking forward, we will continue to advance efforts toward cleaner, more energy efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report which will be released in a couple of weeks.\r\nIn the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLXdrive locomotive.\r\nWe also closed a significant order for international locomotive kits and one additional contract in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions.\r\nIn Freight Services, we want a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for 100 locomotive modernizations in North America.\r\nOverall, mods backlog remains strong and we are showing good momentum on deliveries.\r\nFinally in transit we won new power collection, HVAC and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the UK.\r\nLooking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs.\r\nWe also will continue to control while we can and leverage the strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply change disruptions, increasing metal and commodity costs and labor shortages.\r\nThese dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases.\r\nAcross the board, our team's working hard to mitigate the impact of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can.\r\nWe anticipate our costs will continue to increase over the next few quarters and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges.\r\nIt's great to be with you and I'm very excited to join the team at Wabtec.\r\nIt is a storied company with incredible talent, deep innovation and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail while growing shareholder value and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months.\r\nNow, turning to Slide 8 before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products as well as significant increases in many key input costs.\r\nOn the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which are causing delays in pr Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n This has been another strong quarter for Medifast, with positive trends across our business and solid growth in both revenue and earnings.\r\nCompared to the same time period last year, revenue increased 52.3% to $413.4 million in the third quarter, while earnings per diluted share rose 22.3% to $3.56.\r\nAs planned, we ran our business dealer promotion in August, consistent with the prior two years.\r\nThis promotion focuses on driving coach growth by incentivizing sponsorship at the time when coach leaders are deeply engaged and focused on broadening their reach following our annual convention.\r\nThe number of independent active earning OPTAVIA Coaches exceeded 61,000 at the end of the third quarter, with growth of 44.9% from the same period last year and up 3% sequentially.\r\nBoth coaches and the company had to adjust to the new scale of the business, and that's caused some to be expected bottlenecks that were manifest in product delivery delays in our supply chain in the second quarter and early into the third quarter, which impacted coaches and client experience.\r\nConsequently, the sequential growth rate in active earning coaches decelerated as existing coaches spend more time supporting the record number of new clients who have entered the OPTAVIA ecosystem rather than onboarding as many new coaches.\r\nAs planned, we brought new fulfillment capacity fully online at the beginning of August 2021, and this had a significant positive impact on both coach and client experience in the back half of the quarter and is expected to continue going forward.\r\nPromotional activity directed a client acquisition during the third quarter included the essential start promotion we ran in September.\r\nLast year, this program ran in the April-May time frame, and it was an important catalyst to the sharp acceleration we experienced starting in the summer of 2020.\r\nAs this year's event was later in the quarter, the initial revenue benefit is expected to occur more in the fourth quarter, while some of the costs negatively affected the margins in the third quarter.\r\nThe key takeaway from our third quarter client acquisition results is that it will put us in a very strong position as we move into the final quarter of the year and moving to next year.\r\nOur coach based model is driven by activation of new clients who then go on to be new coaches.\r\nNew client numbers are up about 50% year-over-year in the month of September due to the essential start promotion and the continued strong demand for our coach supported health and wellness plan.\r\nAs a result of new client acquisition, productivity hit a record high for the company with revenue per active earning coach reaching $6,773.\r\nThis is up 7% from a year ago and up 1.7% from Q2, the prior high.\r\nCoaches are continuing to leverage our infrastructure, advanced digital tools and field-led training to amplify their engagement across social media as well as other technology platforms, enabling them to support a greater number of clients.\r\nOur strategic investments in expanding supply chain and fulfillment capacity have proven invaluable in supporting our growth since 2017 when we decided to double down on the clinically proven coaching model through OPTAVIA.\r\nThis was accomplished three to six months in advance of the respective target dates.\r\nGiven our expected growth over the next several years, we are continuing to allocate capital and investments to this critical infrastructure and have already started work on an additional distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas in partnership with a leading third-party logistics company.\r\nThis comes on the heels of the new warehouse and distribution center in Maryland that came online in Q2 and to which we continue to add capacity through Q3.\r\nAdditionally, in October, we held an event with top coach leaders at Sundance, Utah, to reinforce alignment and provide planning and alignment sessions around major initiatives for 2022.\r\nDuring the meeting, we aligned our plans for the fourth quarter, which supported their field-led training events over the final months of 2021 in preparation for Q1 of next year.\r\nConsistent with last year, we will execute our Holiday Dash program, which will begin in December and carry over into the first week of January.\r\nThis promotion rewards coaches to attract new clients during the program period.\r\nWe continue investing in our digital lab in Utah to pioneer exciting growth and productivity tools for existing coaches as well as developing additional pathways for attracting new clients and encouraging and engaging new coaches.\r\nDeployment of the two proprietary apps we've been developing is advancing and the early metrics are encouraging.\r\nThe OPTAVIA app targets clients and features healthy recipes, self-service options related to the OPTAVIA Premier orders and other key information to stay engaged.\r\nIt's broadly available in the U.S., while select users have access now in our Asia markets, where it is on track to go live within the next few weeks.\r\nThrough mid-October, there have been over 217,000 unique downloads and daily average usage has averaged approximately 50,000 over the past month.\r\nOur Connect app is designed for OPTAVIA coaches to provide a powerful tool to help them efficiently manage and grow their business with instant access to key data and insights.\r\nAnd that recently went live with approximately 2,000 business leaders and business coaches and will be rolled out across the broader coach population of 61,000-plus OPTAVIA coaches during the fourth quarter.\r\nFor some time now, many people have been looking at their health more holistically with a specific focus on developing healthy habits in every area of their life.\r\nOur latest survey findings revealed that a large majority of U.S. adults have guidance from someone who has had similar experiences in helping them not only to reach their goals, but also to develop healthy habits.\r\nWe found that 66% of adults say having support helped them throughout their health and wellness journey and that more than four in five or 81% of U.S. adults believe that they would be more successful in creating healthy habits if they had support from someone who had been in their shoes.\r\nThis is true of our clients who are supported by independent OPTAVIA coaches, the majority of whom have undergone their own transformation on program and therefore, understand the clients what the clients are going through.\r\nCoach support continues to be a critical component of the OPTAVIA program and a key differentiator of our unique model.\r\nOur competitive position has never been stronger.\r\nOPTAVIA's unique model and holistic approach incorporating coach and community to support helps people achieve their individual goals around health and wellness.\r\nAbout 91.9% of our revenue is subscription-based and 100% of our orders are DTC, ships directly to consumers.\r\nWe now support over one million clients on an annual basis and the number of people we consider as part of our client community is increasing at a rapid rate.\r\nInvestments in technology and infrastructure have made us more efficient and has created a more powerful, scalable platform.\r\nThe strong consistent growth in revenue and profits that we have delivered in the third quarter as well as over the past several years is a testament to the strength of our business and continues to reinforce our confidence in the future.\r\nIn 2019, I shared the goal with our investment community of Medifast generating $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2021.\r\nIn Q3, we are pleased to announce we surpassed that full year revenue goal three months ahead of the original projection, allowing OPTAVIA to join an elite group of brands as it exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue.\r\nAccording to a study by the Boston Consulting Group, there are around 290 $1 billion FMCG brands with U.S. sales and only around 20 of those brands were introduced after the year 2000.\r\nLess than five years ago, we partnered with  Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Revenue surged 52.3% to $413.4 million, while earnings per diluted share rose 22.3% to $3.56. The company's unique coach-based model supports new client acquisition, with new client numbers up 50% YoY in September. Despite promotional activity driving client acquisition, margins were impacted, with gross profit margin down 90 basis points to 74.3%. SG&A expenses increased 57.9% to $251.9 million due to higher commissions and increased information technology costs. Despite the expense increases, income from operations rose to $55.2 million, with the effective tax rate increasing slightly to 23.9%. The company's strong balance sheet includes $160 million of cash and equivalents and no debt. Medifast remains confident in its long-term growth prospects, targeting 15% top-line growth and a 15% operating income margin, forecasting revenue between $1.51 billion and $1.53 billion and earnings per share between $13.27 and $13.96 for fiscal 2021.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n The pandemic has given us an opportunity to display our agility as a company.\r\nWe increased our communications with retailers.\r\nWe changed our marketing messages.\r\nWe shifted investments to categories that are most important to consumers.\r\nAnd we set new production records for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER baking soda.\r\nAnd we've moved people to focus on the online class of trade.\r\nSo we've been proactive in seizing the opportunities presented by the crisis and are increasing manufacturing capacity in our plants and externally with new co-packers.\r\nThe agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team is showing up in our results.\r\nOur priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands.\r\nOur plant, warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job in keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain.\r\nOur office employees continue to work remotely and are doing a super job running the company.\r\nSo now let's talk about the results.\r\nQ3 was another exceptional quarter.\r\nReported sales growth was 13.9% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.70.\r\nRevenue, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher in Q3 than last year, driven by the significant increase in demand for many of our products.\r\nOrganic sales grew 9.9%, driven by higher consumption.\r\nRegarding e-commerce, we were already strong pre-COVID and well positioned online.\r\nIn Q3, our online sales increased by 77% as all retailer.coms have grown.\r\nOne example would be gummy vitamins.\r\nIn 2019, 8% of our full year sales were online.\r\nThis year, we expect full year to be about 14% online.\r\nRecall, we began the year targeting 9% online sales as a percentage of global consumer sales.\r\nIn Q1, it was 10% online; Q2, 13%; and Q3, also 13%.\r\nSo we expect the full year to be actually close to 13% as well.\r\nWe continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers.\r\nThere's no surprises here, actually.\r\nThere is continued consumer concern that stores will run out of stock and websites will face delivery issues.\r\nConsumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time.\r\nIf we look at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally in balance in the 15 categories in which we compete.\r\nWith respect to our brands, we had broad-based consumption growth in Q3.\r\nWe saw a double-digit consumption growth in VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits and cleaners.\r\nIn Household, our laundry business consumption was up 4% and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was up 8%.\r\nWater flossers is another bright spot as consumption turned slightly positive in Q3.\r\nAlthough our Lunch & Learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to continue to address this with incremental advertising.\r\nIn addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, water flossers is another brand we expect to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness.\r\nBATISTE dry shampoo remains impacted by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but improved sequentially compared to Q2 when consumption was down 22%.\r\nTROJAN consumption was down 6% in Q3, but also improved sequentially when we were down 15% in Q2.\r\nThere's no doubt that consumers have made health and wellness a priority.\r\nVITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw the greatest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%.\r\nThe category consumption was even higher.\r\nOur expectation is that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain high.\r\nAnd we have new third-party capacity coming online in late Q4 to take advantage of this trend.\r\nConsumers are focusing on health and wellness, but also, cleaning, home cooking and new grooming routines.\r\nAt a recent investor conference, you may have heard me cite consumer research that suggests it takes 66 days to form a new habit.\r\nAnd only time will tell if all of these new behaviors will translate into permanently higher levels of consumption.\r\nBut if they do endure over time, we believe we are well positioned.\r\nNow a few words about private label.\r\nAs you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories.\r\nPrivate label shares have remained generally unchanged for the first, second and third quarters of this year.\r\nOur international business came through with double-digit organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our GMG business, that's our Global Markets Group, and Canada.\r\nIn October, our GMG business is off to another strong start, and we continue to see strong POS recovery in Canada and Europe.\r\nAfter three consecutive quarters of growth, our Specialty Products business contracted 3.4% in Q3, primarily due to the poultry segment.\r\nNow turning to new products.\r\nInnovative new products will continue to attract consumers even in this economy.\r\nVITAFUSION gummy vitamins launched a number of new products.\r\nAnd to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity, we launched POWER ZINC and Elderberry gummies.\r\nWe've launched ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, which has only six ingredients plus water compared to 15 to 30 ingredients for typical liquid detergents.\r\nAnd in the second half, we launched ARM & HAMMER ABSORBx clumping cat litter, a new litter, which is 55% lighter than our regular litter.\r\nNow let's turn to the outlook.\r\nWe're having an exceptional year.\r\nWe now expect full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%, which is far above our evergreen target of 8% annual earnings per share growth.\r\nGiven our strong performance, we have raised our full year outlook for sales growth to be approximately 11% and organic sales growth to be approximately 9%.\r\nAs mentioned many times in the past, we take the long view in managing Church & Dwight in order to sustain our evergreen model.\r\nIn the second half, we took the opportunity to increase our marketing spend behind our new products and we made incremental investments in the company.\r\nAs we wind up the year, we are putting together our 2021 plan.\r\nIt's safe to say that we have a high degree of confidence that we will meet our evergreen model in '21.\r\nIn February, we'll provide our detailed outlook for next year.\r\nNow in conclusion, I would like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight.\r\nThe great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good and bad economic times.\r\nThe categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers.\r\nAnd we have a few categories that stand to benefit from the current environment.\r\nWe have a balance of value and premium products.\r\nOur power brands are number one or number two in their categories.\r\nAnd we have low exposure to private label.\r\nWe're coming off some of the best growth quarters we've ever had.\r\nAnd with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses.\r\nWe believe our company is stronger and more agile than ever.\r\nAnd finally, we have the resources, the common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands perform well in the future.\r\nNext up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter.\r\nWe'll start with EPS.\r\nThird quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an acquisition-related earnout adjustment, grew 6.1% to $0.70 compared to $0.66 in 2019.\r\nAs we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period.\r\nStronger-than-expected sales performance allowed the company to spend incrementally on marketing.\r\nReported revenue was up 13.9%, reflecting a continued increase in consumer demand for our products.\r\nOrganic sales was up 9.9%, driven by a volume increase of 10.2%, partially offset

distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $517 million, also a record for SUN and up 14% from 2019.\r\nWe improved our already strong coverage ratio to 1.5 times, up from 1.3 times in both 2018 and 2019.\r\nOur cost reduction initiatives resulted in total operating expenses of $448 million, which was a reduction of 11% from 2019 levels.\r\nOur fuel margin increased $0.018 per gallon from 2019 to $0.119 per gallon.\r\nWe successfully refinanced our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023, with new 4.5% Senior Notes due 2029, thereby lowering interest expense, while significantly expanding the weighted average maturity of our debt.\r\nFor reference, our nearest Senior Note debt maturity is now the 2026 Senior Notes.\r\nAnd finally, we improved our leverage to 4.18 times, or 4.1 times when adjusted for total cash on hand from 4.6 times at the end of 2019.\r\nOur liquidity remains strong, with an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and $97 million in cash at year-end.\r\nWith all these accomplishments as a backdrop, we enter 2021 poised to continue to deliver strong results.\r\nIn December, we provided guidance for 2021 for adjusted EBITDA of between $725 million and $765 million.\r\nUnderpinning this guidance are the following: fuel volumes in a range of 7.25 billion to 7.75 billion gallons; annual fuel margin between $0.11 per gallon and $0.12 per gallon; total operating expenses of between $440 million and $450 million; maintenance capital of $45 million; and growth capital of at least $120 million.\r\nFree cash flow generating capability of this business allows us to focus on the pillars of our capital allocation strategy.\r\nFirst, to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders.\r\nSecond, to protect our balance sheet through debt paydown when prudent.\r\nAnd third, to pursue disciplined investment in our growth opportunities.\r\nWe will be financially disciplined with the target coverage ratio of 1.4 times, which is up from our prior target of 1.2 times and a target leverage ratio of 4 times, which is down from our prior target of 4.5 times to 4.75 times.\r\nI'd like to conclude my remarks by stating that Sunoco established a strong financial footing early on in 2020 and this continues to carry through as we enter 2021.\r\nScott and Dylan walk you through the numbers for the quarter and the full year.\r\nI want to take a few minutes and give you a sense of how we view these results and what kind of insight they give us into 2021.\r\nLet's start by talking about volume.\r\nOn the surface, our fourth quarter results were very similar to the third quarter.\r\nThere are a few additional factors though that we view as promising.\r\nFirst, during our last conference call, I shared the volumes were off around 12% for October.\r\nWhen we moved into November and December, we all experienced some additional restrictions on travel and business activity, with the increase in COVID cases across the country.\r\nEven with those additional restrictions, our volumes held and we finished the quarter at about the same level relative to the prior year.\r\nThe second factor is around J.C. Nolan volumes.\r\nLast quarter, I explained that our J.C. Nolan diesel volumes were off much more than the rest of our business.\r\nWe were also lapping the start-up of the pipeline in the third quarter of 2019.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, this was an even bigger impact, since we were comparing against a full period of pipeline operation.\r\nYear-over-year, J.C. Nolan volume reductions accounted for 3% of total volume for the fourth quarter.\r\nSo that would put our volumes down only 9%, if you remove the impact of J.C. Nolan.\r\nMy final thought on volumes provides some insight into one of the reasons for the solid performance, which is our ability to add new customers.\r\nStarting last summer, we started ramping backup our growth focus on signing up new customers, and we're starting to see that in our Q4 numbers, and that will carry forward into 2021.\r\nThe bottom line is that we see our volumes continue to grow through the rest of this year, both from overall economic recovery and our own growth efforts.\r\nMoving over to margins, the market continues to support stronger margins.\r\nLet me give you some perspective on our reported margins for the fourth quarter.\r\nFirst, we saw a challenging market environment with a fairly steady and relentless claim in RBOB prices for most of the quarter.\r\nIf you look back at our history, that would have likely resulted in margins close to $0.09 a gallon, maybe even dipping a little lower.\r\nFast forward to the post-COVID environment and the floor is higher, which is what our fourth quarter results look like after you account for the one-time adjustments and inventory timing impacts as Scott mentioned.\r\nAs we have stated before, the higher breakeven environment for many industry participants, both in the wholesale and retail channels, helps support the higher margin floor.\r\nAs we look to the first quarter, we've continued to see a steady rise in RBOB prices, putting pressure on margins.\r\nAnd we still feel like a floor in the $0.095 to $0.10 range is reasonable for these tough market environments, excluding one-time issues in the quarter.\r\nWe already discussed some one-time items for the fourth quarter, and we expect the 7-Eleven catch-up payment in the first quarter that will provide a boost to our base margins.\r\nFinally, I want to provide some more color around our expense performance.\r\nFor the last few years, we've been extremely focused on looking hard at what it takes to efficiently run our business.\r\nWhen COVID hit, we took an even deeper look and made some tough choices.\r\nOur expense performance in the third and fourth quarters show that we are able to operate at these levels.\r\nThere will always be some fluctuations in timing, and there w Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\r\nDuring the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations or FFO, core FFO, and Same-Center net operating income.\r\nAs such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, February 18, 2021.\r\nAt this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.\r\nWe request that everyone ask only one question and one follow-up to allow as many of you as possible to ask questions.\r\nIf time permits, we are happy for you to requeue for additional questions.\r\nOn the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nClearly, 2020 was a year like no other.\r\nAnd I want to express my deep appreciation for the entire Tanger team who have worked so diligently to navigate the challenges brought on by the global pandemic.\r\nVirtually, all of our tenants have been facing mandates, directing them to close their stores, operate at reduced capacity and comply with additional health and safety measures.\r\nIn 2020, there were several retail bankruptcies and restructurings, resulting in space recapture and higher vacancy than historic levels.\r\nBut also providing us with opportunities to further diversify and upgrade our tenant mix.\r\nThis past year also highlighted the positive characteristics of the Tanger Outlet platform.\r\nAs evidenced, by the resilience, our portfolio has demonstrated since governmental mandates were lifted starting in the second quarter of 2020.\r\nOur open-air centers provide an excellent value proposition for both retailers and shoppers that cannot be duplicated by e-commerce or other brick-and-mortar formats.\r\nThese desirable characteristics are demonstrated in our recent results, including the rapid pace that stores reopened after mandates were lifted and the positive trends in our traffic and rent collection metrics.\r\nOur balance sheet further differentiates Tanger.\r\nOur financial strategy has always been conservative, with a great emphasis on maintaining sufficient liquidity to provide optimal flexibility.\r\nIn January, given the meaningful improvement of our cash flows since the onset of the pandemic, we reinstated out dividend, which is an important part of our total return for shareholders.\r\nAs previously announced on January 1, I assumed the role of Executive Chair after 12 years as CEO.\r\nAnd the more than 35 years that I've been with the company, I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished as the leader in the outlet industry.\r\nWe created a brand synonymous with quality Outlet Centers, became the go-to-channel for countless world-class brands and retailers, created thousands of jobs and prioritized our role as a community leader, contributor, and partner.\r\nI have complete confidence in Steve's ability to lead the company during this transformative time and look forward to advising Steve through this transition.\r\nWe are encouraged by the opportunities we have identified to position the company to return to sustained growth over time.\r\nFinally, I want to extend our best wishes to those who are in the path of the current winter storms and are being so impacted by the extreme weather and power outages.\r\nI'm grateful and excited for the opportunity to lead Tanger through this important transition, in partnership with Steve, our Board of Directors, and the entire Tanger team.\r\nWhile the last 11 months' have been challenging for our company, the positive traffic, rent collections and liquidity trends that Steve mentioned are all indicators that our business is stabilizing and our shoppers are quickly returning to our open-air outlet shopping centers.\r\nDuring 2020, while navigating the pandemic, we accomplished many things and established the groundwork for positioning our company for growth.\r\nOur team turned challenges into opportunities and focused on enhancing the key components of our core business, leasing, operations and marketing.\r\nOur year end consolidated portfolio occupancy was 91.9% despite having recaptured almost 8% of the square footage in our portfolio during the year due to bankruptcies and brandwide retailer restructurings.\r\nLeasing has taken on an increased intensity and a broader focus across the entire company.\r\nOur leasing and business development professionals are focused on growing our existing tenant base through store expansions and new deals across our portfolio, identifying new retailers and users in order to diversify our center offerings and augment our merchandising with best-in-market food, entertainment and experiential retailers, aimed at driving new shopper visits, increasing their frequency, extending their stay and driving sales growth.\r\nThis strategy has already begun to pay off as we have added best-in-class brands such as Tory Burch, Lululemon, Victoria's Secret and Hugo Boss to several new locations.\r\nAnd in early 2021, we'll add new categories.\r\nFor example, in the F&B category, the iconic Gourmet grocer Nantucket Meat and Fish took space in Hilton Head, South Carolina.\r\nIn the sporting goods category, Dick's will open their first outlet warehouse concept with us later this month.\r\nAnd in shipping and distribution, through our partnership with PELAGIC [Phonetic], the last mile distribution and logistics platform, we are opening our first on-center facility in Deer Park, which we anticipate will be a model for other locations going forward.\r\nLeasing momentum had started to build in Q4 across our portfolio and continues to do so now.\r\nWe are well staffed to take advantage of this increased activity.\r\nIn addition to our team of leasing professionals, we've entered into strategic partnerships in key markets with top retail brokers to tap their local market expertise and drive best-in-class local and iconic businesses in these select markets.\r\nLastly, as I discussed last quarter, we brought on an EVP of Property Operations to help create a field-led strategy.\r\nThrough this initiative, we've reorganized our field management teams and have empowered them to take a proactive role in supporting our local leasing initiatives.\r\nGiven the level of vacancy going into 2021, it's going to take time to rebuild our occupancy, and we anticipate that.\r\nIn certain cases, rent spreads will continue to be pressured.\r\nHowever, we are encouraged by an increase in deal activity as we see more retailers strategizing growth.\r\nWhile our strong brand, stabilized traffic and an attractive value proposition, Tanger Outlet's offers retail brands a compelling solution to manage their product, placement and pricing that is unique to any other retail distribution channel.\r\nWe also believe there is an opportunity to drive NOI by monetizing additional elements of our center, such as media and amenity sponsorships.\r\nAt the onset of the pandemic, we proactively offered all of our retail partners the opportunity to defer April and May rents until January and February of this year, in order to provide them the flexibility to reopen quickly when the mandates were lifted.\r\nThis strategy proved effective.\r\nThe percentage of occupied stores that are open rapidly accelerated post mandate and currently stands at 99%.\r\nOur strong rent collections at 95% of fourth quarter build rents and better than expected deferred rent collections to date demonstrate that the strategy was successful, where we permitted concessions, we negotiated landlord-friendly amendments that resulted in a value for value exchange that strengthened our portfolio.\r\nWe also took a closer look at expenses and we're able to quickly devise a plan that resulted in almost $18 million in cost reductions over the last nine mon Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Our speakers are Jim Owens, H.B. Fuller President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Corkrean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nFirst, a reminder that our comments today will include references to organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues.\r\nWe believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist their understanding of our operating performance and how our results compare with other companies.\r\nUnless otherwise specified, discussion of sales and revenue refers to organic revenues and discussion of EPS, margins or EBITDA refers to adjusted non-GAAP measures.\r\nMany of these risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by COVID-19 and resulting deterioration of the global business and economic environment.\r\nLast evening, we reported first quarter results, which built upon the momentum we saw in Q4 of last year.\r\nOrganic revenues this quarter were up 10.5%, adjusted EBITDA was up 30% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 was nearly doubled last year's first quarter.\r\nThe H.B. Fuller team gained share and reduced operating expense in each of our businesses in 2020, which created the momentum that is delivering exceptional financial performance to begin fiscal 2021.\r\nMarket innovation and exceptional service led to the share gains as H.B. Fuller solved customer problems faster than competition and growth accelerated as demand continued to strengthen in the first quarter.\r\nAs we reported last March, COVID-19 impacted our fiscal Q1 of 2020 only in China and by about $15 million in revenue, $4.5 million in EBITDA and $0.06 of EPS.\r\nExcluding this impact, our revenues were up 8% organically, EBITDA was up 23% and earnings per share was up 65%, exceptional results.\r\nH.B. Fuller works with our customers to solve their toughest adhesive problems.\r\nIn today's remote work environment, this means collaborating in new ways and delivering market-driven innovation faster than ever.\r\nFor example, we proactively developed and qualified new engineering adhesives for mobile devices, automotive, electronics, electronic vehicle batteries and solar panels to name just a few.\r\nThese innovations helped drive one of our strongest quarters for engineering adhesive sales growth.\r\nWe created technology and branding opportunities with the new line of GorillaPro MRO adhesives and there will be more H.B. Fuller marketing innovation in the year ahead.\r\nWe work with Hygiene, Health and Consumable customers to develop innovative applications and to ensure supply to meet high demand for their products.\r\nAs a result, we substantially grew our sales across the majority of our HHC end markets in the first quarter.\r\nH.B. Fuller's revenue growth was also broad based geographically in the quarter with organic growth in all three of our geographic regions.\r\nImportantly, our growth came with positive incremental margins driven by product mix, reduced expenses and structural efficiencies resulting from our business realignment last year.\r\nEBITDA margin increased 190 basis points year-on-year.\r\nRaw material cost increased from where we exited 2020, but we're still relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter and in line with our expectations.\r\nRaw material cost going forward will increase at a faster rate than originally anticipated due to increased demand, reduced inventories and supply constraint.\r\nWinter storm Uri in the Gulf Coast in February has created additional tightening in the United States and is impacting global supply.\r\nSupply has become tight for commodity materials, which make up a smaller portion of our portfolio.\r\nAs the year progresses, this will also have an impact on the supply and pricing of the specialty materials, which make up the majority of our purchases.\r\nMost suppliers have made good progress in recovering from Uri.\r\nHowever, the rate of recovery going forward will mostly depend on the output rates of the impacted assets and the time it takes for supply chains and inventory levels to fully recover.\r\nWe have done a very good job of serving customers thus far by working closely to manage inventories and available materials.\r\nOur contracted positions with our suppliers, backward integration of key polymers and global breadth have helped us manage the supply crisis thus far.\r\nThe breadth of our adhesive chemistry and the diversity of our raw materials has meant that no single material has had a large impact on us and has enabled us to help customers find alternatives when short supply exists.\r\nThe near-term disruptions we are navigating in the US are considerable, but they are temporary and supply is expected to normalize to a more balanced level in the coming months.\r\nOur planning assumptions anticipate that the risk of supply disruption will lessen as we exit the second quarter and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our ability to meet demand.\r\nHowever, we now expect year-on-year raw material inflation to be in the range of 5% to 8%.\r\nH.B. Fuller has done a remarkable job in supporting customers through supply shortages and we also have implemented over $100 million in annualized price adjustments that are effective in Q2 and will enable us to continue to seamlessly serve our customers.\r\nSome of these were effective on February 15, with most effective March 15 and April 1.\r\nWe are preparing for further price adjustments, if needed in Q3.\r\nThese price adjustments will fully offset the impact of raw material increases.\r\nNow let me move on to discuss performance in each of our segments in the first quarter on Slide 4.\r\nHygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives' first quarter organic sales increased 7.6% year-over-year, continuing the strong performance trend in this business unit in 2020.\r\nSales increased versus last year across the majority of our HHC markets with strong growth in Packaging, Tissue & Towel and Tape & Label and good growth in hygiene in particular.\r\nHHC segment EBITDA margin was strong at 13.3%, up 180 basis points, margin improved versus last year, reflecting volume leverage, restructuring benefits and good expense management.\r\nConstruction Adhesives' organic revenue was down 10% versus last year as winter storm Uri, extreme weather and material supply issues across much of the United States impacted construction activity as we started the year.\r\nConstruction Adhesives' EBITDA margin declined versus last year reflecting these issues.\r\nUnderlying operational improvements from the GBU restructuring were offset by lower volume and the impact of severe weather.\r\nUri temporarily disrupted operations at our construction adhesive facilities in Texas in February.\r\nBoth plants have now been fully up and running since early March.\r\nAside from these near-term impacts, demand for Construction Adhesives continues to be strong for residential builds and remodeling.\r\nDemand has also begun to improve on the commercial roofing side.\r\nWe are planning for both top-line performance and margins to improve significantly over the rest of the year.\r\nEngineering Adhesive results were extremely strong with organic revenue up 21% versus last year, reflecting share gains and improving end market demand.\r\nSales increased versus last year across the majority of our EA markets with the strongest growth in electronics and new energy.\r\nWe expect continued strength and double-digit full year growth in this segment.\r\nEngineering Adhesives' EBITDA margins were strong at 15.4%, up 300 basis points compared with Q1 last year, reflecting strong volume leverage and good expense management.\r\nLooking ahead at our full year results, our planning assumptions are that COVID-related shutdown impacts will remain but continue to decrease as vaccines are rolled out around the world.\r\nWe anticipate that many raw materials will be tied through the summer as supply chains normalize and demand continues to be strong.\r\nWe anticipate continued improvement in unde Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

The company attributed this growth to market innovation, exceptional service, and accelerated demand. Across its Hygiene, Health and Consumable, Construction Adhesives, and Engineering Adhesives segments, H.B. Fuller saw strong organic revenue increases in all regions, driven by product mix, reduced expenses, and structural efficiencies.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n Please ensure that your lines are muted until the operator announces your turn to ask a question.\r\nLeading our call today will be Mike Manley, our chief executive officer; and Joe Lower, our chief financial officer.\r\nI will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.\r\nBut as this is my first call, I was also trying to think about what may be helpful for me to touch on in addition to the financial results.\r\nAnd I thought that, firstly, I'm going to give a brief overview of some of the things that I've been doing over the last three months.\r\nAnd then I'm going to go through the highlights of the group's performance and hand over to Joe who will give you more of the fine detail.\r\nAfter that, I'm going to touch on a number of the key topics I gained attention over the last few weeks.\r\nAnd in closing, before our Q&A, I thought I may give a knock to the future, which will albeit just a summary of some of my preliminary observations.\r\nSo as you can imagine, when you join in the organization, particularly one that has a broad national footprint of retail locations and over 20,000 people in the field, you spend quite a lot of time traveling around the country.\r\nAnd today, I have the opportunity to visit a number of our franchise dealerships, including our most recent acquisitions, many of our AutoNation USA stores, our auction sites and a number of our collision centers from coast to coast.\r\nNow obviously, I knew from our previous life that AutoNation was the largest automotive retailer in the United States, and that it also begun to build additional brand businesses and capabilities at scale.\r\nBut I have to genuinely say that reading about it on paper actually doesn't do it justice to what has been built and the talent that the organization possesses, that could actually see, feel, and get a sense of by actually visiting the locations.\r\nI think when you get the opportunity to travel to our dealerships and businesses, you really start to recognize the incredible assets that the group has been able to build, acquire and develop.\r\nWhen I think about the 330 franchises in our dealerships, not only do the brands we represent account for 99% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S., but we're also fortunate to have a superbly balanced portfolio of the best automotive brands in the world.\r\nAnd they are located in some of the most exciting franchise territories.\r\nIn addition to visiting our retail businesses, I've also met with a number of our OEM partners.\r\nAnd I have to say, unfortunately, I haven't been able to get around all of them.\r\nSo for me, this is a big clear to do and finish list.\r\nAnd I'm looking forward to meeting with our partners that I haven't met yet.\r\nBut I have to say the ones and have now been incredibly encouraged by our conversations.\r\nWe've had what I would consider very frank exchange of views.\r\nAnd very importantly, I've been able to see the brand and the product plans for the future.\r\nAnd for me, just makes representative fantastic brands even more exciting when you understand what's actually coming through the pipeline.\r\nNow obviously, our franchise dealerships is an important core part of our group, and our scale gives us significant opportunities.\r\nBut it's also clear that we're also developing businesses and platforms that will significantly expand our reach, and I think give us the opportunity to take advantage of things as they unveil in the future.\r\nAs you know, we're building a strong focus used car brand with AutoNation USA.\r\nAnd as Joe will tell you in a minute, all of the stores we have, including those added in 2021, are up and running.\r\nThey're profitable, ahead of our expectations, and adding happy customers to our growing family on a daily basis.\r\nAnd finally, and I think this is really important, the one thing you really do get a true feel of once you're on the inside on a day-to-day basis is the quality and the passion of the AutoNation team.\r\nIt doesn't matter where I've been, either in our dealerships, our collision centers and our corporate office, I think there's really a clear will to win and a customer and community-focused culture.\r\nSo on this point, as a reality check, I do have to say I've never heard an incoming CEO say anything bad about the team he or she walked into.\r\nCertainly, not at least on the first.\r\nBut and you know doubt probably expected me to complement our people.\r\nBut my comment actually goes well beyond platitudes.\r\nBecause you can imagine, our strong performance, how pleased I am with the team's delivery of the seventh consecutive record quarter.\r\nAnd I think we have to remember, this is still delivered during very unusual times, with significant disruption from lack of supply, winter COVID spikes and competition everywhere.\r\nAnd my comments actually go beyond that.\r\nThey're made as much for the performance the team delivered as they are for the less visible selfless work they do in our communities and the fight against cancer.\r\nAutoNation's Drive Pink campaign was a true revelation to me.\r\nNot in the center, an organization was involved in social and community projects or charity works, because actually, I think that's what organizations are supposed to do.\r\nBut I was amazed to see just how many of our associates get involved on their own time to support Drive Pink and drive out cancer.\r\nToday, the people of AutoNation have raised over $30 million, which has been plowed into research, treatment and care.\r\nNow that is a team that I can tell you, I'm already very proud of.\r\nSo just give you a brief flavor of my first three months, and now I'm going to turn to our results.\r\nSo you've seen from the numbers, we delivered another outstanding quarter and a very strong year.\r\nAnd today, as I already mentioned, we report our seventh consecutive record quarterly results with adjusted earnings per share of $5.76, which is an increase of $137, and revenue increasing by $797 million or 14% compared to the prior year.\r\nNow this was driven by robust growth in used vehicle sales, consumer finance services and aftersales.\r\nTotal units for the quarter declined by 1%.\r\nAnd that was driven by new vehicle sales, down 20%, which was largely offset by an increase in 21% of used vehicle volume compared to the prior year.\r\nAnd with strong consumer demand, we continue to focus on our sourcing capabilities to used vehicles, which further strengthened both our franchise dealerships and our AutoNation USA businesses.\r\nWhen I look at that, nearly 90% of all pre-owned vehicles retailed in the quarter were self-sourced prior acquisition strategy, which obviously includes all of the trade-ins, but now increasingly, our we buy your car program, which processes directly from customers.\r\nAnd as a result, used vehicle revenue increased 55% for the quarter.\r\nNow as I previously mentioned, AutoNation USA is a successful part of our plan.\r\nAnd in November, we opened AutoNation USA Avondale and Phoenix and recently entered the new market with our 10 AutoNation store, USA store in Charlotte.\r\nNow each new store opened in 2021 has exceeded expectation, and as I said, profitable in the first four months of operation.\r\nAnd we remain on target to open 12 additional new stores over the next 12 months.\r\nI think our focus on margin expense control significantly contributed to our performance as strong new used finance and insurance margin per unit, up significantly year over year and in the quarter, and continued our improvement in our after sales business, which delivered an 11% increase in gross profit.\r\nI know it's been discussed over, the ongoing expense control, something which, frankly, I consider structural in the business now helped contribute to an overall increase in total store profits by over 150%.\r\nNow with that, I'm going to hand you over to Joe, who's going to take you through the detail of the financials.\r\nToday, we reported fourth quarter total revenue of $6.6 billion, an increa Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # In Q4, AutoNation reported strong financial results, with revenue increasing by 14% to $6.6 billion. This growth was driven by a 55% increase in used vehicle revenue and double-digit gains in customer financial services and aftersales. Despite a 20% decline in new vehicle sales due to supply chain issues, used vehicle sales grew by 21%, leading to a 130% increase in adjusted net income to $5.76 per share. The company's strong financial performance is attributed to improved margins, expense control, and the success of its AutoNation USA used car business. With over $1.5 billion in liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times, AutoNation has ample capital to invest in growth opportunities. The company's management is optimistic about the future, recognizing the industry's transformation and the opportunities it presents. To drive innovation and expansion, AutoNation has created a new executive role, appointing Gianluca Camplone as EVP, head of Mobility, Business Development and Strategy, and COO of Precision Parts. The company remains committed to leveraging its brand, scale, and digital capabilities to grow its customer base and expand its mobility solutions.</s>"}

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n\nEarnings Call Transcript:\n We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nParticipants in today's call include our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Vice Chairperson and Executive Director, John Somerhalder.\r\nWe will also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.\r\nYesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which is in the upper end of our guidance range.\r\nAs Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather-adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses.\r\nLast month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors.\r\nI greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me, since I was named President last May and Acting CEO in October.\r\nI have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities.\r\nIt's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success.\r\nAs we work to move FirstEnergy forward, my priorities are the continued safety of our employees and customers.\r\nEnsuring that ethics, accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program.\r\nExecuting FE forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential, deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers.\r\nDuring today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments.\r\nJohn Somerhalder will join us for an update on the Board and management's work toward instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity.\r\nAs we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations.\r\nWe have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement.\r\nWe can't currently predict the timing, outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ.\r\nOur goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review.\r\nThis approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy.\r\nFor example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s.\r\nWe've paused all other political disbursements, including from our political action committee.\r\nAnd we have limited our participation in the political process.\r\nWe have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships.\r\nIn addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency.\r\nFor example, we have committed to post updates on our website, on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our corporate political activity policy, which is under revision.\r\nA comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity.\r\nIn Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty, affecting our utilities in the state.\r\nThis includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million.\r\nThis comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law plus interest, the partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers.\r\nTogether, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers.\r\nThese are important steps to put this matter behind us.\r\nIn other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case to provide perspective SEET values on an individual company basis.\r\nWe are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 SEET cases that were consolidated into this proceeding.\r\nDuring our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments.\r\nThose conversations are under way in each effective jurisdiction.\r\nIn Ohio at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of Rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments.\r\nOutside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate.\r\nFor example, on March 1, JCP&L, filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities seeking approval for its proposed EV driven program.\r\nIf approved, the four-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory, in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers.\r\nAnd in late March the Pennsylvania PUC approved our five-year $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets.\r\nIn March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump-storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million.\r\nAnd we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local co-op.\r\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers.\r\nDuring our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our companywide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry leader delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns.\r\nWe expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid, while also maintaining affordable electric bills.\r\nDuring the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve.\r\nWhile our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes, take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees.\r\nWe've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter.\r\nExamples of this work include, improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers, leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs, using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self service options and improve their experience and leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms.\r\nAs part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases o Please summarize this transcript in exactly one paragraph using complete sentences.

[/INST] # FirstEnergy reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, within the guidance range. Strong residential load, rate increases, and operational efficiency contributed to the results, partially offset by lost revenue from discontinued decoupling. The company is committed to enhancing compliance, with key actions including hiring a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, strengthening governance, and improving internal controls. Despite investigations, FirstEnergy remains optimistic about its future, emphasizing its focus on safety, ethical behavior, and innovation. The company reaffirms its 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and anticipates a $150-$200 million annual cash flow increase through 2023. FirstEnergy's progress in pension funding and debt reduction will support its goal of returning to investment grade credit ratings.</s>"}
