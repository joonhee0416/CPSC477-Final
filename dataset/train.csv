KBH_q2_2021.txt,"On the call are Jeff Mezger, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Matt Mandino, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Kaminski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hollinger, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Thad Johnson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.
And with that, here is Jeff Mezger.
We delivered healthy results in the second quarter marked by one of the strongest quarters for both operating and gross margin performance in some time.
Operationally, our divisions are doing an excellent job of navigating this environment of demand strength and well-publicized supply chain constraints as we effectively balance pace, price and starts to optimize our assets and manage our production.
With our full year coming into better view, we are poised for continued returns-focused growth expanding our scale to about $6 billion in revenues and generating a return on equity of roughly 20%.
As for the details of the quarter, we produced total revenues of $1.44 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.50.
We achieved an operating income margin of 11.3% driven by several factors.
In addition to strong market conditions, we are benefiting from solid performance in our newer communities, operating leverage from both the increase in our community absorption rate as well as overall higher revenues, disciplined management of our SG&A costs and the ongoing tailwind from lower interest amortization.
Our profitability per unit grew meaningfully on a sequential basis to nearly $47,000.
We achieved or surpassed our expectations across our financial metrics, although deliveries were at the low end of our range as some of our deliveries shifted into the third quarter due to supply shortages and municipal delays.
That said, with the benefit of local scale in most of our divisions, we are relying on our long-standing relationships with subcontractors and trade partners to mitigate delays.
With the progression of our work in process and our success in accelerating starts, we are confident in our ability to achieve full-year deliveries of between 14,000 and 14,500 homes.
Our balance sheet is solid.
Having worked through the bulk of our inactive assets, our inventory has rotated into a higher-quality portfolio of communities.
We have grown our equity while reducing our debt resulting in a significantly lower leverage ratio, which we expect will decline further by year-end.
We recently completed a $390 million debt offering, the net proceeds from which together with a portion of our existing cash will be used to retire our '21 maturity in full.
Ultimately the offering will contribute to a reduction of our debt levels and lower our average borrowing rate, providing an ongoing tailwind to our future margins.
We continue to allocate the substantial cash we are generating in a consistent manner prioritizing our future growth to drive greater earnings and returns.
In addition, our balanced approach includes returning cash to stockholders, primarily through our quarterly dividend, which we have raised in each of the past few years and reducing our debt, as I just mentioned.
In the second quarter, we invested $575 million in land acquisition and development, expanding our lot position sequentially by 7,800 lots to roughly 77,500 lots owned or controlled with 45% of the total optioned.
This growth in active inventory, together with improving margins, should help to drive further improvement in our return on equity.
As we discussed last quarter, we are assuming a lower monthly absorption in our underwriting as compared to our current pace and no inflation either in ASP or costs.
In addition, we are pursuing moderately sized deals in our preferred submarkets averaging between 100 and 150 lots and staying on strategy and positioning these new communities to be attainable near the median household income for that sub-market.
We believe using this disciplined approach helps to manage our risk as we acquire land throughout this cycle.
While we expect our near-term growth to come primarily from our existing markets as we work to gain market share and expand our scale, we are also selectively entering new markets.
Along with our success in Seattle and recent reentry into Charlotte, we are announcing today that we have started up a division in Boise, Idaho, a top 25 housing market.
We see a meaningful opportunity in this fast-growing metro area to offer our personalized homes at affordable prices and we are excited about extending our market strategy to Boise.
We now have over 900 lots under control and anticipate our first land parcel closing in the third quarter.
We successfully opened 33 new communities in the second quarter.
However, as a result of the heightened demand for our homes, we sold out more communities than we had projected and also experienced slippage in some community openings.
Jeff will provide more detail on our community count expectations for this year in a moment.
Looking forward to 2022 with our strong lot pipeline, we remain on track for double-digit year-over-year community count growth.
As we prepare for the significant acceleration of new community openings over the next six quarters, we have also stayed focused on building our backlog to drive our revenues for the balance of this year and into 2022.
Our monthly absorption rate rose to seven net orders per community during the second quarter, even as we managed sales primarily through price increases and secondarily through lot releases in order to balance pace, price and starts.
We are sensitive to affordability as we work to stay within appropriate range near the median household income of each submarket.
Our order ASP has climbed in the past three months, reflecting a combination of mix as well as rising prices.
Our largest sequential net order increase was in our West Coast region.
Although this region carries our highest average selling price, it remains competitive with resales within our submarkets.
Our Los Angeles/Ventura business provides a good example.
This division generated the strongest sequential order growth in the second quarter.
And although it operates at a higher ASP, it is still below the median resale price of homes in its submarkets which are as much as $100,000 higher and selling within a few weeks of being listed.
Resale prices have moved significantly and our relative position has actually been enhanced.
As to lot releases, our approach is similar to how we gauge interest in a new community.
Homebuyers complete an application and go through their initial credit process to join a list of qualified buyers.
We then work through that list as we release lots.
We are typically raising prices in conjunction with each lot release and have not seen a decrease in the conversion of qualified buyers even as base prices have risen.
Our teams work hard to earn our place as the number one customer ranked national homebuilder in third party customer satisfaction surveys by prioritizing service and the relationships we have with our buyers and we're focused on continuing to do so during this time of limited supply.
The metrics that we monitor internally for shifts in affordability are stable.
Buyers are not adjusting the size of the homes they are purchasing to stay in the market.
Although we offer floor plans below 1,600 square feet in over 75% of our communities, buyers are still selecting homes averaging 2,100 feet, which is consistent with their choices over the past couple of years.
As is evident in our results, the desire for homeownership is strong and we believe will remain so for the foreseeable future.
There are two primary factors in forming our view.
The first is an acute shortage of supply stemming not only from limited resale inventory, but also from the under production of new homes over the past 15 years.
This deficit will take many years to correct and until inventory reverts to more normalized levels, the imbalance between supply and demand should continue to support new home sales.
Another key factor is demographics.
The size of the millennial population and the pent-up demand from this cohort together with the Gen Zs now reaching their homebuying years form a large and healthy pool of prospective buyers.
These demographic groups value personalization and we believe we are well positioned to capture increases in home sales given our expertise in serving the first-time buyer which represents 64% of our deliveries this past quarter with our built-to-order approach.
Net orders were 4,300, our best second quarter since 2007 with strength throughout the quarter resulting in year-over-year growth of 145%.
This comparison narrowed at the end of May when we experienced a significant acceleration in order rates that has lasted for the past year.
We are matching starts to sales and in the first half of this year we have quickly scaled up our production to start over 8,500 homes.
To put this in context, the homes we started in the past two quarters represent about 75% of the total homes we started for the full year 2020.
Almost 95% of the homes in production are already sold and we remain committed to our built-to-order business model.
We value the visibility that our even flow [Phonetic] production provides and the flexibility that it affords in positioning our communities to move with demand.
Offering a personalized home creates meaningful differentiation for our Company, which we view as an advantage because buyers value choice.
Nearly 80% of our orders in the second quarter were for personalized homes, which also creates an additional revenue stream from our design studios and with lot premiums.
Our studio revenue per unit rose sequentially in the second quarter and is continuing to average about 9% of our higher base prices.
We continually monitor the frequency of studio selections and had been raising prices on some products, enhancing an already accretive studio margin.
As to lot premiums, we have found over time that if buyers can pick the home they want and build that home on a lot they choose, they're willing to pay for that choice and we can generate additional revenue.
Every incremental dollar of lot premium is an additional dollar of margin.
Between studio revenue and lot premiums, we are averaging about $40,000 per home today and believe there is opportunity to continue to grow this going forward.
We ended the quarter with a robust backlog value of $4.3 billion, up 126% year-over-year representing over 10,000 homes.
As I referenced earlier, our backlog supports the higher revenues we anticipate this year and sets the stage for another year of revenue growth in 2022.
KBHS Home Loans, our mortgage joint venture, continued to be a solid partner for our customers handling the financing for 75% of the homes we delivered in the second quarter.
These buyers have a strong and consistent credit profile with an average down payment of about 13% or over $50,000 and an average FICO score that inched up to 727.
The majority of our buyers are opting for conventional loans similar to the past few years.
Switching gears, we published our 14th Annual Sustainability Report in April, the longest-running report in our industry.
We've been on this journey for over 15 years.
And the commitment we have made to sustainable homebuilding has resulted in KB Home being the industry leader in energy efficiency.
We have built over 150,000 ENERGY STAR certified homes to-date, more than any other builder, and have the lowest published average Home Energy Rating System, or HERS, index score among production homebuilders.
And we're striving to be even better with an aggressive goal to further improve our average HERS score from 50 down to 45 by 2025, a level which translates into an additional estimated reduction in a KB Home's carbon emission of about 8% per year.
In closing, we are poised for an incredible year of expansion in revenues, margins and return on equity as we execute on our ongoing plan to increase our scale while driving a higher ROE.
Equally as important, we are positioned for a strong start to 2022 with the expected increase in our year-end backlog and projected community count growth next year.
We are pleased with how this year has unfolded and look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
I will now cover highlights of our financial performance for the 2021 second quarter and provide our current outlook for the third quarter and full year.
During the quarter, we generated improvements in all our key profitability measures and continued to enhance our balance sheet strength and liquidity.
With our operations performing well, we leveraged 58% growth in housing revenues to generate a 216% increase in operating income for the quarter.
In addition, our net orders reached their highest second-quarter level in 14 years.
Based on our robust financial results and our order performance, we are once again raising our outlook for the remainder of 2021.
Our housing revenues of $1.44 billion for the quarter increased from $910 million in the prior-year period, reflecting a 40% increase in homes delivered and a 13% increase in overall average selling price.
Considering our current backlog and construction cycle times, we anticipate our 2021 third quarter housing revenues will be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.58 billion.
For the full year, we are projecting housing revenues in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion.
We believe we are very well positioned to achieve this top line performance due to our strong second quarter net orders and ending backlog of over 10,000 homes, representing nearly $4.3 billion in ending backlog value.
In the second quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered increased to nearly $410,000, reflecting strong housing market conditions, which enabled us to raise prices in the vast majority of our communities, as well as product and geographic mix shifts of homes delivered.
For the 2021 third quarter we are projecting an overall average selling price of $420,000.
We believe our ASP for the full year will be in a range of $415,000 to $425,000.
Homebuilding operating income significantly improved to $162.9 million as compared to $51.6 million in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting an increase of 560 basis points in operating income margin to 11.3% due to meaningful improvements in both our housing gross profit margin and SG&A expense ratio.
Excluding inventory related charges of $0.5 million in the current quarter and $4.4 million of inventory-related charges and $6.7 million of severance charges in the year-earlier quarter, this metric improved to 11.4% from 6.9%.
We expect our homebuilding operating income margin, excluding the impact of any inventory-related charges, to further improve to a range of 11.7% to 12.1% for the 2021 third quarter.
For the full year, we expect our operating margin, excluding any inventory-related charges, to be in the range of 11.5% to 12%.
Our housing gross profit margin for the second quarter expanded to 21.4%, up 320 basis points from the prior-year period.
The current quarter metric reflected the favorable pricing environment over the past several quarters when most of the orders relating to the second quarter deliveries were booked, increased operating leverage due to higher housing revenues and lower amortization of previously capitalized interest.
Excluding inventory related charges, our gross margin for the quarter increased to 21.5% from 18.7% for the prior-year period.
Our adjusted housing gross profit margin, which excludes inventory-related charges as well as the amortization of previously capitalized interest, was 24.2% for the 2021 second quarter compared to 21.9% for the same 2020 period.
Our continued gross margin improvement trend demonstrates that we have been successful in offsetting input cost inflation with selling price increases.
In addition, with our strategy of locking in material and labor costs at the time each home starts, we have largely mitigated the impact of cost inflation during the construction process.
Assuming no inventory-related charges, we expect a sequential increase in our 2021 third quarter housing gross profit margin to approximately 21.7% and further improvement in the fourth quarter.
Considering this expected favorable trend, we believe our full year housing gross profit margin, excluding inventory-related charges, will be within the range of 21.5% to 22% representing a 215 basis point year-over-year increase at the midpoint.
Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio of 10.1% for the quarter improved from 12.6% for the 2020 second quarter.
The 250 basis point improvement reflected the continued benefit of overhead cost reductions implemented last year in the early stages of the pandemic, increased operating leverage from higher revenues and the severance charges in the year-earlier quarter.
Considering anticipated increases in future revenues and our continuing actions to contain costs, we believe that our 2021 third quarter SG&A expense ratio will be approximately 9.8% and our full year ratio will be in a range of 9.8% to 10.2%.
Our income tax expense for the quarter of $30.3 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 17%, reflected the favorable impact of $14.8 million of federal energy tax credits recorded in the quarter relating to qualifying energy-efficient homes.
We expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 20%, including the expected favorable impact of additional federal energy tax credits in the third and fourth quarters.
Overall, we produced net income for the second quarter of $143.4 million or $1.50 per diluted share compared to $52 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the prior-year period.
Turning now to community count, our second quarter average of 205 communities decreased 17% from the year-earlier quarter.
We ended the quarter with 200 communities as compared to 244 communities at the end of the 2020 second quarter.
On a sequential basis, our average community count decreased 8% from the first quarter and ending community count was down 4%.
The decreases were due to our strong absorption pace of seven monthly net orders per community during the quarter, which show 42 close-outs as well as community openings that were delayed to the third quarter.
Over the past 12 months our robust absorption pace has driven the close-out of over 150 selling communities.
Although they will not generate additional net orders, we will continue to produce revenues and profit in future quarters associated with nearly 80% of these sold-out communities as we work through the construction and delivery of the sold homes.
The upside from our strong pace of orders is now reflected in our backlog which will drive increased future housing revenues.
Our expectation of continued strong net order activity will drive elevated levels of community close-outs in the second half of this year.
Our goal is to offset the impact of these close-outs by opening a higher number of new communities in both the third and fourth quarters to achieve sequential growth.
We anticipate our 2021 third quarter ending community count will increase sequentially by approximately 5%, followed by another modest sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.
With our significant year-over-year increase in lot supply and our focus on developing and opening new communities as quickly as possible over the next six quarters, we believe we can achieve sequential increases in our quarter-end community count over that period.
We remain committed to our target of double-digit year-over-year growth in community count for 2022.
Favorable operating cash flow in the quarter generated primarily from homes delivered net of higher levels of land investment resulted in quarter and total liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion including $608 million of cash and $788 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
Earlier this month, we completed the $390 million issuance of 4% 10-year senior notes and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem approximately $270 million of tendered 7% notes that mature on December 15, 2021.
We expect to realize a charge of approximately $5 million for this early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter.
It is our intention to redeem the remaining $180 million of the 7% notes at par value on September 15.
Once completed, this redemption, partially offset by the new issuance, will result in a net $16 million reduction in debt and an annualized interest savings of nearly $16 million, contributing to our continuing trend of lowering the interest amortization included in future housing gross profit margins.
In addition, we believe the $350 million of our maturity in 2022 of 7.5% senior notes represents another opportunity to reduce incurred interest and enhanced future gross margins.
In summary, given the size and composition of our quarter-end backlog of over 10,000 homes, along with our expanded production capacity, we expect further improvement in our financial results and return metrics in 2021 as compared to our expectations at the time of our last earnings call.
Using the midpoints of our new guidance ranges, we now expect a 45% year-over-year increase in housing revenues and further expansion in our operating margin to 11.75%.
This profitability level should drive a return on average equity of approximately 20% for the full year.
We believe our emphasis on returns-focused growth will continue to drive improved financial results, increased scale and higher returns to further enhance long-term stockholder value.
Alix, please open the lines.
","KB Home delivered a strong second quarter, driven by solid operational performance and favorable market conditions. The company achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.50, exceeding analysts' estimates. Total revenues rose 58% to $1.44 billion, largely attributed to a surge in housing revenues, which witnessed a 40% increase. KB Home experienced a robust surge in net orders, reaching a 14-year high for the second quarter, and its backlog grew significantly by 126% to $4.3 billion. The company's profitability metrics improved, with an operating income margin of 11.3% and a gross profit margin of 21.4%.

HVT_q2_2021.txt,"Actual results may differ materially from those made or implied in such statements, which speak only of date they are made and which we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise.
Our Chairman and CEO, Clarence Smith will now give you an update on our results.
And then, our President, Steve Burdette will provide additional commentary about our business.
We're very pleased with the record results for the second quarter with sales of $250 million.
We've done a good job in our expense controls across the board, and combined with pricing disciplines from the merchandising teams and stores, we achieved solid gross margins and 11.7% pre-tax operating profits.
Our ongoing objectives are to grow market share in our existing distribution footprint and maintain double-digit operating margins.
We believe that the increased importance of home that was jump-started with the impact of COVID last spring is a longer-term trend.
While we don't expect the rush that impacted our industry to be at the elevated levels we experienced in recent quarters, we do believe that home is a priority and a sustainable trend for the near future.
The strong desire for homeownership, combined with Havertys strong positioning in Florida, Texas and the Southeast, puts us in an ideal position for today and for the future.
Our supply merchandising and distribution teams are working with our factories and shippers to bring in product to fill orders and reduce our record backlog.
The shipping challenges that home-related industries are experiencing have caused major delays for furniture, which we believe will be problems until the spring of 2022.
We are working to increase our inventories as the production and product flow improves.
We're investing in our distribution capacity to support growth over $1 billion over our regions.
We just completed additional racking to our mothership, the Eastern Distribution Center in Braselton, Georgia, which adds 20% more storage capacity.
We will evaluate potential expansions to our network to better serve our planned growth.
Our current focus is on building market share in our key markets with store positioning and target marketing to our core customer and new homeowners.
Examples of this were the opening of Myrtle Beach earlier this year, the opening of a third store in Austin, in the fast-growing Pflugerville, Round Rock markets and a store opening tomorrow in the villages in Central Florida.
We're in a deep dive reviewing potential locations in our best markets, which will reach the fastest-growing areas and leverage our existing infrastructure.
We expect to announce several new fill-in locations for the 2022 openings.
We're very excited about the rollout of the WE FURNISH HAPPINESS marketing campaign, which we believe more clearly separates Havertys from our competitors and continues to raise the bar on service, quality, furniture and design.
We continue to be focused on our front door, havertys.com.
We've committed to significant investments in IT and state-of-the-art systems to better reach and appeal to our customers.
We've contracted with Adobe to bring on a collection of applications and services that will lay the foundation for unmatched customer experience.
The new foundation will improve functionality, help us create content easier and faster, provide better personalizations using AI-driven automation and enhance our analytics and reporting.
Our goal is to have the best-in-class website experience.
I'm very excited with our results for the second quarter.
This performance was due to the commitment, passion and determination of the store, distribution, home delivery, service and home office teams, whom I want to congratulate personally for their efforts.
Our supply chain network has been able to increase the flow of products into our warehouses over the second quarter even with all the headwinds.
Container capacity continues to be under pressure with the continued increase in demand across all of retail.
We expect this to continue to be an issue for the remainder of the year, even if there is a softening in demand.
Also, container prices on the spot market continue to increase with prices varying between $12,000 and $22,000 a container.
We have been able to balance our shipping mix, so that no more than 20% to 30% is on the water at one-time at these increased rates.
As I stated last quarter, we finalized our contracts on May 1, which are significantly below the spot market rates.
Foam continues to be an issue for some of our domestic vendors, however, their production has increased during the second quarter, but still not at 100%.
Our import vendors are not having any foam issues.
The recent closures in Vietnam due to the increased spread of the Delta variant are not expected to have an impact on our customers, if the closures remain at the projected two weeks.
They are expected to open back up beginning the week of 8/2.
However, if the closures are prolonged four to six weeks then there may be an impact to our customers, who already bought and future customer lead times.
Also, we are seeing port congestion in Vietnam and China, along with continued issues at the LA port and railyards.
Our merchandising and supply chain teams are monitoring the situation very closely with our vendors.
Our pool is now approximately 2 times larger than last year, with the average pool age stretching to approximately eight weeks from six weeks over the last 90 days.
Our special order lead times have increased to 12 weeks to 20 weeks, depending on the vendor, causing some softening in our special order business.
Our distribution, home delivery service network delivered a record quarter.
Over 90% of our markets are delivering within a week to the customer's home once we have the product in our warehouses.
Staffing continues to be our #1 concern in both distribution and home delivery.
The extra unemployment moneys that have stopped in most of the states we operate our warehouses, but there is still not enough people looking for work to fill the jobs available.
However, we remain optimistic that we will see this improve during the third quarter.
In the second quarter of 2021, delivered sales were $250 million, a 127.3% increase over the prior year quarter.
If you recall, our retail operations were closed due to the pandemic in the month of April in 2020.
103 stores reopened on May 1, 2020, and the remaining stores reopened by June 20th.
Total written sales for the second quarter of 2021 were up 67.5% over the prior year period.
Comparable store sales were up 46.9% over the prior year period.
This only include stores that were open for a full month in both periods.
Our gross profit margin increased 240 basis points from 54.2% to 56.6% due to better merchandising, pricing and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.
These improvements were partially offset by an increase in our LIFO reserve as we continue to see increased freight and product cost.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39.8 million or 54.7% to $112.4 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.
However, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined over 2,000 basis points to 45% from 66.1%.
As demonstrated in the past three quarters, our financial model has substantial operating leverage at these sales levels.
Other income in the second quarter of 2020 was $31.8 million, which included the gain on the sale-leaseback transaction of three distribution facilities in 2020.
If you recall, the gross proceeds from the sale was approximately $70 million.
Income before income taxes increased $10.5 million to $29.2 million.
Our tax expense was $6.3 million during the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.6%.
The primary difference in the effective rate and statutory rate is due to the state income taxes and the tax benefit from vested stock awards.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $22.9 million or $1.21 per diluted share on our common stock compared to net income of $13.6 million or $0.72 per share in the comparable period last year.
Excluding the gain on the sale of our distribution assets in 2020, our adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of last year was a $0.52 loss.
Now, turning to our balance sheet.
At the end of the second quarter, our inventories were $115 million, which was up $25 million from the December 31, 2020 balance, and up $10.2 million versus the second quarter of 2020.
At the end of the second quarter, our customer deposits were $116.1 million, which was up $29.9 million from the December 31st balance and up $58.5 million versus Q2 of 2020.
We ended the quarter with $235.3 million of cash, cash equivalents.
We have no funded debt on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter of 2021.
Looking at some of our uses of cash flow, capital expenditures were $10.9 million for the first half of 2021, and we paid $8.6 million of regular dividends during the first half of 2021.
During the second quarter, we did not purchase any common shares in our buyback program, and we have $16.8 million remaining under current authorization for this buyback program.
We expect our gross margins for 2021 to be 56.5% to 56.8%.
We anticipate gross profit margins will be impacted by our current estimates of product and freight cost and changes in our LIFO reserve.
Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $275 million to $278 million range.
This is an increase over our previous estimate, primarily due to rising warehouse compensation and benefit cost.
The variable type costs within SG&A for 2021 are expected to be in the range of 17.3% to 17.5%, a slight decrease over our previous guidance.
Our planned capex for 2021 has increased from $23 million to $37 million.
Anticipated new or replacement stores, remodels and expansions account for $18.7 million.
Investments in our distribution network are expected to be $15.2 million, and investments in our information technology are expected to be approximately $3.1 million.
The largest increase in our planned capex for 2021 is in our distribution network.
In the third quarter of this year, we will be buying back our Virginia warehouse, which we sold and leased back last year.
This is a key distribution asset that may be expanded in the upcoming years.
Owning this asset gives us more flexibility as we evaluate our future growth plans.
Our anticipated effective tax rate in 2021 is expected to be 24%.
This projection excludes the impact from vesting of stock awards and any potential new tax legislation.
This completes our commentary on the second quarter financial results.
","Haverty's posted impressive Q2 results, driven by strong demand for home furnishings. Sales surged 127.3% year-over-year to $250 million, with comparable store sales up 46.9%. Gross margins improved to 56.6%, driven by better merchandising and pricing, while SG&A expenses declined to 45% of sales. The company's financial model continues to demonstrate strong operating leverage, leading to a significant increase in net income to $22.9 million or $1.21 per diluted share. Haverty's is optimistic about the future, citing the ongoing importance of homeownership and their strong positioning in key markets. Expansion efforts include store openings in Austin, Myrtle Beach, and Central Florida, as well as a focus on filling in gaps in existing markets to drive future growth. The company is also investing heavily in its distribution network, IT infrastructure, and marketing to enhance the customer experience. Despite challenges in the supply chain, which are expected to persist into 2022, Haverty's is working to increase inventories and expand its distribution capacity. The company remains optimistic about its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for home furnishings and achieve its long-term growth targets."
ITT_q3_2020.txt,"This is Alex Sherk.
Our adjusted non-GAAP results exclude certain nonoperating and nonrecurring items, including, but not limited to, asbestos, restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
All adjustments in the quarter are detailed in the reconciliations.
Before we begin, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our Q3 GAAP results compared to prior year.
Q3 total revenue decreased 17% to $591 million.
Segment operating income decreased 22% to $84 million.
Regarding EPS, we took our net asbestos liability to a full-horizon estimate, resulting in a noncash expense equivalent to $1.20, the main driver of the $0.55 earnings per share loss.
Free cash flow increased 77% to $271 million.

I truly hope that everyone stays safe.
And to make sure we continue to operate safely, we're implementing our ready, safe, go program across ITT based on the successful containment strategy first developed by our Asia Pacific team.
Today, we will present the results of ITT'ers' relentless efforts to drive our performance and fortify our resilience.
During the last few years, we at ITT have elevated the strategic standing of execution.
Q3's outstanding results are the proof of this and also a testament to our strengthening momentum toward full recovery.
Last quarter, we highlighted our focus on protecting our employees and supporting our communities while providing superior service to our customers with flawless execution.
We also committed to delight our shareholders with record cash flow generation and timely cost actions while playing offense for the future.
This is exactly what we continue to do in Q3.
We delivered record ITT operating income margin of 15.4%.
We grew 92% sequentially in Friction OE sales.
We delivered 19% segment decremental margin and 40% segment incremental margins sequential to Q2.
Lastly, we generated record free cash flow of $271 million.
We are firmly on the road to recovery.
ITT's execution capabilities and our unprecedented granularity delivered higher volume than expected, increased top line sequentially, and through strict fixed cost controls, produced an ITT record quarterly margin performance.
We achieved our highest-ever quarterly operating income margin and our highest-ever year-to-date free cash flow.
This is even more remarkable given the current macro environment.
We will also provide our perspective on the markets we serve.
Before going into Q3 performance, I'd like to highlight our safety record.
Safety is, without a doubt, my top priority.
We have made tremendous progress in all our businesses.
Year-to-date, we reduced the number of incidents by 30%.
Our injury frequency rate is 0.8%, and 50% of our sites have been incident-free for more than a year.
I'm grateful to our teams for their accomplishments and for keeping our people safe.
Now let's turn to our Q3 results.
On the road to recovery, we focus on what we control and broke some records along the way.
We delivered solid earnings per share of $0.82, up 44% sequentially, strong segment operating income margin of 16.2%, up 360 basis points sequentially; record operating income margin of 15.4%; and record free cash flow of $271 million, representing a growth of 77% or $118 million versus prior year.
From an operational excellence standpoint, we continued our journey of betterment.
Our productivity and cost actions helped to offset the impact of materially lower volumes.
In the third quarter, I was very fortunate, I was able to visit many of our sites in Europe and the U.S. Let me tell you, we have many opportunities, and we will go after them.
I also experienced the progress made firsthand, progress that helped us to deliver 14.1% operating margin at IP.
This is the highest Industrial Process Q3 margin ever, and we continue to confidently progress toward our long-term 15% plus margin target.
The breadth of the operational improvements delivered by George and his team is impressive, not only because of the quality of execution, but also because of the care they put into structurally resetting IP for the long term.
We are actively shaping our manufacturing footprint and redesigning our product portfolio to establish a lasting competitive mode and superior margin performance for IP in the years to come.
This 14.1% margin performance represented 120 basis point expansion versus prior year, and 40 basis points higher than Q2 this year.
Our progress was also evident when I was with the MT team in Barge.
Motion Technologies delivered a strong operating margin at 18.5%, up 630 basis points versus Q2 and only 30 basis points below prior year.
We continue to drive productivities through our factories, and China and Mexico, in particular, keep on impressing with margins near all-time highs.
At CCT, I was encouraged by the many Kaizen events running in our Valencia site.
And all across ITT, we drove high levels of productivity that produce significant segment margin expansion compared to Q2.
These operational excellence, combined with our speed and execution, enabled us to accelerate working capital reduction and post a year-over-year 180 basis points improvement.
On the customer front, our teams continue to focus on serving our customers with utmost dedication, showing through their actions that our customer-centric approach is a way of life at today's ITT.
Our Friction OE sales grew 92% sequentially, and the momentum in shared gains continued with each one of our main regions outperforming global production year-to-date, including over 1,000 basis points of outperformance in North America and China.
While we still experience inventory adjustment issues in Europe with certain customers in the first half of Q3, we saw encouraging signs in auto OE production, particularly in September and October.
We now expect Friction OE outperformance for the full year at the lower end of our expectations based on the timing of new platform ramps in the fourth quarter.
IP grew organic short-cycle pump orders by 14% sequentially on the back of strong part, which improved gradually during the quarter and showed year-over-year growth in September.
IP delivered a book-to-bill of 1.
And as a result, our backlog at the end of Q3 was up 6%, excluding foreign exchange compared to the beginning of 2020.
IP continues to lead in on-time delivery performance.
Today, our customers know they can rely on us to deliver top-quality Goulds Pumps on time at a competitive price and consistently.
This is a key differentiator.
We've been talking a lot about Seneca Falls' 95% plus baseline pumps delivery performance for the last 12 months.
And I want you to know that today, the rest of our facilities have been performing at an industry-leading level as well.
Finally, at CCT, we have been busy playing offense and finding new ways to partner with our customers.
Our elastomeric rotorcraft business has been nominated on the next U.S. military reconnaissance helicopter code named FARA.
This is a major recognition for our rotorcraft business, which we created organically just a few years ago.
And our composites business is finalizing a strategic partnership with a large aircraft engine manufacturer that we propel our Matrix business to new top line heights.
The team at CCT has been working hard to adjust our cost structure to the new aero market conditions, and at the same time, looking for growth opportunities by showcasing our engineering prowess.
I was at our Valencia facility last week, and I was impressed by our new state-of-the-art sound chamber capabilities as well as our new product pipeline.
Lastly, on capital deployment.
We continue to drive cash generation through working capital efficiency and strict capital expenditure focus, further strengthening our liquidity.
As a result, we are raising our free cash flow margin target to a range of 13% to 15% for the full year.
Today, we have $1.5 billion of available liquidity, and we have ample capital to fund all of our operational needs and investment, and position us to take advantage of other strategic opportunities.
Our strong liquidity position prepares us well for what's ahead, whether it is facing headwind or surfing tailwinds.
Finally, in October, we successfully terminated and transferred our U.S. pension plan.
This will not only provide our pension eligible employees great service but also reduce ITT's administrative costs and eliminate any future funding requirements.
Let's now look at our Q3 financial results provided on slide four.
We produced 16.2% segment operating income margin.
We delivered these margins through productivity and aggressive cost actions that produced segment incremental margin of 19%.
We continued to drive down corporate costs and delivered an approximately 20% structural run rate reduction versus prior year.
EPS of $0.82 per share declined 15% and was ahead of our expectations.
And on cash, we generated $271 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up 77% versus prior year.
Our trailing 12-month free cash flow margin now stands at a record 15.4%, a sequential improvement of 80 basis points.
ITT'ers delivered strong Q3 results versus 2019, and these results are even stronger when we look sequentially.
Switching to our sequential performance on slide five.
Our segment operating income jumped 48%, an impressive growth compared to an organic revenue increase of 12%.
This is the result of our business stepping up efficiency and cost actions as we continue to focus on what we control and benefit from operational leverage from a permanently lower fixed cost base.
Our revenue growth was driven by a 92% increase in friction sales OE, mainly coming from outperformance in China and North America.
Similarly, earnings per share grew 44% sequentially despite a onetime environmental benefit realized last quarter.
Whilst recovery remains uneven across market, whichever way you choose to look at our financials, ITT's businesses delivered outstanding third quarter results.
Let's start with Motion Technologies on slide six.
Organic revenue declined 13% on lower order production rates and slower activity in the rail segment due to reduced passenger traffic.
In the quarter, Friction OE sales were nearly flat to the prior year.
This is a strong showing with China and North America growing 11% and 14%, respectively, which was offset by Europe, where we experienced destocking with some Tier one customers.
Sequentially, Friction OE sales skyrocketed 92%, gradually accelerating during the quarter to show mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in September.
Segment operating income declined 12% to $50 million.
MT successfully improved decremental margins to 21%.
And sequentially, operating income increased 107% with 36% incremental margin performance.
We drove operating income recovery through productivity and restructuring actions.
Motion Technologies delivered outstanding Q3 margins of 18.5%, 30 basis points lower than the prior year, but increased 630 basis points sequentially.
These results were fueled by strong performance in Friction China, which produced its highest margin since Q1 2018, and Friction Mexico is now approaching pre-pandemic margin levels.
The MT team delivered above our expectations given the revenue decline versus prior year.
In Q4, we expect to deliver margin expansion versus prior year on the back of continuing restructuring actions and productivity as well as low single-digit organic revenue declines.
These structural cost actions add to MT's many competitive advantages, material science leadership, best-in-class quality and fastest lead times, all of these together form the foundation for continued outperformance.
And lastly, from an award perspective, both Friction and Wolverine continued to gain share with Conquer wins and new platform wins like the 15 new electric vehicle platform awards in the quarter.
Moving on to Industrial Process on slide seven.
IP clearly demonstrated the resilience of its business model considering the challenging environment.
With 14.1% operating margin, IP expanded 120 basis points compared to the prior year despite an organic revenue decline of 19%.
Sequentially, the growth was 40 basis points on flat revenue.
The IP year-over-year revenue decline was driven by short-cycle bookings during the height of the pandemic last quarter.
Lower project revenue is mainly due to large prior year chemical shipments related to the expansion of plastic production capacity in North America.
Organic orders for the quarter declined 17% coming from 33% lower project bookings and 12% short-cycle decline versus prior year.
Parts orders recovered gradually during the quarter and posted year-over-year growth in September.
IP's book-to-bill of one in Q3 and year-to-date backlog growth of 6%, excluding foreign exchange, provides solid revenue visibility into next quarter.
Operating income declined only 12% to $27 million despite significant revenue declines.
Our proactive cost actions, shop floor and sourcing productivity resulted in best-in-class decremental margin of 8%.
IP will continue to benefit from our footprint optimization strategy.
And in October, we completed step one of our European footprint project and announced a new facility closure.
Industrial Process segment operating margin of 14.1% was driven by productivity and cost control, sourcing and restructuring actions amid a decline in revenue.
IP continued to fund innovation such as the new diagnostic capabilities added to our i-Alert remote monitoring platform and our product portfolio redesign projects.
Let me expand on our BB2 pump redesign project as it demonstrates our strategy of playing offense.
As you know, we have been hard at work improving our large chemical pump design to reduce materials content, improve manufacturability and source components from best cost regions while improving hydraulic performance.
This design has generated so much interest from our customers that we booked 43% higher orders year-to-date than for the entire 2019.
To date, we generated large sourcing savings, and the team has established a long-term supplier strategy that will put IP on a path to supply chain excellence for years to come.
Finally, IP improved working capital by 800 basis points as we reduced AR past dues by more than 20% and inventory by 14%.
We continue to see more opportunities to further reduce inventory as we consolidate footprint and optimize materials management -- materials planning management.
IP finished the quarter with 19% working capital as a percent of sales.
IP's outstanding performance reflects the multiyear strategy that we outlined back in 2017 and that we are faithfully executing as we advance toward our long-term margin target of 15% plus.
We expect to produce a similar margin in Q4 as sequential volume increase is driven by large project shipments.
Let's complete the overview of our segments with CCT on slide eight.
CCT organic revenue declined 26% on weakness across our major end markets.
The steep reduction in passenger traffic lowered commercial aero demand and continues to cause a major slowdown in OE build rates.
We are also impacted by the specific challenges related to the 737 MAX requalification process.
Our CCT industrial business experienced only a 2% decline as our distribution partners reduced excess inventory and adjust to lower levels of activity.
Our BIW, oil and gas connector business, was impacted by reduced North American shale production and lingering difficulties with customer site access and service deliveries in the Middle East.
However, we were able to gain share in that region on the back of better quality and delivery performance, and our year-to-date orders are up 30% year-over-year.
Operating income declined 40% on the volume drop, and margin of 14% showed an improvement of 300 basis points over Q2.
The primary driver of the decline versus prior year was volume impacts from aero weakness.
These impacts were partially offset by shop floor productivity, especially out of the Nogales and Valencia sites, restructuring actions and benefits from product line transfers.
In Q3, we continue to see aero debookings, albeit at slightly reduced levels compared to Q2, and significant disruptions coming from customers' ordering and receiving patterns.
We expect weak OE build rates to persist.
Additionally, lower aircraft utilization and weakened airline profitability result in a slow aftermarket recovery as less maintenance is required or gets deferred.
CCT decremental margins of 28% improved sequentially from Q2 and reflect the aggressive restructuring actions executed by the business.
Finally, in October, Ryan Flynn was appointed CCT President.
Ryan had previously served as the President of our Asia Pacific region, where he drove critical growth initiatives.
Davide Barbon, who is head of our KONI Axtone business, will now lead the Asia Pacific region, one of ITT's growth platforms.
Davide returns to China, where he previously led the expansion of MT in Wuxi.
As you know, last quarter, we raised our cost action target to $160 million.
Let me now give you an update on our plan on slide nine.
Our capex reduction plan is progressing well.
We are hard at work on the remaining $125 million of cost reduction, a large portion of which is structural.
To date, we have completed more than 90% of the full year headcount reduction plan.
On the spending front, we are exceeding our saving expectations driven by strong cost controls and sourcing performance.
We are driving footprint optimization at both IP and CCT with several new actions progressing through granular planning and internal approval stages.
Overall, we expect these actions will generate more than $90 million savings of benefits -- $90 million of benefits in 2020 and additional carryover benefits in 2021, partially offset by temporary compensation actions that have been rolled back in Q1 -- in Q4.
As a result, we are improving our decremental margin target, and we now expect total segment decremental margin for 2020 to range from 21% to 24%.
Now I'd like to discuss the results on our net annual asbestos remeasurement on slide 10, which is excluded from our Q3 adjusted results.
These events, coupled with stability in our underlying claim data, enabled us to extend the period for which we provide an estimate through 2052 from our previous rolling 10-year estimate.
Since then, excluding the full horizon transition, our net liability declined 44%, and when accounting for these quarters, noncash $136 million full horizon impact, the net liability dropped 25%.
This reflects our effective claims management and one firm defense strategy as well as aggressive insurance recovery actions that have improved the value of our insurance portfolio.
Importantly, we now expect that our projected annual average net after-tax defense and indemnity outflows for the next 10 years will decrease to $20 million to $30 million, a reduction of 24% from the midpoint.
Before Luca provides his closing remarks, let me share some perspective on how we see Q4 playing out.
We expect continued sequential improvement in Q4 but still anticipate year-over-year revenue declines to range between high single digits and the low teens.
We expect MT to deliver on low single-digits revenue decline as Friction revenue growth will more than offset -- will be more than offset by lower Wolverine and KONI Axtone volumes.
We expect auto production rates to improve sequentially, reflecting a market decline of approximately 20% for the full year.
Friction OE outperformance is now expected to be at the lower end of our range.
We also expect IP revenue to show sequential growth in Q4 and year-over-year declines to a low double-digit range.
Most of our expected Q4 revenue is already in backlog at the end of Q3.
Despite slowly improving passenger air traffic in Q3, we do not see commercial aero production rates materially improving sequentially.
As a result, we expect flattish CCT revenue from Q3 to Q4.
From a segment margin standpoint, we expect to produce strong Q4 margins, well over the 15.4% generated last year driven by benefits from productivity and cost actions.
With outstanding margin performance to date, we expect IP to deliver healthy full year margin expansion compared to 2019.
Consequently, IP's Q4 margin will be similar to Q3 and prior year, while CCT may show a sequential reduction driven by unfavorable connector mix.
We expect corporate expenses for the full year to be down approximately 40%.
We also expect Q4 earnings per share to show low double-digit sequential improvement, and we are now targeting segment decremental margins of 21% to 24% for the full year.
On free cash flow, we are raising our margin target to 13% to 15% for the full year as we rebuild some working capital to support our business and customers.
ITT's performance is the outcome of a sound and actionable strategy, one with clear priorities and a strong focus on execution driven by unprecedented level of granularity.
As a result, we generated strong levels of profitability and record free cash flow.
We are managing through the storm, and ITT will emerge stronger and bolder than ever before.
I look forward to continuing to share the progress we will make in our journey.
","In Q3 2020, ITT's revenue decreased 17% to $591 million, primarily due to lower volumes and COVID-19 impacts. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 44% sequentially to $0.82, driven by productivity and cost actions. ITT reported an exceptional 15.4% operating income margin, the highest in its history, resulting in its highest-ever free cash flow of $271 million. Notably, the company recorded a $1.20 noncash expense related to its asbestos liability, leading to a $0.55 EPS loss on continuing operations. ITT's Motion Technologies segment delivered strong margins of 18.5%, while Industrial Process posted its highest Q3 margin ever at 14.1%, reflecting improvements in productivity and cost control. Despite challenges in the commercial aviation market, CCT showed signs of improvement, with its margin expanding to 14%. ITT expects continued sequential improvement in Q4 but anticipates year-over-year revenue declines in the high single digits to low teens range. The company remains focused on cost reduction and operational efficiency, aiming for segment decremental margins of 21-24% for the full year and a free cash flow margin of 13-15%."
MFA_q3_2020.txt,"These types of statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including those described in MFA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and other reports that it may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Before we begin, I want to again recognize our entire MFA team.
This has obviously been a very challenging year and despite what the world has thrown at us, our team continues to persevere regardless of the circumstances.
Their dedication and commitment has been extraordinary.
From a financial-results standpoint, the third quarter of 2020 was unquestionably the most normal quarter of 2020, but that's not really saying very much.
Financial markets continue to be awash in liquidity and the interest rate environment continues to feature historically low rates and muted volatility.
Yet the third quarter of 2020 was also very much the story of market uncertainty.
Between the looming election still not decided, government stimulus measures or not, the second wave of COVID-19 diagnoses, and the possibility of future lockdowns, shutdowns, or other economically restrictive measures, it's clear that we are not out of the woods and it seems almost impossible to fathom what the upcoming holiday season will be like, given this backdrop.
Recall that MFA entered the third quarter of 2020 only four days out of forbearance with a fortified balance sheet and substantial liquidity.
Given our experience over the prior four months, we were understandably not inclined to immediately and aggressively pursue new investments and to add leverage.
But that decision was even easier, given the investment environment, which was challenging both in terms of investment availability and relative cheapness.
However, as we mentioned in our second-quarter earnings call, we saw significant opportunities to improve our earnings capability through liability management, and I'm happy to report that we have made substantial progress on this front.
While the results of these efforts are largely absent from our third-quarter financial results, they will be somewhat in evidence in the fourth quarter and very much in evidence in 2021.
What is apparent in our third-quarter financial results is the continued price appreciation of our whole loan portfolio that we fought so hard to retain through the crisis months earlier in the year, contributing to both material economic book value appreciation on carrying value assets and income on fair value assets.
In addition, our abilities to actively manage residential mortgage credit assets, a capability that we began to develop as early as 2013 has also been reflected in our financial results as we achieved better-than-expected results on credit-sensitive assets, resulting in reversals of prior credit reserves which flow through income.
Overall, we are pleased with our progress since July 1 of this year.
We have taken definitive steps to enhance our go-forward earnings capability and have a clear path to continue this success over the next several quarters.
Our asset-based liabilities are still largely of a very durable nature.
We continue to actively manage credit-sensitive assets to achieve good results, and we look forward to continuing to enhance shareholder value.
Please turn to Page 4.
We reported GAAP earnings of $0.17 per share for the third quarter.
Unlike the prior two quarters of this year, our third-quarter income was influenced by more normal factors and less by one-time noisy elements.
These results were largely driven by unrealized gains on our whole loan assets, as well as the reversal in a credit loss provision on whole loans held at carrying value.
GAAP book value was up modestly, but economic book value was up over 10% for the quarter as our carrying value whole loans continued to retrace the writedowns that began with the onset of the pandemic.
Our leverage at September 30 was still quite low at 1.9 to 1 and two-thirds of our asset-based financing was non-mark-to-market.
We caught up on all preferred dividends in the third quarter and we paid a $0.05 common dividend on October 30.
Please turn to Page 5.
Our portfolio, which is also shown in the appendix on Page 20, is primarily comprised of residential whole loans, which have experienced substantial value appreciation since the liquidity-induced sell-off in March and April.
Housing prices are very strong, particularly, in suburban neighborhoods outside of major cities.
This is obviously a good trend for our credit-sensitive assets, but we've been able to take advantage of this in real time, recording over $90 million of REO sales during the third quarter, which is a record quarter for us.
Please turn to Page 6.
We have also taken advantage of, one, the extremely low-rate environment; two, the paucity of non-QM product available for securitization; and three, the demand for short, high-quality assets by executing two non-QM securitizations totaling approximately $960 million, one in early September and the other closing just last week.
As you can see on this page, AAA yields on bonds sold were 1.48% and 1.38%, respectively, and the blended cost of debt sold was between 165 and 180 basis points below the cost of borrowing we replaced.
Also noteworthy is that while some of this replaced financing was non-mark-to-market, the securitized debt is similarly non-mark-to-market, non-recourse, and term.
So we actually increased the amount of this more durable financing while substantially lowering the cost.
Bonds sold generated cash of approximately 94% and 95% of UPB on the two transactions, which produced a little over $200 million of additional liquidity.
Please turn to Page 7.
We are also happy to report that we have fully paid off the $500 million 11% senior secured term note from Apollo and Athene.
This so-called rescue financing was critical to our forbearance exit, negotiation of non-mark-to-market financing on our loan portfolio, and to fortify our balance sheet.
Obviously, this was high-cost debt, but critically, the loan terms permitted repayment without penalty or any yield maintenance provision.
Also noteworthy is the fact that we did not refund this debt with cheaper debt.
The liquidity generated by our portfolio was largely the source of these funds.
And clearly, the ROE in this investment of paying down this debt was a compelling one.
The results of this paydown will be partially realized in the fourth quarter but will be fully reflected in financial results in subsequent quarters to the tune of approximately $0.03 per share per quarter.
I can honestly tell you that when we closed on this loan on June 26, I did not expect that we would be announcing its full payoff on our third-quarter earnings call.
Please turn to Page 8.
So although we have made good progress on the securitization front, we still have additional wood to chop.
A rated SFR securitization will transition current financing on these assets to cheaper debt while producing additional liquidity.
Similarly, we still have approximately $1.5 billion of non-QM loans that will hopefully lend themselves to similar securitization executions as we achieved on our first two deals.
And finally, we have three outstanding nonrated NPL securitizations that can be called and relevered.
And at current market levels, this would offer us additional liquidity while also lowering [Audio gap] Please turn to Page 9.
We announced today that our board has authorized a $250 million common stock repurchase program.
This authorization replaces a scale existing authorization for only about $20 million of stock.
As many of you likely recall, MFA has historically not pursued aggressive share repurchases.
This was primarily because even when our stock traded at a discount to book, it was rarely a considerable discount to book value.
With our stock trading around 60% of economic book value, we feel that the current market price represents a substantial disconnect versus value.
MFA's economic book value calculation is relatively straightforward.
Our assets, primarily residential whole loans with a small mortgage-backed securities portfolio, are not difficult to value.
We own neither a large MSR book nor an operating company, both of which are inherently more difficult to value with precision.
A share repurchase at current market levels is substantially accretive to both book value and earnings.
And just to be clear, there's no conflict of interest in this action.
As an internally managed mortgage REIT, we believe that our motivation is completely aligned with shareholders.
Buying back MFA stock does not reduce any management fee.
And finally, to address available liquidity to execute this stock buyback, our cash liquidity as of last Friday after paying off the balance of the Apollo-Athene loan and the October 30 dividend was approximately $641 million.
Our net income to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.17 per share primarily reflects the continued recovery in residential mortgage asset valuations, a net reduction in our CECL credit loss reserves, and lower operating and other expenses as we have put forbearance negotiations behind us.
However, our results continue to include some items that we don't expect to reoccur in future periods.
For this reason, we continue not to present core earnings metric.
Net interest income for the quarter was $10.1 million and reflects the following: firstly, higher net interest spreads for both our residential whole loan and securities portfolios.
The net interest spread on our loans held at carrying value rose to 1.24% for the quarter as our overall cost of funds declined post forbearance and due to the positive impact of the non-QM securitization transaction that closed in early September.
It should also be noted that interest income for the quarter was impacted by an increase in the amount of nonaccrual loans.
In particular, at September 30, 2020, non-QM loans with a UPB of approximately $175 million were on nonaccrual status.
Under our nonaccrual accounting policy, we stopped recognizing interest income in the period where the loans become 90 days delinquent and reversed any income recognized in the prior period.
Accordingly, no interest income was recognized on these loans in the third quarter.
In addition, as loans with a UPB of approximately $145 million became 90 days delinquent during the third quarter, interest income was adjusted by approximately $1.7 million to reverse income accrued on these loans in prior periods.
Secondly, interest expense for the third quarter on the $500 million loan from Apollo and Athene was approximately $14 million.
Excluding this expense and the cash borrowed that was held on our balance sheet for the entire quarter on a pro forma basis, the net spread generated by our interest-earning assets for the third quarter would have been approximately 1.15%.
As Craig has also noted, we reduced our CECL allowance on our carrying value loans to approximately $106 million, primarily reflecting adjustments to macroeconomic assumptions used for credit loss modeling purposes but also partially due to lower loan balances.
This reversal and other net adjustments to our CECL reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by approximately $27 million.
We continue to take a cautious approach in making our estimates for credit losses given the uncertainty in the U.S. economic outlook due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and given the current political environment.
Our loans held at fair value performed strongly for the quarter.
Net gains of $76.9 million were recorded, including $58.9 million of market value increases and $18 million of cash income.
In the second and third quarters of 2020, our portfolio of loans held at fair value has recovered more than 80% of the market value declines that were recorded in the first quarter of 2020.
Finally, our operating and other expenses were $27.3 million for the quarter, down significantly from the prior quarter as we did not incur any further expenses related to exiting from our forbearance arrangement.
However, it should also be noted that expenses this quarter included a one-time severance accrual of approximately $3.6 million related to a workforce reduction.
In addition, we anticipate that all else remaining equal, our compensation expense going forward should be approximately $1 million lower each quarter as a result of actions taken to rightsize our workforce.
Going forward, we anticipate that annualized G&A expenses to equity should run at about 2% each quarter.
Turning to Page 11.
Non-QM origination volume is gaining momentum and market demand for paper is strong.
This increased demand partially due to improved execution in the securitization market in addition to the overall low-yield environment.
We were able to purchase approximately $40 million in the third quarter and have a growing acquisition pipeline.
We successfully closed our first non-QM securitization in the third quarter and the second subsequent to quarter-end.
In total, nearly $1 billion of our non-QM portfolio has been securitized to date.
Financing of our non-QM portfolio is very stable as over three-quarters of our non-QM borrowings are now financed with multiyear non-mark-to-market leverage.
We will continue to be a programmatic issuer of securitization, which will further increase the percentage of our non-mark-to-market funding, providing stability in addition to lowering our cost of funds.
Turning to Page 12.
The significant percentage of borrowers in our non-QM portfolio have been impacted by the pandemic.
Many of our borrowers are owners of small businesses that were affected by shutdowns across the nation.
We instituted a deferral program at the onset of the pandemic in an effort to help our borrowers manage through the crisis.
Through our servicers, we granted almost 32% of the portfolio temporary payment relief, which we believe help put our borrowers in a better position for the long-term payment performance.
Subsequent to June, we've reverted to a forbearance program instead of a deferral as the economy opened up.
The forbearance program instituted are largely now determined by state guidelines.
And for clarity, deferral program, tax on the payments missed and the maturity of the loan has a balloon payment.
Forbearance requires the payments missed to be repaid at the conclusion of the forbearance period.
If those amounts are unable to be paid in one-month sum, we allow the borrower to spread the amounts over an extended period of time.
Over the third quarter, we saw a much lower level of delinquencies than one might have expected given the high percentage of deferrals granted and have seen improvement in those levels subsequent to quarter-end.
Current state of affairs is unique as although we have seen economic stress and high unemployment, home values have been increasing as low levels of supply, combined with low mortgage rates, have supported the market.
In addition, our strategy of targeting low LTV loans should mitigate losses under a scenario with elevated delinquencies.
In many cases, borrowers which no longer have the ability to afford their debt service will sell their home in order to get the return of their equity.
Turning to Page 13.
Our RPL portfolio of $1.1 billion has been impacted by the pandemic, which continues to perform well.
80% of our portfolio remains less than 60 days delinquent.
Although the percentage of portfolio, 60 days delinquent in status, 20%, over 23% of those borrowers continue to make payments.
Prepay speeds in the third quarter rebounded from the slower speed seen in the second quarter.
This portfolio exhibited a similar percentage impacted by COVID as the non-QM portfolio, and we are working with our servicers to ensure positive outcomes post forbearance.
Turning to Page 14.
Our asset management team continues to drive performance of our NPL portfolio.
The team has worked through the pandemic in concert with our servicing partners to maximize outcomes on our portfolio.
This slide shows the outcomes for loans that were purchased prior to the third quarter ended 2019, therefore owned for more than one year.
35% of loans that were delinquent at purchase are now either performing or paid in full.
44% have either liquidated or REO to be liquidated.
We have significantly increased activity or activity liquidating REO properties, selling 67% more properties versus the third quarter a year ago.
21% are still in nonperforming status.
Our modifications have been effective as three-quarters are either performing or paid in full.
We are pleased with these results as they continue to outperform our assumptions at the time of purchase.
Turning to Page 15.
We saw an improvement in delinquencies and an increase in paydowns on the fix-and-flip portfolio in the third quarter as the strong housing market supported by record-low mortgage rates and large monitoring and fiscal stimulus positively influenced home sales and credit conditions in the quarter.
MFA's fix-and-flip portfolio declined $164 million to $699 million in UPB at the end of the third quarter.
Principal paydowns were $175 million as project completions and the pace of home sales increased in the quarter.
The quarterly paydown is equivalent to about 59% CPR on an annualized basis.
We advanced about $18 million of rehab draws and converted $7 million to REO and made no new investments in the quarter.
The average yield on the fix-and-flip portfolio in the quarter was 5.41%.
And importantly, all of our fix-and-flip financing is non-mark-to-market debt with the remaining term of 21 months.
The total amount of seriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans declined $39 million in the quarter.
Due to lower delinquencies, lower fix-and-flip holdings in general, and improved credit conditions, loan loss reserves on the fix-and-flip portfolio declined $7 million in the quarter.
We have maintained strong relationships and an ongoing dialogue with our originating partners throughout the pandemic and started acquiring new fix-and-flip loans in the month of October.
Turning to Page 16.
As previously noted, seriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans declined $39 million in the quarter as we sell out $51 million of loans either pay off in full or cured to current of 30-day delinquent pay status.
While we completed foreclosure on $7 million of loans and $19 million became new 60-plus day delinquent loans.
We are pleased with the improvement and believe it is due to the efforts of our asset management team, as well as a strong housing market where the pace of home sales has increased recently, which is helpful for fix-and-flip loans where the payoff is often dependent on the sale of a property.
Approximately two-thirds of the seriously delinquent loans are either completed projects or bridge loans where limited or no work is expected to be done, meaning these properties should be in generally salable conditions.
In addition, approximately 20% of the seriously delinquent loans are already listed for sale, potentially shortening the time until resolution.
We believe that our experienced asset management team gives us a tremendous advantage in loss mitigation.
And combined with the term non-mark-to-market financing of our fix-and-flip portfolio, we believe we will be able to patiently work through our delinquent loans to achieve acceptable outcomes.
In addition, we believe recent macroeconomic trends have been helpful for loss mitigations as fiscal and monetary policies continue to be supportive of the housing market.
Turning to Page 17.
Our single-family rental loan portfolio continues to perform really well through these challenging times.
In addition to benefiting from strong fiscal and monetary support, it continues to benefit from short- to medium-term demographic trends as the push for people to move out of apartments in densely populated cities to single-family homes for more space, as well as long-term trends toward increased rental percentage of single-family households supports this asset class.
The portfolio yields have remained relatively stable and was a healthy 5.65% in the third quarter.
After rising modestly in the second quarter, delinquencies have stabilized, and 60-plus-day delinquency declined 10 basis points to 4.9% at the end of the third quarter.
Prepayments have remained relatively muted due to strong prepayment protection, a three-month CPR of 12% in the third quarter.
We made no new SFR investments in the quarter but have maintained strong relationships with our origination partners throughout the pandemic and resumed SFR loan acquisitions in October.
Finally, as Craig alluded to earlier, we are exploring a possible securitization of a portion of our SFR portfolio, which could meaningfully lower our cost of funds given current market condition.
I believe that MFA has made great strides since July 1 of this year.
Significant asset price appreciation, which drove earnings and book value, substantial progress in moving our asset-based financing from expansible, durable debt to equally durable but materially cheaper securitized debt and, most recently, the payoff of $500 million of 11% debt.
Considerable market uncertainty still exists, and the world continue to face challenges around the pandemic, politics, and monetary and fiscal policy.
MFA is well-positioned to weather these uncertainties, respond to opportunities as they arise, and we are taking proactive steps to further position our company to thrive in the future.
","Despite the challenges of 2020, MFA Financial reported $0.17 per share of earnings in Q3, largely driven by gains in whole loan values and credit reserve reversals. Liability management efforts have led to substantial progress in replacing high-cost debt with more durable and cheaper securitized debt, lowering its cost of funds by 165-180 basis points. Additionally, MFA has paid off its $500 million loan from Apollo and Athene, reducing annualized expenses by $0.03 per share. The company's residential whole loan portfolio has appreciated significantly, leading to book value growth. To enhance its earnings capability, MFA has authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program, reflecting a significant discount to its economic book value. Despite economic uncertainty, the company is well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and a strategy to take advantage of opportunities that arise."
CL_q1_2021.txt,"This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.
Actual results could differ materially from these statements.
I will provide commentary on our Q1 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to discuss our 2021 priorities.
We will then open it up for Q&A.
As usual, we request that you limit yourselves to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.
We started 2021 in positive fashion with strong organic sales growth despite a very difficult comparison, which included some consumer pantry loading in March of last year.
Our net sales grew 6% in the quarter, organic sales growth of 5% was driven by 0.5% organic volume growth and a 4.5% increase in pricing.
Foreign exchange was a 1% tailwind in the quarter.
While the tough comparisons, particularly impacted our trends in developed markets, which were flat on an organic sales basis in the quarter, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets with volume up 5.5% and pricing up 6%.
We also delivered organic sales growth in three of our four categories; Oral Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition, while Personal Care organic sales declined due to difficult comparison.
We believe our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation, which Noel and Pat Verduin talked about at CAGNY, is bearing fruit, and we will continue to focus in this area to drive future growth.
Our efforts on premiumization and pricing along with our focus on productivity, like our funding-the-growth initiatives, drove improvement year-over-year in our gross margin despite a worsening raw materials environment.
This gross margin expansion was a key factor in allowing us to deliver base business earnings-per-share growth in line with our full year guidance despite higher logistics costs, incremental advertising spending and investment to build capabilities.
In the first quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.7% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 50 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis where we were up 40 basis points.
For the first quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were 310 basis point headwind.
This is a large impact for the first quarter and it was driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like resins, fats and oils, agriculture-related costs and the transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 180 basis point benefit.
Our SG&A was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales for the first quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis.
This was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce.
Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind growth and innovation.
Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year.
For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 5% on a base business basis.
Our earnings per share was down 4% on a GAAP basis and up 7% on a base business basis.
Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter against a very difficult comparison.
The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of accounts payable and other liability, which was mostly due to changes in the timing of payables and income tax payments.
A few comments on our divisional performance.
Our volume declines in the quarter were primarily due to a combination of category deceleration in the face of difficult comparisons as we cycled last year's COVID pantry loading, logistics issues related to a warehouse transition on our U.S. business that impacted our shelf availability and our market shares and the winter storms in February.
Though logistics issues lessened over the last month of the quarter, service levels improved, and we expect service levels to return to normal by the end of the second quarter.
Pricing grew mid-single-digits in the quarter as our efforts in revenue growth management for pricing growth across all our categories.
The combination of higher raw materials costs, higher underlying logistics costs and costs related to remediating the company's specific logistics issues, pressured margins in the North America division.
Despite these headwinds, we continue to invest in advertising, particularly behind premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen and behind the continued strength of Colgate Optic White Renewal.
Latin America net sales were up 2% as 9.5% organic sales growth was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.
We continue to deliver broad-based organic sales growth in Latin America with organic sales growth in all three categories and in every hub.
As we highlighted at CAGNY, our innovation in Latin America is driving growth in the premium segment of the toothpaste category.
In Brazil, Colgate Total is gaining share behind Colgate Total Anti-Tartar, and our Natural Extracts line is gaining share, particularly behind Charcoal.
Our toothpaste value share is flat year-to-date in Brazil and measured channels and is up year-over-year in e-commerce.
Europe net sales grew 6% in the quarter.
Organic sales were down 2%.
Volume declined 3.5% in the quarter as we lap strong shipments in the year ago period, which was driven by COVID-related demand and pantry loading.
Pricing was plus 1.5% as we took pricing across all categories to help offset raw material inflation.
We're launching equity campaigns across our core oral care equity; Colgate, meridol and elmex, and we're excited about the launch of Sanex Microbiome, which Pat talked about at CAGNY.
We delivered 16.5% net sales and 11% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest markets; Greater China, India and the Philippines.
While China and India benefited from comparisons that included COVID-related shutdowns in 2020, our innovation continues to drive improved underlying performance, particularly in e-commerce.
Over the next several quarters, we will begin to rollout more premium innovation in brick and mortar in China like our Colgate Enzyme Whitening Toothpaste, leveraging the success we have had online in transforming our portfolio.
Africa/Eurasia net sales grew 8.5% as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division.
Volume grew 5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 8%.
Foreign exchange was a 4.5% headwind.
This growth was led by our toothpaste and manual toothbrush businesses, although we also delivered organic sales growth in personal and home care.
Our business in Turkey delivered strong sales and market share performance, and launched significant premium innovation in naturals, charcoal and whitening.
Hill's started the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite lapping significant growth in the year ago period.
Developed markets led the growth, particularly the U.S., Canada and Europe led by e-commerce.
Emerging markets grew organic sales greater than 20% in the quarter through a combination of volume and pricing growth.
We're very excited about our Hill's equity campaign addressing pet obesity.
This global campaign is leveraging digital, in-store, in-office and traditional media assets to drive growth in our weight control products across both our prescription and wellness businesses.
And now for guidance.
We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range.
As we think about our current organic growth assumptions versus where we were three months ago, we're probably a little more cautious on developed markets.
As you've seen from the scanner data, our categories moved negative more quickly than we had anticipated, and we expect that to continue in the short-term.
Hopefully, this allows for some of the volatility to play itself out sooner in the year, and we will see trends stabilize more quickly.
Coming into this year, in categories where consumption rose last year due to COVID, we expected 2021 consumption levels to be below 2020, but above the levels we saw in 2019.
That is the case so far across our developed markets businesses, although year-to-date these categories are slightly weaker than expected.
Categories like toothpaste where usage did not spike in relation to COVID, should normalize more quickly as we move past some of the aggressive pantry loading in March and April of last year, and we're beginning to see that happen -- and the scanner data has returned to growth in the last several weeks.
We are encouraged by how we started the year in emerging markets.
We saw broad-based organic sales growth in our emerging markets across all the divisions and with a good balance of volume and pricing.
Comps will get more difficult as we go through the year, but we believe we have solid momentum.
Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in countries like Brazil, Mexico and India, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID and other disruptions related to COVID, and this is not in our guidance.
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low-single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in January.
All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%.
Our gross margin guidance remains unchanged as we expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021 on both the GAAP and base business basis.
As we mentioned on our 2020 year-end call, raw materials began the year moving higher and faster than we had expected.
This trajectory has continued through the first quarter, as you all know.
We are still laser focused on driving our gross margin higher, but the significant increase in costs across our materials base obviously requires additional pricing and productivity.
Advertising is still expected to be up on both a dollar and a percent of sales basis.
Logistics also continues to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. where costs also have risen faster than anticipated.
We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near-term, but to moderate later in the year.
Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%.
We point out that our guidance does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings-per-share growth in the low-to-mid single-digit.
On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single-digit.
The adverse moves in foreign exchange and raw materials have moved to slightly lower in that range over the past few months, but it is still early in the year.
I'll keep my commentary brief since we've -- so we'll have plenty of time for the Q&A.
I think the results for the quarter really speak for themselves.
Obviously, we're really pleased with our performance in the first quarter.
Despite the significant volatility and headwinds, we delivered strong results around the world and up and down our P&L.
While we've made progress on our strategic areas we've been discussing, we still have a lot to do in the balance of the year.
Here are key priorities for the remainder of 2021.
Continue to drive broad-based growth.
Our priorities here are the same as we've discussed for the past several years.
We need to grow volume and pricing.
We need organic sales growth in every category and in every division in both emerging and developed markets.
In order to do this, we'll continue to ramp up our breakthrough and transformational premium innovation.
We delivered high-single-digit growth in toothpaste in the first quarter despite lapping solid growth in the year ago period, which help us drive high-single-digit growth in our oral care business.
We're driving growth through innovation like Colgate Renewal in the U.S., Colgate Enzyme Whitening Toothpaste in China and our Natural Extracts line in Colgate Total Anti-Tartar line in Latin America.
As Pat and I discussed at CAGNY, this is a marathon not a sprint, but we're making good progress which will continue as we shift our resources, continue to build new skills and even adapt how we motivate our teams.
Pricing is also an important element of growth.
And behind our revenue management efforts, we continue to drive strong pricing as we look to increase our price index versus the market as well as offsetting rising costs.
You're hearing about rising costs from every company this quarter, and we're seeing inflation on pretty much every line of the P&L, but especially raw materials, warehousing and logistics.
Naturally, our pricing plans are focused.
We just discussed, we're battling the cost inflation across the board.
We are also driving savings through funding the growth and other efficiency initiatives, which helped offset these headwinds, an effort Stan, our new CFO, is spearheading for us.
We do not expect these headwinds to abate any time soon, so we have to continue to invest in marketing and building capabilities for future growth, while delivering on our earnings guidance.
We know we need to be disciplined and efficient in this area.
The third is maintaining our focus on building out the key pillars of our long-term strategy, while simultaneously managing through all of the volatility.
That includes building our capabilities on innovation, e-commerce, digital and data and analytics, progressing on ESG including increasing our commitments on DE&I and advancing our 2025 sustainability targets, and then ultimately navigating to return to work for most of our office-based employees.
We are building a team and a culture at Colgate that is focused on adapting and changing to this volatile world.
We're embracing new strategies and new ways of working, and it's paying off.
We've had a good start to 2021 and we're looking to maintain our momentum through the rest of the year.
So with that, we'll go ahead and open up to questions.
","Despite facing tough comparisons and consumer pantry loading last year, Colgate-Palmolive reported a strong first quarter with a 6% net sales growth. Organic sales increased by 5%, driven by volume and pricing, while foreign exchange provided a 1% tailwind. The company saw double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and Colgate Enzyme Whitening Toothpaste contributed to growth in oral care. Despite higher raw materials and logistics costs, Colgate-Palmolive's focus on productivity helped drive gross margin expansion. SG&A expenses increased due to higher logistics costs and increased investment in advertising and growth initiatives. The company reiterated its financial guidance for the full year 2021, with organic sales expected to be within its long-term target range of 3% to 5%. Net sales are projected to grow by 4% to 7%, and the company expects to deliver earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range on a base business basis."
MPC_q4_2021.txt,"We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.
Actual results may differ.
Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment.
During the fourth quarter, despite the widespread surge in omicron variant cases, gasoline demand held up well.
And on diesel, we're seeing highway trucking volumes continuing to meet or exceed seasonal records.
While jet demand reached post-pandemic highs in the fourth quarter, it's still roughly 15% below 2019 levels as business travel remains suppressed, but we expect to see recovery in that this year as well.
When we spoke with you in November, we were cautious about rising COVID cases this winter and the potential impact.
Based on the trends over the last few months, we've become less concerned about the pace of recovery in transportation fuels demand.
demand continues to recover.
We believe that refining margins will be well-positioned for 2022.
On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we made continued progress on our priorities.
Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we've repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.
That puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion share repurchase program.
Further reinforcing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we obtained board approval for an additional $5 billion in share repurchase authorization.
This brings our total outstanding authorization to approximately $9.5 billion.
Today, we announced our 2022 capital spending outlook.
We expect MPC will have approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, with approximately 50% of the $1.3 billion growth capital for our Martinez refinery conversion.
Total costs for the Martinez refinery conversion is estimated at $1.2 billion.
Approximately $300 million has been spent to date, $700 million for 2022 and $200 million for 2023.
This competitive capital cost is driven by the fact that Martinez' assets are conducive to retrofit, and we can leverage existing infrastructure and logistics.
At Martinez, the project reached another milestone as a 60-day comment period for the Environmental Impact Report concluded on December 17, 2021.
We remain committed to progressing the conversion to a renewable fuels facility, engineering is complete and we're ready to begin construction.
Our plan is to have the first phase start-up in the second half of '22.
We've already sourced some advantaged feedstocks for the Martinez facility and are engaged in negotiations with multiple parties for the balance.
Our strategy is multifaceted, including long-term arrangements, joint ventures, and alliances, all of which are common in this space.
A recent example of our success would be our joint venture with ADM.
We're also leveraging existing capabilities that are currently supporting Dickinson to optimize between the two facilities.
We remain confident in our progress and ability to secure feedstocks for Martinez.
On Kenai, we have been working at sales process since we last communicated.
We'll be back to you when we have additional details that we can share.
In 2021, we progressed all three of our strategic initiatives, and Slide 4 highlights this execution.
On the portfolio, we completed the Speedway sale, receiving $17.2 billion of proceeds from that transaction and securing the 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven.
Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility started up, reached capacity, and we've been successfully optimizing the operation.
We made two strategic decisions to idle our Gallup refinery and to convert Martinez to a renewable fuels facility.
And this year, MPLX produced exceptionally strong cash flow, which provided $2.2 billion of contributions to MPC.
As we look at cost reduction, what began as a $1.5 billion cost-reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization and now a low-cost culture is becoming embedded in how we conduct our business.
While I've been reluctant to share too much, I wanted to highlight a few items that have commercial significance in our portfolio.
In March of 2021, we started up the Beatrice pretreatment facility, which processes about 3,000 barrels a day of advantaged feedstock for the Dickinson renewable diesel plan.
In December, we closed on a joint venture with ADM, which will provide approximately 5,000 barrels a day of logistically advantaged feedstock for Dickinson when the new soybean crush plant comes online in 2023.
And in January of this year, we successfully started up our Cincinnati pretreatment facility, which will process about 2,000 barrels per day for our Dickinson renewable diesel plant.
We converted this facility from its original configuration as a biodiesel plant.
Our team's execution on these three strategic priorities builds a foundation for continued value creation and we look forward to sharing updates each quarter as we continue to advance these initiatives.
Shifting to Slide 5.
We remain focused on challenging ourselves to leading in sustainable energy.
We have three companywide targets on GHG, methane and freshwater intensity than many of our investors and stakeholders know well.
In the coming weeks, we look forward to providing an update on our progress against these targets and some of our accomplishments in 2021.
Slide 6 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results.
Adjusted earnings exclude $132 million of pre-tax charges related to make-whole premiums for the $2.1 billion in senior notes we redeemed in December.
Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $112 million of tax expense, which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.
Beginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we will be reporting our effective tax rate on an actual basis and will no longer adjust our actual results to a 24% tax rate.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $400 million higher from the prior quarter.
Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion, which is an increase of almost $300 million from the prior quarter.
Finally, during the quarter, we returned $354 million to shareholders through dividend payments and approximately $2.7 billion in share repurchases.
In the three months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.
Slide 7 illustrates the progress we have made toward lowering our cost structure over the past two years.
As we think about our strategy on cost structure, I want to emphasize a few things.
We will never compromise the safety of employees or the integrity of our assets.
And we are committed to ensure the current cost reductions are sustainable, even during periods of general cost pressures.
Since the beginning of 2020, we have been able to maintain roughly $1.5 billion of cost reductions that have been taken out of the company's total cost.
Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion.
Our refining operating costs in 2020 began at $6 per barrel.
While we were able to finish 2021 with a full year operating cost per barrel that was $5.
Additionally, midstream was reduced by $400 million and corporate cost by about $100 million.
However, regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion.
This improvement is expected to make the company more resilient in future downcycles, while having more bottom-line profitability and upcycles.
Turning to Slide 8.
We would like to highlight our financial priorities for 2022.
First, sustaining capital as we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.
Second, we're committed to the dividend.
As we continue to purchase shares, we will reduce the share count and increase the potential of returnable cash flow.
Third, we continue to believe this is both a return on and return of capital business and we will continue to invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns.
In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that are resilient and reduce cost.
In renewables, current spend is primarily focused on our Martinez renewable fuel conversion.
We believe that share repurchases can be used to meaningfully return capital to shareholders.
In order to successfully execute the strategies guided by these priorities, MPC needs a strong balance sheet as a foundation.
We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile.
Moving to another key focus area.
Slide 9 highlights our focus on strict capital discipline.
Today, we announced our 2022 capital outlook for MPC.
MPC's 2022 capital investment plan totals approximately $1.7 billion.
As we continue to focus on strict capital discipline, our overall spend remains approximately 30% below 2019 spending levels.
Sustaining capital is approximately 20% of capital spend, underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance.
Of the remaining 80% for growth, approximately 50% of this $1.3 billion supports the conversion of Martinez into a renewable fuels facility.
The remainder of the growth capital is for other projects already underway.
At our refineries, the growth capital is primarily for projects that enhance returns at MPC's large coastal assets with a focus on completing Galveston Bay STAR project, as well as smaller projects at Garyville and Los Angeles.
Going forward, we expect growth capital will continue to have a significant portion for renewables and projects that will help us reduce future operating cost.
Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA was higher quarter over quarter, driven primarily by a $354 million increase from Refining & Marketing.
The adjustment column reflects $132 million of pre-tax charges for make-whole premiums for debt redemption during the quarter, which has also been excluded from the interest column.
Moving to our segment results.
Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment.
The business reported continued improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion.
Fourth quarter EBITDA increased $354 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021.
The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions.
Gulf Coast production increased by 14%, recovering from storm-related downtime last quarter, and solid margin per barrel increased 31% due to higher export sales and higher sales of light product inventory.
The West Coast margin per barrel increased 40% associated with increased demand and refinery outages.
Utilization was 94% for the quarter, slightly improved from the third quarter.
The higher Gulf Coast throughput was offset by lower throughput in the Mid-Con for planned turnaround activity.
Operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices.
There was also higher routine maintenance and planned project expense.
Additionally, we saw natural gas prices softened during the quarter, coming off highs in the $5 to $6 range and ending in the $3 to $4 range.
Slide 12 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2021.
Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.
Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion in the quarter.
This excludes changes in working capital and also excludes the cash we received for our CARES tax refund in the quarter, which was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash and is included in the income tax part of the chart.
Working capital was an approximate $1.3 billion source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by reduction in crude and product inventory.
As we announced on last quarter's call, MPC redeemed $2.1 billion in senior notes in December.
Under income taxes, we received approximately $1.6 billion of our CARES tax refund in the fourth quarter.
We also used about $300 million to offset against our Speedway tax obligation.
There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect in the first half of 2022.
We paid approximately $1.2 billion for our Speedway income tax obligation.
All that remains is about $50 million of state and local taxes.
With respect to capital return during the quarter, MPC returned $354 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.7 billion worth of shares.
At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Slide 14 provides our capital investment plan for 2022 which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline.
MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.7 billion.
The plan includes $1.6 billion for Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $300 million or roughly 20% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.
Our growth capital plan is approximately $1.3 billion, split between renewables and ongoing projects.
Within renewable spending, the majority is allocated for the Martinez conversion.
Ongoing projects in our Refining & Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast, and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and ARCO marketing brands.
Also included is approximately $100 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs and capture commercial value.
Their plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital, and $60 million for the repayment of their share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2022.
On Slide 15, we review our progress on our return of capital.
Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of company shares.
This puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion repurchase program commitment, leaving approximately $4.5 billion remaining.
We remain committed to complete the $10 billion program by the end of 2022.
And as we are ahead of pace given our recent repurchases, could foresee completion sooner than initially planned.
As part of our long-term commitment to return capital, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization today, increasing our recent repurchase authorizations to $15 billion.
We plan to continue using open market repurchase programs, although all of the programs we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete our commitment.
We intend to use programs that allow us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings call.
As we have said many times, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business.
It's the foundation allowing us to execute our strategy.
Slide 16 highlights some of the key points about our balance sheet.
MPC ended the year with approximately $10.8 billion of cash and short-term investments.
But longer term, we believe that we will need to maintain about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Additionally, we will always ensure that we have enough liquidity to endure market fluctuations.
Currently, we have a $5 billion bank revolver that is undrawn.
We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade profile.
At year end\, MPC's gross debt-to-capital ratio is 21% and our long-term gross debt-to-capital target is approximately 30%.
As we continue to execute our share repurchase program, we will see that ratio increase.
After the recent redemption in December, our current structural debt is approximately $6.5 billion, and we do not have any maturities until 2024.
Slide 17, we provide our first quarterly outlook.
We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day.
Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the first quarter.
The majority of the activity will be in the Gulf Coast region.
Our 2022 planned turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.
Total operating costs are projected to be $5.10 per barrel for the quarter.
Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter.
Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million.
If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions.
And with that, operator, we'll open it to questions.
","In Q4 2021, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) reported strong financial results, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $400 million from the previous quarter. The Refining & Marketing segment performed well, driven by higher refining margins and increased throughput, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions. MPC remains focused on cost reduction, with $1.5 billion in cost reductions since 2020. This includes $1 billion in refining cost reductions and $400 million in midstream cost reductions. The company is also committed to shareholder returns, and since November 2021, it has repurchased $3 billion of shares, representing 55% completion of its $10 billion share repurchase program. Additionally, MPC announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $15 billion. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and an investment-grade credit profile. For 2022, MPC projects total throughput volumes of 2.9 million barrels per day and capital spending of $1.7 billion, with approximately 50% allocated to the Martinez refinery conversion to a renewable fuels facility."
SPG_q4_2021.txt,"Also on the call are Brian McDade, chief financial officer; and Adam Reuille, chief accounting officer.
Our conference call this evening will be limited to one hour.
For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question.
I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.
We had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year.
We recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales, and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results.
We generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in '21 or $11.94 per share.
The $4.5 billion is a record amount for our company for the -- for a year.
And coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments, coupled with coherent strategy.
Fourth-quarter funds from operations were 1.160 billion -- I'm sorry, $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share.
Included in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest.
Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year.
Our international operations improved in the quarter.
Domestic property NOI increased 22.4% year over year -- I'm sorry, for the quarter and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties, portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year.
Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year over year.
Average base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent.
For the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet.
This was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last six years.
Retail sales, reported retail sales continued in the fourth quarter.
Mall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 34% year over year.
Reported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our Mall and Outlet Business and $645 for the Mills.
These results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for '21.
Occupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they've been in five years at 12.6% year-end.
and a premium outlet in South Korea.
Construction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie France opening the spring of '23.
We completed five significant redevelopments.
We added densification components with the opening of two hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility.
Progress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall.
We have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow.
Let me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG, and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe.
JCPenney's results were impressive.
Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion.
The company de-levered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit.
CEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer.
RGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet, marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth.
SPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There's a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise.
The Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach.
TRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80% posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting.
Reported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year over year.
Occupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year.
Now, turning to the balance sheet.
We've been active in the debt markets.
We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a lower pricing grid for five years.
We issued $2.75 billion of senior notes 750 million-euro notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%.
We paid more than $4 billion in debt and de-levered by $1.5 billion.
And with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion.
Now, just to turn to dividend.
We paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year.
Today, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%.
This dividend is payable on March 31.
Now, just to go through guidance for 2022.
Our FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share.
When looking at our '22 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to '21 actual results.
Approximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands.
These gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for '21.
'21 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average.
Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: Domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney, and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to '21 levels and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition or disposition activity.
And for bouncing back in '21 after a very difficult 2020.
Make no mistake about it, '21 was a great year.
And I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share.
So, that's a heck of a year.
I'm very excited about our plans for '22 and the future growth prospects of our company, and we're ready for any questions.
","Simon Property Group had a record-breaking 2021 with $4.5 billion in funds from operation or $11.94 per share. The domestic property NOI increased by 22.4% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the year. The mall and outlet occupancy rate reached 93.4% at the end of the fourth quarter, showing a strong demand for their space. Despite a lack of international tourism, retail sales in the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to 2019 and 34% year over year, reaching $713 per square foot. The company also invested in other platform investments, including JCPenney, which saw an increase in liquidity and a strengthened management team. The company's dividend was increased by 27% to $1.65 per share. Looking ahead, the company projects an FFO per share range of $11.50 to $11.70 for 2022, assuming continued strong domestic property NOI growth and investments in JCPenney and other platform investments."
CNP_q3_2021.txt,"David Lesar, our CEO; Jason Wells, our CFO, will discuss the company's third quarter 2021 results.
Actual results could differ materially based upon various factors as noted in our Form 10-Q on their SEC filings and our earnings materials.
We will also discuss non-GAAP EPS, referred to as utility EPS, earnings guidance and our utility earnings growth target.
In providing these financial performance metrics and guidance, we use a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share.
As a reminder, we may use our website to announce material information.
Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.
Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dave.
As you know, we laid out our first ever 10-year plan back at our Analyst Day.
We expressed that and are reiterating today that we are a management team who can execute.
We believe we will continue to demonstrate that for you.
This marks my sixth quarter with CenterPoint and Jason's fifth.
I'd like to first start by laying out how we are building a consistent track record of delivery.
First, if you recall, the CenterPoint value proposition we laid out at our recent Analyst Day focused on our efforts to achieve sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities.
I believe we are continuing down the path of achieving this value proposition.
Each quarter under the new CenterPoint leadership, we have met or exceeded quarterly utility earnings per share and dividend expectations.
We have increased our annual utility earnings per share guidance for both 2020 and 2021.
And as I will discuss shortly, today, we are increasing our 2021 utility earnings per share guidance once again.
Our 2021 through 2024 annual utility earnings per share growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility earnings per share guidance range each year from 2025 to 2030.
I am confident in our team's ability to achieve that growth.
Last year, we had a $13 billion 5-year capital plan.
We increased that to $16 billion in our 2020 Analyst Day.
In this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus.
We introduced our first ever 10-year capital plan.
CenterPoint remains ripe with opportunities across our footprint to expand and harden our system to benefit customers and shareholders.
Our current 10-year plan contains no external equity issuances.
We will fund the equity portion of our capital needs to internally generated operating cash flows and our already announced strategic transactions.
We are also executing on our plan to become a pure-play regulated utility as we approach the closing of the Enable ET merger expected by the end of this year and then our subsequent sell-down of our midstream stake.
With the recent settlement agreement among the parties in Arkansas, we are also moving toward the completion of our LDC asset sale.
The remaining steps include the Oklahoma approval, which is anticipated to be received in November and the all-party settlement in Arkansas is expected to be approved by mid-December.
And with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to executing our goals to be net 0 on direct emissions by 2035.
We continue to believe that this is an achievable path delivering for customers, regulators, investors and the environment.
In the third quarter of 2020, I said that I will not be satisfied until we are recognized as a premium utility.
In the theme of our Analyst Day was again establishing a path toward a premium.
I believe we are making tremendous strides down that path.
The storm headwinds of up to 90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power.
Within three days, we had 95% of the power restored for those customers.
And within five days, the whole system was back online.
Now for this quarter's headlines.
Our year-to-date financial progress has been strong.
We are reporting a utility earnings per share beat and are raising our full year outlook this quarter.
For the third time this year, we are increasing our 2021 utility earnings per share guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year.
And for the first nine months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal.
More importantly, we are still targeting an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024.
So this raises our guidance for 2022 utility earnings per share to $1.36 to $1.38.
For the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the third quarter of 2020.
In the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our most recent Board implemented governance changes.
Jason will get into more detail on the variances shortly.
As I mentioned earlier, we have increased our five-year capital plans to $18 billion plus over the next five years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years.
This is nearly a 40% increase in our five-year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020.
This includes new opportunities that stem from the latest legislative session in Texas.
One of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into rate base mobile generation units.
We move quickly on this opportunity and procured [Indecipherable] five-megawatt and 30-megawatt mobile generation units, some of which we were able to deploy during Hurricane Nicholas as backup while crews worked to repair our system.
And recently, during an ERCOT forecasted Texas wide load-shedding event, the Texas PUC [Indecipherable] to make sure our units were ready to support customers.
We were the first the utility in the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law intended.
We look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the Texas legislature to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages.
We already have an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months.
We believe that with the deployment of these additional tools, we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers.
Due to recent weather events in both Louisiana and Texas, we are running slightly behind on our capital spending plans on a year-to-date basis.
These weather events pulled away many of our contract crews, so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities, especially in Louisiana.
Therefore, while deployed elsewhere, they cannot work on our capital projects, but we have a catch-up plan in place and anticipate making the short fall of.
In anticipation of continued labor shortages and as we ramp up our capital plans in the coming years, we have now moved to procure additional contractor resources from multiple suppliers.
We believe that this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years.
We remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions.
We've already realized the benefit of some of these improvements this year.
We stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately $20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources.
So far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our team's ability to continue to execute toward this goal for the balance of the year.
This allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs which helps to mitigate rate pressures while maintaining continued focus on reliability and safety of our service for customers, all while sustaining growth for our shareholders.
In addition to O&M continuous improvement efforts, we are fortunate to operate in growing jurisdictions.
This combination plays a key role in keeping our growth plans affordable for our customers.
As we discussed during our Analyst Day, Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S. and the only one of those four that's growing.
Houston's organic growth has been multi-decades long.
That organic growth rate continued for yet another quarter.
We are also seeing strong growth in many of our other jurisdictions as well.
On a year-over-year basis, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas through September.
Again, this organic growth is the luxury, most other utilities just do not have.
Now let me shift gears and give a brief regulatory update.
A recent highlight in Indiana happened just this past week.
As part of our long-term electric generation transition plan, we received the CPCN approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the first tranche of solar generation, 75% of which we expect to own and 25% due a PPA.
This approval shows the commission's alignment and support of our 2020 IRP, which bridges our coal generation into a mix of lower carbon and renewable sources.
We anticipate the CPCN decisions for our Gas CT plant in the second or third quarter of 2022 and the incremental solar PPA in the third quarter of 2022.
As outlined in our IRP, we are targeting to own approximately 50% of our total solar generation portfolio.
Our continued build-out of renewables is a key driver in achieving our net zero direct emissions goal by 2035.
Shifting to gas cost recovery from the February winter storm.
We continue to make progress.
And as we previously mentioned, we have mechanisms in place or have begun recovery in all jurisdictions.
We are happy to report that just this past week, we reached a settlement on the prudence proceedings supporting securitization of 100% of gas costs in Texas, including all of related carrying costs.
We look forward to the commission approval of the agreement.
We anticipate a financing order for the securitization bonds by the end of the year.
With this time line, we anticipate receiving the proceeds sometime mid next year.
In Minnesota, we started a recovery as of December and are working with stakeholders on ways to reduce the impact on our customers.
We filed a rate case earlier this week, and also proposed an alternative rate stabilization plan to address the unique set of circumstances customers are experiencing.
The full rate case requests $67.1 million per year, while the rate stabilization plan requests $39.7 million per year and an extended recovery period for winter storm costs.
The proposed rate stabilization plan would resolve the rate case and limit the bill impact on customers, in part by recovering the winter storm costs over a 63-month period.
We're asking the PUC to review and approve the stabilization plan by the end of this year, which would allow rates to take effect on January 1.
To summarize, we are working with stakeholders to align our focus on safety and related investments while minimizing the burden to our customers.
Largely as a result of mechanisms in our Houston Electric in Indiana South gas jurisdictions, we have recently received approval for $40 million of increased incremental annual revenue.
As discussed in our Analyst Day, we anticipate approximately 80% of our 10-year capital plans to be recovered through interim mechanisms, which demonstrates the constructive jurisdictions in which we operate.
In Texas, our PUC is now appointed a fourth commissioner.
Jason and I have now had the opportunity to meet all four commissioners and are very encouraged by the dialogue and expertise that all of these commissioners bring to the PUC.
We look forward to continued engagement with the commissions in all of our jurisdictions.
So those are the headlines for the quarter.
I remain excited about what's to come for CenterPoint.
We have a growing track of execution and believe it more than demonstrates what we can do in the near future and the unique value proposition that CenterPoint offers to you.
This marks my one year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better.
To reemphasize Dave's message, we are focused on establishing a track record of consistent execution, and I fully believe the best is yet to come here at CenterPoint.
On a GAAP earnings per share basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 for the third quarter of 2020.
Looking at slide five, we reported $0.33 of non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.34 for the third quarter of 2020.
Our utility earnings per share was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.08.
Favorable growth in rate recovery, lower interest expense and reversal of the net impacts from COVID last year, each contributed $0.01 of favorability.
Board implemented governance changes recorded this quarter and another $0.03 of unfavorable variance attributable to weather and usage.
For context, we experienced 73 fewer cooling degree day in Houston for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020.
We estimate that each cooling degree day above normal has approximately a $70,000 a day impact in our Houston Electric business.
Turning to slide six.
For the first nine months, we've achieved nearly 80% of our full year 2021 utility earnings per share guidance, which we are now raising to $1.26 to $1.28.
And as Dave said, we are also raising our utility earnings per share guidance for 2022 to $1.36 to $1.38, which is an 8% increase from our new 2021 estimates.
Looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering 8% annual utility earnings per share growth through 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual utility earnings per share range over the remainder of our 10-year plan, strong growth each year and every year, no CAGRs for earnings.
The last thing I'll mention for this quarter is the share count.
Our preferred Series B shares converted into 36 million common shares as of September 1, further reducing the number of share classes outstanding.
We expect the conversion will have no impact on earnings as the increase in shares is effectively offset by the termination of our Series B dividends.
Going forward, I want to reiterate we have no external equity included in our current [Indecipherable] and only expect our share count to modestly increase from dividend reinvestment or incentive plans.
Now I want to offer some color on the capital plans supporting our rate base and utility earnings per share growth.
We've spent approximately $2.3 billion year-to-date on capital investments.
As Dave mentioned, we had some slight delays due to recent weather events and are focused on making that up over the coming months.
We outlined on our Analyst Day the three buckets that we are investing in, safety, reliability and growth and enabling clean investments that are included in our $40 billion plus 10-year capital investment plan.
This investment profile should benefit our shareholders, our customers and the environment.
We see those opportunities weighted nearly 60% toward investments in our electric business throughout the plan.
While we are slightly behind the capital plan on a year-to-date basis, we are in the midst of ramping up to a sustained increase in our capital investments and we are restructuring contract crews in a way that helps support our labor needs to execute this level of investment.
We are confident we will make up the shortfall by early 2022.
Moving to the financing updates.
Our current liquidity remains strong at $1.8 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash.
Our long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies.
As mentioned during the Analyst Day, it's our intention to stay within this range throughout the course of our long-term plan.
Lastly, as we near the end of the calendar year, we are getting incrementally closer to the expected closing of the strategic transactions we've announced.
We recently filed a settlement in Arkansas that represents an agreement among all parties.
We anticipate that Arkansas Commission will issue its final approval by mid-December.
In Oklahoma, a hearing was held on November 3, and we expect a final order soon.
Finally, as Energy Transfer expressed on their earnings call earlier this week, the Enable and Energy Transfer merger is also expected to close before year-end.
Once that transaction closes, we will remain absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our exposure to midstream through a disciplined approach.
Analyst Day, we anticipate being fully exited from the midstream sector by the end of 2022.
We will then be nearly a pure-play regulated utility.
As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value.
And with that, we look forward to more of these shorter earnings calls in the future.
As you heard from us today, and others from our full management team during the Analyst Day, the outlook for CenterPoint just keeps getting better.
As I said, we now have six quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations, but we believe there is much more to come.
We are demonstrating the pathway to premium, and we hope that you will be on board with us as a shareholder when that happens.
We will now take a few questions being mindful of today's earnings schedule and the upcoming EEI conference.
","CenterPoint Energy exceeded third-quarter expectations and raised its 2021 utility earnings per share guidance range to $1.26 - $1.28, representing a near 80% achievement of its annual goal. The company's growth strategy remains anchored by an $18 billion-plus, 5-year capital plan focused on enhancing safety, reliability, and clean energy investments. Despite slight weather-related delays, CenterPoint anticipates catching up with capital spending plans by early 2022. Additionally, the company reinforced its target of 8% annual utility earnings per share growth from 2022 to 2024, within the 6% to 8% range for the remaining years of its 10-year plan. CenterPoint is committed to becoming a pure-play regulated utility, emphasizing value optimization for stakeholders. The recent Arkansas and Oklahoma settlements, along with the anticipated Energy Transfer and Enable merger closure, support this transition."
SKX_q1_2021.txt,"I hope you, your colleagues and loved ones are staying safe and healthy.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a global challenge, we remain dedicated to the safety of everyone in the entire Skechers organization and appreciate their ongoing efforts and resiliency during this difficult period.
While many countries' restrictions are easing, our thoughts are with those regions facing another coronavirus wave.
As is the case with most businesses, the pandemic continued to impact Skechers but the high demand for our comfort technology product resulted in a strong beginning to 2021 and it feels reminiscent of 2019.
In the first quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 15% over the same period last year, which resulted in our first quarterly sales of more than $1.4 billion.
This was done while parts of the world remained closed due to the pandemic.
The $1.43 billion first quarter sales were also an 11.9% increase over first quarter 2019, which was then a record for the period.
Driving the record sales was 20.2% increase in our international business and an 8.5% increase in our domestic business.
This double-digit growth drove international sales to 57.8% of total sales in the first quarter.
Throughout the quarter, we focused on delivering our footwear and apparel to meet the needs of both our consumers and customers.
Our sell-throughs across customer types and categories exceeded expectations in many markets and we were able to deliver double-digit growth.
Skechers' mission of delivering comfort, style and quality and innovation at a value resonated with consumers prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the same is true now.
Consumers are returning to a new normalcy, one that involves more walking, more comfort on the job and a casual lifestyle mindset.
We are a natural choice for any demographic worldwide with comfort technology at our core.
The record sales are a testament to the fact that consumers appreciate our product offerings, which we're seeing by the success across many divisions.
Our International Wholesale business grew 23.8% for the first quarter last year and 13% from 2019.
The quarterly sales growth was driven by an increase of 174% in China, which was severely impacted by the pandemic in the prior year.
However, even as compared to 2019, China grew 45.5%.
The International Wholesale growth was partially offset by decreases in our subsidiary and distributor businesses.
Subsidiary sales decreased 4.8% from 2020 but improved 4.2% from 2019.
The first quarter 2021 decrease was due to temporary closures and reduced operating hours in Spain and Italy, and especially in the United Kingdom, where businesses were closed for the entire quarter.
Where markets were open, sales were strong, including in Germany, India and Canada.
Our distributor business was down 6.5% from last year, yet several markets experienced growth in the quarter, specifically Russia, Taiwan, Turkey and Ukraine.
We believe we will continue to see improvements in our distributor business in the second quarter and the remainder of the year.
Sales in our Domestic Wholesale business decreased less than 1% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020 but improved 8.1% compared to the first quarter of 2019.
We believe sales in our Domestic Wholesale business were negatively impacted by logistical challenges, which caused slower replenishment and product shipments to some accounts.
Key sales drivers came from multiple categories with the largest gains in our Women's Sport, Kids, Work and Men's Performance.
Additionally, the average selling price per pair increased 2.7%, reflecting the strength and appeal of new comfort products and technologies.
Skechers direct-to-consumer business increased 18.1% over 2020 and 13.1% over 2019, despite the fact that domestic operating hours were reduced by approximately 15% during January and February, and 7% in March.
In our international company-owned stores, we lost 37% of the days available to sell during the quarter.
Our domestic direct-to-consumer sales increased 28.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and 18% compared to 2019.
This improvement came from our domestic e-commerce channel, which grew by 143% and our brick and mortar stores, which grew by 13.6%.
Our domestic direct-to-consumer average selling price per unit rose 10.9%, which speaks to the strength of our current product offering.
While we expected our e-commerce business to continue to perform exceptionally well, we were pleased with the increased traffic and sales in our domestic retail stores, especially in March, which we believe improved as more people became comfortable shopping and we ramped up our marketing efforts.
We have now completed the update of our point-of-sale system, which further optimizes our domestic direct-to-consumer channels and will continue to improve our omnichannel capabilities.
We are now focused on rolling out this same platform worldwide.
Our e-commerce channel remains a meaningful growth opportunity as sales increase significantly across the globe.
We plan to expand our e-commerce reach across Europe, beginning with a new site in Ireland and the revamp of our U.K. site this summer.
Our international direct-to-consumer business increased 1.9% over the first quarter of 2020 and 4.4% over 2019.
The growth was largely attributable to our company-owned e-commerce sites and the strength of our sales in Korea, India and Thailand, partially offset by ongoing temporary store closures due to stay at home guidelines across many markets, most notably in the United Kingdom.
While we are seeing some markets reopening this month, including England last week, other countries have extended or reinstated their lockdowns given the unpredictability of the coronavirus and its impact on many markets, we remain cautious about a return to normal traffic and sales in many international stores.
In the first quarter, we opened 12 company-owned Skechers stores, six of which are in international location, including our largest store in India.
We have opened seven stores to-date in the second quarter, including our first in Antwerp.
We closed 20 locations in the first quarter as we opted not to renew expiring leases, and we expect to close one additional store at the end of this month.
An additional net 106 third-party Skechers stores opened in the first quarter, bringing our total store count at quarter end to 3,989.
The stores that opened were across 16 countries with most located in China and India.
To support the open regions during the first quarter, we ramped up our marketing efforts to drive home our comfort message.
This included former professional quarterback and lead NFL commentator, Tony Romo in our Max Cushioning commercial during the Super Bowl and NFL coach, Jon Gruden and sports analyst, Howie Long in new commercials for Skechers Arch Fit, as well as Brooke Burke featured in Arch Fit and Skechers apparel commercials during the quarter.
Our new campaign went on television as well as digital platforms to support key initiatives for men, women and kids.
In the first quarter, we were awarded Company of the Year by leading industry publication, Footwear Plus, for the ninth time in 15 years.
This was due to our efforts during the challenging 2020 year and our ability to deliver to consumers the comfort they wanted.
We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, I think this was a solid beginning, especially given the ongoing pandemic-related difficulties most recently impacting our international business, which now represents 58% of our total sales.
While many markets continue to face challenges, we are seeing strong signs of recovery and remain focused on delivering our comfort technology and managing the flow of our inventory to fulfill demand where we are open and drive sales where possible.
The Skechers brand performed exceptionally well this quarter, despite ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, including continuing store closures and operating restrictions in many markets across the world.
The quarter began as expected with the pandemic continuing to influence tepid consumer trends worldwide, especially as many markets reinstituted lockdowns.
However, mid-quarter, we began seeing signs of consumer engagement and optimism domestically that we have not seen in over a year, that led to results in March that even exceeded our own internal expectations, reflecting high demand for the Skechers brand.
Although we remain cautious given the nature of government responses to COVID-19 globally, we are optimistic that our first quarter results are indicative of the power of our brand as the world begins to recover from the pandemic.
Now, let's turn to our first quarter results, where you will note that due to the unusual nature of last year, we will occasionally compare to both 2020 and 2019, where we feel the added measure is beneficial to evaluating the performance of our business.
Sales in the quarter achieved a new record, totaling $1.43 billion, an increase of $186.1 million or 15% from the prior year and an impressive 11.9% increase over the first quarter of 2019.
On a constant currency basis, sales increased $145.9 million or 11.7%.
International Wholesale sales increased 23.8% in the quarter compared with the first quarter of 2020 and 13.4% compared with the first quarter of 2019.
Our joint ventures grew an impressive 120% in the quarter led by China, which grew 174% against prior year results, which contained the most severe impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.
As compared to the first quarter of 2019, China grew 45.5% driven by strong e-commerce performance.
Subsidiary sales declined slightly in the quarter by 4.8%, primarily as a result of continuing closures in Europe and Latin America.
However, as compared to 2019, our subsidiary sales grew an impressive 4.2% despite the current year operational restrictions.
As expected, our distributor business continued to face pandemic headwinds in the first quarter, decreasing 6.5% but saw a marked improvement as compared to the second half of 2020.
Although we continue to expect this portion of our business to recover more slowly than the overall International Wholesale segment, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately see a full recovery of sales in this important channel.
Domestic Wholesale sales decreased slightly in the quarter by less than 1%, primarily due to the unfavorable timing of shipments to customers, which we now expect to occur in the second quarter.
Compared to the first quarter of 2019, sales increased 8.1%, which we believe is more reflective of the positive underlying trends we are seeing with the majority of our domestic wholesale partners, particularly based on sell-through we observed in the back half of the quarter.
Direct-to-consumer sales returned to growth in the quarter increasing 18.1%, the result of a 28.4% increase domestically and a 1.9% increase internationally.
The results reflect a slight benefit from the pandemic store closures in the prior year but more importantly, also reflect a notable 143% increase in our domestic e-commerce business and a significant increase in store traffic and sales in March, a trend that has continued.
Gross profit was $679.6 million, up 24.1% or $131.9 million compared to the prior year.
Gross margin was 47.6%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by increases in our average selling price across all segments as well as a favorable mix of online sales.
Total operating expenses increased by $19.9 million or 3.9% to $528 million in the quarter.
Selling expenses increased by $11.2 million or 15.2% to $85.3 million, which was flat as a percentage of sales versus last year.
The dollar increase was primarily due to higher domestic digital demand creation spending as well as the reopening of certain markets internationally.
General and administrative expenses increased slightly by $8.6 million or 2% to $442.7 million, which was primarily the result of volume-driven expenses in warehouse and distribution for both our international and domestic e-commerce businesses.
This was partially offset by lower retail labor costs.
Earnings from operations was $157.7 million versus prior year earnings of $44.8 million.
This represents an increase of 252% or $112.9 million.
Operating margin was 11% compared with 3.6% a year ago and 13% in 2019, reflecting strong combination of top line performance and operating expense leverage despite ongoing pandemic-related challenges.
Net earnings were $98.6 million or $0.63 per diluted share on 155.9 million diluted shares outstanding.
This compares to prior-year net income of $49.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share on 154.7 million diluted shares outstanding.
Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 20.2% versus 15.3% in the same period last year.
The increase was predominantly due to an unfavorable mix of earnings from higher tax jurisdictions.
And now turning to our balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $1.51 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which was an increase of $148.2 million or 10.8% from March 31, 2020.
Trade accounts receivable at quarter end were $798.8 million, an increase of $2.6 million from March 31, 2020.
Total inventory was $1.07 billion, an increase of 8.3% or $81.8 million from March 31, 2020.
The increase is largely attributable to higher inventories to support growth in China and government closures in Europe.
Total debt, including both current and long-term portions, was $779.7 million at March 31, 2021 compared to $699.8 million at March 31, 2020.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $84.2 million, of which $42.9 million related to the expansion of our joint venture-owned domestic distribution center, $13.8 million related to investment in our new corporate offices in Southern California, $12.4 million related to investments in our direct-to-consumer technology and retail stores and $3.6 million related to our new distribution center in China.
Our capital investments remained focused on supporting our strategic growth priorities, growing our direct-to-consumer relationships and business as well as expanding the presence of our brand internationally.
For the remainder of 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Now turning to guidance.
First, let me preface by saying that we remain in a dynamic situation, where conditions can change materially at any point in time.
As a result, assessing the ongoing impact of the pandemic to our business is difficult.
Incorporated into the following guidance is our best estimate of the influence of these factors on our expected results for 2021.
However, if the situation deteriorates and closures continue longer than anticipated, our expected results may differ materially from this guidance.
That being said, we are providing a perspective today for our second quarter and full year 2021 results, based upon current trends, backlogs and other indicators.
We expect second quarter 2021 sales to be in the range of between $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion and net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of between $0.40 and $0.50.
For fiscal year 2021, we expect sales to be in the range of between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion and net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of between $1.80 and $2.
We also anticipate that gross margins for the full year will be flat or up slightly compared to 2020 and that our effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 20%.
We achieved a new quarterly sales record over $1.4 billion due to the strong demand for our comfort technology footwear and markets where we are open.
International, which is approximately 58% of our total sales was the biggest driver, but we saw strong improvements in our domestic business with increasing traffic in March and now in April.
The achievement came despite ongoing pandemic-related issues.
We drove sales through strong marketing campaigns across multiple platforms, continue to rollout our BOPIS and BOPAC initiative in the United States and plan for additional e-commerce sites in 2021.
To further support our business in the coming years, we are in the process of enhancing our infrastructure with new distribution centers in Peru, the U.K. and Japan.
In addition, our new 1.5 million square foot China distribution center remains on track for full implementation by mid-year.
Given today is Earth Day, I'd like to note that we are continuing to work on the expansion of our LEED Gold certified North American distribution center, which will bring our facility in Southern California to 2.6 million square feet in 2022.
We are also completing construction on Phase 1 of our new LEED Gold certified office buildings and we are increasing efficiencies in our existing corporate office buildings, including the addition of solar panels.
Although we remain cautious given the ongoing temporary closures in many countries, we are seeing the improved traffic that we experienced in March continue in April, where markets are open.
The demand for our product is strong as consumers want familiarity, comfort, quality and value, all of which the Skechers brands delivers together with innovation and style.
","Skechers reported a record first quarter with sales of $1.43 billion, reflecting a 15% increase from the previous year and an 11.9% surge from 2019. This growth was driven by a 20.2% increase in international sales, which now account for 57.8% of total sales. Domestic sales also improved by 8.5%, despite challenges in logistics. Notable drivers of sales growth included Women's Sport, Kids, Work, and Men's Performance categories. Direct-to-consumer sales increased by 18.1% overall, with a 28.4% rise in domestic sales and a 143% growth in domestic e-commerce. The company remains cautious due to ongoing pandemic-related challenges, but is optimistic about its recovery as demand for comfort technology footwear remains strong in open markets. For the full year, Skechers anticipates achieving sales between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, with earnings per share between $1.80 and $2.00."
WU_q1_2021.txt,"On our call today is our CEO, Hikmet Ersek; our CFO, Raj Agrawal; and Head of Treasury and Investor Relations, Brad Windbigler.
During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.
We will also discuss certain adjusted metrics.
The expenses that have been excluded from adjusted metrics are specific to certain initiatives, but maybe similar to types of expenses that the company has previously occurred and can reasonably expect to occur in the future.
We weathered COVID-19 better than many companies in 2020, owing to our resilient fundamentals and the foresight behind our leading digital business that had us ready for accelerated demand for digital services.
Before I give you an update about the encouraging first quarter results and share my thoughts about the rest of the year, I would like to take a moment and mention that although we do see some modest economic improvement and there are signs of some COVID-19 recovery like in the US, parts of Europe and parts of Asia Pacific due to progress with vaccinations, at the same time, I am saddened by the hard breaking current situation in countries like India, Brazil and many others.
Our thoughts are with all of the people who are currently navigating this challenging situation.
The recent outbreaks in many countries show us that as a global community, we still have work to do in the fight against the virus.
However, at the same time, I am hopeful and I know that all my colleagues and all our partners in more than 200 countries, we will do their best to recover from the virus as soon as possible.
Back to our business.
The conditions were fairly stable in the first quarter.
I am pleased that trends for our business improved over the quarter and held up well in April, giving us confidence to push forward with an ambitious agenda and reaffirm 2021 financial targets on an adjusted basis.
Raj will discuss our outlook in more detail in a few minutes.
With that, let's review business highlights for the quarter.
Starting with the big picture, our cross-border consumer-to-consumer or C2C business grew principal 28%, which was the highest quarterly growth in years and the third consecutive quarter with growth over 20%.
This really shows the momentum we are seeing today, especially when compared to forecast from third parties projecting modest growth or even declines in principals for 2021.
Total company revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis, around a 300 basis points increase from declines in the third and fourth quarter of last year.
C2C revenues and transactions grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and both digital and retail revenue trends improved sequentially.
Digital performed exceptionally well again.
Revenues were up from the fourth quarter and grew 45% year-over-year to over $240 million, putting us on target to exceed $1 billion in 2021.
Digital comprised 34% of transactions and 23% of revenues for the C2C segment and was a key source of new customers and incremental profit.
Wu.com delivered impressive results and shows the potential we see as a foundation for a consumer ecosystem.
This is the fourth consecutive quarter of transaction growth of 50% or more and average monthly active users growth of over 40%.
Wu.com led money transfer peers in mobile app downloads by a wide margin and grew principal 78% off of an already large base, which we believe is well ahead of the market.
Our customer engagement efforts also appear to be paying off with favorable trends in retention, transaction per customer and principal per customer.
Digital partnerships revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and it has exceeded our expectation over the past 18 months since we announced it in late 2019.
We continue to have more encouraging developments in the pipeline.
Retail trends improved sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, despite the effects of additional rates of COVID-19.
While the business is not back to pre-pandemic levels yet, it has demonstrated resilience and we expect continued improvement to the rest of the year, assuming the pandemic and global economy doesn't worsen.
Our business solution trends also improved.
We made progress on key initiatives, including launching our payment solutions in Spain and implementing technology upgrades that will allow us to add differentiated solutions and capabilities.
We are optimistic that the business will continue to rebound over the course of the year.
Shifting to an update on operating and strategic objectives during this quarter.
Starting with wu.com, we continue to invest in consumer acquisition and marketing, which drove 46% growth in average monthly active users for the first quarter.
On the branding side, we launched one of our highest-rated television campaigns in recent years, send more than money, which future wu.com.
We also made progress on a number of product initiatives to improve our customer experience, faster registration, better web page performance and enhanced visibility into transaction status.
We achieved an important platform milestone by completing a major phase of our multiyear settlement transformation project.
We also advanced a number of initiatives that will make us more nimble and efficient like cloud migration and adding artificial intelligence and machine learning into processes to reduce project run times and enhance analytics.
Moving on to our global network.
The team has done a great job optimizing commission costs while still enhancing the quality of our global payments distribution capabilities.
During the quarter, we renewed agreements with 34 existing agents and added 41 new agents with favorable terms.
Over 50% of our global account payout transaction volume was delivered real time.
Our launch with Walmart is off to a good start, and we look forward to getting all 4,700 US locations up and running in the second quarter.
To wrap up the first quarter discussion, despite ongoing challenges from the pandemic, we are off to an encouraging start with financial and operating performance on course with our expectations for 2021.
Given the strong customer trends, we have seen over the last year in our C2C business, including almost 9 million wu.com annual active users in 2020, the agenda for the rest of 2021 is largely centered around enhancing the customer experience.
Convenience, reliability and speed are fundamental for a good customer experience in payments, which makes a high-quality network important.
On the digital side, we can reach billions of accounts today, but we are expanding access to even more accounts with new partnerships.
Speed is increasingly valued by customers, and we already have one of the broadest real-time cross-border payment networks in the industry.
So the focus this year is making it more robust by adding additional direct third-party relationships and multiple partners in markets.
Our retail distribution will continue to benefit from ongoing agent optimization, upgrading the caliber of agents and filling in gaps in distribution.
Platform initiatives for 2021 include upgrading and modernizing technology, incorporating cutting-edge solutions and bolstering our executive talent.
This will enhance customer experience in a number of ways, such as better processing speed and enabling more innovation.
Ultimately, we are working toward building a best-in-class tax stack that can support the range of cross-border use cases, including C2C, C2B, B2C and B2B and serve as a foundation for ecosystems.
I'm really excited about the slate of product initiatives this year that can be impactful for customer experience.
A few examples include improving the functionality of our mobile app advancing dynamic pricing, revamping our customer loyalty program and the pilot in Europe with our Western Union International Bank later this year, extending our offerings to a wider set of financial services.
Given the customer-centric agenda we have for 2021, I think it makes sense to discuss why we are so optimistic about the long-term prospects of serving our core customer segment, the global migrant community.
Let me start by saying, we are extremely proud and privileged to serve the global migrant community and we are honored that they trust Western Union with one of the most important financial aspects of their lives, supporting loved ones in home countries.
As highlighted in our ESG reports for 2018, 2019 and our 2020 report coming in June, we are proud of the contribution our business mix around the world by promoting economic growth and prosperity for the people we serve.
Our purpose underpins our market position and strategy, and we believe our business offers strong potential value creation for all stakeholders.
First, the migrant and their loved ones is a large customer segment for Western Union.
According to the United Nations, there are more than 270 million migrant residents globally and many of them send remittances.
Factoring in remittance, recipients in home country, who also use our services and desire more options for financial services could more than double the potential customer base to over 0.5 billion people.
Second, migrants are a growing, hardworking and upwardly mobile group.
They are expected to drive a significant share of future population growth in higher-income countries and have above-average labor participation rates, higher rates of entrepreneurship and contribute significantly to innovation.
The third and final point, migrants have significant spending power.
According to our 2019 new American economy study, migrants represented $1.3 trillion of spending power in the US alone.
And obviously, globally, this amount is even higher.
To summarize, we believe migrants and their families and loved ones are special group of people that have an important role in societies and economies around the world.
Serving our customers' needs is a good business that offers Western Union organic growth and opportunity to expand into new services.
On top of this, in cross-border expertise and capabilities we gain through serving our core customer segments enables us to offer our cross-border platform for financial institutions and other third parties, extending our market opportunity beyond our own Western Union consumer services.
In closing, I'm pleased with the direction of our business.
Based on what we see internally and in the market, we are confident in the strategy and plan for the year, and we are off to a good start.
Moving to first quarter results.
Revenue of $1.2 billion increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis.
Currency translation net of the impact from hedges had a limited impact on first quarter revenues.
In the C2C segment, revenue increased 4% on a reported basis or 2% constant currency with transaction growth partially offset by mix.
B2C transactions grew 9% for the quarter, led by 77% transaction growth in digital money transfer.
Retail money transfer transactions were down in the quarter, but the business continued to move in the right direction with trends improving sequentially from the fourth quarter.
The mix impact from the high growth of digital white label partnerships and account-to-account digital transactions both lower revenue per transaction or RPT, continued to contribute to a spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter.
We do expect this gap to moderate over the next three quarters.
Total C2C cross-border principal increased 28% on a reported basis or 26% constant currency, driven by growth in digital money transfer and retail.
Total C2C principal per transaction or PPT was up 15% or 12% constant currency led by retail and wu.com.
Evolving business mix, coupled with changes in consumer behavior, more widely contributed to a higher PPT.
Digital money transfer revenues, which include wu.com and digital partnerships, increased 45% on a reported basis or 44% constant currency.
Similar to the broader C2C business, the mix impact from digital white label partnerships and account-to-account digital transactions contributed to a spread between transactions and revenue growth.
And from our vantage point, the pricing environment in the digital market remains constructive.
As Hikmet mentioned, wu.com had another very strong quarter.
Revenue grew 38% or 37% constant currency on transaction growth of 55%.
Cross-border revenue was up 49% in the quarter.
PPT trends were impressive, and we saw continued double-digit growth.
Digital partnerships, transactions and revenues more than doubled in the quarter.
As you may recall, the business experienced a step-up in transactions in the second quarter of 2020 with the initial global wave of COVID-19, and then another step-up for the second half of 2020.
This strong prior year growth is expected to cause a moderation in growth over the rest of 2021.
Moving to the regional results.
North America revenue was flat on a reported basis or increased 1% constant currency on transaction growth of 1%.
The increase in constant currency revenue and transaction growth was driven by US outbound, partially offset by declines in US domestic money transfer and Cuba where current US regulations limit our ability to operate.
Revenue in the Europe and CIS region increased 8% on a reported basis or 4% constant currency on transaction growth of 28%.
Constant currency revenue growth was led by France and Russia.
Growth in Russia was driven by the incremental digital white label business, which continued to contribute to a spread between transaction in constant currency growth.
Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region increased 1% on a reported basis or was flat constant currency while transactions grew 13%.
Qatar had solid constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, while the United Arab Emirates continued to experience soft trends.
Incremental digital white label business in Saudi Arabia was the primary driver of the spread between transaction growth and constant currency revenue growth.
Revenue growth in the Latin America and Caribbean region continued to improve sequentially and was up 3% or 8% constant currency on transaction declines of 8%.
The constant currency revenue growth was driven by a broad increase in principal across the region with higher PPT driving the spread between constant currency revenue growth and transaction growth in the quarter.
Revenue in the APAC region increased 9% on a reported basis or 3% constant currency, led by strength in Australia.
Transactions declined 2%, primarily driven by the Philippines domestic business, which has limited impact on revenue.
Business Solutions revenue decreased 2% on a reported basis or 8% constant currency as COVID-19 continue to impact certain verticals and hedging activity.
However, revenue trends continue to improve sequentially, and we expect will remain on an improving trajectory for the remainder of the year with a broader recovery in cross-border trade.
The segment represented 8% of company revenues in the quarter.
Other revenues represented 5% of total company revenues and declined 18% in the quarter.
Other revenues primarily consist of retail bill payments in the US and Argentina and retail money orders.
The revenue decline was due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the depreciation of the Argentine peso.
Turning to margins and profitability.
Consolidated operating margin in the quarter was 19.2% compared to the prior year period margin of 19.6% on a GAAP basis and 20.5% on an adjusted basis, which excluded costs related to our restructuring program.
The decrease in the operating margin primarily reflects how COVID-19 impacted the level and timing of certain expenses and investments in 2021 compared to 2020, including investments in strategic initiatives and marketing and compensation-related expenses, partially offset by changes in FX.
Foreign exchange hedges had a negative impact of $4 million on operating profit in the quarter and a benefit of $10 million in the prior year period.
Moving to segment margins.
Note that segment margins exclude last year's restructuring charges.
B2C operating margin was 19.6% compared to 20.7% in the prior year period.
Given that our C2C segment comprises almost 90% of total company operating income, the decrease in operating margin was driven by the same factors that impacted total company margin.
Business Solutions operating margin was 13.1% in the quarter compared to 14.1% in the prior year period.
The decline in operating margin was primarily due to an increase in compensation-related expenses.
Other operating margin was 22.6% compared to 26.1% in the prior year period, with the decline primarily due to lower revenue.
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 10.4% compared to a 12.5% effective tax rate on both a GAAP and adjusted basis in the prior year period.
The decrease in the company's effective tax rate was due to changes in composition between higher tax and lower tax foreign earnings and an increase in discrete tax benefits.
Earnings per share or earnings per share was $0.44 compared to the prior year period GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.44.
Year-over-year comparisons of earnings per share in the quarter reflects benefits of revenue growth, a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, offset by increased investments in strategic initiatives and marketing and compensation-related expenses.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet.
Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter was $176 million.
Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $97 million driven by agent signing bonuses and should be in a normal range for the full year.
At the end of the quarter, we had cash of $1.5 billion and debt of $3.2 billion.
During the quarter, we took advantage of historically low interest rates to issue new notes.
Proceeds were used to prepay a portion of the term loan in the first quarter, and we repaid our notes due in 2022 in early April.
We returned $172 million to shareholders in the first quarter consisting of $97 million of dividends and $75 million in share repurchases.
The outstanding share count at quarter end was 410 million shares.
And we had $708 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in December of this year.
We are also on track to achieve our digital revenue target exceeding $1 billion.
The increase in GAAP earnings per share reflects the sale of an investment, partially offset by expenses related to the early retirement of the company's notes due in 2022.
Both of these items will be reflected in second quarter results.
Excluding the impact of these two items, the 2021 earnings per share outlook would be unchanged, which we have reflected with an adjusted earnings per share outlook.
Note that our outlook assumes no material worsening in current global macroeconomic conditions or the COVID-19 pandemic.
We expect full year 2021 revenues will grow mid to high single-digits on a GAAP basis or mid single-digits on a constant currency basis, which also excludes the impact of Argentina inflation.
Operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5%, reflecting revenue growth and benefits from our three year productivity program that we expect to generate approximately $150 million of annual savings by the end of 2022, partially offset by higher operating expenses and investments in strategic initiatives.
We expect our effective tax rate will be in the mid-teens range on a GAAP and adjusted basis.
GAAP earnings per share for the year is now expected to be in a range of $2.06 to $2.16, including approximately a $0.06 net benefit in other income on an investment sale and debt retirement expenses that occurred early in the second quarter of 2021.
Adjusted EPS, which excludes those items, is expected to be in a range of $2 to $2.10.
Given the variability that COVID-19 caused on quarterly results, I will provide some context for how we think results may progress over the remainder of the year.
Note that our underlying assumptions include no material worsening in the effects of the pandemic and moderate improvement in global macro environment as the quarters progress.
Starting with revenue, we saw continued positive momentum in April.
And for the second quarter, we expect to see the strongest year-over-year growth rate as we cycle over the largest quarterly decline at the prior year.
For the third and fourth quarter of 2021, given the stability we had in the back half of last year, we expect general stability and trends and similar year-over-year growth rates.
Keep in mind that as a result of COVID-19, our digital business delivered exceptional growth from the second quarter onward in 2020.
So growth rates this year should moderate somewhat for the remainder of, 2021.
Although, we still expect to generate more than $1 billion in digital money transfer revenues this year.
Our retail business experienced a significant decline in the second quarter of 2020.
And while it began to come back quickly, we expect recovery will occur gradually.
As a result, we expect retail will generate growth in 2021.
The Business Solutions segment and other revenues were adversely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020.
So we expect that those businesses will continue to rebound this year.
Moving on to margin.
Based on our current view, we expect that second quarter margin will be below the full year margin outlook, while the back half of the year will be above the full year margin outlook.
To wrap up, we are off to a solid start to the year, optimistic that the macro environment will remain constructive, confident in our competitive position and underlying fundamentals.
And we are enthusiastic that our strategic agenda for the year will position us to realize the significant opportunities we see for our business over the next few years and beyond.
And operator, we are now ready to take questions.
","In Q1 2021, Western Union's revenue increased 2% to $1.2 billion. The Cross-Border Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) business grew substantially, with a 28% increase in principal and a 15% increase in principal per transaction. Digital revenue, including Wu.com and digital partnerships, surged 45%, driven by strong user growth and expansion. Despite challenges from COVID-19, the company maintained stability in April, giving confidence in continued growth. Full-year 2021 guidance remains positive, with an expected mid to high single-digit revenue growth on a GAAP basis. Operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 21.5%, while the effective tax rate is projected to be in the mid-teens range. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to be between $2.00 and $2.10. Western Union remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of serving the global migrant community, highlighting the market's size, growth potential, and spending power."
EXR_q1_2021.txt,"We are off to a great start in 2020.
The strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we move through the first three months of the year.
Same-store occupancy remained at all time highs for Extra Space with sequential growth in January and February at a time of the year when occupancy normally declines.
Occupancy increased further in March, ending the quarter with the year-over-year positive delta of 480 basis points.
Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which has also accelerated during the quarter with achieved rates increasing from 10% in January to well into the teens by the end of March.
These trends fueled same-store revenue growth of 4.6% despite a 110 basis point drag on revenue growth from lower year-over-year late fees.
We had excellent expense control with 0.2% decrease in same-store expenses.
The result with same-store NOI growth of 6.5% a sequential acceleration of 310 basis points from Q4 and year-over-year core FFO growth of 21%.
With fundamentals holding and performance comps becoming much easier in the upcoming months, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth through the second quarter.
Our concern of a dramatic increase in vacates has not materialized and now we are into our busy leasing season when demand is typically strongest.
We believe that vacate risk to our elevated occupancy has likely been postponed until the end of the summer or even into the fall.
Turning to external growth.
The acquisition market continues to be expensive and we remain disciplined but opportunistic.
Year-to-date, we've been able to close or put under contract a little over $300 million in acquisitions.
These are primarily lease-up properties and several of the properties came from our bridge lending program.
Looking forward, we anticipate the majority of additional acquisitions to be completed in joint ventures and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We were very active in Q1 on the third-party management front, adding 61 stores in the quarter, which includes the previously announced JCAP stores.
Our growth was partially offset by dispositions.
We have only sold to other operators at prices we viewed as unattractive to the region.
While this trend presents a headwind, we still expect solid growth in our third-party management platform for the year.
As I said on our last call, we are mindful of the risks we face.
These include difficult fourth quarter operational comp, a tight labor market and new supply and state of emergency orders in certain markets.
That said, current fundamentals are the strongest we have seen in some time.
And our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance.
Our first quarter outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improving 2021 outlook allow us to increase our industry-leading annual guidance $7.5 at the midpoint.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.
As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers.
Late fees and other income continue to be down and partially offset rental income, but we will lap this comp in the second quarter, which will enhance same-store revenue growth.
Existing customer rate increases will also provide a tailwind in the second quarter since they were paused during much of Q2 2020.
We delivered a reduction in same store expenses despite property tax increases of 6.9% and repairs and maintenance increases of 20% due to higher year-over-year snow removal costs.
These increases were up and were offset primarily by savings in payroll and marketing.
We believe payroll savings will continue throughout the year, albeit perhaps at lower levels due to wage pressure in certain markets.
Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive topline revenue growth, but it should also remain down for the year.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, a year-over-year increase of 21%.
Same-store property performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees.
As we announced during the quarter, Moody's issued Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating, our second investment grade credit rating now providing us access to the public bond market.
We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter through ATM activity and an overnight offering, which combined for net proceeds of $274 million.
We sold 16 stores into a joint venture and obtained debt for that venture, resulting in cash proceeds to Extra Space of $132 million and an ownership interest of 55%.
We plan to add a third partner to this venture in the second quarter, which will reduce our ownership interest to 16%.
Our equity and disposition proceeds reduced revolving balances and we ended the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 5.1 times lower than our long-term debt target of 5.5 times to 6 times.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions.
We raised our same-store revenue range to 5% to 6%.
Same-store expense growth was reduced to 2% to 3%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 6% to 8%, a 175 basis point increase at the midpoint.
These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected first quarter performance, relaxed legislative restrictions in certain markets, and better-than-expected resilience in storage fundamentals as the vaccine rolls out.
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $5.95 to $6.10 per share, a $7.5 increase at the midpoint.
We anticipate $0.14 of dilution from value-add acquisitions in C of O stores, $0.02 less than previously reported due to improved property performance.
We are excited by the strong performance year-to-date, as well as the acceleration we see heading into the second quarter.
","Extra Space experienced an exceptional first quarter with accelerated growth in key metrics. Same-store occupancy reached an all-time high, driving revenue growth of 4.6% despite lower late fees. Strong expense control contributed to a significant 6.5% increase in same-store NOI, leading to a 21% rise in year-over-year core FFO. External growth initiatives included $300 million in acquisitions, primarily lease-up properties, and expansion of the third-party management platform. The company raised its 2021 guidance to reflect the improved same-store performance, expecting revenue growth of 5% to 6% and core FFO per share of $5.95 to $6.10, an increase of $7.5 at the midpoint. Despite operational challenges and a tight labor market, the company remains optimistic due to strong fundamentals and its ability to optimize performance."
TUP_q3_2021.txt,"Actual results may differ materially from such statements.
Please note that any reference to net sales today is being made on a constant-currency basis, which reflects the application of the current period foreign exchange rates to any prior period results enabling comparisons, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
This is our sixth quarter of consistent successful execution against our three-year turnaround plan.
We're now at the midway point and are building a solid foundation for sustained growth and expansion.
Let me summarize our strategy for those of you who are new to the Tupperware turnaround story.
Our strategy includes fixing our core direct selling business while building an omnichannel consumer product company.
We're doing that by creating sub-brands that will enable us to strategically merchandise and price our products to minimize channel content.
The idea is to increase consumer access to our iconic products wherever they choose to buy.
2020 was a year of stabilization.
This year, 2021 is the foundation year where we continue to fix our core business and build the foundation to invest in the omnichannel opportunity.
We'll talk more about this opportunity today.
Next year, 2022, will be the year of expansion where we really begin to enter new channels and product categories.
And in 2023 and beyond, we will accelerate those efforts for long-term sustained growth.
During the quarter, we executed on several high-priority strategic initiatives that will improve our capital structure and position us well for the future.
We will get into more detail on each of these later in the call, but at a high level, include, progressing on divesting our noncore assets, including our beauty businesses and excess property holdings, enabling us to focus more time and resources on growing our core Tupperware brands and utilizing the recently authorized share repurchase facility to buy back 1 million shares during the third quarter, accelerating returns to shareholders.
These actions support our turnaround plan and are important components that will enable us to grow, expand and ultimately achieve our long-term strategic goals.
As a result, our net sales of $377 million reflects our core Tupperware business, which declined 13%, primarily reflecting difficult comparisons from 2020, along with COVID-related market closures in 2021 and disruption in our US and Canada business due to the implementation of a new technology platform.
From an earnings standpoint, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 reflects our improved cost structure and new tax strategy that Sandra will describe later on the call.
And during the quarter, we knew we were up against tough year-over-year comps.
Remember, we grew 21% in Q3 of 2020, yet our team executed well.
The prior year period benefited from an increase in demand from shift in consumer behavior as most of us were under lockdown and adjusting to working, learning, and eating from home.
Now that several markets have begun to open up mostly the US and Europe, we've seen a reversal of that trend as consumers are excited to get out and go places again and shopping at more traditional retail channels.
And we believe this trend will continue.
While some of the markets have begun to open up, others have gone into strict or mandatory lockdown in response to COVID resurgence in many regions, especially in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
This has had a significant impact on recurring efforts and overall productivity given the restrictions of personal gatherings and opportunities to directly connect with the brand.
That said, we believe these headwinds are transitory in nature and will begin to normalize in the near to medium term.
As I will talk about later, we are working to reconnect with our sales force and give them tools and support they need to be successful in any market environment.
And because these headwinds had the most impact on our direct selling business in the third quarter, we believe that our strategy to diversify into multiple channels as we roll our business is being directly validated.
We believe that our turnaround will not produce linear results as evidenced by the third quarter but that over time, both top and bottom line will improve as we implement our growth plans.
Now that we are six quarters into our third year turnaround plan, this midway point feels like an appropriate time to summarize the progress we have made over the last 18 months.
In short, the company was in a very different place in April of 2020.
Quite frankly, the business was not doing well, and we needed to make major changes to keep this iconic brand afloat.
The solution was to execute a full turnaround of entire business.
We did this by rightsizing our cost structure, delivering $192 million in savings in 2020.
We've created a global business services group to generate operational efficiencies, centralizing and optimizing many of our back-office functions with a mandate to improve service and reduce costs, refinancing our debt and improving liquidity.
In fact, our leverage ratio is a third of previous levels.
On capital structure, we made significant progress.
After selling our Avroy Shlain Beauty business earlier this year, we're working diligently to sell our remaining beauty business and excess land on holdings.
Lastly, we repurchased shares of our common stock.
And I should mention that this was the first time we bought back shares since 2018, reflecting our belief in a positive outlook of our share appreciation as we execute our turnaround plan, and restructuring the company from systems and processes to strategy and personnel.
We've made detailed investments to improve sales force productivity.
We implemented a new sales force system in the US during the second quarter.
Given that the legacy system was customized to the needs of our sales force for the last 20 years, the new technology solution caused disruption to our sales force in the past few months.
We've begun working closely with our sales force over the past several weeks and believe once fixed, the technology will be enabler for our sales force to grow their business.
We've increased our use of data to make better and smarter business decisions.
We've begun using more data-driven approach designed to identify best practices, improve our marketing communication, upgrade our business intelligence to make better decisions and ensure competitive service and costs.
We're also using data-driven approach to segment how we look at our sales force and customers to personalize the experience they have with Tupperware.
That means providing differentiated support, service and incentives to all of our sales force, our customers, ensuring we are adding value as a result, improving retention.
To that end, we've introduced preferred customer loyalty programs in some of our biggest markets such as Mexico and plan to roll out additional markets including the US soon.
We've continued to innovate and expand product lines, soon-be, sub-brands, and product categories beyond the kitchen.
This strategy will enable us not only to compete on price more effectively, but also to segregate which products are sold through which channels, helping us minimize channel conflict.
One of our first sub-brands is called Tupperware Essentials.
And we've recently begun testing consumers' response in Europe through selected retailers.
We're also continuing the work of expanding our product line beyond the kitchen.
Finally, we recently received a recognition from fast company for our product innovation and specifically for our Echo-plus to go coffee cup, which is made of our revolutionary Ecoplasmaterial and our solution for eliminating single-use coffee cups.
We're also working to improve our service level.
Service means serving both our sales force and the end consumer better, giving our sales force the tools they need to be successful and ensuring the end customer has a good experience.
So service is much more than just delivery of customer service.
It is the entire customer and sales force journey.
This effort is a true cultural shift for our company, but one that is necessary to compete in an omnichannel business.
In hindsight, that's a lot.
We're not even close to the same company that we were 18 months ago, and we're proud of the progress we've made.
Lastly, we have to recognize that the pandemic induced an inability to gather people and connecting person has been less than ideal.
For six quarters, the entire time, the new leadership team has been in place, we have not been able to meet face to face with our sales leaders around the world.
And we think that that has a cumulative effect.
Now with vaccination rates increasing in many regions, the executive team finally has the opportunity to get back to meeting sales leaders in person.
We also intend to resume incentive trips and events that were put on hold in the past 18 months due to travel restrictions.
This was a portion of our total cost savings we said we anticipate coming back when we return to more normal activity.
Next on business expansion, which is essentially channel expansion and includes B2B loyalty programs selling to retailers and studios and selling through an important move.
We continue to make good progress.
For the year-to-date period through September, business expansion represented 21% of total sales, which is an increase compared to where we were in Quarter 2.
Also, last quarter, we mentioned that we were looking to enter into the UK.
So I'm excited to announce that we just signed an agreement with a large UK distributor who distributes products of international brands in many of the major retailers in the UK.
The UK market is sizable and represents a large opportunity for us.
And we think this approach will enable us to gain faster traction in this key market.
Expanding into new channels is a key component of our strategic plan that will enable us to meaningfully increase the consumer aspect of Tupperware product.
It also reduces the reliance of single channel and therefore, is expected to minimize the volatility of our performance during any given period.
Next on our ESG efforts.
During the fourth quarter, we launched a power project with TerraCycle Loop in Canada where we will be providing sandwich keepers for five Tim Hortons locations.
A customer can opt to pay a small premium basically a deposit for the sandwich keeper.
And if they return it to Tim Hortons when they're done, they will receive their deposit back.
Loop then cleans and returns it to the restaurant for future use.
We were recognized in the Fast Company's first annual list of brands that matter, which honors spreads to do more than just selling products or provide services.
Brands achieving relevance through cultural impact, social engagement, and authentic communication of their mission and ideas.
It is especially gratifying to be recognized for our purpose and it is indicative of the progress we're making to chart a new path for this iconic brand.
Lastly, we will soon be publishing our new sustainability report, which include clear ESG goals and targets intended to further demonstrate and realize our commitment to our purpose.
Looking ahead, it is our goal to be a very different and even stronger company 18 months from now.
Our near-term priorities continue to be strengthening our direct selling business through structural service improvement, detail and property investment, use of data to optimize practices and expanding into new channels and product categories.
We're running a long-term strategic plan.
Our path won't necessarily be linear.
And therefore, investors should naturally expect near term ebbs and inflows.
But longer term, we're confident we will achieve our goals given the power of our brand, coupled with our improved liquidity and capital structure.
I will now turn the time over to Sandra, our CFO and COO, to provide a full report on the quarter.
It was indeed a significant quarter for the company and continuing to establish the foundation while investing in the business to prepare for the next six quarters of our turnaround plan.
Before I begin the detailed financial discussion for the quarter, I want to address a reporting change that will be evident in the release of our 10-Q.
Because we've either sold or are actively working to sell several of our beauty brands, the necessary criteria have been met to classify these businesses as held-for-sale assets and discontinued operations as of the third quarter of 2021 and have also been restated as such in the prior-year period.
We believe this is also very aligned with our strategy to focus on the performance of our core business.
Details of the results from discontinued operations will be presented separately in our financial statement footnotes found in our Form 10-Q.
I will note that we did record an approximate $148 million noncash loss within discontinued operations, primarily driven by accumulated currency translations, which is standard GAAP accounting practice.
Now I will discuss the results of continuing operations in the quarter.
Net sales of $377 million in the quarter represents a decrease of 13% compared to last year.
The year-over-year decline was driven by lockdowns caused by the persisting pandemic, disruptions caused by the implementation of a new independent sales force solution in the US and lower productivity caused by higher levels of vacationing, especially in Europe.
We believe many of these headwinds are transitory in nature.
But nevertheless, we have reprioritized certain initiatives to ensure we're providing full support to our sales force across the globe.
In the quarter, total business expansion or nondirect selling business, which includes B2B, importers, EU markets, and other business expansion efforts represented 24% of total sales.
For the year-to-date period, total business expansion was 21% of total sales, up 100 basis points compared to the same year-to-date period through June.
B2B partnership sales in the quarter were $16 million or 4% of total sales.
Historically, our annual B2B sales have been between $30 million to $35 million.
And for this fiscal year, our goal is to reach $50 million.
Year-to-date through September, we've already achieved $35 million.
Our B2B relationship with portfolio of new programs of major retailers, while at the same time, increasing our brand awareness.
I'll reiterate that expanding into new channels represents a significant growth opportunity for Tupperware.
Turning now to sales performance by regions.
In Asia Pacific, sales decreased by 15%.
The slowdown in China was driven by COVID lockdowns related to resurgence challenges, ineffective and low vaccination rates as well as by studio closings and a slower pace of new openings.
I should note that we recently made an important leadership change in this market.
We believe China continues to hold significant potential for the Tupperware brand long term.
Other areas within the region were down 12% in the quarter, severely impacted by COVID, including by mandatory or strict lockdowns in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which significantly impacted sales efforts, particularly as digital adoption is low in many of these regions.
We think there is a significant opportunity to improve performance within the region as we focus on increasing digital adoption.
In Europe, sales decreased by 20%.
Excluding B2B, sales decreased by 17%, mainly due to the timing of a B2B deal in Italy in the prior year that was not repeated this year.
European developed markets were significantly impacted by elevated levels of summer vacationing, which is customary in Europe and likely exasperated this year, given a full year of travel restrictions.
We also eliminated certain unprofitable promotions this year to continue to improve the profitability of the region.
European emerging markets were impacted by COVID lockdown and civil unrest, resulting in lower productivity and recruitment, which are a natural side effect of such challenging conditions.
In North America, sales decreased by 15% in the quarter, while US and Canada decreased by 20%.
The decrease in the US and Canada were driven primarily by disruption caused by the implementation of our new sales force solutions.
We are taking actions to address change management challenges related to the salesforce system including talking with the vendor and working to migrate personal sales force ordering sites to a more consumer-friendly solution.
As Miguel previously mentioned, we've also begun to take action to reconnect with our sales leaders face to face to understand how to serve them and our end customers better.
Those efforts are yielding valuable insight that will help us to improve.
Sales in Mexico decreased by 6%, driven by a significant sales force reduction stemming from service issues during the second quarter as well as lower-than-expected recruitment due to primarily COVID restrictions.
We already have a campaign underway to recruit and reengage the sales force in this region.
In South America, sales increased by 9%.
Sales in Brazil were flat, which we view as positive given its cumulative recruitment issues due to COVID.
We attribute the relative strength to significant recruiting efforts and the simplification of our onboarding and training processes.
Argentina was a bright spot this quarter, which we attribute to the rollout of digital training platforms and expansion of e-commerce on a national level.
Overall, we are pleased with our sales performance despite challenging market conditions and of our ability to continue executing against our strategic initiatives and delivering tangible results.
Moving now to profit.
Gross profit in the third quarter was $248 million or 65.8% of net sales, a decrease of approximately 300 basis points compared to last year.
This was driven primarily by 240 basis points related to higher resin and manufacturing costs and 60 basis points related to country mix.
As we mentioned last quarter, we had anticipated higher resin costs, but we're optimistic that the favorability in manufacturing would continue to help offset it.
However, this was not the case in the third quarter due to lower volumes and higher inventory.
As we look forward to 2022, we will look for opportunities to reduce cost, increase efficiencies and opportunistically raise prices where appropriate.
I should also note that we intentionally built up inventory levels during the first half of 2021 in order to improve service and meet increasing demand.
However, with the higher inventory levels and lower demand in the quarter, we will be focused on sell-through of inventory and taking downtime where needed in the future.
We do believe that our ability to manufacture locally continues to be an advantage during the pandemic.
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the third quarter was 50.6% versus 48.5% last year, an increase of 210 basis points, primarily reflecting higher logistics costs and the investments we plan to make in the second half of the year.
In regard to logistics costs, we have been working to minimize the impact through efforts to improve contract pricing and sourcing, optimize container utilization, and strategically planned shipments.
I'll note that carrier costs remained elevated, FedEx surcharges are still in effect and we're seeing a shift in our business model in the US where we're increasingly shipping direct to the end consumer versus using the sales force for fulfillment and distribution.
We do recoup a majority of this cost as we charge for shipping, which is reflected in revenue.
As we continue to shift to a more omnichannel approach, we expect this trend to continue.
Therefore, we're working to improve efficiencies in fulfillment, packaging and shipping.
Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter was $52 million, and as a percentage of sales, it was 14%.
Despite softer-than-expected sales, our operating margin remained in the mid-teens, reflecting the renewed focus on tighter cost controls and a more disciplined approach to investments.
Now to adjusted EBITDA, which is an important metric and an indicator of progress toward rightsizing our cost structure and evolving our capital structure.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $69 million versus $100 million in the prior year.
Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA through September was $328 million.
Our operating tax rate was a negative 20.4% versus the same quarter in 2020 of 28.3%.
This quarter's tax rate benefited from an election we made when filing the 2020 tax return in October to change our capitalization policy, which allows us to utilize previously valued tax credits in the third quarter that would have otherwise expired and which resulted in the release of valuation allowances.
While nonrecurring in nature, this valuation allowance release is part of our strategic tax initiative that we were executing as part of our turnaround plan to help us effectively utilize our existing tax assets and achieve our overall tax rate of below 30%.
Now to earnings per share.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 for Q3 versus $1.12 last year is better by $0.07 per share.
The favorable tax item just discussed contributed $0.52 of the variance and was offset by $0.41 due to lower volumes, higher resin costs and incremental investments, and $0.05 of higher inventory reserves.
We also bought back shares in the quarter, which Miguel mentioned, and I will discuss more in a minute, that contributed $0.01 per share.
Year to date, operating cash flow net of investing was a negative $7 million, compared to $108 million last year.
As we've mentioned before, higher cash flow last year was driven by aggressive cost-saving actions, including COVID-specific actions like furloughs and significant lower spending on inventory and higher payables in order to preserve cash.
This year, we've invested in inventory in order to improve service levels given the current landscape of the global supply chain issues while also reverting to a more normalized level of capital spending.
As I mentioned earlier, the investment in inventory was to improve service while mitigating global supply chain conditions.
I should note that our full year free cash flow target may be less than $200 million and is largely dependent on the timing of cash proceeds from the sale of our noncore assets.
Moving on to the balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $124 million, which compares to $134 million last year.
And we ended the quarter with a total debt balance of $678 million.
Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio for debt covenant purposes was $2.28 million versus 3.72% last year and well below the required covenant of 3.75%.
We will look to favorable market conditions to present opportunities to further improve our capital structure.
As Miguel and I also mentioned, we utilized our newly approved share repurchase facility.
Of the $250 million that was recently authorized by our board, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock during the third quarter at an acquisition cost of $25 million.
This was the maximum we could do within our credit facility covenants.
With each quarter of the turnaround behind us, our optimism increases regarding our future growth trajectory.
And going forward, we'll continue to be opportunistic regarding repurchasing shares, seeking to deploy capital as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Although we focused on the continuing operations for the third quarter, net sales from discontinued operations were $45 million or 11% of total net sales and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the cumulative translation adjustments from discontinued operations was $0.03 or 3% of our total adjusted earnings per share.
For the year-to-date period through September, net sales from discontinued operations were $140 million or 10% of total net sales and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the CTA from discontinued operations was $0.11 or 4% of total adjusted earnings per share.
As we continue to make progress and get further along in our turnaround plan, we want to be sure to share some of our strategies and early successes that are driving our long-term plan.
To that end, we are planning to host an Investor Day during the first half of 2022, during which we will provide a more comprehensive view into the business, strategy, and tangible examples of the progress against our strategic initiatives and turnaround efforts as well as provide a longer-term framework and outlook.
Look for more details in the coming months.
We continue to make progress on stabilizing our core business while increasing investments in our business expansion efforts and executing on several strategic initiatives that strengthened our capital structure and have positioned us well for future growth.
All components of our turnaround plan and indicative of progress.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2021, we'll continue to build on our foundation and invest in initiatives that will improve the business and drive penetration into new channels.
We believe our consistent execution will result in a stronger more resilient, competitive, and durable company long term.
With that, let's take some questions.
","Tupperware Brands continues to execute its turnaround plan, reporting mixed financial results for the third quarter. Net sales declined 13% to $377 million, primarily due to COVID-related market closures and disruptions from a new technology platform implementation. Adjusted earnings per share improved to $1.19, reflecting cost-cutting measures and a new tax strategy. The company has divested non-core assets, repurchased shares, and improved its capital structure. It is expanding into new channels and product categories to diversify revenue streams. Despite headwinds, Tupperware believes its turnaround will yield positive results in the long term. The company plans to host an Investor Day in the first half of 2022 to provide further insights into its strategy and progress."
TTC_q3_2021.txt,"The Toro Company delivered record third quarter results.
We continue to benefit from robust demand in both our Professional and Residential segments and our operations team went above and beyond to execute even as global supply chain challenges affected availability.
Our employees together with our channel partners, kept a sharp focus on serving the needs of our customers.
As a result, total net sales for the third quarter were up 16% year-over-year.
Professional segment net sales increased 15%, marking the second quarter in a row of double-digit growth for this segment.
We saw continued strength in landscape contractor and golf markets worldwide.
Higher pre-season shipments of BOSS snow and ice management products, and strong demand for our rental and specialty construction equipment and Ventrac products.
Our lineup of innovative products, combined with strong business confidence fueled robust demand.
Residential segment net sales were up 23% and that comparison is on top of a 38% growth rate in the third quarter of last year.
Growth in the quarter was driven by strong retail demand for our zero-turn and walk power mowers.
Customers also continued to respond favorably to our all-season Flex-Force 60-volt product lineup, which offers power and durability with no compromise on performance.
The recent actions we've taken to introduce innovative new products, refresh marketing, and expand mass retail distribution continue to strengthen the Toro brand and drive positive results.
As noted last quarter, we expected supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures to escalate at a rate faster than could be fully offset in the near term, through pricing and other mitigating actions.
Despite these challenges, both segments delivered solid earnings growth in the third quarter, Professional earnings up 7.6% and Residential earnings up 10.5%.
I'll now touch on some of the key themes for the quarter.
First is the robust and broad-based demand, we continue to see across our markets worldwide.
This has been driven by consumer and business confidence as well as customer investment priorities focused on outdoor environments.
We continue to capitalize on these drivers with our commitment to investing in new product development, our best-in-class distribution, and our talented teams.
Second, the continued escalation of global supply chain and inflationary challenges.
This included component availability constraints as well as material freight and wage related cost headwinds.
Our operations team took extraordinary steps to enable us to source and produce as effectively as possible in this incredibly dynamic environment.
We also continue to execute on our productivity and synergy initiatives, demonstrated disciplined expense control and implemented market align pricing actions.
Regardless of how long these pressures persist, we remain focused on managing the factors within our control.
Third, in line with general economic trends we saw an increasingly challenging labor market, including wage pressures and workforce availability limitations in some of our manufacturing location.
Across the enterprise, we have talented and dedicated teams committed to serving our customers.
We're focused on having workforce and other resources in place to put ourselves in the best position to meet demand and deliver our products to the right places at the right time.
Our innovative product portfolio, outstanding team, and deep relationships with our channel partners and end customers set us apart and position us well for the long term growth.
We have the financial capacity to invest in the future and we continue to allocate capital to best drive value for all stakeholders.
This fiscal year, we've made strategic investments in key technologies, both organically and through acquisitions to advance our priority areas of alternative power, smart, connected, and autonomous.
Our healthy cash flow also has allowed us to return capital to shareholders while maintaining ample liquidity.
Looking ahead, we will continue to execute against our enterprise strategic priorities of accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity, and operational excellence and empowering people.
I'll discuss our outlook further following Renee's more detailed review of our financial results.
As Rick said, our record results for the third quarter were driven by robust demand in both our professional and residential segments.
Against the backdrop of increasing supply chain, inflation and labor pressures.
We grew net sales for the quarter by 16.2% to $976.8 million.
Reported earnings per share was $0.89 per diluted share, up from $0.82 last year and adjusted earnings per share was $0.92 per diluted share, up 12.2% from $0.82 in the prior year.
Both of our segments delivered record top and bottom line third quarter results.
Professional segment net sales were up 15.2% to $718.5 million.
This increase was driven by broad-based demand in landscape contractor, golf, snow and ice management, rental and specialty construction, and Ventrac products.
This was slightly offset by lower sales of underground construction equipment due to supply chain disruptions that impacted product availability.
Professional segment earnings for the third quarter were up 7.6% to $122.3 million.
And when expressed as a percent of net sales, decreased 120 basis points to 17%.
This decrease was largely due to higher material and freight cost, partially offset by net price realization and productivity improvements.
Residential segment net sales for the third quarter were up 23% to $252.1 million.
This increase was primarily driven by strong retail demand for zero-turn and walk power mowers.
Residential segment earnings for the quarter were up 10.5% to $31.5 million and when expressed as a percent of net sales, down 140 basis points to 12.5%.
This decrease was primarily driven by the same factors as in the Professional segment.
Turning to our operating results for the quarter.
We reported gross margin of 33.9%, a decrease of 110 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year.
Adjusted gross margin was 33.9%, down 130 basis points on a comparative basis.
These decreases were largely due to the same factors that affected Professional and Residential earnings.
SG&A expense as a percent of net sales for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 21.4%.
This increase was primarily driven by more normalized spending compared to the third quarter of last year and a legal settlement in the third quarter this year.
Operating earnings as a percent of net sales for the third quarter decreased 130 basis points to 12.5%.
Adjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 13.1%.
Interest expense was down $1.3 million for the quarter to $7 million, driven by lower debt levels and decreased interest rate.
The reported effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.3%.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow.
Accounts receivable totaled $301.2 million, down 2.2% from a year ago, primarily driven by channel mix.
Inventory was essentially flat to last year at $665.6 million.
However, finished goods were significantly lower, driven by strong retail demand while working process was higher.
This was a reflection of the supply chain variability and our efforts to procure higher levels of key components when available.
Accounts payable increased 53% from last year to $411.4 million.
This was primarily due to the timing of purchases as well as more normalized spending compared to last year.
Year-to-date free cash flow was $429 million with the conversion ratio of 123%.
This positive performance was largely the result of higher earnings and lower working capital, primarily driven by higher payables.
At the end of the quarter, our liquidity remained at $1.1 million.
This included cash and cash equivalents of $535 million and full availability under our $600 million revolving credit facility.
Our cash balances are elevated from pre-pandemic levels, largely driven by our desire to ensure adequate liquidity at the onset of pandemic.
And our cash was further strengthened by the accelerated demand we're experiencing along with the related working capital impacts.
Over the past nine months, we deployed the majority of cash generated year-to-date, including the funding of our Turflynx and Left Hand Robotics acquisition, an increase in our regular dividend with $85 million paid out so far this year, the resumption of share repurchases with $177 million through the third quarter and $100 million in debt pay down.
We also increased our capital expenditure budget reflecting our commitment to invest in key technologies and ensure we have the capacity to meet future demand.
We remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy fueled by our strong balance sheet.
Our priorities have not changed and include reinvesting in our businesses to support sustainable long-term growth both organically and through acquisition, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and maintaining our leverage goals to support financial flexibility.
As we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year, we're benefiting from strong demand momentum and our leadership position in the markets we serve.
At the same time customer demand continues to outpace supply and production.
We're not immune to the challenges facing companies worldwide and we remain focused on serving our customers, winning in our markets and managing the factors within our control.
We previously indicated that operational headwinds would be most pronounced in the third quarter.
As a result of collective work of our team to fulfill additional demand, we were able to deliver a stronger third quarter than we had anticipated.
This resulted in lower finished goods heading into the fourth quarter.
We remain focused on procuring materials, components and other resources to accelerate the pace of production in the face of supply chain, inflation, and labor pressures.
With this backdrop, we are updating our full year fiscal 2021 guidance.
We now expect net sales growth of about 17%, up from 12% to 15% previously.
We anticipate the Professional segment growth rate will be similar to the company average, with the Residential segment exceeding the company growth rate.
Looking at profitability, we now expect overall adjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales for the full year to be similar to fiscal 2020.
We expect professional segment operating margins to be similar to last year.
And we expect Residential margins to be down compared to last year, but still well above historical levels.
This reflects our volume leverage and strong operational performance year-to-date offset by increasing supply chain, inflation, and labor pressures.
We continue to take actions to counteract these market dynamics.
Based on current visibility, we now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.53 to $3.57 per diluted share, up from our previous range of $3.45 to $3.55.
This higher earnings per share guidance reflects our strong year-to-date performance, the robust demand environment, and continued solid business execution while also taking into account the headwinds previously discussed.
All in, we remain well positioned to capitalize on this period of profitable growth as we continue to execute on our strategic long-term priorities.
The guidance Renee just discussed reflects continuing strong demand across our end markets as well as our current operational outlook.
Looking at global key demand drivers for the remainder of the fiscal year and into fiscal 2022, we are watching consumer and business confidence levels along with developments related to COVID-19, customer prioritization of investments to maintain and improve outdoor environments, a continuation of strong momentum in golf and government support and funding of infrastructure investments.
These end market factors should continue to drive strong demand in the fourth quarter and into next year.
Our biggest challenge remains our ability to produce, to meet retail demand across all of our markets given the current operating environment.
We believe constraints will begin to ease as we see improvements in key material and component availability, logistic channels and other COVID related factors.
Our operations team remains committed to doing everything reasonably possible to meet increased production requirements and grow market share in this challenging environment.
When operating constraints begin to ease, we expect to be in a better position to build field inventory from our current historically low levels.
We remain focused on driving productivity and synergies prudently managing expenses and implementing market based pricing actions as appropriate.
We are well positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities with our strong cash flow, market leadership, investments in innovation and trusted relationships.
A few recent examples that highlight our commitment to innovation and relationships include for the second year in a row, a Partner of the Year Award from Tractor Supply Company, this time as omnichannel partner.
From Green Industry Pros, the selection of three of our products for their 2021 Editor's Choice Award citing innovation and utility has factors.
The three products include the Exmark 96-inch Lazer Z Diesel, the Toro Z Master 4000, and Z-Spray LTS spreader sprayer.
In August, two of our rental and specialty construction offerings received Editor's Choice Award from Rental magazine, including the Ditch Witch SK3000 full size stand-on skid steer, which offers the most power in its class and the Toro Swivel Mud Buggy with superior traction and maneuverability.
And finally, the International Sustainable Irrigation Expo recently recognized our Aqua-Traxx Azul micro-irrigation solution as new products of the year.
In addition to awards, our innovative products have been showcased at recent marquee events.
Earlier this summer, our Perrot Irrigation Systems helps keep the playing fields in top condition at many of the Euro Cup Championship sites.
In July, our irrigation and turf equipment supported Paul Larsen and his team at Royal St George's Golf Club as their expert work was on full display at the Open Championship.
And more recently, our turf and irrigation solutions helped Tokyo's Japan National Stadium and Kasumigaseki Country Club maintain pristine conditions for this summer's high-profile events.
Our mission to deliver superior innovation and customer care is deeply rooted in our purpose of helping our customers enrich the beauty, productivity and sustainability of the land.
This long-standing focus on sustainability extends to our communities where we have a strong legacy of giving back.
A few recent examples highlight this legacy.
First, close to our worldwide headquarters, we partnered with Better Futures, an organization that works to transform the lives of men post incarceration and supports Minnesota's environment.
Our donations of equipment and training resources helped further the organization's mission.
Second, on a national level, we've partnered with the American Rental Association Foundation on a new community impact project.
This initiative is improving communities across the US by rebuilding green spaces.
These are just a couple of examples of the many ways our company employees are giving back and promoting sustainability, supporting our customers, and communities as an important part of our culture and core to who we are as a company.
In closing, we are optimistic as we finished fiscal 2021 and head into 2022 while also acknowledging the continuing dynamic environment.
We believe our updated guidance appropriately reflects both the risks and the opportunities we face.
We have strong fundamentals and momentum across our businesses and are well positioned to capitalize on future growth.
","The Toro Company reported strong third-quarter results, driven by a 16% increase in net sales to $976.8 million, with both the Professional and Residential segments delivering double-digit growth. Professional sales rose 15% to $718.5 million, while Residential sales jumped 23% to $252.1 million. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, earnings per share increased 12.2% to $0.92, exceeding expectations. The company's innovative product portfolio and strong demand propelled these results, with especially robust growth in the residential zero-turn and walk power mower segments. Toro expects the strong demand environment to continue in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022 and has raised its full-year guidance. However, the company remains focused on managing supply chain disruptions and other operational headwinds to meet the growing demand."
AVD_q2_2020.txt,"American Vanguard will file our Form 10-Q with the SEC tomorrow.
Before beginning, we should take our moment for a usual cautionary reminder.
Such factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures and various other risks that are detailed in the company's SEC reports and filings.
We appreciate your continued support of American Vanguard.
In our last call, we gave you our first impression of the coronavirus pandemic, which had begun to spread into the United States partway through the first quarter.
As part of the critical infrastructure, we were permitted, indeed, expected to continue operating in the midst of a global pandemic, the likes of which we had not seen in over a century.
In order to operate without disruption during the first quarter, we had to adapt.
Where we could do so, we shifted from in-person to remote work.
Where we had to maintain physical operations as in our factories, we implemented COVID protocols to keep the workplace safe and healthy.
At the same time, we learned to do business remotely while constantly checking on supply chain stability, logistics and customer demand.
Fast forward to the second quarter, the pandemic has become the norm.
We, and our suppliers, peers and customers, have become more accustomed to doing business through Zoom meetings, webinars and email.
We continue our efforts to ensure that internal communication was frequent and continuous.
In fact, I continue to hold weekly 2-hour state of the company calls with over 40 of my key managers during which I solicit input on operational challenges, sales opportunities and regional developments to ensure that we are all moving in the same direction.
In addition, on a daily basis, our pandemic working group advises the workplace regarding COVID-related news, government orders, research and company protocols.
During the second quarter, the pandemic shifted from Asia and Europe into the Americas, where we do most of our business.
In spite of that shift, I am pleased to report that we have had a low very low incident of coronavirus infection within our workforce.
That nearly all of the cases were community transmissions outside of our facilities and that our operations have not been adversely affected by the pandemic to date.
At this point, I want to pause to note that given the circumstances where so many businesses are struggling for survival, cutting workforces, taking federal loans or filing free organization, we are generating stronger returns than what we did while operating in the normal course of last year at this time.
Specifically, even while quarterly net sales declined by 8%, net income increased by 25% over the period.
At the same time, and I hate to steal David's thunder here, as of June 30, we have strengthened our balance sheet by reducing inventory even with expanded product offerings, reducing debt and improving cash from operations by $38 million so far this year.
Before turning the call over to David, let me take a moment to focus on the future.
We are still constrained from making specific forecast because we do not yet know how long the pandemic will last nor how it may affect our business or markets.
Nevertheless, we have adapted to the coronavirus with increasing success.
As we look forward to the balance of the year, we continue to believe that we are poised to perform in line with our peers.
This is so for a number of reasons, including favorable conditions for our mosquito control products, larger supply of Krovar and Hyvar herbicides for use on citrus, pineapple and McCabe and expansion of our Vapam fumigant business in Mexico, Central America and Australia.
I will then return to give you an update on some exciting initiatives to grow our business through new products and technology innovation.
As Bill mentioned, we will be filing our Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, tomorrow.
Everything I'm covering here is included in more detail in that document.
As Eric indicated, the company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate.
As a result, our customers and suppliers have all operated more or less without disruption during the pandemic.
Having said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways, including our ability to present new sales and marketing ideas, such as new products, face-to-face with customers in the field.
On the other hand, you will see in our financial statements the same restrictions have caused us to spend less on operating expenses.
Furthermore, the company has been able to operate normally throughout the first half of 2020 without the need to apply for any COVID-related federal stimulus package loans.
Looking forward to the balance of 2020, we do not expect to need to seek such loans resistance.
With regard to our financial performance for the three months ended June 30, 2020, the company's net sales decreased by 8% to $105 million as compared to sales of $113 million this time last year.
Within that overall decline, our U.S. sales were down about $6 million and our international sales were down about $2 million.
International sales accounted for 44% of net sales as compared to 43% of net sales this time last year.
Eric has already discussed the main factors that have affected our second quarter sales performance.
In addition, the sales and expenses of our businesses in Mexico and Brazil were affected by the devaluation of the related currency exchange rates with the dollar, as compared to this time last year.
We believe these exchange rate devaluations were caused at least in part by the COVID pandemic.
Without the adverse currency translation effect on our Brazilian and Mexican sales, our second quarter consolidated sales would have been $3 million higher.
For the quarter, our manufacturing performance was strong, with factory operating costs well controlled and activity improved as compared to 2019.
As a result of these various dynamics, we improved our gross margin performance when expressed as a percentage of sales to 39% of sales in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to 37% in the same period of 2019.
For the three months ended June 30, 2020, our operating expenses decreased by $1.9 million or 5% as compared to the expenses incurred in the same period of the prior year.
In the prior year, however, we had a benefit of approximately $1.8 million, primarily associated with adjustments to deferred liabilities on a past acquisition.
That did not repeat in the current year.
Making adjustments for that item, our underlying reduction in recurring operating expenses is greater and amounted to approximately $3.7 million or about 10%.
During the second quarter, we recorded reduced interest expense.
Our average debt was a little higher because of all the acquisition activity during the last year, but we got a benefit from reduced borrowing rates in the United States.
Finally, our effective tax rate remained approximately flat compared to the same period of 2019.
In summary, for the second quarter, though our sales were down, selling prices and overall mix of sales remain good, factory performance was improved compared to 2019 and gross margins as a percentage of sales increased from 37% to 39%.
Our operating expenses and interest expenses were lower.
And as a result, net income increased by 25% in comparison to 2019.
Now let us turn to the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.
Sales were down about $12 million or 6% as compared to the prior year.
Within that performance, net sales of both our domestic and international businesses were down about $6 million each.
The devaluation in key currencies resulted in about $4 million lower sales when sales originally recorded in the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso were translated to dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
Our factory performance for the six-month period was excellent, with costs up only 0.006% and factory output up about 13%.
This resulted in a much improved rate of recovery factory costs.
Overall, gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales was flat period-over-period at 39% of sales.
Our operating expenses remained almost flat in the first six months of 2020 as compared to the prior year.
In the prior year, however, we had a benefit of approximately $3.3 million, primarily associated with adjustments to deferred liabilities on a past acquisition.
That did not repeat in the current year.
Making adjustments for that item, our underlying reduction in recurring operating expenses amount to about $3.3 million or about 5%.
Our net income for the first six months of 2020 ended at $4.4 million or $0.15.
This compared with $7 million or $0.24 in the same period of 2019.
From my perspective, the operating and financial focus for the company remains as follows.
We continue to follow a disciplined approach to planning our factory activity, balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels.
At the end of June 2020, our inventories were at $180 million.
This includes about $5 million of inventory related to acquisitions completed since June 30, 2019.
An adjusted or underlying inventory of $175 million represents an $18 million reduction as compared to $193 million this time last year.
We are highly focused on our balance sheet as we navigate through this pandemic period and having lower inventories at this point in the year is pleasing to report.
Looking forward, we expect inventories to reduce during the balance of the year.
Our present forecasts indicate that we will be below prior year numbers for both the remaining reporting periods of 2020.
The estimate of $145 million that we previously indicated remains a good estimate, excluding any acquisitions.
With regard to accounts receivable, as I noted earlier, our customers have continued to operate without significant disruption.
They are placing orders for our products and making payments when expected.
As a result, we have not seen any material change in the assessment of our credit risk exposure at the end of the second quarter of 2020 in comparison to prior quarters.
The variation between accounts receivable this year and prior comparative periods relate entirely to mix of products, specific markets, individual customers and contractual terms.
Our business has a distinct annual cycle, and we routinely experienced expansion in working capital in the first half of the year and a reversal in the second half of the year.
Year-to-date, in 2020, working capital has increased by only $8 million as compared to $45 million in the same period of 2019.
This careful management of working capital is driving the improved cash generation from our operating performance.
In the first six months of 2020, we have generated $6 million from operations as compared to using $32 million in the first half of 2019.
Comparatively, that amounts to a positive change of $38 million period-over-period.
With regard to liquidity, at the end of the second quarter, availability under our credit line was $49 million, which compares to $31 million at the same point in 2019.
As we progress through 2020, we intend to continue to focus on both working capital and debt levels.
Indebtedness ended at $159 million at June 30, 2020, as compared to $165 million this time last year.
During the last year, in addition to paying down $6 million in debt, we have funded more than $35 million in investments, including fixed assets, product acquisitions and technology investments from the cash generated from operations.
These investments are focused on developing our businesses for the future.
During the first six months of 2020, we have continued our normal business cycle of expanding working capital in support of our globally situated businesses.
However, we are focusing very carefully on every dollar of working capital, and our usual annual cycle expansion has been much more muted than in previous comparable periods.
In summary, though our sales are down in comparison to prior year, our product mix has remained strong, our factories have performed well and gross margins have remained solid.
We have performed well at controlling underlying operating expenses which are down.
Finally, our interest expense is down.
From a balance sheet and cash perspective, we are doing very well managing working capital, and our debt is lower than this time last year, notwithstanding our investments in long-term growth of our businesses.
Finally, availability under the credit line has improved.
With that, I will hand back to Eric.
I would now like to focus on the key strategic initiatives that will define and enrich our enterprise.
First, we continue to expand our product portfolio through core growth.
That is taking existing products and developing new formulations and mixtures tailored for use on new crops for providing greater views of application.
As we've reported in the past, at any given time, we are launching some of these solutions while several are in the pipeline.
We expect that these core growth products will generate over $100 million in high-margin revenues per annum within the next five years.
Beyond core growth, Envance technologies continues to broaden market opportunities with their insect receptor targeting technology.
As we've reported Envance technology and products are being commercialized by Procter & Gamble for their emerging, safe and effective Zevo brand consumer pest control products.
We are pleased that the Chief Executive Officer of P&G, David Taylor, mentioned Zevo in his recent earnings conference call last Thursday.
We see this as another positive sign for Envance's innovation partnership with P&G.
In addition to Envance's superior technology for households, we believe that this patented nontoxic alternative to traditional pesticides will be successfully leveraged into numerous consumer, commercial and agricultural markets to meet the increasing demand for low-impact solutions.
The Envance R&D team has also developed a new technology a new application for their technology to kill weed pests.
The company's new herbicide platform delivers broad spectrum efficacy that is safe for people and pets.
We intend to pursue all potential market applications to fully exploit the superior safety, functional performance and environmental sustainability of these herbicide solutions.
Of course, the Capstone of our technology innovation is SIMPAS, and I'm pleased to announce that the launch of this game-changing prescription application technology has arrived.
As we've previously discussed, SIMPAS enables growers to precisely target multiple crop inputs solely to the locations where they are needed in order to realize higher yields, significant cost savings and sustainable environmental benefits.
Having successfully completed multiple field trials this past spring, we'll be ready to commercialize the SIMPAS system in the fourth quarter of this year.
This launch represents a milestone for American Vanguard, and this is how we see it playing out.
Our market campaign will proceed on several fronts.
First, a group of the industry's largest distributors and retailers, including Nutrien, Helena, Simplot, Harvest Land Co-Op and Asmus Farm supply, all of whom participated in our 2020 spring trial, will use their positive experiences to promote the benefits of SIMPAS to some of their most valued customers.
Second, the AMVAC sales and marketing team, in conjunction with BEC Ag marketing consultants will identify progressive growers in each region who have analyzed their soil health and crop protection needs and can significantly benefit from the multiple capabilities of SIMPAS.
Third, SIMPAS will enable us to provide economically beneficial product solutions to a much broader segment of the corn market than we've reached with our SmartBox corn worm products.
For over 20 years, our current SmartBox users have recognized the benefit of using our granular insecticide products, primarily to address corn rootworm pressures which tends to be greatest in the I-70, I-80 corridor, where most farmers also grow soybeans.
As we expand our SIMPAS product portfolio to include soybean inputs, we'll be able to offer these same growers both corn and soybean solutions through SIMPAS.
In addition, unlike corn rootworm, nematodes are present and economically damaging numbers throughout the entire corn build.
By offering counter through SIMPAS for Nematode control, farmers throughout the entire region can significantly improve the return on investment as compared to the current practice of having to apply counter at a uniform rate across the entire form.
Add in Southern soybeans and cotton akers and SIMPAS becomes a vehicle to help us increase product sales in all three of these major row crops throughout the United States.
As a bridge for SmartBox users who aren't yet ready to make the jump to simultaneous prescriptive application of multiple products, we'll be offering a lower cost system called SmartBox Plus by SIMPAS in Q4 of this year, featuring SIMPAS components such as meters, harnesses and an ISO-based prescriptive controller.
The SmartBox plus by SIMPAS will enable farmers to gain the benefits of prescriptively applying a single product like counter for a smaller capital investment.
Like SIMPAS, SmartBox Plus by SIMPAS supplies only what's prescribed precisely where it's needed.
That's good for the environment and for the farmers' bottom line.
Fourth, this year, we plan to introduce SIMPAS into the largest crop protection market in the world, Brazil, where we'll be conducting field development trials in the fourth quarter.
Having just completed a comprehensive study with our consulting firm, context of the Brazilian market, we believe there is robust opportunity for our technology in that region, particularly given the extremely large row crop farming operations in such states as and Mapitoba.
Our market approach in Brazil will vary from that of the U.S. as we will generate sales both through distribution and from direct sales to large growers.
We also expect that regional crop input manufacturers will market their own products through smart cartridges, thereby increasing demand for the SIMPAS platform.
Further, having Trimble as our global partner, will give us ready access for both sales and support in that country.
As an additional entree into Brazil, in 2021, we plan to introduce SmartBox Plus by SIMPAS as a way to prescriptively apply counter to control nematodes in soybeans, the largest row crop in Brazil.
This market access was one of the key reasons for our acquisition of Defense Agrovant earlier this year or early last year.
In preparing for our domestic Q4 SIMPAS launch, we are manufacturing smart cartridge containers to meet demand for all the SIMPAS applied solutions that will be sold in 2021.
The initial filling of these product cartridges will occur in our access Alabama manufacturing plant, and they will be refilled in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 and using Smartfill refilling equipment that we've positioned with select SIMPAS applied solution retailers.
We are also adding staff to provide sales, installation and support training to Trimble dealers who will begin SIMPAS sales activities in October of this year.
In addition, we are working under NDAs with multiple peer crop protection chemical manufacturers as they conduct application trials of their own products using SIMPAS equipment.
It is gratifying that industry leaders are recognizing SIMPAS as a technologically advanced application system.
From the outset, we have aspired to have other manufacturers package and sell their own proprietary products for use as SIMPAS applied solutions.
Access to products from multiple companies greatly increases the utility of SIMPAS equipment for farmers.
We'll be announcing some of these collaborations in the coming months.
On a related note, we have seen strong enthusiasm for our SIMPAS at plant seed treatment process.
Since seed treatments are generally liquid products, we are focused on expanding our liquid product portfolio offering.
Finally, we recently received a U.S. patent for our ultimate supply chain tracking software.
As crop inputs are applied via SIMPAS, Ultimas enables complete traceability of individual product containers through every step of the supply chain, from the factory to the farmer and to the geotag field location where the product is applied.
Ultimas makes it possible to know precisely when, where and how much product was applied to any given location in the field and to identify the product containers associated with the application.
With consumers and food marketers demanding greater transparency as to how food is produced, Ultimas answers those demands through automated and verifiable traceability of applied crop inputs.
So on closing, I'm encouraged by what we have accomplished over the course of the second quarter and the year.
There is in part to managing a business in the best of times, but the true test is delivering results in the hardest of times.
In response to the turmoil brought on by the pandemic, our team has shown discipline from top line to bottom line, selling higher-margin products, launching newer acquired product lines, improving factory use, driving down inventory and debt and generating cash.
All the while, we have continued investing in our future through self-funded technology innovation.
And from SmartBox insecticide applications to SIMPAS multiproduct prescriptive applications to automated and verifiable product application traceability through Ultimas, we are on the leading edge of precision ag.
And with that, we'll field any questions you may have.
","Despite an 8% decline in quarterly net sales to $105 million compared to $113 million last year, American Vanguard experienced a notable 25% increase in net income. This was driven by a focus on higher-margin products, improved factory performance, and reduced operating and interest expenses. The company's gross margin as a percentage of sales increased from 37% to 39%, and underlying operating expenses decreased by 10%. Additionally, American Vanguard has strengthened its balance sheet by reducing inventory by $18 million and improving cash from operations by $38 million year-to-date. The company remains optimistic about the future, with plans to commercialize its SIMPAS prescription application technology in Q4, expand its core product portfolio, and introduce new herbicide and insecticide solutions."
APH_q2_2021.txt,"This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.
I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we'll take some questions.
The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2.654 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.59 and $0.61, respectively.
Sales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Sequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 7% organically.
Orders for the quarter were a record $3.120 billion, which was up 58% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18:1.
Breaking down sales into our two segments.
The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year.
Our cable segment, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year.
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
GAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021.
GAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other noncash costs related to the MTS acquisition.
And the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes that in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter and therefore had no impact on the second quarter earnings.
Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by a strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially.
The year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year's quarter.
The sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company's average operating margin.
From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially.
In the cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter.
These lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions.
Given the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company's performance.
Our team's ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture.
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020.
On an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to $0.42 in the prior year period.
And adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.
Operating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter or 109% of adjusted net income.
And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income.
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days, respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million at an average price of approximately $67.
At the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion.
Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.
Second quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times.
On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS test and simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3 times.
As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS test and simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation.
And therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance.
In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operations and therefore are not included in our guidance.
And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far.
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter.
I'll then get into a discussion of the trends and our trends and progress across our served markets.
Our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Craig already mentioned, our sales grew a very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $2.654 billion.
On an organic basis, our sales increased by 22%, with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program.
We're very pleased to have booked record orders in the quarter of $3.120 billion and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18:1.
Despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, we were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20% in the quarter.
This was a 200 basis point increase from last year's levels and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew a very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61.
And just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution.
And finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million, respectively, in the second quarter.
I just can't emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world.
These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amid what is a very dynamic and challenging environment.
Very pleased that in the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services.
Unlimited is based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million.
This is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market, primarily with a particular focus on heavy vehicles.
The addition of Unlimited broadens our already strong position in value-add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications.
In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Now turning to our served markets.
I just would comment once again how pleased we are that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create real value for us.
We believe that ultimately, this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry.
Now turning to the military market.
The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter.
And as expected, sales grew a strong 45% from the COVID impacted prior year second quarter and were up 30% organically.
And this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12%, also very strong.
As we look into the third quarter, we remain -- we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels.
And we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market.
And that position is really based upon our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and now sensor products, together with our support of essentially all major military programs.
This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance in this important area.
The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter.
Sales grew by 7% versus prior year, really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions.
On an organic basis, sales were down by about 14% as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production.
Sequentially, however, our sales did increase by better than expected 19%.
And that's really from the benefit of the MTS acquisition as well as some organic progress.
As we look ahead, we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter, which we would typically see in commercial air.
And regardless of the ongoing difficult environment, our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those planes.
As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic, we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels.
The industrial market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance in the second quarter in industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically.
This growth was broad-based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, marine and energy generation segments, together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by a very strong 26% from the first quarter really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance.
Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter.
I can't say enough how proud I am of our team working in the industrial market.
And we've had a long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions.
And that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world who are accelerating their adoption of electronics.
The acquisition of Unlimited Services further bolsters our leading value-add capabilities in this important market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.
The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter.
And I can just say that sales were higher than our expectations, growing a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market.
In particular, we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles this quarter, which confirms again for us our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms.
Despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers due to the widely reported global supply chain issues, we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales, which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter.
No doubt about it, though, there continues to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that are arising within the automotive industry, and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world.
Accordingly, as we look toward the third quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales.
I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market.
They continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year's reduced production levels while expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing.
We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.
Turning to the mobile devices market.
That market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter.
Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in handsets and laptops more-than-offset growth in wearables.
I would just remind you that our last year's second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch-up from the COVID impacted first quarter of 2020, which made the comparison versus prior year, a little more challenging.
Sequentially, our sales fell by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations.
Looking to the third quarter, we now expect an approximately 25% increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products.
While mobile devices remains the most volatile of Amphenol's end markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term in this exciting market.
The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter.
Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically as sales to both OEMs and wireless service providers moderated.
On a sequential basis, however, our sales increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter.
And as we look toward the third quarter, we expect a further increase in sales as Mobile Networks customers ramp up their investments in next-generation networks.
Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next-generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world.
And as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.
The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter.
Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year's second quarter.
Our strength this quarter was driven, in particular, by robust sales to web service providers, which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to networking equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales grew a very strong 20% from the first quarter, which significantly outperformed our original expectations.
Looking now into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels.
We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market.
Our OEM and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power.
In turn, our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products.
And we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come.
Turning finally to the broadband market.
This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by 12% from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of Cablecon.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters.
And regardless of this more muted outlook, we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.
Now turning to our outlook.
And I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as constant exchange rates, in the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.62.
This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year.
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.
I had to say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long term and sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.
","Amphenol reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021, exceeding expectations and achieving record sales of $2.654 billion, up 34% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Earnings per share also rose significantly, with adjusted diluted earnings per share reaching $0.61, a 53% increase compared to the previous year. The company's strong performance was driven by broad-based growth across major end markets, including automotive, military, industrial, and broadband. Despite challenges related to the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, Amphenol maintained high adjusted operating margins of 20%, primarily due to effective cost management and operational leverage. The company also continues to execute a strategic acquisition program, most recently adding Unlimited Services to bolster its position in the industrial market. Looking ahead to the third quarter, Amphenol anticipates continued sales growth in the range of 14% to 16%, with adjusted diluted earnings per share projected between $0.60 and $0.62, despite expected moderation in certain end markets. The company remains optimistic about long-term growth opportunities and is committed to delivering sustainable value to shareholders."
PDM_q4_2021.txt,"We appreciate you joining us today for Piedmont's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
At this time, our president and chief executive officer, Brent Smith, will provide some opening comments and discuss our fourth quarter and annual results and accomplishments.
On the line with me is Eddie Guilbert, our executive vice president of finance and treasurer; George Wells, our chief operating officer; and Bobby Bowers, our chief financial officer; as well as other members of the senior management team.
Their tireless dedication continues to garner industry honors for operational excellence and sustainability, including our recognition as the 2021 ENERGY STAR partner of the year and achieving LEED status now on roughly half of the portfolio.
Today, I'm going to cover Piedmont's operational success and leasing momentum along with an update on capital allocation activities across our markets.
Focusing on the fourth quarter of 2021, our FFO per share was $0.51, in line with market consensus.
Portfolio operating metrics were solid with same-store NOI on a cash basis increasing 5.8%.
We leased approximately 400,000 square feet, generated a 3% increase in second-generation cash rents and executed an average lease term of six and a half years, illustrating the longer-term view taken by most of our customers.
Most notably, about half of the fourth quarter's leasing was related to new tenants, making this the second consecutive quarter Piedmont has achieved pre-pandemic levels of new leasing.
Overall, leasing activity remained robust and well dispersed across the portfolio with over 40 leases and amendments executed during the fourth quarter.
And while the omicron variant had a modestly negative impact on building utilization during December and January, the leasing pipeline has not dissipated and we expect the momentum from the second half of 2021 to continue.
Today, our leasing pipeline stands at over 500,000 square feet of negotiations.
And we're trading LOIs on an additional 1 million square feet, which positions Piedmont for space absorption in 2022 and with only about 1 million square feet of existing leases expiring or about 6% of the portfolio.
Boston, Dallas and Atlanta remain our most active leasing markets, albeit for different reasons.
The Boston market continues to exhibit strong fundamentals led by business migration to the suburbs and reduced competitive Class A office stock as the insatiable demand from life science users continues to drive office to lab conversions.
For example, during the past year in our Burlington submarket, three competitive Class A buildings comprising over 400,000 square feet have been repurposed to labs, helping to push net effective rents for office space to pre-pandemic levels.
And in Dallas and Atlanta, our two largest markets, we continue to see an increasing number of corporate relocations, resulting in meaningful job growth.
As an example, during the fourth quarter, we signed a 55,000 square foot lease at our Connection Drive property in Dallas to serve as the new corporate headquarters of an undisclosed Fortune 500 company.
And in that same market during the second quarter, we signed a 44,000 square foot lease to serve as the corporate headquarters for a large national beverage distributor.
In both these markets, rents at our properties are now above pre-pandemic levels.
However, net effective rents are approximately 2% to 5% lower.
I would note a customer flight to quality is well underway, which is driving wider rent disparities between place-making versus commodity office product.
For example, JLL Research noted that 84% of Atlanta leasing activity in the fourth quarter was in Class A or trophy product.
Orlando also continues to perform well with leasing and tour activity across all five of our downtown properties at pre-pandemic levels.
The downtown submarket continues to experience population inflows particularly for the millennial and Gen Z cohorts driven by a highly walkable environment with expanding retail, food and beverage options, along with entertainment amenities surrounding the University of Central Florida's Creative Village campus, Amway Center Arena and Camping World Stadium, along with a uniquely urban Lake Eola.
In Orlando, net effective rents are still trailing pre-pandemic levels by about 5% as a result of increased concessions.
Finally, Minneapolis, the districts in Washington, D.C. and New York City, all experiencing increasing tour activity.
However, leasing velocity and tenant demand still lag our Sunbelt markets.
I would add, we are fortunate to have limited vacancy and near-term lease expirations at our 60 Broad Street property in Lower Manhattan and virtually no expirations at our Washington, D.C. properties for more than two years.
Leasing across all our core markets contributed to the fourth quarter's totals.
And our customer CEO and HR dialogue continues to show our portfolio is positioned to gain market share.
Users of office space are undertaking a flight to quality that focuses on new or newly renovated office buildings with unique environments and a vast set of amenities, owned and operated by responsive, sustainability-minded service-oriented landlords.
And because of these demand drivers, Piedmont's portfolio is well positioned, supported by a concentration of newly renovated, well amenitized buildings located near housing communities and highly regarded education systems with easy accessibility to major highway thoroughfares and airports.
But today's tenants are not only focused solely on location and neighboring amenities.
The physical attributes of a building have never been more important.
The building's indoor air and light, HVAC, fresh air intake, elevator capacity and outdoor collaboration space are all critical.
In addition to high-quality building in a vibrant environment, customers are demanding a higher-quality landlord as well.
And by that, we mean an attentive operator that focuses on sustainability initiatives and which has the capital base and scale to provide tenant offerings and engagement.
Office space is no longer just a real estate product.
Taking a look back at the operational highlights for the 2021 fiscal year.
Piedmont leased almost 2.3 million square feet, which was in line with our average pre-COVID annual leasing levels.
In addition, the increase in second-generation cash rents was seven and a half percent, which helped increase same-store cash NOI for the year by almost 7%.
And finally, our tenant retention ratio was in line with prior years at approximately 70%.
Recovery in leasing activity bolsters our optimism for the rebound of the office sector, and particularly for landlords such as ourselves who offer high-quality, modernized sustainability-focused amenity-rich environments.
Looking ahead, approximately 750,000 square feet of tenant leasing has yet to commence as of this year-end or is in some form of abatement.
This backlog creates organic growth opportunities going into 2022 associated with approximately $26 million in future annualized cash rents.
In addition, approximately 60% of the portfolio's vacancy and 85% of 2022's lease expirations resided in our Sunbelt properties, where we are experiencing the greatest level of leasing velocity.
A schedule of the larger upcoming lease commencements and abatements is included in our supplemental financial information, which was filed last night.
Pivoting now to capital allocation activities.
Despite the disruption from the pandemic and more recently, the omicron variant, the office investment sales market has continued to unthaw.
We are currently in discussions on a pipeline of over $1 billion of high-quality assets primarily for properties in our Sunbelt markets.
Furthermore, we are encouraged to hear of several targeted buildings that will be coming to market in the first half of 2022.
Our principal and broker dialogue suggests insurance companies, pension funds and other private market participants are planning to reduce their office sector exposure in the near term in currently well-leased Sunbelt office with more than seven years of weighted average lease term is among the most liquid type of property in the asset class.
The increase in transactional activity is encouraging, given Piedmont's strategy to recycle capital strategically as an additional driver for our earnings growth.
And finally, I would note that cap rates remain steady for high-quality assets with limited lease rollover and particularly those that are highly amenitized and that can compete with new construction.
While the investment sales market has improved, construction starts have slowed dramatically due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic, a positive for the continued office market recovery.
With supply chain constraints, the construction of new product will now take two and a half to three years to be delivered.
In addition, new construction costs have escalated by 15% to 20% versus pre-pandemic pricing driven by an increase in both raw materials and labor.
In this capital environment, Piedmont continues to focus on our redevelopment opportunities where costs and time lines can be more easily managed.
In 2021, we completed over $50 million of incremental investment in our properties, upgrading assets to remain best-in-class within their respective submarkets.
That said, we continue to have dialogue with a number of clients regarding pre-leasing for ground-up development.
Focusing on Piedmont's investment activities.
During the quarter, we expanded our Atlanta market footprint with the acquisition of 999 Peachtree Street.
And subsequent to quarter end, I'm pleased that we closed on the disposition of a Raytheon asset as well as accelerated our plan to exit from the Chicago market.
As you all know, the 999 acquisition marks our entry into Midtown Atlanta submarket.
The iconic Class A LEED-Platinum 28-story building, a 622,000 square feet with 77% leased at acquisition.
We purchased it for $360 a square foot, which we estimate is over 40% below replacement cost.
We're working with Gensler, a tenant at the building to complete the redesign of 999s arrival experience in public spaces, including a modernized and expanded lobby, energized outdoor space and other enhanced amenities, which will complete over the next 12 to 18 months, and we'll revitalize this asset in a fraction of the time and cost of new construction.
With a 10-foot glass window line across 70% of the facade this asset will effectively compete against new construction at a fraction of the cost with an expected all-in basis in the low $400 per square foot versus new product costing in excess of $650 per square foot, creating substantial pricing leverage for our building when compared to that new development.
The $224 million acquisition of 999 is being funded through multiple dispositions.
Immediately after quarter end, the disposition of 225 and 235 presidential Way in Boston closed in a reverse 1031 exchange for $129 million or a mid-5s cap rate.
Also subsequent to quarter end, we negotiated an agreement to sell and have closed on Two Pierce Place, our last remaining asset in the Chicago area, and we'd anticipate more non-core asset proceeds in the first half of 2022.
The acquisition of 999 Peachtree Street during the fourth quarter as well as the completion of two non-core dispositions just after the quarter end, now makes Atlanta our largest market based on annualized lease revenue.
Adjusting our lease percentage for the disposition transactions our pro forma lease percentage as of December 31 would have been 87%.
Additionally, approximately 63% of our annualized lease revenue is now generated from our Sunbelt properties and our goal is to have 70% to 75% of our ARR generated by our Sunbelt markets before the end of 2023.
We believe a goal that's attainable given the investment in sales market activity we see today.
Myself and the team were extremely grateful to be able to share some of our most recent redevelopment projects.
Looking back on 2021, core FFO for the year was $1.97 per diluted share, a 4% increase over 2020 and in excess of the upper end of our original guidance range for the year.
This growth in core FFO overcame an approximately 1% reduction in our overall lease percentage on a year-over-year basis.
The decrease in occupancy was driven by several factors: Reduced leasing activity during 2020 in the first half of 2021 as a result of the pandemic, a number of sizable lease expirations at recently acquired properties in Atlanta and Dallas that were underwritten as part of their respective acquisitions and the purchase of the 77% leased 999 Peachtree Street property.
After incorporating the just completed disposition activity in January of 2022, our pro forma lease percentage as of December 31 would have been 87%.
We reported $0.51 per diluted share of core FFO for the quarter.
That's an 11% increase over the fourth quarter of 2020.
This increase is primarily due to accretive recycling activity and rising rental rates.
Our core FFO achievement during the fourth quarter also reflects the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $17.76 per share during the quarter, leaving approximately $150 million in board authorized capacity under our share repurchase program.
Now, core FFO, as you know, excludes gains, losses, impairments on real estate as well as excluding depreciation and amortization.
And I do want to discuss this real estate activity during the fourth quarter of 2021.
While we had originally intended to lease up Two Pierce Place before disposition, we received an unsolicited offer to purchase the asset during the fourth quarter.
Given the fact that we have no other Chicago holdings, we made the decision to accept the offer if the purchase could be negotiated and closed quickly thereafter.
As is often the case, gap typically just dictates early recognition of potential losses and the decision to shorten the hold period for this asset did result in the recognition of a $41 million impairment charge that is included in our fourth quarter results of operations.
On the flip side, the sale of 225, 235 presidential Way will result in the recognition of an estimated $50 million gain during the first quarter of 2022 when the sell closed.
AFFO generated during the fourth quarter was approximately $39 million, which is well above our current $26 million quarterly dividend level.
Our board has indicated that given our cash NOI growth over the last few years, the fact that we're approaching the conclusion of the large construction restacking project for the State of New York at 60 Broad, and the time since our last dividend increase, they will be reviewing our dividend payout amount during 2022.
Turning to the balance sheet.
I expect more attention will be focused now on corporate financial positions given the rising interest rate environment, including the amount of floating rate debt, upcoming maturities and overall leverage.
Our annual debt -- net debt to core EBITDA ratio as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 was 5.7 times and we reported $210 million of unused capacity on our line of credit.
Taking into consideration the completed disposition activity occurring right after year-end, with the net sales proceeds received in January, our current available capacity on our $500 million line of credit is approximately $320 million, with an approximate $120 million more expected later this quarter from the payoff of a note receivable.
Adjusting for the application of proceeds from the two closed January sales, our pro forma debt to gross asset ratio at year-end would have been approximately 35%.
We have no secured debt currently on our books and we have no scheduled debt maturities in 2022 other than our revolver, which we currently intend to renew long term later this year rather than exercise the line's short-term extension options.
Finally, we're introducing 2022 annual financial guidance for core FFO in the range of $1.97 to $2.07 per diluted share.
This guidance assumes a gradual increase in physical utilization of our buildings by our tenants over the course of the year, to a level near pre-COVID utilization by the end of the calendar year.
It also assumes a neutral amount of asset recycling during the year with about $350 million to $450 million each of acquisitions and additional dispositions.
This net neutral activity excludes the recently completed sales of the presidential Way assets and Two Pierce Place property that were used to fund the 999 Peachtree Street acquisition.
We will provide revised guidance as each significant acquisition or disposition is completed this year.
The guidance assumes general and administrative expenses in the range of $29 million to $31 million for the year.
Our same-store cash NOI growth is expected to be flat for the year with a number of abatements occurring during 2022 due to the lease renewals and newly commencing leases such as 160,000 square foot renewal at 1155 Perimeter Center West in Atlanta, and a 56,000 square foot lease at 400 Virginia in Washington, D.C. As well as downtimes between leases associated with new tenant build-outs, such as a 67,000 square-foot lease at 5 and 15 Wayside in Boston and a 44,000 square foot lease at One Lincoln in Dallas.
Accrual-based store NOI is expected to grow from 1% to 3% during the year.
I will remind you that these estimates will ultimately be dependent upon the transactional activity achieved during the year since such properties will be excluded at year-end, from the same-store two-year comparisons.
Likewise, our lease percentage is expected to grow to approximately 88%.
But again, this estimate is subject to the lease percentages of the properties involved was $350 million to $450 million of potential recycling transactions completed during the year.
Our forecast also assumes there will be three to four interest rate hikes during 2022 that will impact interest expense negatively versus recent prior years.
And finally, we are assuming a dividend adjustment around midyear, and it is not expected to impact our overall financial results.
With that, I'll now ask our conference call operator to provide our listeners with instructions on how they can submit their questions.
","Piedmont reported in-line fourth-quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.51. Portfolio metrics remained solid, with a 5.8% increase in same-store NOI on a cash basis and a 3% increase in second-generation cash rents. Leasing activity was robust, with 400,000 square feet leased and half of the fourth quarter's leasing related to new tenants. The leasing pipeline stands at over 500,000 square feet, positioning Piedmont for space absorption in 2022. Boston, Dallas, and Atlanta remain Piedmont's most active leasing markets. Net effective rents are approximately 2%-5% lower than pre-pandemic levels, but a flight to quality is underway, leading to wider rent disparities. The company's core FFO for 2021 was $1.97 per diluted share, a 4% increase over 2020. The office investment sales market is gradually recovering, with Piedmont discussing a pipeline of over $1 billion of high-quality assets. Cap rates remain steady for high-quality assets. Construction starts have slowed due to the pandemic, with a 15%-20% increase in new construction costs. Piedmont acquired 999 Peachtree Street in Atlanta, marking its entry into the Midtown Atlanta submarket. The company also completed two non-core asset disposals and plans for more in 2022. Piedmont's pro forma lease percentage as of December 31 would have been 87%, with a goal of 70%-75% of annualized lease revenue generated by Sunbelt markets by the end of 2023. The company is also introducing 2022 annual financial guidance for core FFO in the range of $1.97 to $2.07 per diluted share, assuming gradual physical utilization of buildings, neutral asset recycling, and a dividend adjustment around midyear."
M_q3_2021.txt,"With me on the call are Jeff Gennette, our Chairman and CEO; and Adrian Mitchell, our CFO.
A detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In discussing the results of our operations, we will be providing certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Our Company delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations on both top and bottom lines, outperforming 2020 and notably 2019.
With strong cash generation year-to-date, we were able to execute on our capital allocation priorities including returning capital to shareholders.
Our business has demonstrated resilience and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on Polaris strategy.
And as a result, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2021 guidance.
Our '21 results demonstrate the progress we've made with our Polaris strategy operating in a better economic environment as well as the strength of our digitally led omnichannel model.
We are poised for sustainable and profitable growth and we'll continue to build and invest in our retail ecosystem to both maximize and accelerate our opportunities.
Today, I'm pleased to announce that we are making a significant investment to launch a curated digital marketplace platform to enhance the existing Macy's, Inc. business fuel customer acquisition and drive growth across all of our channels.
We will partner with the enterprise marketplace technology company, miracle to build the platform.
Through this new digital marketplace platform which we'll launch in the second half of 2022, we will connect carefully selected third-party sellers with our customers in a scalable way and provide even greater breadth of assortment of exciting products to deliver on our promise of style and curation.
Now, I'll provide some highlights from the third quarter.
Comparable, owned plus licensed sales increased 8.7%, an improvement in trend from the 5.9% increase we saw in Q2, even after adjusting for changes in our marketing calendar.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.23, up significantly from Q3 2019 and adjusted EBITDA was more than 2 times better than 2019.
Gross margin for the quarter improved by approximately 100 basis points driven by stronger regular price selling, fewer markdowns due to leaner inventories and a number of pricing and promotion initiatives and offset by increased delivery expenses.
Gross margins and inventory are benefiting from the outstanding work that our supply chain teams have done in navigating the recent disruptions.
When they first begin the fourth quarter of 2020, our teams activated plans to mitigate bottlenecks and since then stayed agile and flexible, leveraging our strong networks and relationships with international carriers and variants and diversifying how we move product both up and downstream.
Significantly, as a result, we don't expect to be materially impacted by supply chain issues during the critical holiday shopping season.
Total Company AUR was up more than 12% across our three nameplates.
SG&A dollars were significantly lower driven by a combination of ongoing expense discipline and unfilled open positions.
Looking at each of our nameplates, comparable sales for Macy's brand were up 8.4% on an owned plus licensed basis which represents a nearly 1 point improvement versus last quarter, when you take into consideration, the friends and family marketing shift.
Macy's brand full price sell-through improved 610 basis points while full price AURs increased by 6.9% driven by high demand and our gross margin initiatives.
Our Bloomingdale's business performed well with comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis up 11.2%, which was in line with the second quarter.
Results were driven by strong sales of luxury handbags, fine jewelry, home, men's shoes in contemporary apparel and both stores and bloomingdales.com outperformed 2019.
Bluemercury continues to recover outperforming versus 2020, but was down 2.2% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
We see strong sales performance of private brands, home fragrance and treatment.
Turning to the health of our customer base, we brought in 4.4 million new customers into the Macy's brand, a 28% increase compared to 2019.
Approximately 30% of these new customers were dormant customers over the last 12 months who have now reengaged.
In addition to growth in new customers, customer loyalty has also increased.
Star Rewards program numbers now make up nearly 70% of the total Macy's brand comparable owned plus-licensed sales, up approximately 10 percentage points compared to 2019.
During the quarter, we saw Platinum, Gold and Silver customers reengage with average customer spend in these tiers up 16% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Bronze members who represent our youngest and most diverse loyalty tier continued to grow with the addition of 2.3 million members during the quarter and we're seeing average spend per customer increased 13%.
Bronze is one of our best customer acquisition vehicles with approximately 35% of members under the age of 40% and 57% ethnically diverse.
Our Star Rewards Loyalty customers have a more personalized and productive shopping experience with the most relevant offer presented to them, right down to the particular homepage they see.
This is leading to increased conversion, higher revenue per visit and a decreased rate of customers leading the site and through targeted personalization and pricing science, we've been able to reduce the number of raw based promotional days and increase AURs.
Having a strong integrated retail ecosystem that provides a seamless shopping journey enables us to successfully attract and retain our most productive omnichannel customers.
The growth of our omnichannel ecosystem is powered by our thriving online business, relevant full line brick and mortar stores and growing off-mall format stores, all soon to be further accelerated by the new digital marketplace platform.
Our data validates that in markets where we have a physical presence, our online business is stronger.
The interplay between traditional and physical assets is more important than ever and we are focused on establishing an appropriate footprint in markets that drive our sustainable and profitable omnichannel growth.
Turning to merchandising which we think about in three buckets.
First, our products and categories were strong during the height of the pandemic such as fragrance, watches, jewelry, sleepwear and home continue to perform well during the third quarter.
Second, occasion based categories such as dresses and men's tailored and luggage are continuing to see renewed interest from our customers.
And third, our emerging categories and new brands are expected to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the future.
These complement our core categories, while satisfying the customer shopping journey and we're seeing encouraging results.
To give you an example, since bringing the Toys ""R"" Us business to macys.com in August, our toys sales have more than doubled in stores and online compared to 2019 and we continue to expand on our assortment in these emerging categories.
During the quarter, we had another important new brand partner, Fanatics which offers our customers, the largest selection of licensed sports products and increases our fan apparel offering 20 fold.
This expanded assortment drove a 22% AUR increase in sports apparel and head gear compared to 2019.
Using data and analytics, we continue to grow key brand partnerships with more vendors looking to us for expanded relationships.
One element of this is the B2B monetization of our advertising partnerships that we realized through our in-house media agency Macy's media network which continues to generate solid results and recently expanded the scope to include Bloomingdale's.
We see a lot of potential to further strengthen our relationships with vendor partners and cultivating greater customer engagement.
Overall through Polaris, we laid a solid foundation for digital growth and we're seeing that growth come to fruition.
We are now able to focus on additional strategic investments to refresh the digital experiences to create more experiential customer engagements, enhance our stores and further empower our colleagues who drive to the success of our business on every level.
Our important digital initiatives during the quarter included a refresh of Macy's mobile app, the launch of live shopping at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's and a fragrance finder.
We also rolled out our 3D Room Planning Expansion, added PayPal and Venmo to in-store and online payments and launched a sustainability product segment.
As a result of these and other investments digital conversion for the quarter was 4.25%, up 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Turning from digital to stores, we also continue to invest in our brick and mortar business and are seeing ongoing trend improvement in store conversion.
During the quarter, sales in our non-downtown locations continue to sequentially improve.
But due to the slow return of international tourism and office workers, our downtown doors continue to significantly lag our other doors versus 2019.
A good example of stores recovery is our backstage store within store format with sales up 24 percentage points compared to the full-line stores.
Backstage store customers are more diverse with 56% of customers ethnically diverse and have a higher spend.
Across our ecosystem, everything we do starts with and is driven by our colleagues.
They are our most significant contributors to our success and we are pleased with the strength of our performance this year has made it possible for us to double down on our investment in talent.
Last week we announced the plan to launch a best-in-class benefit program to give our colleagues access to debt free education.
We are also raising our minimum wage rate to $15 an hour which will be in effect nationally by May of 2022.
This will increase our average total pay for hourly colleagues to about $20 an hour.
Our workplace culture and colleague engagement have never been stronger and we see it as a meaningful competitive advantage in this tight labor market.
Adrian will now summarize the financial details before I make brief closing remarks.
As Jeff shared, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and momentum of our digitally led omnichannel Polaris strategy.
Top line sales continue to grow.
Gross margin continue to expand.
SG&A continue to gain leverage.
And as a result, we delivered EBITDA and earnings per share far above our expectations.
Additionally, we continue to successfully execute on our capital allocation priorities aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders.
Our strong results combined with our continued confidence as we move into the holiday season are leading up to narrow and waiting for our full year of 2021 guidance, which I will expand upon in a few moments.
Now, as I review each quarter and summarizing our results I'll focus on the metrics that are most important to value creation, sales, gross margin, inventory productivity, expense management and capital allocation.
First, for the second quarter in a row, we have generated top line sales above 2019 levels.
In the quarter, net sales increased by $267 million or 5.2% to $5.4 billion while we posted comparable owned plus licensed sales of 8.7%.
Keep in mind that compared to 2019, October benefited from the pull forward of some sales from the fourth quarter into the third quarter.
The early start of our friends and family sale in late October contributed to this adding about 200 basis points to owned plus licensed sales comp.
Additionally, holiday shopping began earlier as it did last year, but we won't know the full extent of the pull forward until we get further into the season.
Nevertheless, even when adjusted for friends and family, we produced solid sales growth and continued to expand our trend of sequential improvement.
Now, I want to take a moment to highlight the progress we've made as a true omnichannel retailer as we have become increasingly focused on the sustainability of omnichannel sales growth.
The true performance and potential of our omnichannel performance is hidden when sales outcomes are viewed as digital results versus brick and mortar results.
Recall that Jeff said, we see stronger digital sales in those markets where we have physical stores and we certainly saw this to be the case in the third quarter.
Moreover, while digital sales continue to grow and store sales trends continue to improve, notably more than 70% of our omnichannel market saw overall sales growth over and above 2019 levels which represented approximately 85% of Macy's brand comparable owned-plus licensed sales.
So digital isn't merely benefiting from a shift of sales from stores.
It is actually growing beyond that.
Within these markets, here is an added potential to expand our market share further with the addition of new off-mall locations.
During the quarter, we opened five new locations in the Washington DC, Dallas and Atlanta markets.
We've seen a strong sales response and solid net promoter scores from customers well above our current expectations.
We are very encouraged by the initial results and we now see a clear path to new store off-mall growth.
So, through a combination of difficult stores and the best malls, the most productive off-mall locations and a best in class e-commerce platform, our sales growth is accelerating as we meet customers whenever, wherever and however they choose to shop.
In addition, an omnichannel view has also highlighted the need for us to take a second look at the timing of when we close approximately 60 remaining stores we previously planned to close this part of Polaris.
Those markets that are performing best in aggregate include many of the stores previously slated for closure.
With this in mind, we are considering the fallen points as we approach the optimization of our store portfolio.
First, as it relates to underperforming mall-based stores, the lane [Phonetic] closure of certain stores allows us to maintain a physical presence in the market which is critical to our topline growth.
Second, these stores are cash flow positive and support the funding of investment needed to reposition our store portfolio over time.
And lastly, we're adapting our learning in the smaller off-mall formats to more quickly introduce these concepts to more markets with plans to open more of these stores next year.
Scaling our off-mall formats will allow us to reposition our brick and mortar assets within markets to more effectively support omnichannel sales growth.
As a result, we expect to announce about 10 closures in January with more details on the remaining stores to come later in 2022.
Moving on to gross margin.
We saw another quarter of rate expansion to 41%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019.
We continue to generate very healthy merchandise margin which improved by 270 basis points to 45.3%.
The primary drivers were the consistent improvement we maintain in lower markdown and inventory productivity, which I'll expand upon shortly.
Markdown levels were the result of a combination of lower inventory levels and further scaling of pricing science including location level pricing and POS pricing work.
As Jeff noted, these efforts drove higher full price sell-throughs and full price AURs compared to 2019.
We continue to roll out additional initiatives including a new promotional effectiveness tool, given our teams access to advanced analytics to better understand the profitability of prior promotional events.
The improvement in merchandise margin was offset by a rise in delivery expense due to increased digital penetration.
Delivery expense was 4.2% of net sales, 170 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2019.
With regards to inventory productivity, inventory levels were down 15.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, a product of ongoing market dynamics and our own Polaris initiatives.
Our sales to stock ratio remains healthy and the improved use of data science continues to enhance our inventory management practices from order placements, all the way to customer sales.
Inventory churn for the trailing 12 months improved by nearly 18%, while for the trailing six month, inventory churn improved by approximately 22%.
Additionally, given the macro challenges facing the retail industry, we're staying ahead by making further shift in our inventory management practices and implementing a number of initiatives.
As we noted on our last call, we do not anticipate improvements to many of the macro supply chain constraints until mid to late 2022.
Moving on, we again exercised strong expense management discipline, our net value creation metric.
SG&A expenses of $2 billion improved by about 10% or $229 million from the third quarter of 2019 levels.
As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses were 36.3%, a significant improvement of 630 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019 as we continue to benefit from permanent cost savings and reduced cost due to elevated job openings.
The impact of the labor shortages are transitory and we expect them to moderate going into the next quarter as well as into the next year.
Improved bad debt levels driven by strong customer credit health continued to contribute to the growth of credit card revenues to $213 million, up $30 million from the third quarter 2019 and ahead of what we expected.
Credit card revenues were also ahead as a percent of net sales increasing by 40 basis points to 3.9% and trending ahead of our prior annual guidance.
As it relates to our credit card program, we are close to finalizing our decision on a partner and expect to announce the decision in the upcoming weeks.
As a digitally led retailer, we must have a partner with strong digital capabilities today and a strong innovation pipeline with the prospect to further expand that pipeline in the future.
Our loyalty and personalization initiatives serve as key growth levers in our ability to obtain and retain more customers to drive omnichannel sales growth.
That said, over the next few years, we expect credit card revenue levels will be slightly lower as a percent of sales in the 3% or so that we have historically experienced.
Given our strong performance across these areas as well as the $50 million of asset sale gains recognized during the third quarter, we generated positive adjusted EBITDA of $765 million.
Notably, adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.1% exceeded the margin in the third quarter of 2019 by 780 basis points on the strength of expense management discipline and gross margin expansion.
After accounting for interest and taxes, collectively, these results helped to generate quarterly adjusted net income of $386 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.23 versus $21 million and $0.07 respectively in 2019.
Our final value creator is capital allocation and our meaningful free cash flow generation of $574 million year-to-date has served us well in this regard.
In the third quarter, we repaid approximately $1.6 billion of debt early, which brings our leverage ratio well under our year end target.
And while we drew on our credit facility to support the build of seasonal merchandise during the quarter we did so at a much lower interest rate than that of the debt we retired.
Going forward, we expect to use the facility periodically based on the needs of the business.
Now, we successfully regained an investment grade profile well ahead of schedule.
We will continue to pay down debt as debt matures with an aim to achieve a leverage ratio below 2 times in the upcoming years.
Additionally, we paid $46 million in cash dividends and announced our fourth quarter dividend earlier this month.
And we repurchased 13 million shares for more than 4% of total shares outstanding for a total share buyback of $300 million.
With $200 million of authorization remaining, we're trying to look for further opportunities to repurchase shares.
These actions underscore our confidence in our business and our commitment to our capital allocation priorities that create shareholder value in the near term and the long-term.
Turning to our outlook.
As mentioned, we are narrowing and raising our full year guidance.
We have strong momentum entering the fourth quarter, but the headwinds that we noted on the last quarter's call remain in place, the supply chain concerns, the tight labor market, elevated levels of holiday shipping surcharges and potential unforeseen impacts of COVID variants.
The low end of our guidance considers the impact of these headwinds.
But here are some of the highlights.
For the full year, we now expect net sales to be between $24.1 billion and $24.3 billion, which at the midpoint of the range is an increase of over $400 million from our prior guidance.
We now increased our adjusted earnings per share range to $4.57 to $4.76 from $3.41 to $3.75, an increase of more than a $1 compared to our prior guidance.
Now for the fourth quarter.
Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis versus 2019 are expected to increase between 2% and 4%.
This includes an approximately 125 basis point adverse impact due to the shift of the friends and family promotional event from the fourth quarter into the third quarter as compared to 2019.
Gross margin rate expectations are between 100 basis points and 150 basis points lower than 2019.
SG&A expense as a percent of sales is expected to improve by approximately 75 basis points compared to 2019 and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between a $1.67 and $1.87 events excluding the impact of any additional share repurchases other than those already executed in the third quarter.
Our progress to date combined with our Polaris initiatives already underway put us well on the path to profitable and sustainable sales growth.
As such, we have increased clarity on our business outlook over the next few years.
In 2022, we see several incremental tailwinds for our business beyond those from our Polaris initiatives.
The consumer mix is healthy, and we expect the strong demand to continue, particularly as people return to work.
As borders open, we anticipate an uptick in tourism, although we don't yet see tourism returning back to 2019 levels in 2022.
At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on headwinds.
As mentioned, we are actively managing supply chain disruptions with success.
We're continuing to navigate the labor shortages and competition for talent by investing in our current and future colleagues.
We are also focused on mitigating inflationary pressures on our customers by leveraging our pricing science while continuing to provide our customers with clear value.
In summary, our team is committed to accelerating and sustaining top and bottom line growth through the continued successful execution of our digitally led omnichannel Polaris strategy, which in turn will strengthen the health of our balance sheet and deliver strong returns to our shareholders.
Next quarter, we look forward to sharing with you further detail on our guidance for 2022 and our outlook for 2023 and beyond.
So in summary, we remain focused on executing our Polaris strategy to position Macy's Inc. for sustainable and profitable growth.
We regularly review the structure of our business and our strategy and are open to all options that are likely to create long-term shareholder value.
This past year, we conducted an analysis of our e-commerce and brick and mortar operations evaluating how each contribute to the value of the Company as well as how each benefits from being integrated and working together.
In collaboration with our Board and with assistance from our advisors, we look at multiple business models that would create long-term shareholder value, while always respecting the omnichannel behavior of the customer.
This work supported our digitally led omnichannel Polaris strategy that we are successfully executing.
That said, we also recognize the significant value of the market at this time in a pure e-commerce businesses.
And as we look at the landscape today, we are undertaking additional analysis that could help inform our long-term strategy to further unlock value for Macy's Inc. To help in these efforts, we have recently engaged AlixPartners to work with our Board and financial advisors.
It is too early to tell what the result of this additional analysis will be, but we plan to update everyone after the work is complete.
I am confident that we have a lot more opportunity ahead.
Our colleagues focus on both strengthening the fundamentals of our business and driving innovation, gives me great confidence that a bolder and brighter future for Macy's, Inc. lies ahead.
And operator, please begin the Q&A.
","Macy's Inc. reported a strong Q3, exceeding expectations with revenue growth of 5.2% to $5.4 billion and comparable sales increase of 8.7%. Digital conversion rose 14% year-over-year. The company continued to optimize its store portfolio, closing underperforming locations while investing in off-mall stores and smaller formats. Gross margin expanded by 100 basis points, driven by lower markdowns and increased full-price selling. Inventory levels were down 15.4% compared to Q3 2019. SG&A expenses improved by approximately 10%, leveraging expense discipline and unfilled open positions. The company generated positive adjusted EBITDA of $765 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.23. Macy's is raising and narrowing its full-year 2021 guidance, projecting net sales between $24.1 billion and $24.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $4.57 and $4.76. The company remains confident in its digitally led omnichannel Polaris strategy and is exploring additional options to create long-term shareholder value."
DXC_q1_2022.txt,"I'm pleased that you're joining us for DXC Technology's first-quarter 2022 earnings call.
Our speakers on the call today will be Mike Salvino, our president and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our executive vice president and CFO.
In accordance with SEC rules, we provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most comparable GAAP measures.
A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
Today's agenda will begin with a quick update on our solid Q1 performance, which continues to show that revenue, adjusted EBIT margin, book-to-bill and non-GAAP earnings per share all have a positive trajectory compared to past quarters.
During our Investor Day in June, we gave you additional insights into the steps of our transformation journey, and those steps are: inspire and take care of our colleagues, focus on our customers, optimize costs, seize the market and build a strong financial foundation.
I will give updates on each step, and then hand the call over to Ken to share our Q1 financial results, guidance and more details on how we are building a strong financial foundation.
Regarding our Q1 performance, our revenues were $4.14 billion, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 8%.
This represents the fourth straight quarter of both revenue stabilization and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q2.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.12.
This is the fifth straight quarter that we delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill, and we expect our success of winning in the market to continue in Q2.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 in the quarter, which is up 300%, as compared to $0.21 that we delivered in Q1 of FY '21.
The positive trajectory of all four of these numbers gives us confidence that our playbook is working.
As a refresher, our playbook has three phases.
The stabilization phase was completed in FY '21.
This phase enabled us to make great progress with our colleagues, customers, on revenue, margin, book-to-bill and reducing our debt.
We are now focused on the foundation phase.
This phase focuses on the steps that will allow us to deliver growth.
The goals of this phase are: first, continue to increase our employee engagement, all while we attract and retain highly talented colleagues; second, stabilize year-on-year organic revenue; third, expand adjusted EBIT margins; fourth, consistently deliver a book-to-bill number of 1.0 or greater, with a nice mix of new work and renewals; and finally, under Ken's leadership, deliver a financial foundation that increases discipline and improves our cash flow and earnings power.
Now I will discuss the good progress we are making on each step of our transformation journey, beginning with inspire and take care of our colleagues.
We are executing a people-first strategy.
Attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth.
Our refreshed leadership team has deep industry experience and is delivering.
Brenda, who is our chief marketing officer, is our newest addition.
Brenda is a strategic results-oriented leader who brings deep marketing experience to DXC.
75% of our leadership team is now new to DXC and bringing in talent based on their personal credibility as talent follows talent.
What the team is finding is that the new DXC story is resonating in the market, and new-hires are wanting to join DXC because they see the opportunity to progress their careers with a company that's on the right trajectory.
We mentioned during our investor call that nearly 50% of our vice presidents across the company are new to DXC within the last 22 months.
Also, we are investing in our people.
This quarter, we rewarded high performance by paying annual bonuses that benefited roughly 45,000 of our colleagues.
In Q2, we are planning merit increases that will benefit roughly 77,000 of our colleagues.
In addition to these investments, we are doing a great job of taking care of our colleagues and their families during the pandemic.
This focus on our colleagues is unique and builds trust with them, increases employee engagement, allows us to compete for talent and enables us to deliver for our customers.
Focus on our customers is the second step of our transformation journey.
Our investment in our customers is the primary driver of revenue stabilization.
It was clear from their comments that the new DXC story is resonating with them because we are delivering.
These are all large global companies, and they are saying that their IT estates are important.
In fact, they use the word critical.
Our strategy of delivering ITO services builds customer intimacy and develops trust that when our customers want to further transform their business, they turn to us, and allows us to move them up the enterprise technology stack.
Additional evidence that our strategy is working is the nice progress we have made on our GBS business, along with the cloud and security layer of our GIS business.
All of this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our financial commitments.
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program.
We continue to do well, optimizing our costs and delivering for our customers without disruption.
These levers have helped us expand our margin going from 7.5% last quarter to 8% this quarter.
You will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in Q2.
Next, seize the market is where we are focused on cross-selling to our existing customers and winning new work.
The 1.12 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is evidence that our plan is working.
In Q1, 57% of our bookings were new work and 43% were renewals.
You will see that we are running specific sales campaigns.
An example of these campaigns is ITO modernization, which is focused on improving the performance of our customers' IT estates.
Another example is our campaign to show our customers how to think about cloud, which combines on-prem, private cloud and public cloud technology.
Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of 1.0 in each of the last five quarters is evidence that these sales campaigns are working and that we can win in the IT services industry.
This momentum and success in the market gives us confidence that we will deliver another book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater in Q2.
Turning to our financial performance on Slide 12.
For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continued to deliver a strong book-to-bill.
GAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher than the top end of our guidance range.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 8% in the quarter, an improvement of 380 basis points as compared to the prior quarter.
In Q1, bookings were $4.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.12, the fifth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than one.
Moving on to Slide 13.
Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 or $0.08 higher than the top end of our guidance, benefiting $0.05 from a lower tax rate.
Restructuring and TSI expenses were $76 million, down 58% from prior year.
Free cash flow was a use of cash of $304 million, as compared to a use of cash of $106 million in the prior year.
We expect free cash flow to improve significantly as the year progresses.
As the next slide shows, our Q1 FY '22 performance continues our trajectory as we deliver on our transformation journey.
Starting with organic growth progression, we went from approximately 10% decline in the first three quarters of FY '21 to down 6.5% in the fourth quarter and now down to a decline of 3.7%.
This is a 40% improvement from the prior quarter.
Our previous organic revenue growth calculation was not performed in this manner.
As a result, we have revised the organic growth rates for the prior-year periods in our earnings deck and have further supplemented our organic calculation to include all the information to support the calculation, providing you complete transparency.
This change does not yield a meaningful difference to our historically reported organic revenue growth rates, trajectory or guidance.
Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 380 basis points.
Excluding the impact of dispositions, margin expanded almost 600 basis points.
We continue to market with five consecutive quarters of a book-to-bill greater than one, and lastly, non-GAAP earnings per share quadrupled.
Now moving to our GBS business, composed of analytics and engineering, applications and business process services.
Revenue was $1.9 billion in the quarter.
Organic revenue growth was positive 2% as compared to prior year.
In terms of quarterly progression, organic revenues declined about 6% to 7% in the first three quarters of FY '21, declined 3.4% in the fourth quarter and turned to positive 2% this quarter.
GBS segment profit was $272 million with a 14.4% profit rate, up 450 basis points from the prior year.
GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.29.
As you have seen for a number of quarters, the demand for our GBS offerings, the top half of our technology stack have been quite robust and now yielding positive organic revenue growth.
Turning to our GIS segment, consisting of IT outsourcing, cloud and security, and modern workplace.
Revenue was $2.3 billion, down 9.1% year over year on an organic basis.
We are seeing the rate of decline moderate this quarter despite the headwinds from our modern workplace business.
GIS segment profit was $131 million with a profit margin of 5.8%, a 480-basis-point margin improvement over the prior-year quarter.
GIS bookings were $2.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.97, compared to 0.77 in the prior year.
It is safe to say revenues continue to stabilize and demonstrate that with improved customer intimacy and delivery, our revenue is not running away, allowing us to build our growth foundation.
Now I will break down our segment results, GBS and GIS, into the layers of our enterprise technology stack, starting with GBS.
Analytics and engineering revenues were $482 million, up 12.9% as compared to prior year.
We continue to see high demand for our offerings with a book-to-bill of 1.32 in the quarter.
Applications also continued to demonstrate solid progress with revenue of $1.246 billion, growing organically almost 1%.
Applications also continues its strong book-to-bill at 1.32.
Business process services revenues were $118 million, down 13% compared to the prior-year quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.13.
Cloud and security revenue was $549 million, up 4.9% as compared to the prior year.
The cloud business is benefiting from increased demand associated with our hybrid cloud offerings.
Book-to-bill was 0.85 the quarter.
IT outsourcing revenue was $1.13 billion, down 9% as compared to prior year.
To put this decline in perspective, last year, this business declined almost 20% year over year.
We expect this momentum to continue and organic declines to further abate as the year progresses.
Modern workplace revenues were $577 million, down 19.7% as compared to prior year.
Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter.
As you may recall, modern workplace was part of our strategic alternatives and was not part of our transformation journey until recently.
As a result, we previously disclosed that the performance would be uneven as we invest in the business, enhancing our offerings and innovating the end-user experience.
As our transformation journey takes hold, we expect modern workplace performance to improve similar to the trend we have seen with our ITO business.
One of our key initiatives to drive cash flow and improve earnings power is to wind down restructuring in TSI costs.
We expect to reduce this from an average of $900 million per year over the last four years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24.
On Slide 19, we detail our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet.
We are proud of what we achieved on this front, reducing our debt by $7 billion, while improving our net debt leverage ratio to 0.9 times.
Further, we have reached our targeted debt level of $5 billion with relatively low maturities through FY '24.
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow for the quarter.
First-quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $29 million.
Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $304 million.
As you likely realize, with Mike's leadership, we will continue to make decisions to better position the company for the longer term, creating a sustainable business.
Certain of these decisions impacted cash flow this quarter.
As our guidance anticipated, we plan to take certain actions that impacted the Q1 cash flow.
We remain on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow guidance of $500 million.
Let's now turn to our financial priorities on Slide 21.
We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and use that base to drive the company forward in a disciplined and rigorous fashion, unleashing DXC's true earnings power.
Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet.
We achieved our targeted debt level.
We are encouraged by our almost 50% year-over-year interest expense reduction.
We continue to focus on reducing interest expense and are evaluating refinancing options given the advantageous interest rate environment.
Third, we will focus on improving cash flow.
During the quarter, we paid $88 million to draw to conclusion a long-standing $3 billion take-or-pay contract for IT hardware.
These types of contracts are not efficient, and we are reducing our exposure.
Additionally, we paid down $300 million of capital leases and asset financing in order to allow us to dispose of IP hardware purchased under the previously mentioned take-or-pay arrangement and realizing tax deduction once we dispose of the unutilized assets.
Given our relatively low borrowing cost, it makes less sense to enter into capital leases as the borrowing costs are higher and creates other complexities.
We continue to reduce capital lease and asset financing origination from approximately $1.1 billion in FY '20 to $450 million in FY '21 and believe that we will remain at that level or lower for FY '22.
As we continue to curtail capital lease origination, our average quarterly lease payment will reduce from about $230 million a quarter in FY '21 to about $170 million near term.
Our efforts to limit capital leases does create upward pressure on capital expenditures.
Though, on balance, we expect to reduce cash outflows for both capital leases and capital expenditures over time.
Lastly, we terminated our German AR securitization program, negatively impacting cash flow by $114 million for the quarter.
Going forward, this will result in interest savings, strengthen our balance sheet, but more importantly, it will bring us closer to our customers as cash collections is tied to their success.
Fourth, we will reduce restructuring and TSI expense, improving our cash flow.
Fifth, as we generate free cash flow, we will appropriately deploy capital to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders, all the while continuing to maintain our investment-grade credit profile.
During the quarter, we executed $67 million of stock buybacks to offset dilution, taking advantage of what we believe was an attractive valuation in the market.
I should note, we continue to make progress with our efforts to optimize our portfolio, unlocking value as we divest noncore assets, including both businesses and facilities.
We expect to continue these efforts.
Our results today include the benefit from the sale of assets, partially offset by other discrete items, and the headwind of 30 basis points of margin associated with the disposition of our healthcare provider software business.
Moving on to second-quarter guidance on Slide 22.
Revenues between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion.
This translates into organic revenue declines of down 1% to down 3%.
Adjusted EBIT margins of 8% to 8.4%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, I would note that we expect $175 million of tax payments in Q2 related to the gains on dispositions.
We also updated our FY '22 interest guidance to approximately $180 million, a $20 million improvement; and reduced our full-year non-GAAP tax rate by 200 basis points to 26%.
As noted on Slides 23 and 24, we are reaffirming our FY '22 and longer-term guidance.
Lastly, we expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year.
Let me leave you with three key takeaways.
First, I couldn't be more pleased with the trajectory of the business.
Our improvement in revenue, margins and earnings per share is evident, and we expect this success to continue.
Second, we have momentum and continue to win in the market.
We expect our progress in driving a book-to-bill of over 1.0 to continue.
Third, our financial foundation is coming together nicely under Ken's leadership.
We have made great progress on debt reduction, reducing our restructuring and TSI expense, and delivering on our capital allocation priorities.
These three key takeaways show that we have good momentum, we are building the foundation for growth, and we are confident that we will deliver on our financial commitments.
","DXC Technology's Q1 2022 earnings call highlights continued progress in its transformation journey. Revenue reached $4.14 billion, exceeding estimates, with adjusted EBIT margin improving to 8%. Non-GAAP earnings per share surged 300% to $0.84. The company's focus on customer engagement and cost optimization contributed to these positive results. Book-to-bill ratio maintained above 1.0 for the fifth straight quarter, indicating strong market demand. DXC plans to expand adjusted EBIT margins and deliver a consistent book-to-bill over 1.0 in Q2. Moreover, the company emphasizes debt reduction, balance sheet strengthening, improved cash flow, and strategic capital deployment to enhance its financial foundation."
CNS_q4_2020.txt,"Joining me are our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Steers; our President, Joe Harvey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Stadler.
Further, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $0.76 per share compared with $0.74 in the prior year's quarter and $0.67 sequentially.
The fourth quarter of 2020 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation to revenue ratio and effective tax rate, respectively.
Revenue was a record $116.6 million for the quarter compared with $109.8 million in the prior year's quarter and $111.4 million sequentially.
The increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management, partially offset by lower performance fees when compared with the third quarter.
Our implied effective fee rate was 57 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 59 basis points in the third quarter.
Excluding performance fees, our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 56.3 basis points, and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been five point -- 56 basis points.
Operating income was a record $49.4 million in the quarter compared with $47.4 million in the prior year's quarter and $44.2 million sequentially.
Our operating margin increased to 42.4% from 39.6% last quarter.
Expenses were essentially flat compared with the third quarter as lower G&A was offset by higher expenses related to distribution and service fees as well as compensation and benefits.
The decrease in G&A was primarily due to lower professional fees and a reduction in virtually hosted conferences.
The increase in distribution and service fee expense, which as noted earlier, excludes the cost of our new closed-end fund, is primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds.
And the compensation to revenue ratio for the fourth quarter was 35% lower than the guidance we provided on our last call.
The decrease was primarily due to an adjustment to reflect actual incentive compensation to be paid.
For the year, the compensation to revenue ratio was 36.1%.
Our effective tax rate was 25.8% for the fourth quarter, which included an adjustment to bring the full year rate to 26.65%.
The lower full year tax rate was primarily due to the relationship between a consistent amount of permanent differences relative to higher-than-forecasted pre-tax income.
Our firm liquidity totaled $143 million at quarter end compared with $201.9 million last quarter.
Firm liquidity as of December 31 reflected the payment of approximately $60.2 million for costs associated with our new closed-end fund and a special cash dividend in December of approximately $47 million or $1 per share.
Over the past 11 years, we have paid a total of $14 per share in special dividends.
And we remain debt-free.
Assets under management totaled a record $79.9 billion at December 31, an increase of $9.4 billion or 13% from September 30.
The increase was due to net inflows of $3.9 billion and market appreciation of $6.4 billion, partially offset by distributions of $859 million.
Bob Steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.
Now I'd like to briefly discuss a few items to consider as we begin the new year.
With respect to compensation and benefits, we expect to balance anticipated revenue growth from year-end assets under management that exceeded our 2020 full year average assets under management by about 15%, with our focus on controlled investment in order to maintain our industry-leading performance, broaden our product offerings and expand our distribution efforts.
As a result, we expect that our compensation to revenue ratio will decline to 35.5% from the 36.1% recorded in 2020.
Continuing with the theme of investing in our business, we expect G&A to increase by about 6% from the $42.6 million we recorded in 2020.
After finishing last year 8% below 2019, which was largely driven by lower travel and entertainment and a reduction in hosted and sponsored conference costs as a result of COVID conditions, we intend to make incremental investments this year in technology, including the implementation of new systems, cloud migration and upgrades to our infrastructure and security as well as in global marketing, focused on hosting virtual conferences and expanding our digital footprint.
We also expect that travel and entertainment costs will increase as conditions begin to return to normal.
We expect that our effective tax rate will be 27.25% in 2021.
And finally, we will have earned a full quarter and full year of fees from our new closed-end fund.
And so all things being equal, we expect our implied effective fee rate, excluding performance fees, will increase by about one basis point.
Today, I will review our investment performance and provide some perspective on how our largest asset classes are positioned for 2021.
The markets were ebullient in the fourth quarter as investors continued to look beyond the valley of the pandemic, encouraged by progress with the vaccine and anticipating a potential economic recovery, relieved by clarity on our new administration and government and supported by record monetary and fiscal stimulus.
The macro environment in 2020 was unprecedented with the Fed's balance sheet increasing by over 75%, the budget deficit reaching the highest level since World War II, money supply growing 25% and negative yielding debt reaching $18 trillion globally.
Although we had some of the best relative performance ever in 2020, our asset classes, except for preferreds, lagged their market counterparts meaningfully.
Summarizing our performance at a high level, preferreds performed competitively within fixed income.
U.S. and Global REITs and infrastructure significantly trailed the technology-led performance in stocks.
And certain of our strategies with energy allocations underperformed due to concerns about the secular decline in the demand for oil, considering the growing focus on renewables.
Looking at our performance scorecard, in the fourth quarter, five of nine core strategies outperformed their benchmarks.
For the last 12 months, six of nine core strategies outperformed.
As measured by AUM, 84% of our portfolios are outperforming on a 1-year basis, an improvement from 70% last quarter, mostly due to our preferred portfolios.
On a 1- and 3-year basis, 99% are outperforming, which was consistent with last quarter.
Preferreds returned 4.6% in the fourth quarter.
We outperformed in both our core and low-duration preferred strategies.
After a brief stretch of underperformance, we've now outperformed for three consecutive quarters.
Our 12-month figures are beginning to turn positive across our accounts, which led to the improvement in our 12-month outperforming AUM.
While our relative performance was mixed in 2020, we outperformed all peers.
Taking stock of the critical factors for preferreds, unprecedented monetary stimulus has helped to compress credit spreads to near record low levels.
Credit quality should benefit as the recovery progresses.
With 2020 elections over, the expectation for more fiscal stimulus, and potentially, with the bottoming of inflation, treasury yields may be transitioning from declining to rising.
As a result, companies are taking their queue from markets and issuing significant amounts of preferreds at a very low cost of capital.
Taken together, these factors lead us to expect lower returns from preferreds, and we are currently suggesting that investors consider our low-duration strategy.
With that as a starting point, we believe that conditions later in 2021 and 2022 may create good entry points for these asset classes as the vaccine continues to be distributed, businesses reopen and recovery brings back the more cyclical real estate and infrastructure subsectors that have been disproportionately hit.
In the fourth quarter, infrastructure returned 8.4%, which lagged the global stock index return of 14.8%.
While we underperformed our benchmark in the fourth quarter, we exceeded our excess return target for the full year.
Assessing the infrastructure universe's sensitivity to the economic situation and pandemic, we believe that 9% benefits from secular trends, 50% is relatively unaffected by the economy and pandemic, 20% is directly sensitive to the economic recovery, and 21% will be reliant on successful penetration of the vaccine.
Key investment themes for infrastructure include digital transformation of economies, including 5G deployment; decarbonization and development of renewable power; and the potential for recovery in travel.
We continue to see adoption of infrastructure allocations with asset consultants and institutions.
With the new administration and potential for additional fiscal stimulus via infrastructure, we also believe that wealth advisors may have more interest as well.
In fact, our closed-end fund, UTF, is now trading at a premium to its NAV, indicating investor demand and anticipation of recovery.
In the fourth quarter, U.S. real estate returned 8.1% compared with the S&P 500, which was up 12.1%, and global real estate returned 13.2%.
For the year, we outperformed our benchmarks in all strategies by region and style and by amounts that exceed our excess return targets across the board.
In terms of where real estate is headed, all eyes are on the vaccine and the timing of the reopening of the economy.
Currently, some sectors such as apartments are seeing stabilization with rents flattening out, which is a key step in the recovery progression.
The secular winners such as cell towers, data centers and industrial continue to have great fundamentals.
Probably, the biggest unknown relates to return-to-office dynamics and the proportion of occupancy that may be permanently impaired.
Broadly speaking, lenders have been kicking the can down the road, but banks are now beginning to feel pressure to address problem loans.
While pricing transparency for many sectors is opaque, we expect transactional activity to pick up as the economic recovery takes hold.
Overall, on most metrics, REITs are very cheap, as cheap as they were in the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009.
As the recovery unfolds, considering how much REITs have lagged, we would expect a catch-up in performance.
I also want to mention that our real assets multi-strategy portfolio had very good relative performance in 2020, outperforming by 200 basis -- 240 basis points for the year, which puts us in good position with investors who are looking for inflation protection.
Looking backward over a period of low inflation, investors had not felt a need for this portfolio, which includes real estate, infrastructure, resource equities, commodities and short-duration credit.
However, it has the highest inflation sensitivity of all of our strategies, and we are seeing increased interest in inflation protection, perhaps no surprise considering the deficit and monetary statistics cited earlier.
As Matt mentioned, allocating resources to our investment department is always a priority.
This past year has been particularly gratifying as we continue to see the growing return on investments we've made over the past five years in our people, IT, processing strategies and data and quantitative resources.
One example is our transition of U.S. REIT team leadership that we announced in the fourth quarter.
Our current head, Tom Bohjalian, will be retiring in the middle of this year, and our succession plan has been put in place with Jason Yablon assuming leadership in partnership with Matt Kirschner.
It's hard to imagine replacing as a strong a leader and investor as Tom.
But in the spirit of continuous improvement, we expect Jason to give Tom a run for his money.
We'll continue to build the team for depth and succession.
We will never be complacent on performance and innovation, and we will continue to drive our Alpha Mining initiatives.
Last quarter, I noted that we have a stable of -- track record accounts for strategies that have been developed over the past three years, ranging from existing strategy extensions to new ideas generated by our investment teams.
All but one outperformed benchmarks last year.
We'll be adding more track record accounts in 2021, including one in renewables and clean energy.
Our challenge will be to convert these investment ideas into investor allocations.
Our recent hire of Greg Bottjer from Nuveen, who heads Global Product Strategy and Development, will help us bring some of these strategies to market as well as map out real asset strategy extensions for the next phase of growth.
Overall, I'd say the state of our investment department is strong.
And we are optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the investment opportunities that are expected to come along with a post-pandemic economic recovery.
Let me start by stating the obvious.
2020 was a year that all of us would like to forget.
The one-two punch of COVID and political and social upheaval has had a devastating impact on our culture and economy, and we're not out of the woods quite yet.
In contrast to the unprecedented challenges that we faced last year, U.S. equity markets posted remarkably positive returns led by the COVID beneficiary plays as demonstrated by the strength in the FAANG and related stocks, as Joe already touched on.
While most active managers continued to battle the dual challenges of declining fees and net outflows, the equity markets offered them a reprieve with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ up 16.3% and 43.6%, respectively, last year.
While alternative income strategies such as preferred securities also performed well, delivering returns in high single digits, most real asset strategies, notably real estate and infrastructure, did not.
As Joe noted, global and U.S. real estate securities indices actually declined by 9% and 5.1%, respectively, while global listed infrastructure indices also fell by 4.1%.
It's a point of pride for us that unlike our peers in the industry that benefited from market appreciation, we faced significant market headwinds last year, and yet, still generated industry-leading organic growth.
Importantly, our growth was broad-based and -- with almost every region, strategy and channel contributing to record-breaking results.
We ended the quarter with record assets, as Matt said, of $79.9 billion.
Assets under management in each of the open-end fund, closed-end fund and advisory channels also ended the year at record levels.
In the quarter, gross inflows were a record $7.3 billion and net inflows contributed $3.9 billion.
Virtually, all the organic growth in the quarter was derived from the wealth channel.
Our confidence in the new generation of closed-end funds paid off in the quarter, and we added $2.1 billion of net new assets through the IPO of our Tax-Advantaged Preferred Securities and Income Fund.
Although not a record, our open-end fund channel registered $1.7 billion of net inflows, driven mainly by preferred securities and U.S. real estate strategies.
Notably, each of the RIA, BD, DCIO and Bank Trust verticals generated positive net inflows in the quarter.
Our non-U.S. open-end fund showed modest improvement, albeit from low levels, with net inflows of $41 million in the quarter.
We are continuing to build out our EMEA wholesale distribution team and fully expect that these nascent positive trends will improve.
Consistent with more recent trends, Japan subadvisory saw net inflows of $83 million before distributions and $293 million of net outflows after distributions.
And it was a quiet quarter for subadvisory ex Japan with $10 million of net inflows.
While the headline results for the advisory channel of $101 million of net outflows was disappointing, the underlying trends continue to be strong.
five new mandates totaling $297 million, combined with $282 million of inflows from existing clients, contributed $579 million of gross inflows.
Offsetting these inflows was an unexpected $301 million global real estate outflow, stemming from the termination of a relatively new institutional account, along with a global listed infrastructure termination totaling $299 million.
We do expect the balance of the terminated global real estate account of approximately $960 million to be withdrawn in the next quarter or 2.
Lastly, the quarter ended with a record-setting pipeline of $1 billion, but unfunded mandates of $1.7 billion.
The quarter began with a $1.2 billion pipeline.
$400 million was funded in the quarter, and another $280 million has been deferred due to funding uncertainties.
New awards totaled $1.1 billion.
These new awards were diverse both by strategy and region.
Demand for our strategies, especially real assets remained strong, driven by relative performance, attractive valuations and rising concerns regarding future inflation expectations.
As you know, in recent years, our overarching goal has been to achieve positive flows in each of our core strategies and in every channel and region simultaneously.
To accomplish these results, we have invested continuously in our investment teams, IT, existing and new channels of distribution, innovative new investment strategies, and most importantly, in our people and culture.
So while 2020 was a terrible year in so many ways, it was also a year to be proud of at Cohen & Steers.
All of our teams came together under crisis conditions to deliver a cascade of record results.
For the full year, firmwide gross sales were $27.4 billion, which exceeded the prior record achieved in 2011 of $17 billion by 61%.
Open-end fund gross sales of $17.6 billion were 41% above the prior record, and closed-end fund sales of $2.7 billion similarly blew by the prior record by more than double.
Even in the transition year for us in the U.S. institutional market, our advisory channel recorded sales of $4.3 billion, which was more than 100% better than the prior -- the record set in 2018.
Net inflows last year also set a record at $10.8 billion.
While this was only modestly above the prior record set in 2011, it highlights the important progress that we've made in diversifying our sources of organic growth.
In 2011, net inflows were $10.7 billion.
However, subadvisory inflows from Daiwa Asset Management contributed 81% of that amount in one single strategy.
In contrast, last year, six strategies across open-end funds, closed-end funds and advisory contributed $5.4 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion of net inflows, respectively, and each setting individual channel records and accounting for almost 90% of firmwide totals.
Achieving these results despite significant market declines for most of our strategies is extraordinary and bodes well for the future.
Strong investment performance in our core strategies has helped us to gain significant market share from our active peers and even passive alternatives.
Seeding and launching innovative new strategies, such as low duration and tax-advantaged preferred securities, next-generation real estate and digital infrastructure has been well received, and our product pipeline is robust.
In addition, expanding and improving the delivery of our strategies through the launch of usage funds, CITs, SMAs and closed-end funds has materially broadened our distribution reach and opportunities.
Lastly, our focus on improving underperforming distribution channels such as U.S. Advisory is starting to pay dividends.
Maintaining the current level of organic growth will not only require a continuation of industry-leading investment performance but also the development of the next generation of innovative real asset and alternative income strategies to complement our existing lineup.
We believe that in the current market cycle, a significant shift in asset allocations into real assets, seeking to capitalize on depressed valuations and the potential to hedge against unexpected inflation is taking place.
Current and prospective clients are looking to us to implement their strategies through both listed and private markets.
In response to our clients' needs and to maintain our leadership position in real assets and alternative income strategies, we plan to expand our opportunity set and related capabilities to include non-traded equity and fixed income investments.
In addition, an important point of differentiation for us will be the ability to deliver all of our capabilities through strategically allocated and bespoke solutions.
As always, we're committed to invest as necessary to drive our long-term growth.
With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open up the floor to questions.
","Cohen & Steers reported record quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share, up from $0.74 in the prior year and $0.67 sequentially. Revenue reached $116.6 million, surpassing the previous quarter's $111.4 million. Despite lower performance fees, the company experienced higher average assets under management. Operating income increased to $49.4 million, with an improved operating margin of 42.4%. Assets under management reached a record $79.9 billion, driven by net inflows of $3.9 billion and market appreciation. The company anticipates a decline in its compensation-to-revenue ratio to 35.5% in 2021 and expects G&A expenses to increase by 6% due to investments in technology, marketing, and travel expenses. The implied effective fee rate is projected to rise by approximately one basis point in 2021."
ENR_q2_2021.txt,"In addition, a slide deck providing detailed financial results for the quarter is also posted on our website.
This quarter e-commerce data is not included in our category overview as the data is not currently available.
It is uncertain when that data will become available in the future.
Today, I am pleased to share our second quarter 2021 results, which build on the momentum from our first quarter as we benefited from elevated demand, expanded distribution and strong execution, all of which led to robust earnings growth.
As we look specifically at the results for the quarter, we maintained top line momentum with organic sales of 12.7% with strong sales across categories and markets around the globe.
We were able to meet that demand while also demonstrating improved cost control and delivering synergies, which partially offset the inflationary headwinds from transportation, tariffs and product input costs.
Our adjusted earnings per share were $0.77, more than double the prior-year, driven by strong organic sales growth, synergy realization, favorable currencies and lower interest expense.
Given our performance in the first half, we are increasing our full fiscal year outlook to the following.
Net sales growth to 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share to a new range of $3.30 to $3.50 and adjusted EBITDA to a new range of $620 million to $640 million.
Tim will provide more information on both the quarterly results and the revised outlook in a moment.
Turning to category trends.
Consumer demand in our categories remains elevated.
As a reminder, the category data I'm about to provide does not include e-commerce, as Jackie indicated in our opening comments.
Starting with batteries, few changes in consumer behavior that have emerged since the beginning of COVID drove the battery category globally.
First, an increase in the number of devices on per household; and second, an increase in the amount of time devices are being used, which has led to more frequent battery replacement.
During the three months ending February, our brands grew faster than the category and we gained 2.1 share points globally as we benefited from the previously discussed distribution gains.
In the most recent four weeks through March, in markets like the U.S., Australia and the UK, the category experienced year-over-year declines as we lapped the initial spike in COVID related buy.
We anticipated these year-over-year declines, including a 13.9% decline in the U.S. during that four-week timeframe.
However, if you look at those same markets on a two-year basis, there is robust growth when compared to the pre-pandemic levels.
In the U.S., for example, the category was up 14.1% for that four-week period when you compare 2019 to 2021.
Across both the most recent four weeks and the two-year basis, Energizer significantly outpaced the category.
Looking at the U.S. AutoCare category, in the 13 weeks through February, we saw a healthy category growth of 7.4% as the category experienced both an increase in household penetration and existing consumer spending more on cleaning and maintaining their cars.
Given the seasonality of our portfolio, the cold weather and the short-term constraints on our wipes supply which have recently been resolved, Energizer lag category growth in the U.S. Similar to batteries, we are seeing category growth in the latest four weeks and on a two-year basis with Energizer outpacing the category.
Finally, while we don't have e-commerce category data this quarter, our net sales have increased 70% across our combined portfolio, a reflection of our investments and ongoing focus which are paying off and positioning us to lead well into the future.
The environment remains dynamic and we can't predict the impact of vaccines, the virus variance or the resulting consumer habits.
However, in surveys with consumers, many expect their pandemic influence habits to continue, including the increased use of devices such as home health and home office equipment as well as increased focus on their auto cleaning habits.
During the quarter, we faced inflationary headwinds from transportation, tariffs and input costs.
However, we were able to offset a significant portion of these through the delivery of synergies.
As we look to the future, we do not believe that these costs are transitory and have initiated productivity and revenue management efforts to offset them.
Our revenue management efforts are focused in three main areas.
Channel and mix management across our markets, brands and pack sizes, including leveraging the breadth of our strong battery brands from premium to value.
Resetting our promotional framework, including the frequency and depth of promotion and price increases based on a longer-term outlook of product input costs, our innovation pipeline and currency impacts.
As an example of this work, we've recently announced price increases in the U.S. in our AutoCare portfolio to offset the headwinds we are experiencing.
Going forward, we will evaluate a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions, product input costs, transportation costs, market dynamics, innovation and currency to assess the need for additional pricing actions across the balance of our portfolio.
Our internal initiatives designed to reshape our organization and to ensure we are poised for future growth are all progressing well.
Specifically, we are on track to deliver over $120 million in synergies by the end of fiscal 2021, a portion of which is being reinvested in the business through innovation and brand building activities.
We have significantly increased production in the Indonesian plant that we acquired in the first quarter, which provides us with a source of high-quality products at lower costs.
We have built an impressive innovation pipeline for our AutoCare business and have advanced our international growth plans with International AutoCare organic growth for the second quarter at 24%.
Our global product supply team has made significant strides in reshaping our network, which we expect will result in greater efficiency, effectiveness and supply chain resiliency.
And finally, we have launched project to advance our organization's data and analytics capabilities, creating a seamless data flow which starts with the consumer and ease its way through our organization in a more automated manner, will ensure that we are positioned to meet the demands of consumers in a rapidly changing operating environment.
With that, I will now turn things over to Tim who will dive deeper into our financial performance for the quarter and provide more details about our updated outlook for the fiscal year.
As Mark touched on, as we crossed the halfway mark for the fiscal year, we are pleased with our continued momentum.
Our organic revenue growth of 12.7% combined with synergy realization, cost controls, lower interest expense and favorable currency headwinds resulted in strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.77, up more than double the prior-year second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $148 million, up 20% compared to the prior year.
Taking a deeper look at the organic revenue growth.
We maintained our top line momentum with strong sales across all of our categories and geographies.
Both of our segments showed organic growth with the Americas up nearly 16% and International up 6%, and our Battery and Auto Care businesses grew benefiting from elevated demand and distribution gains that began last summer.
Adjusted gross margin decreased 110 basis points versus the prior year to 40.5% in line with our adjusted gross margin reported in the first quarter.
This was impacted primarily by increased operating costs that resulted from higher tariffs associated with source product to meet elevated demand, transportation, labor and product input cost, all consistent with inflationary trends in the global market.
Additionally, our gross margin was negatively impacted by the lower margin profile associated with recent distribution gains and acquisitions, synergies of $14.2 million and favorable impacts from currency exchange rates partially offset these negative impacts.
As Mark mentioned, we do expect inflationary headwinds over the balance of the current year and into next year.
At the present time, we are essentially fully hedged on a commodity costs for fiscal year 2021.
Looking beyond this year, we will continue to take actions to offset the impact of these headwinds through continuous improvement efforts and pricing actions.
A&P as a percent of sales was 4% relatively flat compared with the prior year's second quarter.
Consistent with our priorities, we invested on an absolute dollar basis in A&P to support our brands and innovation with total A&P spending of $4 million or 19% over the prior year.
Excluding acquisition and integration costs, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 16.7% versus 18.4% in the prior year, primarily the result of elevated sales experienced in the current year.
On an absolute dollar basis, adjusted SG&A increased $6 million in part because of the higher overheads associated with our top line sales growth and foreign exchange rate impacts.
We realized nearly $20 million in synergies this quarter, bringing the total for that first half of 2021 to $40 million.
Since our Battery and Auto Care acquisitions were completed, we have recognized approximately $109 million of synergies, exceeding our initial targets and we expect to realize an additional $10 million to $15 million over the balance of the year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we've taken advantage of favorable debt markets and refinanced a significant portion of our debt over the last 12 months.
We expect these refinancings to contribute to a $30 million reduction in our 2021 interest expense, of which $8 million was realized in the second quarter.
At the end of the quarter, our total debt was approximately $3.5 billion or 4.8 times net debt to credit defined EBITDA, with nearly 80% at fixed interest rates and an all-in cost of debt of 4.2%.
As a result of our strong organic growth in the first half of the fiscal year, we are updating our full year fiscal 2021 outlook for the following key metrics.
Net sales growth is now expected to be between 5% to 7%, owing in large part to a prolonged elevated battery demand in North America and favorable currency impacts.
Adjusted gross margin rate is expected to be essentially flat on a year-over-year basis in line with our previously provided outlook.
Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $640 million.
And finally, adjusted free cash flow is expected to be at the low end of our previously provided range of $325 million to $350 million due to working capital requirements, mostly related to inventory as we look to rebuild safety stocks.
The revised net sales outlook provided for the full year reflects a low-single digit decline over the balance of the year consistent with our prior outlook.
We began lapping elevated COVID-related battery demand late in the second quarter and we will lap the favorable impacts of weather on our AutoCare business, particularly in refrigerants in the third and fourth quarter.
With respect to gross margin rates, we expect them to remain roughly flat throughout the balance of the year as synergies and the impacts of favorable currency offset inflationary cost pressures and mix shifts.
We will also benefit over the rest of the year as our gross margin in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 was burdened with one-time COVID-related costs of $9 million and $19 million, respectively.
As we turn to the second half of the year, we expect to build on the momentum from the strong first half by executing on our strategic priorities to deliver the full year outlook.
We have had a great first half of fiscal 2021, which is a testament to the efforts of our colleagues around the world to make, ship and deliver the products that our consumers need during this time.
We are focused on winning the day by staying focused on the consumer and delivering for our customers, all while building the foundation to win in the future.
","Energizer's second-quarter performance was marked by strong organic sales growth of 12.7%, driven by elevated demand across categories and markets. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled year-over-year to $0.77, primarily due to sales growth, cost controls, and favorable currency impacts. The company expects full-year net sales growth of 5% to 7%, with adjusted earnings per share revised upwards to $3.30 to $3.50. The battery segment experienced robust growth globally, with the company gaining market share. In AutoCare, category growth was healthy in the Americas, supported by increased household penetration and spending on vehicle maintenance. While e-commerce data was not available, Energizer's net sales surged 70%, reflecting the company's focus on this channel. To combat inflationary pressures, Energizer has implemented revenue management initiatives and is closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions to assess the need for additional pricing actions. The company has also achieved significant progress in its cost-saving and growth initiatives, including synergy realization and a strengthened innovation pipeline."
VSH_q3_2021.txt,"As usual, we'll start today's call with the Chief Financial Officer, who will review Vishay's third quarter 2021 financial results.
Dr. Gerald Paul will then give an overview of our business and discuss operational performance as well as segment results in more detail.
We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they provide useful information about the operating performance of our businesses and should be considered by investors in conjunction with GAAP measures that we also provide.
I will focus on some highlights and key metrics.
Vishay reported revenues for Q3 of $814 million.
EPS was $0.67 for the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 for the quarter.
The only reconciling items between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share are tax related.
There were no reconciling items impacting gross or operating margins.
Revenues in the quarter were $814 million, down by 0.7% from previous quarter and up by 27.1% compared to prior year.
Gross margin was 27.7%.
Operating margin was 15.2%.
There were no reconciling items to arrive at adjusted operating margin.
EPS was $0.67, adjusted earnings per share was $0.63.
EBITDA was $162 million or 19.9%.
There were no reconciling items to arrive at adjusted EBITDA.
Reconciling versus prior quarter, operating income quarter three 2021 compared to operating income for prior quarter based on $5 million lower sales or flat sales, excluding exchange rate impacts, operating income decreased by $2 million to $124 million in Q3 2021 from $125 million in Q2 2021.
The main elements were: Average selling prices had a positive impact of $10 million, representing a 1.3% ASP increase; volume decreased with a negative impact of $4 million, equivalent to a 1.3% decrease in volume.
Variable costs increased with a negative impact of $12 million, primarily due to increases in metal prices as well as materials and services and not completely offset by cost reductions.
Fixed costs decreased with a positive impact of $4 million, in line with our guidance.
Reconciling versus prior year, operating income quarter three 2021 compared to adjusted operating income in quarter three 2020, based on $174 million higher sales, or $172 million excluding exchange rate impacts, adjusted operating income increased by $62 million to $124 million in Q3 2021, from $61 million in Q3 2020.
The main elements were: Average selling prices had a positive impact of $18 million, representing a 2.2% ASP increase; volume increased with a positive impact of $70 million, representing a 23.2% increase.
Variable costs increased with a negative impact of $8 million.
Volume-related manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction efforts did not completely offset higher metal prices, annual wage increases and higher tariffs.
Fixed cost increased with a negative impact of $17 million, primarily due to annual wage increases and higher incentive compensation costs, only partially offset by our restructuring programs.
Inventory impacts had a positive impact of $9 million.
Exchange rates had a negative effect of $9 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $102 million, in line with our guidance, excluding exchange rate impacts.
For quarter four 2021, our expectations are approximately $104 million of SG&A expenses at current exchange rates.
The debt shown on the face of our balance sheet at quarter end is comprised of the convertible notes due 2025 net of debt issuance costs.
There were no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter.
However, we did use the revolver from time to time during Q3 to meet short-term financing needs and expect to continue to do so in the future.
No principal payments are due until 2025, and the revolving credit facility expires in June 2024.
We had total liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end.
Cash and short-term investments comprised $916 million, and there are no amounts outstanding on our $750 million credit facility.
Total shares outstanding at quarter end were 145 million.
The expected share count for earnings per share purposes for the fourth quarter 2021 is approximately 145.6 million.
Our convertible debt repurchase activity over the past three years, together with the adoption of the new convertible debt standard significantly reduces the variability of our earnings per share to share count.
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate year-to-date was approximately 18%, which mathematically yields a rate of 17% for quarter three.
In quarter three, we recorded a tax benefit of $5.7 million due to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions.
We also recorded benefits of $8.3 million year-to-date due to changes in tax regulations.
Our normalized effective tax rate, which excludes the unusual tax items, was approximately 22% for the quarter, and 23% for the year-to-date period.
We expect our normalized effective tax rate for full year 2021 to be between 22% and 24%.
Our consolidated effective tax rate is based on an assumed level and mix of income among our various taxing jurisdictions.
A shift in income could result in significantly different results.
Also a significant change in U.S. tax laws or regulations could result in significantly different results.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $136 million.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million.
Free cash for the quarter was $79 million.
For the trailing 12 months, cash from operations was $436 million, capital expenditures were $171 million, split approximately for expansion, $113 million; for cost reduction, $9 million; for maintenance of business, $49 million.
Free cash generation for the trailing 12-month period was $267 million.
The trailing 12-month period includes $15 million cash taxes paid for the 2021 installment of the U.S. tax reform transition tax.
Vishay has consistently generated in excess of $100 million cash flows from operations in each of the past 26 years and greater than $200 million for the past 19 years.
Backlog at the end of quarter three was at $2.244 billion or 8.3 months of sales.
Inventories increased quarter-over-quarter by $30 million excluding exchange rate impacts.
Days of inventory outstanding were 81 days.
Days of sales outstanding for the quarter were 43 days.
Days of payables outstanding for the quarter were 35 days, resulting in a cash conversion cycle of 89 days.
Also in the third quarter, we operated under quite excellent economic conditions characterized by extremely high backlogs.
We continue to expand critical manufacturing capacities in order to prepare ourselves for further growth.
During the quarter, we did experience some localized shortages of labor impacting the manufacturing output.
There were strong financial third quarter results.
We had a gross margin of 27.7% of sales and operating margin of 15.2% of sales.
Earnings per share were $0.67 and adjusted earnings per share, $0.63.
Vishay in the third quarter generated $79 million of free cash, and we do expect another good year of cash generation.
As I said, the economic environment for electronic components remains exceptionally good with backlogs at a historical high.
Except for automotive, all markets continue to be in excellent shape and sales are basically limited by the manufacturing capacities.
The automotive sector is expected to accelerate again over the next quarters with current supply problems getting resolved step by step.
The supply chain continues to be rather depleted in general.
We see extremely long lead times and shortages of supply.
Price increases are being implemented in general also to offset increased inflationary costs for metals and for transportation.
Concerning the various regions, not so many differences.
All regions remained exceptionally strong.
POS in all regions remains close or above all-time highs, and distribution in all regions remains hungry for products every year, no change.
Global distribution continues to get overwhelmed with orders.
POS in the third quarter continued on a record level of the second quarter, running 34% over prior year.
POS increased versus Q2 by 5% in the Americas and by 3% in Europe.
Asia was slightly down by 2%.
Americas and Europe are at an all-time high.
Inventory turns of global distribution in quarter three turns was at 4.2 turns, started to normalize from quite extreme 4.4 turns in the second quarter.
In the Americas, 2.2 turns after 2.1 turns in the second quarter and 1.5 turns in prior year.
In Asia, 6.1 turns after 7.4 turns in Q2 and 4.3 turns in prior year.
And in Europe, 4.5 turns in the quarter after 4.6 turns in the second quarter and 3.2 turns in prior year.
Coming to the various industry segments we serve.
Sales to the automotive market remains dampened by customers' inability to secure ICs.
The situation is expected to improve step by step.
And as the demand for cars remains on a very high level, you can see that there's money in the bank for 2022.
Industrial markets continued strong in all regions, factory automation, alternative energy, power transmission are driving the growth.
After record levels in 2020, personal computing shows signs of normalization, but server markets continue growing.
Proliferation of 5G technology continues to drive sales in fixed telecom.
Military spending remains stable.
Commercial aerospace starts to recover slowly.
Medical markets are steady, with focus being more and more shifted back to normal hospital procedures.
White goods, air conditioning and gaming remains strong and profitable.
Coming to Vishay's business development in Q3.
Due to local labor shortages, third quarter sales, excluding exchange rate impacts came in below the midpoint of our guidance.
We achieved sales of $814 million versus $819 million in prior quarter and versus $640 million in prior year.
Excluding exchange rate effects, sales in Q3 were flat versus prior quarter and up by $172 million or by 27% versus prior year.
Book-to-bill in the quarter has remained on an extraordinarily high level of 1.26 after 1.38 in prior quarter.
1.29 book-to-bill for distribution after 1.41 in quarter two; 1.23 for OEMs after 1.34 in the second quarter; 1.27 for semis after 1.41 in Q2; 1.26 for passives after 1.35; 1.30 for the Americas after 1.33 in Q2; 1.14 for Asia after 1.29; 1.41 for Europe after 1.54, I think we can speak of a broad continuation of an excellent economical environment.
Our backlog in the third quarter has climbed to another record high of 8.3 months after 7.5 in the second quarter, 8.9 months in semis after 8.4 months in Q2 and 7.6 months in passives after 6.7 months in Q2.
Price increases become visible in our broad form.
We have seen 1.3% prices up versus prior quarter and 2.2% versus prior year.
For the semiconductors, it was 2.2% up versus prior quarter and 3.8% up versus prior year.
For the passives, 0.3% up versus prior quarter and 0.5% up versus prior year.
Some highlights of operations.
Despite the continued good level of plant efficiencies, our contributive margin in the third quarter has suffered from inflationary impacts, in particular as it relates to metals and to transportation.
SG&A costs in Q3 came in at $102 million according to expectations when excluding exchange rate impacts.
And manufacturing fixed costs in the quarter came in at $137 million, below our expectations when excluding exchange rate impacts.
Total employment at the end of the third quarter was 22,730, 1% up from prior quarter.
Excluding exchange rate impacts, inventories in the quarter increased.
By $30 million, $13 million in raw materials and $17 million in WIP and finished goods.
Inventory turns in the third quarter remained at a very high level of 4.5 after 4.8 in Q2.
Capital spending in the quarter was $57 million versus $22 million in prior year, $41 million for expansion, $2 million for cost reduction and $14 million for the maintenance of business.
We continue to expect for the year 2021 capex of approximately $250 million for the most part, of course, for expansion projects.
We, in the third quarter generated cash from operations of $436 million on a trailing 12-month basis.
And also, on a 12-month basis, we generated $267 million free cash.
Despite increased capex, we also for the current year, expect a solid generation of free cash, quite in line with our provision.
Coming to our main product lines, starting with resistors.
With resistors, we enjoy a very strong position in the auto industrial, mill and medical market segments.
We offer virtually all resistor technologies and are globally known as a reliable high-quality supplier of the broadest product range.
Vishay's traditional and historically growing business has returned to record levels.
Sales in the quarter were $181 million, down by $12 million or 6% from previous quarter, but up by $35 million or 24% versus prior year, all excluding exchange rate impacts.
In the third quarter, in particular, some shortages of labor and limited sales.
The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter continued strong, 1.26 after 1.39 in the second quarter.
The backlog increased further to 7.8 months from 6.6 months in the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the quarter decreased to 27% of sales, down from a peak of 30% in Q2.
Main reasons were lower volume and higher metal and logistics costs.
Inventory turns in the quarter remained on a very high level of 4.7 after 5.1 in the second quarter.
Selling prices continued to increase, plus 0.5% versus prior quarter and plus 0.7% versus prior year.
We are in process to raise critical manufacturing capacities mainly for resistor chips and for power wirewounds.
And of course, we focus on hiring in the critical places.
We expect a very successful year for resistors.
The business consists of power inductors and magnetics.
Since years, our fast-growing business with inductors represents one of the greatest success stories of our company.
Exploiting the growing need for inductors in general, which had developed a platform of robust and efficient power inductors and leads the market technically.
With magnetics, we are very well positioned in specialty businesses, demonstrating steady growth there.
Sales of inductors in the third quarter were $85 million, flat versus prior quarter and up by $5 million or by 7% versus prior year, excluding exchange rate effects.
The book-to-bill ratio in the third quarter was 1.11 after 1.21 in prior quarter.
The backlog for inductors grew further to 5.4 months from 5.1 in the second quarter.
Gross margin continued to run at an excellent level of 32% of sales, slightly down from a peak of 34% in prior quarter.
Inventory turns were at 4.6, practically flat versus prior quarter.
There is a substantially reduced price decline at inductors, a slight price increase of 0.2% versus prior quarter and minus 1% versus prior year.
We are accelerating the next steps of capacity expansion for power inductors in order to get ahead of the demand curve.
Our business with capacitors is based on a broad range of technologies with a strong position in American and European market niches.
We enjoy increasing opportunities in the fields of power transmission and of ECAs, namely in Asia and China.
Sales in the third quarter were $116 million, 3% below prior quarter but 25% above prior year, which excludes exchange rate impacts.
Shortages of labor, also in the case of capacitors, limited manufacturing output and sales.
Book-to-bill in the third quarter for capacitors remained at very strong 1.7 on the level of the prior quarter.
Backlog increased to an absolute record of 8.9 months, up from 7.7 months in the second quarter.
Gross margin in the third quarter reduced to 21% of sales from 24% in the second quarter.
Lower volume meant further increased cost for metals, in particular, worsen the results.
Inventory turns in the quarter remained on a healthy level of 3.5 after 3.9 in prior quarter.
We are steadily increasing selling prices, 0.1%-plus versus prior quarter and 1.3%-plus versus prior year.
We expect a solid year for capacitors with growing opportunities in the future.
We remain confident for capacitors for the midterm in the light of increasing designed wins that we see.
Coming to Opto products.
Vishay's business with Opto products consists of infrared emitters, receivers, sensors and couplers.
Also in Opto, we see a strong acceleration of demand.
Sales in the quarter were $71 million, 6% below prior quarter, but 9% above prior year, which excludes exchange rate impacts.
We experienced quite substantial losses of manufacturing output due to COVID-related restrictions in Malaysia.
This situation should be resolved, for its resolved after all by all the workforce now has been vaccinated, will not repeat itself therefore.
Book-to-bill in the third quarter continued strong at 1.36 after extreme 1.69 in the second quarter.
Backlog continued to grow to another record high of 10.9 months after 9.3 months in prior quarter.
Gross margin in the third quarter improved further to 34% of sales after 32% in prior quarter.
I think we can say Opto continues to perform exceptionally well.
We have seen now more normal inventory turns of 5.0 in the quarter after 5.8 in the second quarter.
The selling prices are going up, plus 1.9% versus prior quarter and plus 5% versus prior year.
We modernized and expand our Heilbronn wafer fab and the production should start in the course of Q4, partially Q1 next year.
Opto products continue to be a very relevant factor for Vishay's growth.
Diodes for Vishay represents a broad commodity business where we are largest supplier worldwide.
Vishay offers virtually all technologies as well as the most complete product portfolio.
The business has a very strong position in the automotive and industrial market segments and keeps growing steadily and profitably since years.
Sales in the quarter were $185 million, up by $12 million or by 7% versus prior quarter, and up by $61 million or 49% versus prior year without exchange rate effects.
We see a continued strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.31 in the quarter after 1.45 in Q2.
Backlog climbed to an extreme high of 8.9 months from 8.5 months in prior quarter.
With growing volume, gross margin continued to improve to 25% of sales as compared to 24% in Q2.
Inventory turns were at 4.5 after 4.7 in prior quarter.
Selling prices keep increasing by 2.9% versus prior quarter and by 5.1% versus prior year.
We have started to expand our fab in Taipei introducing the 8-inch technology there.
The business with diode starts to exceed pre-pandemic levels.
Vishay is one of the market leaders in MOSFET transistors.
With MOSFETs, we enjoy a strong and growing market position, in particular, in automotive, which in view of an increasing use of MOSFETs will provide a very successful future for this product line.
The demand has reached quite extreme levels and increases further.
Sales in the quarter were $176 million, 5% above prior quarter and 31% above prior year, excluding exchange rate impacts.
Book-to-bill ratio in Q3 was 1.19 after 1.26 in the second quarter.
Backlog has grown further to an extreme level of 8.1 months as compared to 7.9 in the second quarter.
Higher volume, better selling prices and good efficiencies allowed gross margin to increase further to 31% of sales, up from 28% in the second quarter.
Inventory turns in the quarter were at 5.1, virtually flat versus prior quarter.
We are implementing price increases plus 1.5% versus prior quarter and plus 2.2% versus prior year.
MOSFETs remain absolute key for Vishay's growth going forward.
We intend to keep a proper balance between in-house manufacturing of wafers and purchases from foundries.
And this in mind, we decided to build a 12-inch wafer fab in Itzehoe in Germany, adjacent to our existing eight-inch fab, which will increase our in-house wafer capacity by 70%, 7-0 percent, within three to four years.
Let me summarize and let me emphasize the following: Clearly we, since a few years, enjoy very favorable economic conditions, and the end of the positive phase of the current cycle is not in sight.
But, I think much more important beyond all short-term speculations, the longer-term outlook for electronics and also for components is remarkably bright.
We expect noticeably higher growth rates for our products going forward than we have seen them in the past.
Vishay definitely is in a good position to benefit from this favorable trend.
We enjoy a very broad and strong market position.
We are a broad liner, and we are financially solid and therefore, in the position to take the right steps.
Results also for the fourth quarter look promising.
We guide to a sales range between $805 million and $845 million at a gross margin of 27.7%.
Over to you, Peter.
Vic, please take the first question.
","Vishay reported strong financial results for Q3 2021, with revenues of $814 million (up 0.7% QoQ and 27.1% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $0.63. Gross margin was 27.7% and operating margin was 15.2%. Despite facing challenges such as labor shortages and inflationary pressures, Vishay's sales grew, backed by price increases to offset higher metal and transportation costs. Backlog remains exceptionally high at a record 8.3 months of sales due to continued strong demand across all markets, except automotive. Cash flow generation was solid, with $79 million in free cash flow. The outlook for Q4 2021 is positive, with projected revenue between $805 million and $845 million, reflecting the ongoing favorable economic environment for electronic components. Vishay is strategically investing in capacity expansion to meet the growing demand for its products, particularly inductors, capacitors, and MOSFETs."
DKS_q1_2021.txt,"A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.
dicks.com for approximately 12 months.
And finally, a few admin items.
First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices.
Our consolidated same-store sales calculation includes stores that we chose to temporarily close last year as a result of COVID-19.
The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19.
Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers.
Next, as a reminder, due to uneven nature of 2020, we plan 2021 off of 2019 baseline.
Accordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020.
We are extremely pleased to announce yet another quarter of record results as we continued to execute at a very high level and capitalize on incredibly strong consumer demand.
We're in a great lane right now, and 2021 will be our boldest and most transformational year in the company's history.
We believe the future of retail is experiential, powered by technology and a world-class omnichannel operating model.
Importantly, we are reimagining the athlete experience, both across our core business and through new concepts that we have been working on for the past several years, which will collectively propel our growth in the future.
We've recently debuted DICK's House of Sport in Rochester, New York.
It's off to a great start and is on track to become among our highest volume stores in the chain.
We've reimagined virtually everything in the store and believe it sets the standard for sport retailing and athlete engagement.
Our partners who have visited the store all agree there is nothing like it, and we hope everyone has the opportunity to see it in person.
Next we are completely reengineering our Golf Galaxy business.
The game of golf is in great shape.
Our golf business has been tremendous.
With Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters, we're leaning into this straight by investing in our Golf Galaxy business and adding TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience.
We are also investing in talent to elevate the in-store service model and are remodeling 18 stores this year.
The new stores we've remodeled are showing promising results.
Looking ahead, we expect golf to have a long runway, and we are committed to leveraging this momentum for future growth within our business.
We've been working on Public Lands for several years and look forward to opening our first two stores later this year.
Based on our research, we think there is an opportunity in the marketplace and believe this new concept will be a great growth vehicle for us.
Importantly, conservation will play a prominent role in our new Public Lands concept.
And we will champion environmental issues as we speak up to protect the planet and our Public Lands.
As a member of the outdoor industry, we have also joined forces with other retailers to advocate for conserving 30% of the U.S. lands and waters by 2030.
We expect to have the same voice and as much impact on these issues as we've had inside the DICK's business, highlighting the youth sports crisis and sensible gun legislation.
We'll be sharing more details about our plans for Public Lands in the weeks and months ahead.
In closing, you can see DICK's is a growth company, and we will continue to invest in our business to grow our lead as the nation's largest sport retailer.
We see significant growth opportunities within DICK's and Golf Galaxy as well as with House of Sport and Public Lands.
We will continue to invest in our vertical brands.
And with our key partners, including Nike, North Face, Callaway, TaylorMade and others, to elevate the athlete experience across the stores and online.
Our Q1 consolidated same-store sales increased 115% as we anniversaried the majority of our temporary store closures from last year.
The strength of our diverse category portfolio, supply chain, technology capabilities and omnichannel execution helped us continue to capitalize on strong consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle.
We also saw a resurgence in our team sports business as kids began to get back out on the field after a year in which many youth sports activities were delayed or canceled.
Our strong comps were supported by sales growth of over 100% within each of our three primary categories; the hardlines, apparel and footwear as well as increases in both average ticket and transactions.
Like others, we also benefited from the recent stimulus checks.
These results combined translate to a 52% sales increase when combined -- sorry, when compared to the first quarter of 2019.
From a channel standpoint, our brick and mortar stores generated significant triple-digit comps, and importantly, delivered an approximate 40% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage.
Our eCommerce sales increased 14%, which was on top of our 110% online sales increase in the same period last year when the vast majority of our stores were closed for over six weeks.
This represented nearly a 140% increase when compared to 2019.
Within eCommerce, in-store pickup and curbside continued to be a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering, increasing approximately 500% when compared to BOPIS sales during the first quarter of 2019.
And as a percent of online sales, we saw sequential growth compared to the second half of last year.
These same-day services along with ship from store are fully enabled by our stores which are the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment.
During Q1, our stores enabled approximately 90% of our total sales and fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales through either ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside.
Throughout the quarter, we remained disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained.
As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 787 basis points versus 2020 and 312 basis points versus 2019.
This merchandise margin expansion, along with substantial leverage on fixed costs, drove a significant improvement in gross margin.
In total, our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79 not only represented a 511% increase over Q1 2019, but eclipse our full year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.59.
During the first quarter last year, we recorded a net loss per share of $1.71 as we temporarily closed our stores to promote the safety of our teammates, athletes and communities.
Looking ahead, we remain very enthusiastic about our business and we're raising our full year sales and earnings guidance.
Our financial outlook balances this enthusiasm with the uncertainties that still exist, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year.
Lee will address our outlook in greater detail within his remarks.
Now let me provide a few updates on our strategic growth drivers.
First, within merchandising, our well defined brand strategy drive differentiation and exclusivity within our assortments as we leverage both our key national brand partnerships and our highly profitable and growing vertical brand portfolio.
During the quarter, our vertical brands continue to be a significant source of strength, posting triple-digit comps with merchandise margin rate expansion that outperformed the company average.
We saw sustained success in DSG, our largest vertical brand as well as in CALIA, our second largest women's athletic apparel brand.
This year we are investing to make our vertical brands even stronger through improved space in-store and increased marketing.
In March, we augmented our men's athletic apparel collection by launching VRST, our new premium apparel brand that serves the modern athletic male.
The team has done a great job with VRST, and it's off to a really strong start.
Next, to increase engagement with our athletes, we're taking steps to dial-up service in our stores and to make our stores more experiential.
As Ed mentioned, we've been very pleased with the early results from our first DICK's House of Sport and are excited for the grand opening of our second location in Knoxville next week.
Virtually everything in House of Sport is new; from our engagement and service models to our merchandising standards, brands and concept shops as well as an adjacent outdoor field to host sports events and promote product trial.
These highly experiential stores are exploring the future of retail and they provide us a great opportunity to test and learn.
We'll continue to refine and grow the House of Sport concept while also rolling the most successful elements into our core DICK's stores.
Beyond House of Sport, we continue to evolve the DICK's athlete experience.
During the quarter, we added more than 30 soccer shops that provide a high level of service from in-store soccer experts who are especially trained to help athletes find the equipment and cleats they need to excel at the game.
The soccer shops also feature a variety of updated in-store elements, including an elevated cleat shop, an expanded selection of licensed jerseys and soccer trial cages in select locations.
We've been pleased with the initial results and plan to add additional shops throughout the year.
As discussed on prior calls, footwear is a key pillar of our merchandising strategy.
And during the quarter, we converted more than 40 additional stores to premium full service footwear.
Over 50 more stores will be converted by the end of the year, taking this experience to approximately 60% of the DICK's chain.
Lastly, as the number one premium golf retailer in the world, we are benefiting from renewed interest in the game.
Participation rates are healthy and energy for the game of golf continues to increase with women, juniors and young adults contributing to the game's growth.
As a result of this robust demand, our golf business has been great at both DICK's and Golf Galaxy with Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters.
In 2021, we're investing over $20 million to transform our Golf Galaxy stores via combination of elevated experience, industry-leading technology and unmatched expertise through our certified PGA and LPGA professionals.
As part of this, we've rolled out TrackMan technology to over 80% of the chain to enhance the fitting and lesson experience.
We've also completely redesigned nearly 20 stores.
In addition, we enabled online booking of lessons and club fittings and invested in talent and training to elevate our in-store service model.
We supported these efforts through our first Golf Galaxy specific brand campaign, Better Your Best, across TV, social and in-store.
Now moving to our omnichannel capabilities.
We continue to drive significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel through fewer promotions, leverage of fixed costs and strong athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside.
We're continuing to enhance the curbside experience with new features like proxy pickup as well as through improved inventory availability and reduced pickup wait time for athletes.
During Q1, over 90% of curbside orders were ready within 15 minutes.
And upon checking at the store, 50% were delivered to the athlete's car in under 2.5 minutes.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect curbside pickup will remain a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering as our athletes turned to this service for speed and convenience.
Along with curbside, our ScoreCard program continues to be a key to our omnichannel offering with more than 20 million active members who drive over 70% of our sales.
We're using data science to drive more personalized marketing and engagement with our athletes, which is resulting in strong retention of the 8.5 million new athletes we acquired last year.
Speaking of new athletes, we acquired nearly 2 million new athletes this past quarter.
And relative to our existing athletes, they continue to skew younger and more female, representing a great opportunity for future growth.
In closing, we are a growth company, steeped in technology and omnichannel experience with a bold path forward.
As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we are enthusiastic about our business and confident that our investments will strengthen our leadership position within the marketplace.
I had the pleasure of visiting many of our stores during this first quarter.
Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results.
Consolidated sales increased 119% to approximately $2.92 billion.
Including the impact of last year's temporary store closures, consolidated same-store sales increased 115%.
This increase was broad-based with each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear comping up over 100%.
Transactions increased 90%, and average ticket increased 25%.
Compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 52%.
Our brick and mortar stores comped up nearly 190% as we anniversaried last year's temporary store closures.
And compared to 2019, increased approximately 40% with roughly the same square footage.
Our eCommerce sales increased 14% over last year and increased 139% versus 2019.
As a percent of total net sales, our online business was 20%.
As expected, this decrease from the 39% of net sales in 2020 given last year's temporary store closures, but increased compared to the 13% we had in 2019.
Lastly, in terms of stimulus.
While this can be difficult to quantify, we recognize that our athletes had more cash spend during the quarter and believe we benefited from this during the first quarter.
Gross profit in the first quarter was $1.09 billion or 37.3% of net sales and improved approximately 2,100 basis points compared to last year.
This improvement was driven by leverage on fixed occupancy cost of approximately 1,000 basis points from the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 787 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions and a favorable sales mix.
Additionally, last year included $28 million of inventory writedowns, resulting from our temporary store closures, which were subsequently recovered in the second quarter of 2020 due to better than anticipated sales and margin on merchandise nearing the end-of-life upon the reopening of our stores.
The balance of the improvement was driven by lower shipping expense as a percent of net sales due to higher brick and mortar store sales penetration following last year's temporary store closures.
Compared to 2019, gross profit as a percent of sales improved by 795 basis points, driven by leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 475 basis points due to the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 312 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions.
SG&A expenses were $608.3 million or 20.84% of net sales and leveraged 940 basis points compared to last year due to the significant sales increase.
SG&A dollars increased $205.1 million, of which $21 million is attributable to the expense recognition associated with changes in our deferred compensation plan investment values.
This expense is fully offset in other income and has no impact on net earnings.
The remaining $183 million is primarily due to normalization of expenses following our temporary store closures last year to support the increase in sales as well as higher incentive compensation expenses due to our strong first quarter results.
SG&A expenses include $13 million of COVID-related safety costs, which in light of the latest CDC guidance, we expect these costs to decline significantly beginning in the second quarter.
Compared to 2019's non-GAAP results, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales, leveraged 446 basis points from the -- due to the significant sales increase.
SG&A dollars increased $122.3 million due to increases in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales and hourly wage rate investments and COVID-related safety costs as well as higher incentive compensation expenses.
Driven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, we delivered record quarterly non-GAAP EBT and EBT margin results.
Non-GAAP EBT was $477.1 million or 16.35% of net sales, and it increased $684.8 million or approximately 3,200 basis points from the same period last year.
More relevantly, compared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT increased $396 million or approximately 1,200 basis points as a percent of net sales.
In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79.
This is compared to a net loss per share of $1.71 last year and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 in 2019, a 511% increase.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.41.
This includes $7.3 million in non-cash interest expense as well as 9.2 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedge at settlement, but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation.
Both are related to the convertible notes we issued in the first quarter of 2020.
Now looking to our balance sheet, we are in a strong financial position, ending Q1 with approximately $1.86 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.85 billion revolving credit facility.
While our quarter end inventory levels decreased 4% compared to the same period last year, our strong flow of products supported Q1 sales growth in excess of our expectations.
Looking ahead, our inventory is very clean and we continue to expect a robust product flow.
In terms of supply chain expense, we are seeing elevated costs, which we expect to continue, but thus far have mitigated this pressure through higher ticket as a result of being less promotional and increasing prices in select categories.
Turning to our first quarter capital allocation.
Net capital expenditures were $57.2 million and we paid $33 million in quarterly dividends.
During the quarter, we also repurchased just over 1 million shares of our stock for $76.8 million at an average price of $74.59 and we have approximately $954 million remaining under our share repurchase program, and our plan for 2021 continues to include a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases.
Now let me move on to our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings.
As a result of our significant Q1 results, we are raising our consolidated same-store sales guidance and now expect full year comp sales to increase by 8% to 11% compared to our prior expectation of down 2% to up 2%.
At the midpoint, our updated comp sales guidance represents a 22% sales increase versus 2019 compared to our prior expectation of up 11%.
While we have been very pleased with the start of our second quarter and are highly encouraged about the rest of the year, beginning in June, we will start to anniversary significant comp sales gains from last year.
There is also continued uncertainty around when consumer behavior will normalize and what the new normal will be.
And we are limited in our ability to forecast demand, particularly as it relates to the second half.
Given this, within our updated outlook, we have maintained our Q3 and Q4 performance expectations in line with our original guidance, which assumes comps will decline in the range of high-single to low-double-digits.
Non-GAAP EBT is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion compared to our prior outlook of $550 million to $650 million, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, is up 142% versus 2019 and up 45% versus 2020.
At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10%.
Within this, gross margin is expected to increase versus 2019, driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins.
When compared to 2020, gross margin is also expected to increase driven by leverage on fixed expenses, while merchandise margins are expected to be approximately flat.
This assumes a gradual normalization promotions beginning in the second quarter and modest deleverage on fixed expenses in the second half.
SG&A expense is expected to leverage versus both 2019 and 2020 due to the significant projected increase in full year sales.
As a reminder, at the beginning of 2021, we transitioned last year's premium pay program to a more lasting compensation program, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums.
The impact of these programs has been included within our guidance.
In total, we are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $8 to $8.70 compared to our prior outlook of $4.40 to $5.20.
At the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, our updated earnings per share guidance is up 126% versus 2019 and up 36% versus 2020.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q1 results and remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK's Sporting Goods.
This concludes our prepared comments.
","DICK's Sporting Goods reported a remarkable quarter with record earnings and a 115% increase in same-store sales, driven by strong demand in golf, outdoor activities, and home fitness. eCommerce sales also surged by 14%, contributing to an overall 119% revenue growth. The company's strategic investments in omnichannel capabilities, including curbside pickup and enhanced in-store experiences, have proven successful. DICK's is also expanding its vertical brand portfolio and introducing new concepts like DICK's House of Sport to enhance customer engagement. In response to the increased interest in golf, the company is investing in its Golf Galaxy business with TrackMan technology, remodeled stores, and talent investments. The company has raised its full-year guidance, forecasting consolidated same-store sales growth of 8% to 11% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $8 to $8.70. Despite supply chain pressures, DICK's has maintained its strong financial position and plans to continue investing in its growth initiatives, including a minimum of $200 million in share repurchases in 2021."
ABM_q4_2020.txt,"Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that Earl joined less than a month ago after the fiscal year end; and although quickly acclimating himself to the business, should you have any questions after today's call, please follow-up with Investor Relations accordingly.
It's hard to believe we're already at the close of 2020 and covering our fourth quarter results.
On the other hand, we're about to discuss only the second full quarter of COVID-19's impact on our financials.
In Q4, we reported revenues of approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter.
This represents a 9.9% decline versus last year and a considerable sequential improvement when comparing to our more than 15% decline in Q3.
Once again, our diversified client base demonstrates the resilience of our business.
Our Technology & Manufacturing industry group grew almost 7% and Business & Industry as well as Education posted revenue results that were only slightly down.
As one would expect, our Aviation segment drove the majority of our organic decline versus last year.
Technical Solutions also saw a large revenue decline and continued to see challenges in site access, which affected churn rates.
Positively, the backlog of committed work in Technical Solutions is healthy and the pipeline for '21 is robust.
So all things considered, it was a good revenue story for the quarter.
From a profit perspective, there was sustained demand for higher margin COVID-related work orders and our enhanced cleaning program, particularly in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing.
Our financial performance was protected by our variable labor model and our ability to dynamically adjust staffing based on demand, and we continue to see profit arbitrage by efficiently managing labor as we scaled and consolidated staff during the quarter.
This has been one of the key contributors of our financial performance through the pandemic.
As a result of all of these factors, we grew earnings on both the GAAP and an adjusted basis versus last year.
Income from continued operations grew to $53.1 million or $0.78 per share.
On an adjusted basis, we delivered $46.7 million or $0.69 per share.
Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2% versus 5.6% last year.
Even more compelling, these results incorporate a non-cash reserve we took for an entertainment-related project within our Technical Solutions segment.
This was a unique circumstance in client, and not a reflection of our broader project portfolio within Technical Solutions.
This had 120 basis point impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin as well as our earnings.
So even when including this distinctive event, quarter-after-quarter, our performance continues to demonstrate consistent strength and execution.
In so many ways, 2020 will stand out as a pivotal year for ABM.
The pandemic has created a shift in the public mindset as professional Class A janitorial services are now unquestionably viewed as an essential and non-discretionary service.
Facility owners must demonstrate that they are providing clean, healthy and safe spaces that their occupants can trust.
Not only will this be required, but it will be a reflection of their brand.
Our response with our EnhancedClean service, gives our clients the peace of mind that comes with studied protocols and practices that keep facilities safe, and this offering creates even more distance between us and our competitors.
As a company that's been around for more than 110 years, ABM has withstood and grown during many global events.
But 2020 tested us in historic ways and I've never been more inspired by our organization.
I want to take a moment to recap some of our team's accomplishments more specifically.
Since March, we have been on the frontlines battling a pandemic that has disrupted nearly every industry.
While navigating a constantly evolving environment as we learn more about the virus, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees and our clients above all.
And when it came to PPE and our global supply chain, our procurement team did not disappoint when others in our space did, as they couldn't accommodate surging demands.
Also, we partnered with large cleaning contractors to form the Cleaning Coalition of America to represent our industry which played a critical role in restoring our country.
The Coalition plans to press for vaccine priority for our industry and developed a focused campaign on awareness around what differentiates best-in-class providers.
At ABM, we were particularly proud of how we proactively developed our own expert-backed certified programs to answer our client's needs with disinfection protocols, such as specialized training and signage, electrostatic spraying of disinfectant and air filtration.
And all of this is being supported by one of the most comprehensive marketing campaigns we've ever developed.
What shouldn't be minimized is the fact that we mobilized multiple cross-functional task forces across all the critical areas of our business that elevated our adeptness and will endure long past the pandemic.
These task forces led to improved operating procedures for labor management, sales and financial activities.
As an example, our approach to collections led us to generate more than $450 million in cash flow from operations and $420 million in free cash flow, both records for the firm.
This translates to nearly $1 billion of liquidity, including $400 million of cash, which is an extremely powerful position to be in during still uncertain times.
As we move into 2021, our intention is to capitalize on the momentum and shift from defense to offense.
Beginning with our executive team, we recently announced several appointments to further align our internal organizational structure to our business strategies.
Earl is a seasoned finance executive joining us from Best Buy, a leading Fortune 500 provider of consumer technology products and services with 125,000 employees in North America.
Earl held several executive positions across finance and most recently he was responsible for leading enterprise capital project planning plus transformation and procurement as well as supporting digital and technology and global real estate.
During his tenure at Best Buy, Earl also spearheaded several strategic initiatives targeting labor and logistics.
Earl joined less than three weeks ago but is quickly immersing himself in our business.
I'm also excited that Rene Jacobsen has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer and will lead all of our client-facing industry groups.
Since joining ABM eight years ago, Rene has consistently driven our operational performance and service excellence and his leadership was unquestionably instrumental in our successful navigation of 2020.
As COO, he will provide strategic guidance for our operations and drive our financial results across all of our platforms.
Rene will also continue to work with Sean Mahoney our new President of Sales and Marketing.
Since Sean's arrival in ABM in 2017, we've broken sales records each succeeding year and we achieved another record in 2020 with new sales at $1.2 billion, an amazing accomplishment for any year but especially in a year when so much of the economy was paused.
With both Rene and Sean's leadership, our operations and sales teams proved to be a powerful combination in 2020 and will undoubtedly exceed our expectations in 2021.
Speaking of 2021, later in the year, we will be sharing our refresh business strategy which builds on the positive changes and the acceleration we saw with our 2020 vision.
At that time, we will be reviewing our technology plan and path toward a digital platform for our employees and clients.
In fact, just as I discussed last quarter, some of our near-term investments are reengagements of IT projects that were put on hold due to the pandemic, like our ERP system and data management roadmap.
Other investments will be new given the opportunities that arose as a result of the pandemic such as EnhancedClean and the associated build of that program.
On that front, from a payback standpoint, we concluded the year with over $300 million in sales for our EnhancedClean program and COVID-related activities.
And we have some really exciting sales and marketing plans lined up over the next few months to continue accelerating and differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.
Of course, we will be responsible for our investment approach given how smooth the operating environment is but we recognize that we must plan for the long-term while also keeping our maniacal focus on what the near term may bring.
There's no doubt that conditions remain uncertain, particularly as we operate over the winter months.
COVID cases continue to rise throughout the country and I'm sure you've seen or experienced various stages of closures in your own communities.
Unfortunately, the operating environment isn't any more predictable than it was last quarter.
Clients are still generally managing for the shorter term as they react to resurgences, which caused occupancy volatility and they don't yet have the ability to predict when the workforce at large will return.
While vaccine news is encouraging, the widespread availability and use is also unknown today, which could impact the timing of recoveries and reopenings.
Therefore, our visibility remains limited and, as you would expect, we are not providing guidance for the full fiscal year in 2021.
However, we are going to share our near-term expectations for the first fiscal quarter.
This is the only time we anticipate guiding to such a short-term view, given the uniqueness of the moment.
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.58 in earnings per diluted share or adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share.
These ranges compare to last year's $0.41 and $0.39 respectively, both considerable increases on a year-over-year basis.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 6.1% to 6.4%, expanding from 4.3% last year.
At this time, we believe we may have seen the bottom in revenue compression as a result of COVID-19.
Sequentially, we could see similar to slightly better organic declines than what we saw in Q4.
We also anticipate good demand for pandemic-related work orders and EnhancedClean to continue throughout Q1.
The investments I discussed earlier should also continue into Q1, which you will see in both our segment profit and corporate lines.
In general, investments will continue throughout fiscal 2021 but the magnitude and cadence will be determined by both our long-term strategy and where we see the broader recovery going.
Earl will go through more detail on some of the assumptions for the quarter and year, which is obviously still dynamic.
Should we have better line of sight for the full year by Q2, we would anticipate providing full year guidance at that time.
This purpose has never meant more than it does today.
Our value to clients has risen because our teams have been the ambassadors of our brands and demonstrated the operational excellence that sets ABM apart from our competitors.
Nine months ago, we couldn't have imagined how 2020 would culminate for ABM.
We not only exceeded our pre-COVID expectations, but actually accelerated into a long-term EBITDA margin range of 5.5% to 6%.
Our 2020 vision journey has come to a climactic transition, leading us into the next phase of growth and excellence and building on a strong foundation to propel us into the future.
Next year, we'll also mark our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange and we look forward to celebrating this milestone at ABM's history.
So, while last year was certainly a memorable one for our organization, I'm now looking forward to the opportunities that lie ahead and I am more excited than ever.
Now, to Earl, who'll cover our financial results.
I am so excited to be part of the ABM team.
I recognized early on that the culture here is so special and unique.
Even in just my first few weeks here, I have witnessed an exceptional drive to collaborate and execute that clearly sets ABM apart.
As I spend the next several months diving into the business, I look forward to developing and sharing my perspectives on our financial strategies over future calls.
Now, onto our quarterly results.
Revenue for the quarter were $1.5 billion, a total decrease of approximately 9.9% compared to last year, reflecting our second full quarter of COVID-19 revenue declines, particularly in the Aviation and Technical Solutions segment.
Partially offsetting this revenue decline was continued demand for higher margin work orders that we have been providing for our clients through the pandemic, particularly within business and industry and technology and manufacturing.
GAAP income from continuing operations was $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $48.1 million or $0.71 last year.
These results reflect the continuation of favorable claims trend related to health insurance reserves.
We saw a benefit of $21.3 million in self-insurance adjustments, of which $6.2 million was related to the current year.
On an adjusted basis, income from continued operations for the quarter increased to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $44.7 million or $0.66 last year.
Similar to the third quarter, our GAAP and adjusted earnings growth versus last year was driven primarily by a significant increase in higher margin work orders as clients respond to COVID-19 as well as the continued management of direct labor to align with the demand environment for legacy services.
Partially offsetting these results was a $17.6 million reserve for notes receivables for a project related to a unique family entertainment customer within the Technical Solutions segment.
We are currently working with the client to resolve this issue.
In addition, operational investments in such areas as our EnhancedClean program continued, which was embedded in our operating segment results.
We also reengaged certain corporate projects such as investments in IT, that were previously put on hold as we prioritized business continuity during the pandemic.
This amount was approximately $10 million for the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter also experienced one less workday which equates to approximately $6 million in labor expense savings.
I'll speak about the cadence of our working days for fiscal 2021 later in the call.
But the number of days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 will be comparable at 65 days.
Our overall performance during the quarter led to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $92.5 million at a margin rate of 6.2% compared to $93 million or 5.6% last year.
Now, for a discussion of our segment results.
As a reminder, these results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on revenue.
Operating profit reflects the mix shift toward higher margin work orders, labor modulation on legacy service demand, as well as operational investments such as EnhancedClean.
B&I revenues were $794.3 million, down just 1.6%.
We're encouraged by the sequential top line improvement compared to a decline of 6.3% last quarter.
The pandemic's negative impact on our parking and sports and entertainment business continued this quarter, similar to Q3.
Offsetting this COVID compression and the loss of some lower margin business, we had consistently strong demand for higher margins pandemic-related work orders.
This led to a more favourable mix of B&I business that led to operating profit growth of more than 65% to $84.7 million with a margin rate of 10.7%.
Another very resilient segment for us during the pandemic has been our T&M business.
Revenues were $245.5 million for the quarter, up 6.7% versus last year.
Operating profit grew more than 30% to $23.5 million for an operating margin of 9.6%.
This segment is particularly comprised of essential service providers such as biopharma, logistics and industrial manufacturing.
As a result, demand has been driven by work order and EnhancedClean work, more than offsetting any COVID-related and other account losses throughout the year.
In education, we reported revenue of $212.2 million, reflecting the new school season and the adoption of hybrid models across our K-12 and higher education portfolios.
Operating profit of $15.1 million or 7.1% margin reflects labor-related savings as a result of modified staffing at site locations during the pandemic.
As many of us are likely experiencing today with our own children, there remains a great deal of variability in this segment as different cities respond to resurgences, particularly ahead of the holiday season.
We continue to monitor developments and partner with our clients to address both day-to-day cleaning and disinfection needs, as well as longer term budget constraints, where our technical solutions offering can be compelling.
Aviation reported revenues of $141 million, and an operating profit of $3.5 million, clearly demonstrating how the pandemic continues to have a dramatic impact on the industry.
However, as discussed last quarter, our goal was to achieve a breakeven position or better by the fourth quarter.
We are pleased to have closed the year in a profitable position.
And now onto Technical Solutions, which reported revenues of $123.1 million compared to $175.5 million last year.
As a reminder, this segment experienced phenomenal growth last year, exceeding 25% during Q4 of fiscal '19.
In addition to tougher compare, site access has been disrupted by the pandemic.
Backlog remains in our healthy zone, which we've historically defined as above the $150 million.
We are actively monitoring our ability to churn through these projects.
The operating loss of $3.6 million was driven by a reserve of notes receivables related to a single entertainment customer and associated with the client increasing credit risk resulting from the pandemic, which we continue to pursue.
Turning to cash and liquidity.
During the quarter, we generated a record $198.7 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $189.6 million for the quarter.
This led to $457.5 million in cash flow and $419.5 million of free cash flow for the year.
As a reminder, these results include $101 million in deferred U.S. payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, which will be due in 2021 and 2022.
Even excluding this, these are records for the year.
Due to our strong cash position, we ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit of $883.4 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 2.1 times.
Additionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $394.2 million.
During the quarter, we paid our 218th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for a total distribution of approximately $12.3 million.
Now, for a quick recap of our annual results.
Total revenues were approximately $6 billion, a decrease of 7.9% versus last year.
The decrease in revenues was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on business operations, predominately during the third and fourth quarters of this year.
Our GAAP income from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was $0.2 million.
On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the year was $163.5 million or $2.43 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year increased 6.6% to $361.9 million and we ended the fiscal year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 6%.
Now, turning to our guidance outlook.
We are providing guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
At this time, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be in a range of $0.53 to $0.58 and adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.60 to $0.65.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is anticipated to be between 6.1% to 6.4%.
This guidance outlook assumes organic growth will be sequentially flat to slightly improved versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
We anticipate a higher margin work orders and labor efficiencies to continue into the first quarter.
And as Scott discussed extensively, we are planning to invest in fiscal 2021.
The first quarter will see the same level of investments that we saw during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of approximately $10 million.
The first quarter will also have one less working day versus last year, which could lead to approximately $6 million in lower labor expense.
However, we are preparing for the potential for higher payroll taxes beginning in January for SUI, FUI, as well as federal taxes such as FICA.
With respect to interest, based on our operating expectations for the first quarter and our current cash position, we do not anticipate an increase in borrowings compared to the fourth quarter.
Therefore, sequentially, interest expense should decrease slightly due to the continuing amortization of our term loan.
The tax rate for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately 30%.
This rate excludes discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and a tax impact of stock-based compensation awards, the total impact of which we currently expect will be under $1 million in Q1.
With respect to cash flow, we assume government-related benefits in the U.K. and U.S., such as the CARES Act, will not recur.
This should be considered when ascertaining free cash flow for the new fiscal year.
However, we drove higher free cash flow as a result of sharper operational practices in response to the pandemic.
And we intend to continue to uphold these standards and disciplines.
Lastly, related to taxes, in fiscal '20, our full-year impact for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit was $4 million, reflecting the pandemic's impact on traditional hiring practices.
Currently, WATSI [phonetic] is expected to expire on December 31 of this calendar year.
However, we are actively monitoring Congress for related action, including an extension on WATSI.
On the heels of such strong results for 2020, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming quarters.
","ABM reported a 9.9% revenue decline to $1.5 billion in Q4, primarily due to the COVID-19 impact on Aviation and Technical Solutions segments. However, Technology & Manufacturing and Business & Industry saw growth. Despite the pandemic, earnings on both GAAP and adjusted basis increased year-over-year, driven by higher margin COVID-related work orders and effective labor management. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2%, demonstrating consistent strength even with a non-cash reserve taken for a Technical Solutions project. ABM's EnhancedClean service, introduced during the pandemic, generated over $300 million in sales, creating a competitive advantage. The company plans to invest in the first quarter, including IT projects and operational initiatives. For Q1, ABM forecasts adjusted EPS between $0.60 and $0.65 and GAAP EPS between $0.53 and $0.58. The company anticipates organic growth to be similar to Q4, with continued demand for higher margin work orders. Despite economic uncertainty, ABM remains optimistic and plans to provide full-year guidance in Q2 if visibility improves."
ELY_q3_2020.txt,"I'm Patrick Burke, the company's head of investor relations.
We are pleased to be with you today to discuss our Q3 results, results that have exceeded our expectations, and strengthened our confidence in the future.
With recently announced plans to merge with Topgolf, we are naturally anticipating further questions on that subject as well.
Having said this, and turning to Page 6, let's now jump into our results.
We were pleased with our results in virtually all markets and business segments.
Our golf equipment segment has been experiencing unprecedented demand globally as interest in the sport and participation has surged.
We saw strong market conditions in all markets globally.
According to Golf Datatech, U.S. retail sales of golf equipment were up 42% during Q3, the highest Q3 on record.
U.S. rounds were up 25% in September, and are now showing full-year growth despite the shutdowns earlier this year.
We also believe there will be a long-term benefit from the increased participation as we are welcoming both new entrants and returning golfers back to our sport.
Golf retail, outside of resort locations, remains very strong at present and barring a shutdown situation has not been sensitive to the upticks in COVID cases.
Inventory at golf retail is at all-time lows and is likely these low inventory levels will continue into next year.
Callaway's global hard goods market shares remained strong during the quarter.
We estimate our U.S. market share is roughly flat year over year.
Our share in Japan is up slightly, and our share in Europe is down slightly.
On a global basis, I believe we remain the leading golf company in terms of market share and total revenues, and the No.
In the U.S., third-party research showed our brand to once again be the #1 club brand in overall brand rating as well as the leader in innovation and technology.
Over the last several years, we have shown resilience with these important brand positions.
We have also started to show our 2021 product range to key customers and are receiving strong feedback.
Turning to our soft goods and apparel segment, with total revenue only down 3.4% year over year, the segment also experienced a rapid recovery in demand during the quarter.
The speed and magnitude of the recovery exceeded our expectations.
Like our golf equipment business, this segment appears to be well-positioned for both the months and years ahead, both during the pandemic and after.
Looking at individual businesses in this segment, both our TravisMathew and Callaway branded businesses experienced significant year-over-year growth during the quarter.
Jack Wolfskin was down year over year but only 16% on a revenue basis with improved trends continuing into October.
The hero of the soft goods and apparel segment is certainly e-com, a channel that was strengthened by investments we've made over the last several years.
As a result of these investments, we were able to deliver a 108% year-over-year growth in this channel during the quarter.
E-com is now a significant portion of the channel mix of this segment.
We believe our expanded capabilities and strength here will bolster this business growth prospects and profitability going forward.
Long term, we continue to expect our apparel and soft goods segment to grow faster than our overall business, and with that growth to deliver operating leverage and enhance profitability.
And although the pandemic delayed our efforts, we still believe we'll be able to deliver $15 million of synergies in this segment over the coming years.
During the quarter, we also made good progress on key initiatives, including the transition to our new 800,000 square-foot Superhub distribution center located just outside of Fort Worth, Texas.
We are now completely consolidated into this new facility.
We also made further progress in our Chicopee golf ball facility modernization with productivity rates in this plant ramping positively during the quarter.
The primary investment phase on both of these significant projects is behind us now.
Looking forward, we are in a strong financial position and are pleased with the pace of our recovery and the business trends we have seen.
With the resurgence in the virus, there clearly could be some volatility over the next few months.
Portions of Q4 are likely to be at least partially impacted by the increase in restrictions being put into place globally.
Fortunately, for us, either low impact months for our golf equipment business, and we currently expect to continue to benefit from increased year-over-year demand.
In our apparel and soft goods segment, the impact will be larger than our golf equipment business.
But these businesses, too, are fortunate to be well-positioned in this environment and also benefit from strong e-com capabilities, which should offset some portion of any potential negative impacts in markets where in-store shopping might be constrained.
We also benefit from global scale and diversity across all of our segments.
As demonstrated by our Q3 results, we are fortunate in that our principal business segments are well-positioned for consumer needs and trends, both during the pandemic and afterward.
In addition, we are confident that we have both brands, human capital, and financial strength necessary to not only weather this storm but to also perform well during it and to emerge stronger than when we entered the crisis.
In closing, while we are pleased with our recent results and outlook, the safety and health of the company's employees, customers, and partners continue to be paramount in our minds.
As we operate our businesses, we are careful to follow appropriate protocols for social distancing, in-office capacity management, personal protective equipment, and other safety precautions.
In addition, our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to those directly impacted by the virus and those diligently working on the front line to protect, serve, and care for the rest of us.
Brian, over to you.
We are happy to report record net sales and earnings for the third quarter of 2020.
We feel fortunate that both our golf equipment and soft goods businesses are recovering faster than expected as both businesses support healthy, active outdoor lifestyles and activities that are compatible with social distancing.
This faster-than-expected recovery has placed us in a position of strength.
Our available liquidity, which includes cash on hand plus availability under our credit facilities increased to $630 million on September 30, 2020, compared to $340 million on September 30, 2019.
We are also excited about our prospective merger with Topgolf, which also provides a healthy, active, outdoor activity that is compatible with social distancing.
And Callaway Topgolf merger is a natural fit.
With the significant overlap in golf consumers, there should be significant advantages to both businesses through increased consumer engagement, marketing, and sales opportunities and faster growth than could be achieved on a stand-alone basis.
And the best part is that these synergies provide upside to the financial model we provided.
The financial returns of this transaction are so compelling, we did not need the synergies to justify the transaction.
Growing the Topgolf Venue and Toptracer businesses alone will create significant shareholder value.
We look forward to discussing the Topgolf business further during the virtual investor conference on Thursday.
In evaluating our results for the third quarter, you should keep in mind some specific factors that affect year-over-year comparisons.
First, as a result of the Jack Wolfskin acquisition in January 2019, we incurred nonrecurring transaction and transition-related expenses in 2019.
Second, as a result of the OGIO, TravisMathew, and Jack Wolfskin acquisition, we incurred non-cash amortization in 2020 and 2019, including amortization of the Jack Wolfskin inventory step-up in the first quarter of 2019.
Third, we also incurred other nonrecurring charges including costs related to the transition to our new North American distribution center in Texas.
Implementation costs related to the new Jack Wolfskin IT system and severance costs related to our cost reduction initiatives.
Fourth, the $174 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020 is nonrecurring and did not affect 2019 results.
Fifth, we incurred and will continue to incur non-cash amortization of the debt discount on the notes issued during the second quarter of 2020.
We have provided in the tables to this release as scheduled breaking out the impact of these items on the third quarter and the first nine months' results, and these items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
With those factors in mind, I will now provide some specific financial results.
Turning now to Slide 10.
Today, we are reporting record consolidated third quarter 2020 net sales of $476 million, compared to $426 million in 2019, an increase of $50 million or 12%.
This increase was driven by a 27% increase in the golf equipment segment, resulting from a faster-than-expected recovery and the strength of the company's product offerings across all skill levels.
The company's soft goods segment is also recovering faster than expected, with third-quarter 2020 sales decreasing only 3.4% versus the same period in 2019.
Changes in foreign currency rates had an $8 million favorable impact on third-quarter 2020 net sales.
Gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter of 2020, compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of 270 basis points.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 42.7% in the third quarter, compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of 220 basis points.
This decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in gross margin in the soft goods segment due to the impact of COVID-19 on that business, including our proactive inventory reduction initiatives, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, an increase in e-commerce sales, and a slight increase in overall golf equipment gross margins.
Operating expenses were $137 million in the third quarter of 2020, which is a $14 million decrease, compared to $151 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $135 million, a $12 million decrease compared to the third quarter of 2019.
This decrease is due to decreased travel and entertainment expenses and the actions we undertook to reduce costs in response to the COVID pandemic.
Other expense was $6 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to other expense of $7 million in the same period of the prior year.
On a non-GAAP basis, other expense was $3 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $7 million for the comparable period in 2019.
The $4 million improvements were primarily related to a net increase in foreign currency-related gains period over period, partially offset by a $1 million increase in interest expense related to our convertible notes.
Pretax earnings were $58 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to pre-tax earnings of $33 million for the same period in 2019.
Non-GAAP pre-tax income was $65 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to non-GAAP pre-tax income of $37 million in the same period of 2019.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.54 on 96.6 million shares in the third quarter of 2020, compared to earnings per share of $0.32 on 96.3 million shares in the third quarter of 2019.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were $0.60 in the third quarter of 2020, compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $0.36 for the third quarter of 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA was $87 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2019, a record for Callaway Golf.
Turning now to Slide 11.
The first nine months of 2020 net sales are $1.2 million, compared to $1.4 million in 2019, a decrease of $174 million or 13%.
The decrease was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in our e-commerce business.
The decrease in net sales reflects a decrease in both our golf equipment segment, which decreased 7%, and our soft goods segment, which decreased 21%.
This decrease also reflects a decrease in all major regions and product categories period-over-period due to COVID-19.
Change in the foreign currency rates positively impacted first nine months 2020 net sales by $2 million.
Gross margin was 42.7% in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 45.8% in the first nine months of 2019, a decrease of 310 basis points.
Gross margins in 2020 were negatively impacted by the North America warehouse consolidation and in 2019 were negatively impacted by the nonrecurring purchase price step-up associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these recurring items -- excuse me, nonrecurring items, gross margin was 43.3% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 46.6% in the first nine months of 2019, a decrease of 330 basis points.
The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales related to the COVID-19 pandemic, costs associated with idle facilities during the government-mandated shutdown, and the company's inventory reduction initiatives.
The decrease in gross margin during the first nine months was partially offset by an increase in the company's e-commerce business.
Operating expense was $592 million in the first nine months of 2020, which is a $111 million increase compared to $481 million in the first nine months of 2019.
This increase is due to the $174 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name.
Excluding the impairment charge and other items previously mentioned, non-GAAP operating expenses for the first nine months of 2020 were $410 million, a $58 million decrease, compared to $468 million in the first nine months of 2019.
This decrease is due to our cost reduction initiatives, decreased travel and entertainment expenses as well as a reduction in variable expenses due to lower sales.
Other expense was approximately $7 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared to other expense of $28 million in the same period in the prior year.
On a non-GAAP basis, other expense was $3 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to $24 million for the same period of 2019.
The $21 million improvements is primarily related to a $22 million increase in foreign currency-related gains period over period, including the $11 million gain related to the settlement of the cross-currency swap arrangement.
Pretax loss was $80 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared to pre-tax income of $127 million for the same period in 2019.
Excluding the impairment charge and other items previously mentioned, non-GAAP pre-tax income was $113 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to non-GAAP pre-tax income of $155 million in the same period of 2019.
Loss per share was $0.92 on $94.2 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared to earnings per share of $1.13 on 96.2 million shares in the first nine months of 2019.
Excluding the impairment charge and the items previously mentioned, non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share was $0.98 in the first nine months of 2020, compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $1.35 for the first nine months of 2019.
Adjusted EBITDAS was $175 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared to $216 million in the first nine months of 2019.
Turning now to Slide 12.
I will now cover certain key balance sheet and cash flow items.
As of September 30, 2020, available liquidity, which represents additional availability under our credit facilities plus cash on hand was $637 million compared to $340 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019.
This additional liquidity reflects improved liquidity from working capital management, our cost reductions, and proceeds from the convertible notes we issued during the second quarter.
We had a total net debt of $498 million, including $443 million of principal outstanding under our term loan B facility that was used to purchase Jack Wolfskin.
Our net accounts receivable was $240 million, an increase of 7%, compared to $223 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which is attributable to record sales in the quarter.
Day sales outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days as of September 30, 2020, compared to 56 days as of September 30, 2019.
We continue to remain very comfortable, if not pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of our accounts receivable at this time.
Also displayed on Slide 12, our inventory balance decreased by 5% to $325 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020.
This decrease was primarily due to the high demand we are experiencing in the golf equipment business, partially offset by higher soft goods inventory related to COVID-19.
Our teams have done an excellent job being proactive with regard to managing inventory as soon as COVID hit us.
They continue to be highly focused on inventory on hand as well as inventory in the field.
We are very pleased with our overall inventory position and the inventory at retail, particularly on the golf side of the business, which remains low at this time.
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2020 were $31 million, compared to $37 million for the first nine months of 2019.
We expect our capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately $35 million to $40 million, up slightly from the estimate we provided in May but down substantially from our $55 million of planned capital expenditures at the beginning of the year due to our cost reduction actions.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $203 million for the first nine months of 2020.
On a non-GAAP basis, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding the $174 million impairment charge, was $29 million for the first nine months of 2020 and is estimated to be $35 million for the full year of 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $25 million for the first nine months of 2019 and $35 million for full-year 2019.
I'm now on Slide 13.
As we previously reported, we are no longer providing other specific financial guidance at this time due to continued uncertainty surrounding the duration and impact of COVID-19.
Although we expect some level of continued volatility due to the ongoing pandemic, third-quarter trends have thus far continued into the fourth quarter.
Perhaps more importantly, all of our business segments as well as the Topgolf business support an outdoor, active, and healthy way of life that is compatible with the world of social distancing.
And we now appreciate even further that all of our businesses are likely to be favored in both the realities of the current environment as well as anticipated consumer trends post-pandemic.
These circumstances, along with our increased liquidity will allow us to weather the pandemic and emerge in a position of strength to the benefit of our businesses and the Topgolf business post-merger.
As Chip mentioned in his remarks, due to time constraints, the primary focus of the Q&A should be the Callaway business, and we have scheduled a virtual conference on Thursday to discuss the Topgolf business further.
Operator, over to you.
","Callaway Golf reported strong Q3 results, exceeding expectations and bolstering confidence in the future. The golf equipment segment experienced a substantial 27% increase in sales due to increased demand and strong product offerings, while the soft goods segment's recovery exceeded expectations with only a 3.4% decrease. The company's record net sales of $476 million represented a 12% year-over-year growth. Market conditions remain favorable, with U.S. golf equipment sales up 42% and U.S. rounds up 25% in September. Inventory at golf retail is at record lows and is expected to continue into next year. Despite the pandemic, the company's liquidity has increased to $630 million, and they are well-positioned to weather the ongoing challenges and emerge stronger. The merger with Topgolf, a complementary business, provides significant financial upside and growth opportunities."
BR_q3_2021.txt,"Joining me on the call today are Tim Gokey, our Chief Executive Officer; and our Chief Financial Officer, Edmund Reese.
A summary of these risks can be found on the second and third page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.
We will also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results.
I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives.
It's an exciting time to be at Broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started.
I'm pleased to share that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results.
Recurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%.
Our results in both ICS and GTO are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization, mutualization and the democratization of investing.
These trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes.
We're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management.
I'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes.
A combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business.
We've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti.
We're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line.
We now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%.
While the new guidance reflects the impact of Itiviti, the bulk of this raise is organic, as Edmund will discuss.
The net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and M&A investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.
We remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns.
Broadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan.
So let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on Slide five.
I'll start with ICS.
Recurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth.
The biggest driver of ICS' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and I'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results.
Let me share two examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth.
The first is the Shareholder Rights Directive II.
Over the past two years, we've created a shareholder communications hub, linking millions of investors across the EU and with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way.
Now as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business.
Virtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues.
Over the past year, we've upgraded our VSM capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting.
Those upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth.
We are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring.
The second factor driving ICS was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter.
It's clear, the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth.
That strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients but has been most pronounced at the online brokers.
It has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases.
We did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called meme stocks like GameStop.
But those increases only contributed one point of the overall growth.
Commission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend.
It includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade.
Broadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments.
Looking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4.
To close off on governance.
Let me touch briefly on regulatory.
I want to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman.
As we have with every chair and administration of both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in the next generation of technology, to help the SEC achieve its mandate to better inform and protect investors, all while reducing cost for registers and creating a fair return for our shareholders.
Let's turn now to our capital markets franchise.
Capital markets' recurring revenues slipped by 1% as steady international growth was offset as expected by lower license revenues.
We anticipate this period of flattish revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog.
On the strategic front, our planned acquisition of activity represent a significant enhancement of our ability to drive value to our clients.
For those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me remind you why we think this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise.
As a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, Itiviti gives Broadridge a compelling opportunity to extend our capital market service offering.
The combination of Itiviti's front-office trading solutions, with Broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities, will allow us to serve our client's entire trade life cycle from order to settlement.
With increasing high frequency and algorithm trading, it's increasingly important to serve clients across traditional boundaries.
This combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and improve their front-to-back technology stack and operating model.
The combination also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income, and it substantially extends our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue chip clients.
The acquisition virtually doubles our business in APAC and further expands our reach in Europe.
That expanded footprint and scale positions us to take advantage of growing mutualization trends in both EMEA and Asia.
Itiviti adds more than $6 billion to Broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth, margins and earnings, as Edmund will discuss in his remarks.
Early feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, giving us added confidence that our front-to-back thesis and our near-term medium growth outlook are sound.
Also of note in our capital markets franchise is the continued development of our LTX fixed income trading platform.
LTX recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trading.
Enabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity for multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market, and I hope one of the many steps toward creating a more liquid corporate bond market.
To date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the LTX platform.
And an additional 14 institutions are signed in the onboarding process, including one of the world's largest fixed income managers.
Let's turn next to our wealth and investment management business, where revenues grew by 7%, driven by new client additions and higher equity trading volumes.
A key part of our growth strategy is to expand our sales of component solutions.
So it's terrific to see new client onboardings across a full range of our wealth and investment management products.
We also continue to make progress on building our industry-leading wealth management platform, which will help clients with the digital transformation of their wealth business.
We're already live with our average daily balance billing solution and industry milestone.
We're currently in active testing of our phone office workstation with select advisors, setting the stage for a period of extensive testing of the broader platform before going live.
Our sales and marketing efforts with several new clients to this platform are advancing well.
Clients see that using the Broadridge wealth platform to drive digitization by seamlessly connecting the back office functions we already provide, with additional select front and middle office capabilities, will drive a stronger top and bottom line by bringing new capabilities to advisors and clients while digitizing financial advisor, branch and back office interactions.
Another important part of our wealth strategy is developing a robust partner network to ensure that we can integrate cutting-edge capabilities from innovative partners.
Recent partnerships include Fligoo for predictive analytics and Anchor Bank for securities-based lending; and, a wealth management fintech accelerator.
These partnerships and others represent ongoing steps in building a network that will enable our clients to rapidly adopt new technologies.
When I spoke to you at the close of our fiscal third quarter a year ago, the economic outlook was deeply uncertain and from the New York area and much of the world was locked down.
My remarks at that time were focused on the steps we were taking to keep our associates safe and meet the needs of our clients in an unprecedented time.
Today, after 12 long months, there remains significant challenges and thinking, in particular, of our more than 3,000 associates in India and of their families and friends.
But the global outlook is unquestionably brighter, with increasing economic growth marching, hand-in-hand with rising vaccination rates.
The pandemic has also accelerated many long-term trends, including digitization, mutualization and next-generation resiliency.
And the lower cost and friction for investing is bringing in millions of new investors.
These changes are clearly having a significant impact across wealth management, governance and capital markets.
They're causing financial services leaders to rapidly adopt next-generation technologies.
And Broadridge is building the suite of capabilities that will help them navigate and win this period of change.
We do so from a position of strength.
We started the fiscal year last July expecting 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted earnings per share growth.
Our focus then was on driving enough expense savings to assure that we could continue to fund critical growth investments.
Fast forward nine months, and we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth, driven by a combination of strong new sales and healthy financial markets.
After achieving our expense targets, we're now investing heavily in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform and building next-generation capabilities across digital communications, wealth management and fixed income trading, among other investments.
We're also adding talent and investing in our people to make Broadridge the best place for the most talented associates in our industry.
Last but not least, we're on the brink of closing our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, expanding our capital markets franchise and further strengthening our global footprint.
And yet even after those investments and the near-term dilution from Itiviti, we're positioned to deliver 11% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth.
Broadridge is at its front foot and leaning into the opportunities we see ahead.
It has been a remarkable year.
Looking further ahead, we're on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
We see long-term trends continuing to drive demand for our services.
And our investments are creating new avenues for growth long beyond our current 2-year objectives.
The future of Broadridge is brighter than ever.
We've asked a lot of our team over the past 12 months, and they're delivering.
They stayed focused on clients, and through them are helping to build better financial lives for millions.
As you can see from the Q3 financial summary on Slide seven, Broadridge delivered another strong quarter.
Recurring revenue grew 8% to $900 million.
Adjusted operating income also grew 8% to $284 million.
Margins declined 60 basis points to 20.4% as we successfully made the investments that we discussed last quarter in our technology platforms, in our products, our people.
Our operating income was partially offset by a higher tax rate in Q3 '21 as we grew over discrete tax benefits in Q3 '20.
So our adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.76 in the quarter, up 5% over Q3 '20.
Now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with recurring revenue growth.
As I said, recurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter, powered by 7% organic growth, and comfortably within our historic mid- to high single-digit growth performance.
demonstrating the strength of our sustainable recurring revenue growth model.
As a result of that strong organic growth and an increase in our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're raising our guidance for recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% for the full year, up from our prior guidance of growth at the higher end of 3% to 6%.
Now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business on Slide nine.
I'll start with our ICS segment, where revenues grew by 11% to $586 million.
Regulatory revenues rose 20% to $290 million driven by the 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and ETF communications volumes and net new sales, including from our Shareholder Rights Directive II solution that Tim highlighted earlier.
We expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter with, our current testing indicating 25% equity record growth.
After a strong 12 months, we now have significant penetration of our VSM solution across the S&P 500, and we expect issuer revenue growth to ease going forward as we start to lap the increase of VSM activity that began in Q4 '20.
Fund solutions revenue was flat as double-digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business.
Customer communications revenues were also flat with double-digit growth in our high-margin digital products, offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic-depressed activity levels.
We expect growth in both our data-driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease.
Wealth and investment management revenues rose 7%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading.
Capital markets revenues fell 1% of strong growth from international sales, was offset by $6 million in lower license revenues, which declined as expected.
As we said last quarter, this flat revenue growth will continue in the Q4 '21 before picking up in fiscal year '22.
Let's turn to Page 10, where we show more detail on volume trends.
Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including stock record growth.
Over the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds and ETF has grown 6% to 8%.
Recently, equity record growth has accelerated to 11% in Q4 '20 and continued to increase through the year to 20% in Q3 '21, surpassing the estimates from our January testing.
As I said, we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25% in Q4 '21.
Mutual fund and ETF record growth picked up as well to 7%, more in line with our historical growth rates.
We are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity, mutual fund ETF records for fiscal year '22, with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half.
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see on the bottom of this slide.
This is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth.
This growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year, which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter.
More recently, trading volatility subsided during the second half of March, and we expect tougher trading volume comps in Q4.
Let's move to Slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue.
Organic growth at a very healthy 7% continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth, and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ICS and GTO.
We also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97%.
Internal growth contributed another three points as growth in ICS regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in GTO license revenue.
We've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Itiviti to add three points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth.
Total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 11%, with distribution revenue contributing three points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event-driven activity this quarter.
Moving forward, we continue to expect the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business.
Event-driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering.
Event-driven revenues have climbed over the past four quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter and reached $74 million in the third quarter, well above last year's unusually low $39 million.
Broadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions.
We expect fiscal '21 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average that we've seen over the past seven years.
For modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 13.
Adjusted operating income grew by 8%.
Our adjusted operating income margin declined by 60 basis points, reflecting the continued investments that we're making in our technology platforms and product capabilities that we highlighted on our last quarterly call.
These investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, right in line with our fiscal year '21 guidance and 3-year growth objectives.
This formula, forgoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth, will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business.
As a Chief Financial Officer focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines, giving us momentum toward future growth.
Our $124 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year.
We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions.
We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million.
Historically, the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals.
A handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could put us at the lower end.
And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenues as of Q4 '20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide.
We generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $54 million over the first nine months of fiscal year '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management.
During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $71 million in capex and software spending.
Our M&A investment through the first nine months of the year was 0, but that will change with our announced $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which I'll touch on in a moment.
Even after completing the Itiviti acquisition, Broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Importantly, we are also committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in M&A opportunities over the next several quarters.
Given our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5 times leverage target by the end of fiscal year '23.
Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio.
On Slide 16, we are on track to close the Itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks.
So let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that Itiviti will have on our financial performance.
I'll start with fiscal year '21.
We expect Itiviti to add $25 billion to $30 billion or one point to our full year recurring revenue growth, which equates to three points to our fourth quarter growth.
And the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted earnings per share growth.
In fiscal year '22, we expect Itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about eight points to our recurring revenue growth.
And we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately two to three points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted earnings per share growth.
Please note that Itiviti's results in both fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal '22.
This revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that I just shared with you.
Finally, I want to reiterate the commentary that I gave you when we announced the deal, about the impact on our 3-year growth objectives.
We expect Itiviti to add 2.5 to three points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth CAGR and, after interest, more than two points to our 3-year adjusted earnings per share CAGR.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 17.
We are raising our outlook for fiscal '21 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, and that includes one point of growth from Itiviti.
We are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%.
We continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth.
We expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, and that includes a 1-point drag from Itiviti.
Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million.
The Broadridge Financial model is working.
We are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth.
That growth is fueling our ability to both invest and expand margins.
At the same time, our strong free cash flow business model enables us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products and step up and make a significant M&A investment to grow our capital markets franchise.
The end result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.
It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted earnings per share growth and historically top quartile TSR.
","Broadridge delivered a strong third quarter with 8% growth in both recurring revenues and adjusted operating income. Strong new sales and equity record growth propelled revenues in ICS. GTO is benefiting from mutualization, digitization, and democratization trends. The company's strategic growth plan includes initiatives in governance, capital markets, and wealth and investment management. Broadridge is investing heavily in products, platforms, and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti. This investment is enabling the company to increase guidance for fiscal year 2021 to 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth and 11% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth, driven by both organic growth and Itiviti's contribution. Broadridge's strong third quarter results, continued internal investment and M&A strategy, and outlook for fiscal 2021 indicate that the company is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of its 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth."
SAH_q1_2021.txt,"This is Sonic Automotive.
That was very choppy from our perspective.
I want to be sure that the listeners can hear.
That must a bad connection.
I'm David Smith, the Company's CEO.
Joining me on the call today is our President, Mr. Jeff Dyke; our CFO, Mr. Heath Byrd; our Executive Vice President of Operations, Mr. Tim Keen; our Chief Digital Retail Officer, Mr. Steve Wittman; and our Vice President of Investor Relations, Danny Wieland.
During the first quarter of 2021, we continue to build on our strong momentum coming off record adjusted earnings in 2020.
We generated record first quarter total revenues of $2.8 billion, up 21% on a year-over-year basis and record first quarter earnings per share of $1.23 per share, tripling our adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 per share in the first quarter of last year.
These results were driven by strong performance in our franchise dealerships, and another all-time record quarter for our EchoPark business, reflecting increasing consumer demand and continued execution by our team.
I'm pleased to report positive trends in the first quarter have continued into the second quarter, and we continue to see strength in all facets of our business.
We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth targets based on our current results and near-term outlook and the increasing number of Americans that are receiving vaccinations and beginning a return toward normalcy.
Given these trends in our progress to date, we are confident we can attain our goal of more than doubling total revenues to $25 billion by 2025.
And significantly increasing profitability going forward.
In our core franchise dealership segment, first quarter revenues were $2.3 billion, a 15% increase from last year.
Total franchise pre-tax income was $70.5 million, an increase of $47.9 million or 211% compared to last year.
On a two-year comparison compared to the first quarter of 2019, same-store franchise dealership revenues increased 14% and pre-tax income increased by $49.8 million, which is a 240% increase, reflecting the impact of our lower expense structure as a result of strategic actions that was taken last year.
Turning now to EchoPark.
We continue to experience rapid growth during the first quarter, achieving all time record quarterly revenues of $507 million, which is up 53% compared to the same period last year.
We also achieved record quarterly retail sales volume of nearly 19,700 units, which is up 41% year-over-year and ahead of 18,000 to 19,000 units we guided to on our February call.
In addition to top line growth, we have to -- build of our EchoPark model that currently use vehicle pricing environment during the total gross profit per unit of $2,339 and above our target of $2,150.
Our first active part delivery center in Greenville, South Carolina continues to outperform our model selling 160 vehicles in March at nearly $1,750 in total gross profit per unit.
Generally $100,000 and store level profit for the month.
Our outlook in the EchoPark stores and delivery centers also continue to ramp aggressively.
With our Phoenix hub selling 228 vehicles in its full month in March, driving $125,000 of store level profit.
The unit ratio of December's used car acquisition is already ramping up nicely selling 300 plus in total gross profit per unit.
And we continue to apply our learnings to each new EchoPark store we opened or acquired.
And results are proving the scalability and momentum of the EchoPark model.
We believe these results showcase the flexibility, value proposition and consumer demand or EchoPark's unique pre-owned vehicle shopping concept as more guests choose to visit our stores and or shop echopark.com for the incredible inventory selection on diesel pricing and a unique guest experience that we offer.
As an update on our expansion of EchoPark's nationwide distribution network and omnichannel retailing platform, we opened five new locations in the first quarter.
In April, we opened our latest retail hub in Birmingham, Alabama and our third delivery center in Charleston, South Carolina.
We remain committed to opening 25 new EchoPark locations in 2021 and we're on track for our 140 plus point nationwide distribution network by 2025, which we expect to retail over 0.5 million pre-owned vehicles annually by that time.
With our progress to-date and the continuing development of our omnichannel retailing platform, we are confident that we can reach $14 billion in EchoPark revenue by 2025.
It's important to recall that Sonic actually grew earnings per share in the first quarter of last year compared to 2019 due to the strength of our January and February results despite the initial impact of the pandemic in March of 2020.
Since that time, we have substantially improved our expense structure, which was reflected in the current quarter's profitability and operating margins and our expectations for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
In the first quarter of 2021, total SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit were 72.2% representing a 830 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of last year and 790 basis points better than the first quarter of 2019 which in dollar terms, while same store franchise gross profit increased 34.5 [Phonetic] last year, same-store franchise SG&A expenses decreased $7.5 million, demonstrating the permanent expense reductions we had previously [Technical Issues].
Turning now to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $435 million in available liquidity and set an all time high liquidity mark in April at $570 million which included over $300 million in cash on hand.
More recently, the Company closed a new four-year $1.8 billion credit facility.
The credit facility was substantially oversubscribed with strong support from both new and incumbent financial partners.
We are very pleased with this transaction which has extended our debt maturities, improved our borrowing costs and raised our total available liquidity and fore-playing capacity to facilitate our growth plans.
Reflecting our current business momentum, expansion of liquidity resources, I'm very pleased to report that our Board of Directors recently approved 20% increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.12 per share payable on July 15, 2021 to all shareholders of record on June 15, 2021.
Additionally, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $250 million, bringing our total remaining authorization to $277 million.
In summary, our record first quarter performance reflects steadily increasing automotive retail demand as well as constantly improving operating conditions.
EchoPark has rapidly become one of the leading success stories in the pre-owned automotive retail industry, and we look forward to continuing its rapid expansion in 2021.
We expect to see continued strong demand for both new and pre-owned vehicles in the near term, which should drive further growth for our franchise dealerships and the EchoPark brand.
At the same time, our efficiency improvements have enabled us and had enabled us to operate in a much leaner more profitable manner.
Despite the challenges we all faced in the last year during this global pandemic, Sonic and EchoPark has emerged as much stronger, more efficient organization.
We are encouraged by our successes to-date and remain confident in our long-term strategic plans.
","Sonic Automotive reported a strong Q1 2021 with record revenue of $2.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.23, up from $0.40 in Q1 2020. Franchise dealerships contributed significantly to this growth, with revenues increasing 15% and pre-tax income tripling. EchoPark, Sonic's pre-owned car business, also achieved record quarterly revenues of $507 million, representing a 53% increase year-over-year, driven by strong demand and an expanded inventory selection. The company's expense structure has improved significantly, with total SG&A expenses decreasing as a percentage of gross profit. Sonic continues to expand its EchoPark network and expects to open 25 new locations in 2021, bringing its nationwide distribution network to over 140 points by 2025. With increased liquidity and a stronger credit facility, the company has also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share and expanded its share repurchase authorization to $277 million."
KMI_q2_2021.txt,"With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash flow.
Whether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date, or our projections for the full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow.
It's also apparent that we continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.
The question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash.
We have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.
This quarter, we announced two fairly significant acquisitions.
The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion.
These assets expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas.
The acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.
Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million.
Steve will talk about this acquisition in detail.
We believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy transition businesses; that we are exploring.
Now, let me conclude with two important points.
Both of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash.
I believe both fit within the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our board looks at all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.
On the Stagecoach, storage and transportation assets drew $1.2 billion.
We closed that transaction earlier this month.
It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline.
We're excited about this transaction for several reasons.
As we discussed on the first-quarter call, we think storage value is going to increase over time.
Its value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions.
Storage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the grid.
The Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system, as well as other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint, and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built.
We're excited about this transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.
The second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly formed Energy Transition Ventures Group.
We put that together in the first quarter of this year.
We're acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other closing conditions.
At signing, Kinetrex had secured three new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than six times EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023.
With Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market.
It gives us a nice head start on working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project candidates in the U.S. A few more points on this deal.
As several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the value is dependent on RINs value.
You don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception that I'll get to in a minute.
Importantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs, which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well.
D3s are for advanced biofuels and promoting more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from the environmental community than conventional ethanol.
Having said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility.
Based on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called voluntary market.
These are customers who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.
There are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value.
So we will look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.
When we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on attractive returns for our shareholders, not loss leaders and not doing things for show.
This deal is a great example of that.
In the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities.
So very good progress in a short period of time.
These two deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business.
The larger deal, Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest transportation and storage network in the country.
That reflects our view that our existing business will be needed for decades to come.
Hydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world.
That's something we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.
At the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and we're positioning ourselves there as well.
We're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries.
We're doing it in responsibly sourced, that is low methane emissions, natural gas.
We had our second such transaction this quarter.
We're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as well.
The Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start.
The takeaway from all of this is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.
First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.
Starting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter.
Transport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020.
And that was driven primarily by LNG, Mexico exports, and power demand on TGP, the PHP in-service, higher industrial and LNG demand on our Texas intrastate system, and then higher deliveries to our Elba Express LNG facility.
These increases were partially offset by lower volumes on CIG.
And that's due to declines in Rockies production and Fayetteville Express contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day.
That's a huge increase versus the second quarter of 2020.
LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter of this year by approximately 8%.
Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%.
Exports to Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020.
Our share of Mexico volumes is about 54%.
Overall, deliveries to power plants were relatively flat.
Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of '20.
For gathering volumes though, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter.
So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%.
And here, we saw nice increases in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%, and the Haynesville volumes, reports were up about 13%.
In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second quarter of '20.
Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year.
So we saw substantial improvement both year over year and quarter over quarter.
Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%.
Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and sequentially, they were up very slightly.
In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization remains high.
If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are leased.
Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products.
But that still remains a little bit below 2019, up 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking at gasoline and diesel.
We continue to experience some weakness in our marine tanker business.
But as we said last quarter, we expect that this market will improve, but it may take until late this year as the charter activity tends to lag the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel.
Mill utilization of our largest steel customer exceeded pre-pandemic levels.
Coal export economics improved for both met and thermal coal.
In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%.
CO2 volumes were down about 10% year over year.
Increased oil and NGL prices did offset some of the volume degradation.
But if you compare to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC.
CO2 volumes, we also expect to exceed our budget.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas volumes and demand from LNG and Mexico exports, as well as industrial demand on the Gulf Coast.
We're seeing increased gathering volumes in the Bakken and the Haynesville and nice recovery of refined products volumes.
Crude oil volumes are above our expectations in our CO2 segment, and we're getting some price help.
We still experienced some weakness in our Jones Act tankers, and the Eagle Ford remains highly competitive.
Now, let me give you a very high-level update of our full-year forecast.
As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full-year DCF of $5.4 billion.
That's above the high end of the range that we gave you last quarter.
The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion.
The outperformance versus the high end of the range is driven by our Stagecoach acquisition, higher commodity prices and better refined products volumes.
For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020.
This quarter, we generated revenue of 3.15 billion, which is up 590 million from the second quarter of 2020.
We also had higher cost of sales with an increase there of 495 million.
So netting those two together, gross margin was up 95 million.
This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of 1.6 billion.
So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of 757 million for the quarter.
Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.
Moving on to the segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance.
Natural gas -- our natural gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in our Texas Intrastate business, greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and increased volumes on our Bakken gas gathering systems.
Partially offsetting those items were lower volumes on our South Texas and KinderHawk gathering and processing assets and lower contributions from FEP due to contract roll-offs.
Our product segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume.
Terminals was up 17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery, partially offset by lower utilization of our Jones Act tankers.
Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2 volumes and some increased well work costs.
Those are partially offset by higher realized crude oil and NGL pricing.
Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million.
This is where we benefited from our organizational efficiency savings, as well as some lower noncash pension expenses, partially offset by some lower capitalized G&A costs.
Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby.
And that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Interest expense was $16 million favorable, driven by our lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt.
And those are partially offset by lower capitalized interest expenses versus last year.
Our cash taxes for the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing.
And for the full year, our cash taxes are in line with our budget.
Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our natural gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the quarter.
Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01 from last year.
On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8 times debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6 times at year-end.
Kim already mentioned that we updated our full-year guidance, which now has DCF and EBITDA above the top end of the range that we provided in the first quarter.
For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end the year at 4.0 times.
That includes the acquisitions of Stagecoach, which we closed on July 9, and Kinetrex, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
As a reminder, that level -- our year-end debt-to-EBITDA level has the benefits of the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during Winter Storm Uri earlier in the year, and our longer-term leverage target of around four and a half times has not changed.
Onto reconciliation of our net debt.
The net debt for the quarter ended at 30 billion, almost 30.2 billion, down 1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1.
Our net debt has now declined by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.
To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated 1.025 billion of DCF.
We paid out approximately 600 million of dividends.
We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures.
And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows, primarily interest expense accrual.
That explains the majority of the change for the quarter.
For the change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow.
We spent $1.2 billion on dividends.
We've spent $300 million on growth capex and JV contributions.
We received $413 million on our partial interest sale of NGPL.
And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425 million, and that explains the majority of the change for the year.
[Operator instructions] All right, Missy, let's open it up.
","Kinder Morgan, characterized by strong cash flow generation, has announced two strategic acquisitions: Stagecoach, expanding its natural gas storage and pipeline network, and Kinetrex, marking its entry into the renewable natural gas (RNG) market. Both acquisitions meet the company's investment criteria and leverage internally generated cash. The Stagecoach acquisition is particularly promising due to the increasing value of storage and transportation assets in light of intermittent renewable energy sources. The Kinetrex acquisition provides a platform for exploring the rapidly growing RNG market, mitigating price volatility through potential partnerships and long-term contracts. Despite an impairment charge, Kinder Morgan's second-quarter financial performance was solid. Overall, the company experienced increased demand in its natural gas, refined products, terminals, and steel businesses. Higher commodity prices and better volumes contributed to its strong performance. Projected 2021 DCF reached $5.4 billion, exceeding previous estimates. Kinder Morgan remains committed to dividend growth and expects to end 2021 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0."
PHM_q3_2021.txt,"Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.
These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports.
I look forward to speaking with you today about PulteGroup's third quarter operating and financial results.
In combination, top line growth and margin expansion helped drive higher earnings per share of $1.82.
This is an increase of 36% over the prior year's third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share.
Inclusive of these strong third quarter numbers through the first 9 months of 2021, our home sale revenues were up 22% to $9.2 billion while our reported earnings per share are up 36% to $4.85.
The resulting strong cash flow being generated by our operations continues to put our company in an enviable position in which we can invest in our business, return funds to shareholders and still maintain outstanding balance sheet strength and overall liquidity.
More specifically, consistent with our constructive view on the housing market, we have invested $2.9 billion in land acquisition and development so far this year.
Our $2.9 billion of land spend is comparable to what we invested for the full year in both 2020 and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, and we remain fully on track to invest approximately $4 billion in total for the full year of 2021.
I would highlight that while we are investing more into the business, we remain disciplined and focused on building a more efficient and lower-risk land pipeline.
At the end of the third quarter, our lots under option had grown to 54% of our total controlled lot position compared to when I set the initial 50% option target, we have over 65,000 more lots under option and now view 50% as the floor rather than the ceiling in terms of how we control our land assets.
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, along with investing $948 million more in land acquisition and development through the first 9 months of 2021 compared with last year, we have also returned $726 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have paid off nearly $800 million in debt this year, leaving us with a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 5.7%.
Finally, consistent with our strategic focus, our operating and financial performance has helped drive a return on equity of 26% for the trailing 12 months.
Just like the broader economy, our operations continue to be impacted by the pandemic.
On one hand, we are managing through the disruptions COVID-19 and the Delta variant have inflicted on our workforce, our trade partners and the global supply chain.
On the other hand, our results have certainly benefited from the remarkable demand and pricing environment the homebuilding industry has experienced over the past 18 months.
Either way, to deliver our third quarter numbers during the global pandemic and with a supply chain that is clearly struggling reflects the commitment and tireless efforts of the entire PulteGroup team.
Since we updated our production guidance in early September, broader industry comments have validated the challenges within the construction supply chain are significant and don't have any quick fixes.
Based on a myriad of calls and questions we have received, I think it's hard for everyone to appreciate the full magnitude of the issues we're facing when you're not dealing with them on a day-to-day basis.
For some products, it's simply the materials aren't available.
Sometimes you can switch to an alternative.
But when you can, you wait.
For others, it's changing lead times where order fulfillment has gone from 6 weeks to 16 weeks, back to 11 weeks and then back to 16 weeks.
And for others, it's seeing allocations being imposed as manufacturers and distributors do their best to keep their major customers, which I would note we are one, at least partially satisfied.
Our local divisions may not get much advanced notice of the shortage resulting allocations so we have to adjust on the fly.
In other cases, it's logistics.
When you're forced to ship materials to solve near-term issues, this might be shipping siding from the Southeast to the Southwest or our trades driving across the state for paint.
In one form or another, these issues impacted our third quarter results and, as Bob will detail, will put additional pressure on our deliveries and margins in the fourth quarter.
As difficult and frustrating as this is, I can say that our suppliers have been outstanding partners and routinely bend over backwards to get us the materials we need to solve our issues.
I can say that we've been clear with our teams that we have to be -- that we have to overcommunicate with customers to keep them informed of any schedule changes.
We also have to be flexible and creative in sourcing materials even if this means spending additional dollars to acquire needed resources.
And finally, we must maintain our standards on the quality and completeness of each home that we deliver.
Given the very problems impacting the supply chain, we would expect a solution that -- we would expect that solutions will be found over different time lines, depending on the suppliers' underlying issue.
In the interim, we will adjust our production estimates for the fourth quarter and work to position the business for more consistent cadence in the year ahead.
We will also continue to work in close partnership with our suppliers to manage through the supply chain issues as quickly and as intelligently as possible.
Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating through the challenging production environment, which can be seen in the exceptional operating and financial results we delivered in the quarter.
Starting with our income statement.
Our home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 18% over last year to $3.3 billion.
The increase in revenues was driven by a 9% increase in closings to 7,007 homes in combination with an 8% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $474,000.
The higher average sales price realized in the third quarter reflects meaningful price increases we've realized across all buyer groups, with first-time up 8%, move-up up 10% and active adult up 8%.
The mix of homes we delivered in the third quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 44% from move-up buyers and 24% from active adult buyers.
In last year's third quarter, 30% of homes delivered were first-time, 45% were move-up and 25% were active adult.
Our net new orders for the third quarter were 6,796 homes, which represents a 17% decrease from last year that was driven primarily by a 14% decline in year-over-year community count.
In addition to fewer open communities, orders for the period were impacted by ongoing actions to manage sales paces to better align with current production volumes.
The actions to manage sales pace and outright restrict sales were more frequently targeted toward our first-time buyer communities as we strategically work to build up spec inventory within our Centex branded communities.
Looking at our third quarter orders in a little more detail.
Our orders from first-time buyers decreased 20% compared with last year.
This decrease was driven primarily by our actions to restrict sales as our first-time community count was only down 6% compared with last year.
In contrast, our orders from move-up and active adult buyers decreased 22% and 4%, respectively, which was driven by comparable 22% and 5% decreases in community count, respectively.
In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 768 communities.
Consistent with the guide in our recent market update, this is down 14% from last year's average of 892 communities.
Our Q3 community count should be the low watermark for the year as we expect our fourth quarter community count to increase to approximately 775 active communities.
Further, our existing land pipeline should allow us to realize a meaningful ramp-up in community count as we move through 2022.
As is our practice, we will provide more specifics on 2022 community count as part of our fourth quarter earnings call.
Our unit backlog at the end of the third quarter was up 33% over last year to 19,845 homes.
The dollar value of our backlog increased an even greater 56% to $10.3 billion as we benefited from robust price increases realized over the course of this year.
At the end of the third quarter, we had 18,802 homes under construction, of which 83% were sold and 17% respec.
We have almost 900 more spec homes in production than we did in the second quarter as we have been working to increase spec availability, particularly in our Centex communities.
In many instances, this has meant tightly controlling current period order rates, but we feel this is the appropriate action as we seek to better align our sales with the current pace of production.
Given that 90% of our specs are early in the construction cycle and we have only 109 finished specs, these units are about helping to position the company for 2022, rather than providing closings in 2021.
We faced similar dynamics within our production of sold units as 2/3 of these homes are in the earlier stages of construction, and we can see gaps in the supply of key building products needed to complete these homes.
Given these conditions, we believe it appropriate to update our fourth quarter guide for expected fourth quarter deliveries and currently expect to deliver approximately 8,500 homes in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 24% over the fourth quarter of last year.
It's difficult to say there are positives to be gleaned from the challenging production environment, but one of the outcomes is that the limited supply of homes, coupled with ongoing strong demand, has supported higher prices across the market.
Reflective of these conditions, our average price in backlog increased 18% or $78,000 over last year to $519,000.
Although more than half of our quarter end backlog is expected to deliver in 2022, we will continue to see the benefit of rising prices in our fourth quarter as our average closing price is expected to be $485,000 to $490,000.
At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of approximately 10% over last year.
Our reported homebuilding gross margin in the third quarter increased 200 basis points over last year to 26.5%.
Given that our third quarter closings absorbed the elevated lumber prices from earlier this year, expanding our gross margin by 200 basis points attest to the strong pricing environment the industry experienced over the past year.
It's worth noting that the strong market conditions also contributed to another step down in incentives in the period as discounts fell to 1.3%.
This is down from 3% last year and down 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year.
As our margin increase demonstrates, strong buyer demand has allowed the company to pass through the higher labor and material costs we've experienced.
That said and as Ryan discussed, we are knowingly incurring additional expenses to get houses built within today's challenged operating environment.
In addition to the incremental build costs we are absorbing over the short term to get homes completed, our reported gross margins are being influenced by the mix of homes closed.
As we also highlighted in our recent market update, certain of the homes that we expected to close in Q3 slipped into Q4 and others have been pushed out of the fourth quarter into 2022.
These conditions are impacting our reported gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 but set us up to realize gross margin expansion as we head into 2022.
That said, with the changing mix of homes we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter, coupled with the added material, labor and logistics costs we're paying to get homes closed, we currently expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be 26.6% or 26.7%.
This would represent an increase of 160 to 170 basis points over last year's fourth quarter and an increase of 10 to 20 basis points over the third quarter of this year.
We see the opportunity to build on this momentum as the strong pricing conditions we've experienced, coupled with the lower lumber costs we expect in next year's closings, should result in further gross margin expansion in 2022.
Our SG&A expense for the third quarter was $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues.
Prior year SG&A expense for the period was $271 million for a comparable 9.6% home sale revenues.
Given there's still increase in closings, we expect [Technical Issues] in the upcoming quarter expected to fall to a range of 8.9% to 9.2% of home sale revenues.
Looking at our financial services operations.
Our third quarter pre-tax income was $49 million versus $64 million last year.
As has been the case for much of this year, higher origination volumes have been offset by lower profitability per loan given more competitive market conditions.
The company's reported tax expense in the third quarter was $145 million, for an effective tax rate of 23.3%.
In the comparable prior year period, our effective rate was 14% as we realized a tax benefit of $53 million associated with energy tax credits recognized in the period.
For the third quarter, our reported net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share.
This compares with prior year adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the energy tax credits, of $363 million or $1.34 per share.
Moving over to the balance sheet.
Our business continues to generate strong cash flow, which allowed us to end the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash after significant investment in the business and continued shareholder distributions in the quarter.
In the quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares or about 2% of our outstanding common shares for $261 million at an average price of $51.07 per share.
The $261 million in stock repurchase is a sequential increase of $61 million from the second quarter of this year.
As stated previously, we are fully prepared to allocate more capital to shareholders as conditions warrant.
We also invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the third quarter.
This brings our total land-related spend in 2021 to $2.9 billion and keeps us on track to invest approximately $4 billion of land acquisition and development for the year, which would be an increase of almost 40% over last year.
We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 22.4%, which is down from 29.5% at the end of last year.
Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 5.7%.
We ended the third quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options.
Our divisions and particularly our land teams have done an outstanding job building a more efficient land bank while helping to reduce market risk.
We're extremely proud of their efforts and the success that they've realized.
We continue to experience strong demand in the quarter with very consistent traffic and sign-up numbers across the period.
I would also add that strong demand has continued through the first few weeks of October.
While sign-ups in the quarter were lower compared with last year, the primary driver of the decline was the decrease in community count.
Beyond the impact community count had on order rates in the quarter, our divisions continue to manage or outright restrict sales pace to better match sales with our current production.
As Bob indicated, this most recent quarter should be the low point of our community count -- should be the low point of our community count this year as we expect our community count to move higher on a sequential basis as we move through 2022.
Reflecting the strong demand conditions and relatively limited supply of new and existing homes, we were able to raise prices in the quarter across most of our communities.
The most typical increase in the quarter was in the range of 1% to 3%, although some of our divisions were able to push pricing in select communities a little more aggressively.
That being said, we continue to keep a close eye on affordability metrics within our local markets, especially given the recent rise in mortgage rates.
Between an improving economy, a strong jobs market, wage inflation and government stimulus checks, consumers are in a very strong financial position and have proven they are prepared to pay today's higher prices for everything, from food to autos to homes.
We continue to see a very strong financial profile among our homebuyers with the average FICO score remaining above 7 50 and loan-to-value of 83% based on users of our mortgage company.
Looking at demand across the country.
I would tell you that generally where we have product available, we can sell it and at a higher price than earlier in the year.
Although frustrated at times because of limited supply, higher prices and longer build cycles, consumers remain engaged in the home buying process and are anxious to get into a new home.
Just to wrap up, while there are certainly challenges in the business, PulteGroup remains in an excellent position, both operationally and financially.
We have a strong and improving land pipeline that we continue to make more efficient through the use of lot options.
We have an opportunity to further expand margins based on limited supply, strong buyer demand, resulting favorable pricing dynamics and lower lumber costs in 2022.
We have an outstanding homebuilding operation that is generating tremendous cash flow, and we have an exceptional balance sheet strength and liquidity that can support our operations and gives us tremendous flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities.
","PulteGroup reported strong third-quarter earnings, with home sale revenues up 18% to $3.3 billion, driven by higher closings and average sales prices. Earnings per share increased 36% to $1.82, exceeding the previous year's adjusted earnings of $1.34. However, the company's production environment has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, leading to delays in deliveries and higher construction costs. Despite these challenges, PulteGroup has taken proactive steps to increase spec home availability and better align sales with production, with spec homes in production increasing by 900. The company remains confident in the housing market and is investing heavily in land acquisition and development, with $2.9 billion spent so far this year and a target of approximately $4 billion for the full year. As the supply chain improves and lumber costs decline in 2022, PulteGroup expects further gross margin expansion and financial growth."
TEN_q3_2021.txt,"Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2021 earnings results and related financial information.
When we say EBITDA, it means adjusted EBITDA.
Unless specifically described otherwise, margin refers to value-add adjusted EBITDA margin.
In the near term, we're looking forward to participating in the virtual Barclays Global Automotive Conference on November 17th and speaking with many of you there.
Our agenda for today we'll start with CEO, Brian Kesseler, giving an overview of the third quarter and our COO, Kevin Baird will provide more details on our performance at the segment level.
Our CFO, Matti Masanovich will discuss our balance sheet progress and provide an updated outlook for 2021.
Brian will then wrap up our prepared comments before we move into the question-and-answer session.
Please turn to Page 4 for a review of the key themes from our third quarter.
As we're all aware, the operating conditions in the end-to-end supply chain environment are unprecedented from semiconductor shortages affecting our OE customer bill rates, the freight and labor availability to escalating raw material and component costs, we are managing through a unique operating landscape and are planning for more of the same through the end of 2021 and into 2022.
More specifically, in the very near term, we are planning for Q4 global light vehicle production to be about the same as Q3.
With that as a backdrop, it's important to note that our global scale and market mix and structural cost improvement actions helped us mitigate the impact of the challenging operating environment.
On a year-over-year basis, our volume and mix was down only 5% compared to a 20% decline in global light vehicle unit production.
On a constant currency basis, our light vehicle value-add revenues outperformed global light vehicle production and our position in various commercial truck, off-highway and industrial end markets and the aftermarket, help support our revenue performance.
Material cost recovery actions with our customer base are on track and contributed to revenues in the quarter, but with no margin.
Importantly, our Accelerate+ structural cost actions more than neutralized the effects of unanticipated manufacturing inefficiencies related to the light vehicle semiconductor shortages during the quarter.
Planning ahead, we have initiated new structural cost actions that will add to the $35 million benefit from the Accelerate+ program that are expected to carry over in 2022.
We are well positioned to benefit from the eventual recovery of light vehicle production volumes.
Lastly, our core growth drivers, continue to build momentum.
Motor Parts and the commercial truck off-highway and industrial space delivered revenue growth year-over-year.
Our Performance Solutions segment is launching 34 BEV and hybrid programs expected to yield annualized revenues of $200 million.
Kevin will add more color on the launches later in the call, but in addition, our advanced suspension technologies or AST business within Performance Solutions were supply advanced, passive and semi active suspension for light vehicle and specialty markets, received very positive reviews in the automotive press for our innovative suspension technologies equips on new BEVs from Rivian and Geely.
Turning to Page 5.
Let's take a look at an overview of our third quarter results.
Revenue was $4.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by our diversified end market mix and includes $1 billion of pass-through substrate sales.
As a reminder, substrate sales are only in our Clean Air segment and are passed through to the customer at cost plus the small handling fee.
Excluding substrates, our value add revenue was $3.3 billion, down 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
As I highlighted on the previous page, this compares favorably to the industry light vehicle production decline of 20% and includes material cost recovery of $110 million.
The scale and diversification in our regions and markets served are evident in the charts on the right.
In the third quarter, just over 50% of our business was generated from aftermarket and commercial truck off-highway and industrial applications.
Adding the light vehicle portion of our Performance Solutions business, which is agnostic to the vehicles powertrain, 65% of our value-add revenue is unrelated to OE light vehicle ICE technologies.
We expect this mix to expand to 80% plus by the end of the decade.
Adjusted EBITDA was $279 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.5%.
Despite the volatile production environment, we maintained strong liquidity and our third quarter net leverage ratio improved 1.1 times since the end of 2020.
On Page 6, we show our enterprise performance.
On the left side of the slide, light vehicle production declines due to the semiconductor and supply chain shortages negatively impacted our volume.
We estimate the value-add revenue impact of the semiconductor shutdowns during the quarter was approximately $400 million and our most important geographies experienced the largest adjustment.
In a normal operating environment, we would have expected to produce a low 20s incremental EBITDA margin on that revenue contribution.
Also, our third quarter value-add revenues included $110 million of material cost recovery via price in the quarter, although no margin dollars came with that contribution.
On the right side of the page, adjusted EBITDA was $279 million at a value-add margin rate of 8.5%, down 330 basis points with almost half of the year-over-year margin rate decline due to temporary cost actions put in place last year that were not expected to repeat this quarter.
Material cost recovery lag also represented a significant margin headwind compared to Q3 2020.
We remain on our plan to recover the higher commodity costs, but there is a lag.
In each of our business segments, our recovery arrangements vary based on region and customer, which creates timing differences on a comparative basis.
In the box on the right, you can see our Accelerate+ restructuring savings more than offset manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain shortages, which resulted in positive other operating performance of 60 basis points versus the prior year.
Overall, solid performance by the operating teams in the quarter, we value their resilience and fortitude in a difficult operating environment.
Let's turn to our motor parts business performance on Page 8.
Aftermarket revenue was $769 million, up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis on continued strong demand and relative to the second quarter, it is in line with normal seasonality.
We saw revenue growth in all three regions, including Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific in spite of the lengthening supply chain lead times that are having an effect on our component and finished goods availability.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $115 million, delivering a 15% EBITDA margin.
Compared to the prior year, margin was impacted by non-recurring temporary cost actions taken in the third quarter of 2020, as well as higher commodity price recoveries in the quarter that dilute margins.
Before I discuss the OE segments, you will hear some common themes across all three, including the impact of non-recurring temporary cost actions on margins in the state of our net material cost recovery.
As Brian mentioned earlier, our commodity recovery agreements differ by product, region and customer.
Steel is our most important raw material input and it's used by all three OE segments.
Also Clean Air and Powertrain have differing commodity exposures, which I'll touch on shortly.
In addition, the late notice on OE customer production schedule changes, trapped inventory of approximately $250 million as of quarter end.
Let's turn to our Performance Solutions segment on Page 9.
Third quarter revenue was $686 million, down slightly year-over-year in constant currency.
Light vehicle applications, representing approximately two-thirds of the business, were down 10% excluding currency, outperforming industry production by 10 percentage points.
Commercial truck off-highway and other applications were up 58% year-over-year and made up almost 20% of revenues.
Adjusted EBITDA was $38 million in the third quarter for a margin of 5.5%.
Year-over-year earnings comparisons were impacted by the flow-through of lower volumes, the impact from temporary cost actions taken in the prior year and net material price inflation due to the recovery lag.
Earlier, Brian mentioned the positive market reviews on our advanced suspension technology on the Rivian Electric Pickup Truck program.
In addition to our AST product line, we also supply that program with NVH and system protection products.
As a reminder, the five product lines in this segment are agnostic to the powertrain technology in the vehicle.
In the third quarter, we continued to win new business and are making inroads with China domestic OE manufacturers and their EV platforms.
Earlier this week, we announced our CVSAe electronic suspension technology, will make its China debut on the new premium electric brand Zeekr from Geely.
Lastly, approximately 80% of our alternative propulsion launches in 2021 are battery electric vehicles.
On Page 10, we show Clean Air's results.
Clean Air value-add revenues were $897 million and fell 8% year-over-year, excluding foreign currency effects.
Light vehicle value-add revenues declined 22% year-over-year.
However, commercial truck off-highway and industrial value-add revenues increased 48% year-over-year.
Clean Air's China commercial truck revenues, as well as North America's and Europe's off highway revenues expanded nicely year-over-year, driving the bulk of the segments CTOHI growth.
Commercial truck off-highway and industrial comprised 27% of the segment's value-add revenues in the third quarter, compared to 19% for all of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million.
Value-add adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.3% compared to 15.6% in the prior year period.
Strong manufacturing performance and effective material cost management helped offset most of the negative impact from weaker volume and the non-recurrence of benefits from temporary cost actions realized in Q3 of 2020.
In addition to base steel, Clean Air uses large amounts of stainless steel in its operations.
Page 11 has a summary of Powertrain.
In constant currency, revenues were about flat versus the year ago period.
CTOHI and OE service revenues both expanded more than 20% year-over-year, which helped offset a 13% decrease in light vehicle revenues.
Powertrain experienced broad strength in its CTOHI and OE service in Europe and benefited from the strong year-over-year volume in the North America on-road commercial truck market.
Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.9%.
The year-over-year margin decline was attributable to material cost inflation due to recovery lag and non-recurring temporary cost actions in the year ago period.
Steel is Powertrains most important raw material input, but the business consume several other metals, including significant amounts of aluminum and copper.
Accelerate+ restructuring savings more than offset inefficiencies related to the semiconductor volume losses.
I'll begin my comments on Page 13.
As of September 30th, our net leverage ratio was 3.2 times, which represented a 1.1 times improvement from our year-end ratio.
With net debt approximately even with year-end, our free cash flow performance year-to-date has been neutral.
As a reminder, the normal seasonality of our cash flow is weighted toward the fourth quarter.
The leverage improvement is driven by higher LTM adjusted EBITDA.
We are staying focused on cash conversion, while managing a volatile customer order schedule in this challenging supply chain environment.
Our focus includes net working capital efficiency and reducing capital intensity.
Our mid-term net leverage target range is 1.5 to 2 times.
We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $2.1 billion with our revolver undrawn and no significant near-term debt maturities.
As we have in the past, we plan to stay opportunistic regarding our future refinancing needs.
Page 14 shows our updated 2021 guidance.
We have revised our fiscal year 2021 value-added revenue guidance to a range of $13.55 billion to $13.65 billion, which compares to our prior range of $13.8 billion $14.1 billion.
The change largely stems from lower global light vehicle production relative to our last update.
Our guidance assumes Q4 global light vehicle production volumes of approximately 16.5 million units, flat with the third quarter, which is more conservative than IHS's most recent Q4 update.
Actual customer production schedules have deviated from their releases over the past several months and this has continued into the fourth quarter.
Our guidance incorporates the sequential market volume decline in our key off-road markets and a sequential volume decline in our aftermarket business, consistent with normal seasonality.
We expect our material cost recovery via price to continue to build, but will be dilutive to our margin rate comparisons.
We have reduced our 2021 adjusted EBITDA range from $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion from a range of $1.36 billion to $1.44 billion.
The primary driver of the change is a lower global light vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortages.
The EBITDA decline associated with the loss revenues is slightly higher than normal because of the sudden nature of the shutdowns since mid-year.
In some cases, we have received little notice from the customers that production was being canceled, creating inefficiencies and trapped costs.
We continue to recover the higher material costs, but there is a lag and commodity inflation remains elevated.
We believe that the lag for material cost inflation will continue into the first half of 2022 as our commodity recoveries timing gets caught up and assuming year-over-year inflation growth rates begin to stabilize.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect year-over-year savings of $110 million from our Accelerate+ Cost Reduction program.
We expect our net debt to improve to approximately $4.3 billion at year-end.
Seasonally, Q4 is our largest free cash flow quarter.
Relative to our expectations, our inventory levels remained elevated in the third quarter due to the sudden and sharp light vehicle production reductions at several of our customers.
As Kevin mentioned, we estimate the trapped inventory approximately $250 million in the third quarter.
We are working diligently to reduce the inventory and expect to partially unwind and contribute to our free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter.
We have reduced our estimate for full year capex spend by $50 million due to the softer operating environment and our cash taxes are estimated to be approximately $140 million, $10 million lower than prior expectation.
The work our team has done since the beginning of 2020 in lowering our capital intensity and our focus on free cash flow conversion, has us in a strong liquidity position with significant cushion on covenants.
The management team remains focused on improving our balance sheet.
Turning to Page 15.
I'll close with a summary of our major priorities to increase shareholder value.
First, we have taken significant structural cost out of the business and we're not stopping with the Accelerate+ program.
We have identified and initiated new projects that we expect will contribute meaningfully in 2022 on top of the $35 million of carryover savings from Accelerate+.
I want to emphasize that this continued focus positions the company to materially improve its margin rate performance once supply chain constraints are relieved and production volumes begin returning closer to 2019 levels.
Second, we have lowered the capital intensity of the business to enhance our free cash flow conversion.
We remain disciplined with our capital spending levels and intend to continue to enhance our working capital returns.
In the mid-to-long term, we target a free cash flow to EBITDA ratio in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%.
We're investing in our businesses that have above-average growth characteristics and returns on capital.
We believe the investments being made today in key businesses with our motor parts and Performance Solutions segments will enhance the company's organic growth over the long term.
Further, we have significant opportunities to grow our CTOHI revenue base over the next several years as new regulations in our key geographies increase quote and content opportunities.
On a go-forward basis, we believe the 65% of our revenue base, not associated with light vehicle IC applications, can outgrow the market and drive above market value-add revenue growth for the entire enterprise as the company transitions to a predominantly non-light vehicle IC revenue mix by the end of the decade.
We're proud of the high level of service they deliver to our customers as they continue to improve our operating performance.
Operator, we'll now answer any questions.
","Despite the unprecedented supply chain challenges, including semiconductor shortages and rising costs, the company reported a modest 2% revenue increase to $4.3 billion in the third quarter. The company's global scale and market mix helped mitigate the impact of these challenges, with volume and mix down only 5% compared to a 20% decline in global light vehicle production. Material cost recovery actions contributed to revenues but had no margin impact. The Accelerate+ structural cost program neutralized the effects of light vehicle semiconductor shortages. The company expects to continue structural cost actions and benefit from the eventual recovery of light vehicle production volumes. Core growth drivers, such as motor parts, commercial truck, off-highway, and industrial applications, delivered year-over-year revenue growth. Looking ahead, the company has revised its fiscal 2021 guidance, assuming flat Q4 global light vehicle production volumes due to semiconductor shortages. This has led to a revised value-add revenue guidance of $13.55 billion to $13.65 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion. The company remains focused on cost reduction and improving free cash flow conversion, including reducing its capital intensity and working capital returns."
XYL_q1_2021.txt,"They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first-quarter results and our outlook.
A replay of today's call will be available until midnight on June 2.
Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events.
All references will be on an organic or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated.
These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including in our Form 10-Q to report results for the ended -- the period ending March 31, 2021.
In the appendix, we have also provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.
The quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies.
Our momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets.
Orders were up double digits in all three of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically.
Both Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year on year and with momentum up strong sequentially.
demand also continued to recover with orders up 18%.
Alongside top-line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion.
I credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020.
Our financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion.
Looking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
Therefore, we are raising our full-year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS.
I'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team.
But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter.
The first quarter was clearly a meaningful step forward.
The team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets.
Revenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year with performance better than our expectations across the board.
Strong double-digit revenue growth in wastewater utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery.
Geographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%.
I'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments.
But in short, utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial, up 5%; and residential was up 31%.
Organic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all three business segments contributed double-digit order gains.
Importantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement.
Looking at the key financial metrics.
Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%.
The 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation.
Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%.
Water infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%.
Geographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year.
The U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance.
EBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation.
In the applied water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe.
Revenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies.
Residential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%.
Geographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets.
By contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential.
Emerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior-year COVID shutdowns, as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa.
Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively.
The expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity.
In M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects.
Segment backlog is up 29%.
As anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement but finished flat year on year.
Water applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business.
In energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year.
Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half.
Emerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business.
Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively.
Modest price realization and strong productivity savings, as well as a prior year warranty charge, more than offset inflation.
Our balance sheet continues to be very strong.
We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash.
Free cash flow was in line with our expectations, as well as our historical seasonality patterns.
Managing working capital remains an enterprisewide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance.
Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6 times at the end of the quarter.
I'd like to revisit the three focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability.
Turning first to our growth platforms.
You've already heard about our emerging markets team's exceptional first-quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively.
Up until now, China and India have taken the spotlight.
In both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth.
But of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us.
Many countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in water infrastructure.
And in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher-growth nations continue to urbanize.
We expect emerging markets, overall, will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future.
The second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy.
Our broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated end points.
Those capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic.
We've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio.
In Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks.
All of these projects deliver network as a service, software as a service and advanced analytics.
In each case, Xylem's ability to bring a suite of transformational capabilities distinguished us and was essential to winning.
And just last week, we further extended the digital capabilities we can offer our customers by partnering with Esri.
Esri is the global leader in geographic information systems, GIS for short.
These systems are an essential component of utility's operating environment.
By integrating their technology with our advanced digital solutions, water operators achieved unprecedented network visibility and a clear path to increased operational efficiency and sustainability.
And with last week's agreement, Xylem and Esri are bringing that powerful combination to the water sector together.
Our partnership includes developing joint solution road maps and joint selling to water utilities around the world.
We are very excited about this partnership and about the value we can deliver to customers together.
Turning next to operating discipline.
Our operational capabilities were absolutely key to coming through 2020 on strong foundations.
As you know, last year, we made difficult but essential decisions on structural cost.
And we're now clearly seeing the benefit of those actions.
In addition, the team drove strong productivity gains in the first quarter, which offset the early impact of rising inflation.
The result was solid margin expansion with incremental margins coming in at 55%.
Over the last year, we've learned that we can do more with less, and we will remain absolutely vigilant on cost as economies reopen and demand continues to recover.
That said, we are expecting some impact from the broad-based inflation and component supply challenges that are affecting the industrial and tech sectors.
Now we've already taken action by strategically investing in inventory to support areas of strong demand, and we will continue driving productivity and pricing to mitigate inflation.
Still, the supply environment is likely to remain challenging for some time.
The third focus area we highlighted coming into the year was sustainability.
I think many of us worried that the cause of sustainability might suffer setbacks through the economic hardships of 2020.
However, instead of a retreat, we've actually seen a broad and energetic global embrace of sustainability.
As an enterprise over the last year, we've taken several meaningful steps toward our signature 2025 sustainability goals.
We'll be highlighting those in our annual sustainability report to be published in June.
We'll be reporting, for example, that, in 2020, we helped our customers prevent 1.4 billion cubic meters of polluted water from entering local waterways.
Now the report is largely retrospective, but, of course, we continue to move forward.
In 2021, we've deepened and broadened the link between compensation and sustainability performance.
It is now a component in the long-term incentive program for a range of key executives.
Our commitment and our action has put us in a leadership position, which is both gratifying and a tribute to the team.
That said, we all know we have a lot more work ahead of us to deliver on our goals and on our mission and purpose.
With that, I'll now hand it back over to Sandy to provide the forward view of our end markets, along with guidance for the remainder of the year.
The outlook for our end markets remains mostly consistent with our view from last quarter with a couple of notable changes.
First, in utilities, we continue to see strong commercial momentum in both wastewater and clean water, and anticipate our utility business will grow in the mid to high single digits.
On the wastewater side, operators remain focused on mission-critical applications and opex needs in the developed markets of Europe and North America.
Capital spending outlook and bid activity in China and India remains robust, although we expect some lumpiness in India due to high COVID case rates there.
On the clean water side, we are encouraged to see large project deployments beginning to ramp again.
We're clearly positive about the prospect of investment in modernizing the country's water infrastructure.
More broadly, the plan could represent an opportunity for communities across the U.S. to invest in greater resilience in several infrastructure categories, which would have the effect of reducing pressure on municipal budgets.
We are encouraged by those possibilities.
But to be clear, it's too early to know whether and in what form the plan may emerge from Congress, who have not built specific upside into our expectations.
The second notable change in our outlook is in the industrial end market.
We have seen a rebound in global industrial activity and sentiment across all three of our business segments.
We expect healthy growth in emerging markets in Western Europe to continue in the first half, while North America will deliver modest growth.
And then we anticipate those relative market performances will flip in the second half, primarily because of the compares.
Importantly, the industrial dewatering business is recovering, driven by demand in construction, mining and other verticals.
And we now expect the industrial end market to grow in the mid-single digits for the year.
Our outlook in the commercial segment remains unchanged.
We continue to expect our commercial end market to be up low single digits.
replacement business is stable, although new commercial building is expected to be soft for most of 2021.
In residential, we now anticipate high single digit to low double-digit growth for the full year, which is up modestly from our previous expectation of mid to high single digits.
We do expect growth will moderate through the second half, due largely to prior-year comparisons.
As you can see, we are raising our previous annual guidance.
For Xylem overall, we now see full-year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%.
This breaks down by segment as follows: mid- to high single-digit growth in water infrastructure, up from low to mid-single-digit growth previously; mid- to high single-digit growth in applied water, up from low single-digit growth; and in measurement and control solutions, we expect -- we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth.
While we anticipate delivering a number of large project deployments, growth may be somewhat constrained by component supply challenges.
For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be at 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%.
For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points.
This higher range reflects our expectation that volume, price and productivity gains will more than offset inflation.
Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted earnings per share range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year.
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our three-year average right around 130%.
And we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100% going forward.
Our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter, which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment.
We are continually assessing inorganic opportunities to strengthen our strategic position, differentiate our portfolio and enhance market access.
We have provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions to supplement your models.
Those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance, including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22.
And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile and, therefore, we have included a foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix.
Now drilling down on the second quarter.
We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 8% to 10%.
This includes high single-digit growth in water infrastructure, low teens growth in applied water and mid-single-digits growth in M&CS.
We expect second-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year.
Xylem is clearly in a strong position coming out of Q1, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and beyond.
Demand recovery and strong commercial performance will drive organic growth.
Operating discipline will deliver margin expansion and strong cash conversion, and a robust balance sheet will continue to underpin our strategy.
More broadly, our business and mission have never been more relevant than they are today.
The economic and social value of critical infrastructure is more apparent than ever.
Not only is it critical in times of crisis, but also as a driver of economic recovery, and it's a prerequisite for broader prosperity.
From the shocks of the last year, the world has embraced the need for greater resilience and the imperative of a sustainable future.
In that context, our mission, our business and our values put us in a privileged position, which will enable us to continue creating both economic and social value for our stakeholders over the medium and long term.
We look forward to providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our next investor day, which is currently planned for September 30.
It will most likely be a combined virtual and physical format, but we do hope to host as many of you as possible, COVID restrictions permitting.
Matt and the team will follow up with more details as soon as they're pinned down, now with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have.
So operator, please lead us into Q&A.
","In its first quarter, Xylem witnessed exceptional growth, surpassing expectations with organic revenue growth of 8%. The quarter was marked by strong performance in both wastewater utilities and industrial demand, resulting in double-digit order gains across all business segments. Backlog also grew significantly by 23%. Geographically, Western Europe and emerging markets exhibited exceptional growth, with double-digit organic revenue increases, while the U.S. experienced modest growth. All end markets and geographies contributed to the overall revenue increase, with particularly strong growth in residential and industrial sectors. Margins expanded considerably due to volume effects and cost actions, leading to an EBITDA margin of 17.1%. The company anticipates continued revenue growth in the mid to high single digits for the full year and has raised its guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin to 17.2% to 17.7%, as well as adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.50 to $2.70."
LOW_q4_2021.txt,"Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.
Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.
A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our investor relations website.
Our results once again beat expectations this quarter, with comparable sales up 5% for the total company and 5.1% for the U.S. on top of over 28% growth last year.
on a two-year basis.
These results capped of outstanding financial results for fiscal 2021 with sales of $96.3 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable basis and earnings per share of $12.04, up 36% on an adjusted basis.
With these outstanding results, 100% of our stores earned a quarterly Winning Together profit-sharing bonus.
This $94 million payout is $24 million above the target payment level.
And in recognition for their hard work throughout the pandemic in 2021, we are awarding an incremental discretionary bonus of $265 million to our frontline associates.
Altogether, we rewarded our frontline associates with bonuses of over $350 million in the fourth quarter.
As Joe will discuss later in the call, financial support of our frontline associates is consistent with our commitment to being an employer of choice in the retail industry.
Our Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum, as we grow our share of wallet with both Pro and DIY as they increasingly rely on Lowe's as a one-stop solution for all their project needs.
In looking at our results this quarter, I'm particularly encouraged that our growth was broad based and balanced across product categories, across both DIY and Pro, both online and in-store.
In Pro, we delivered growth of 23% and 54% on a two-year basis.
And we are building on our momentum with the Pro with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program, MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program.
We redesigned our loyalty program based on feedback from our Pro customers who expressed a desire for a business partnership rather than a series of stand-alone transactions.
Our data shows that Pros who leverage our loyalty and credit offering spend 300% more than Pros not engaged in these programs.
Our Pro business is off to a strong start this year, and we're excited about the national launch of our MVPs Pro loyalty program.
I look forward to providing updates on this critical initiative throughout the year.
Now turning to our DIY customer, where we delivered growth on top of exceptionally strong demand last year.
Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we continue to grow our DIY market share by elevating our private brands product assortments in our home decor category.
On Lowes.com, sales grew 11.5% on top of 121% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a two-year comp of 147% and nearly 11% sales penetration.
Our intuitive online shopping experience and expanded on-trend assortments are resonating with our customers.
And while we're pleased that our online sales have more than doubled over the past two years, we still have tremendous growth opportunity in front of us.
And as part of our efforts to enhance our omnichannel experience, we are expanding our same-day and next-day fulfillment capabilities.
With that in mind, we're actively piloting several gig network solutions, including partnering with Instacart in several markets with same-day DIY home delivery.
And building on the success we gained in the Florida and Ohio Valley regions with our market delivery strategy, we completed the conversion of our third geographic area, the Carolina region, during the fourth quarter.
By way of reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes.
This replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products.
As we continue to expand our market-based delivery model, we're freeing up space in our 10,000 square foot store back rooms, which on average are considerably larger than our competition.
And we are testing out different options to drive both greater in-store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both Pro and DIY customers.
In a few minutes, Bill will discuss our continued investments in online as we create a best-in-class integrated omnichannel shopping experience.
During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 115 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $1.78, which is a 34% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year.
These results reflect our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI, as well as the ongoing benefits of our new pricing strategies.
Joe and Dave will discuss these initiatives in further detail later in the call.
The Canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the U.S. Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market, as well as our opportunity to continue to win share.
Our outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong, supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheet, especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation.
Persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment.
In fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.
Other trends remain favorable, including baby boomers' increasing preference to-age-in-place.
And with the extension of remote work for some employees, we're expecting a permanent step-up in repair and maintenance cycle.
are over 40 years old and will continue to require investments for upkeep and approximately two-thirds of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity.
Therefore, we're encouraged that the macro environment for home improvement remains very supportive.
As we close the year, we continue to give back to the communities where we operate, with total donations of $100 million in 2021 well over our pre-pandemic levels.
And we're pleased that our efforts to enhance our brand reputation while supporting our associates and driving long-term value for our shareholders and was recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as they named Lowe's the No.
1 most admired specialty retailer for the second year in a row.
This is the first time in our history that we received this recognition in back-to-back years.
In closing, I'd like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our frontline associates.
As I travel the country every week visiting stores, I continue to be struck by their commitment to supporting our communities while providing excellent customer service.
In the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales increased 5.1% and 35.2% on a two-year basis.
We delivered positive comps in all three merchandising divisions in the quarter with growth across Pro and DIY customers.
Growth was well balanced with 12 of 15 merchandising departments comping positive and was broad-based on a two-year basis with all 15 departments up more than 18% in that time frame.
Beginning with our Home Decor merchandising division, flooring and appliances delivered the strongest comps in the quarter.
In flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as we continue to see consumer preference shifting toward this affordable and stylish solution.
Lowe's already offers a wide selection of vinyl flooring products, including several Pergo WetProtect options.
And this year, we look forward to extending our own trusted STAINMASTER brand with its high performance characteristics and lifetime stain-resistant warranty across a full range of flooring products, including laminate, tile and vinyl.
Within appliances, sales of ranges, cooktops, along with dishwashers were the strongest in the quarter.
As we continue to extend our private brand offering, we recently launched Origin 21 across several product categories in home decor.
This is our new modern brand designed for the trend-setting millennial consumer, while our ever popular Allen + Roth brand is tailored to the more traditional style.
Now, turning to our performance in hardlines.
The team delivered an exceptional holiday season.
Customers were active early and shopped often in our trim and tree category, which drove excellent sell-through in this holiday category.
Seasonal, outdoor living and lawn and garden delivered standout performances, as customers continue to enhance their outdoor living spaces with new grills, patio heaters, fire pits, as well as live goods for the yards and garden.
With the home serving as a center for entertainment, our customers are making the most of their homes, inside and out.
We continue to build on our No.
1 position in outdoor power equipment with further share gains in battery outdoor power equipment, as we drove over 37% growth in this area for the quarter and over 118% on a two-year basis.
Both DIY and Pro customers enjoy the convenience, reliability and the power of our innovative battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands.
In this spring, we are thrilled to expand our exclusive lineup of EGO battery products with their new 52-inch zero-turn riding mower with features that include a fabricated deck and power to mow up to four acres on a single charge.
Also new for EGO is the industry's most powerful handheld battery-powered blower with power that will outperform the leading gas blower with 765 cubic feet per minute of blowing capacity.
These new products will complement our existing lineup and assortments from powerful brands, such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN.
This spring, we will launch our new Origin 21 patio collections, as well as our new style selection replacement cushions.
These cushions are made with 100% recycled plastic bottles and they are fade-resistant, UV-protected as well as easy to clean.
Now turning to the building products division.
Our comps were very strong driven by broad-based balanced growth across lumber, electrical, rough plumbing, millwork and building materials.
We are pleased with the continued momentum we are building with the Pro as we work to expand our brand and product offerings to meet their project needs.
New this year will be a full range of CertainTeed roofing, insulation and gypsum products.
As a leading manufacturer of building products for both residential and commercial construction, CertainTeed is an important strategic partner that we are proud to add to Lowe's as we continue to enhance our Pro offering in the building materials category.
We also continue to build out our Pro power tool program with the introduction of the new DEWALT power stack battery technology, which is the smallest and most energy-densed battery pack on the market.
These new products and new brands are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.
As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 11.5% in the quarter and 147% on a two-year basis in the fourth quarter.
We are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across three key areas: expanding our online assortment, enhancing the user experience and improving fulfillment.
First, we are expanding our Lowes.com assortment to meet our customers' design and lifestyle needs.
For example, within Lowe's Livable Home products, we will offer a range of products to help our customers adapt to their changing mobility needs.
At the same time, we will continue to enhance the user experience with continued upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools, like kitchen visualizer and measure your space.
Finally, as we continue to improve our fulfillment capabilities, our customers can now track their appliance delivery in real time, and we will soon be leveraging enhanced technology to further streamline the buy online, pick-up in store experience for our customers through an improved store execution process.
As we look ahead to spring, we are well positioned to capitalize on what we expect to be another strong spring season.
Consistent with our approach over the past year, we have worked hard to land our spring product early.
Through an expansion of our network of coastal holding facilities, we are better able to manage the flow of imported product enabling us to quickly flow product where needed as spring arrives across the country.
As one of the largest importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate and manage the impact of cost increases across our supply chain.
Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendors for their hard work and continued support.
In recognition of their outstanding efforts, we awarded the discretionary year-end bonus of $6,000 for assistant store managers, $1,000 for department supervisors, $800 for full-time hourly associates and $400 for part-time hourly associates.
As Marvin mentioned, the combination of Winning Together and this discretionary year-end bonus will result in a payout of over $350 million for our frontline associates this quarter.
As someone who started his career in home improvement as an hourly associate, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition is for our hourly associates.
At Lowe's, our people are truly our most valuable asset.
When it comes to recruiting and retaining top talent, we strive to be an employer of choice.
From the moment that a candidate applies for a position at Lowe's, we are committed to creating a positive impression.
We have invested in leading technology that accelerates the hiring process, so that we are processing applications in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks that the manual process required as recently as last year.
We also continue to improve our onboarding process so that our new hires can quickly come up to speed, leveraging the technology and product knowledge that is readily available to them on their handheld mobile devices via the Lowe's University application.
As I mentioned on our last call, we are also leveraging our new Lowe's University in-store training labs to provide the ongoing training that our associates need to build their skills and confidence so they can continue to progress in their career.
Over the last three years, we have created valuable career opportunities for our associates with the incremental 10,000 department supervisor roles and 1,600 ASM positions that we have added.
Since 2018, we have also invested well over $2 billion in incremental wage and equity programs for our frontline associates to ensure that we continue to offer a strong competitive wage and benefit package to our associates.
I'm really pleased to report that our investments to position Lowe's as an employer of choice are paying off.
Heading into spring, we anticipate being even better positioned than last year from a hiring perspective.
And we are also confident that we will continue to drive productivity in our operations through our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives.
As a reminder, this is not a single win.
It is a series of improvements that are scaling across our stores over time.
In fact, we are working on over 20 different PPI initiatives in our store operations this year.
To highlight just a few key PPI initiatives, we have just launched a new store inventory management system, or SIMs across all of our stores.
This platform gives store associates real-time visibility to inventory in their store.
This includes inventory in the home bay location as well as product in the top stock and cap, off-shelf and back stock room.
This new system will eliminate the countless nonproductive hours associates have been spending looking for product.
I'm also excited about our continuing efforts to eliminate the ancient green screen technology with the launch of our simplified user interface to other selling stations throughout the store.
First introduced at our front-end registers, we are beginning to implement this new technology across the sales floor.
With this new platform, we are accelerating the associate training process and facilitating cross-training in other departments.
This new technology will free up our associates to focus on providing excellent customer service while reducing customer wait time.
While these two initiatives are just a few of the PPI deliverables planned for this year, we expect that these two initiatives alone will drive $100 million in productivity this year.
Looking forward, we will continue to leverage technology to reduce manual tasking for our associates while also enabling them to deliver better service to our Pro and DIY customers.
As Marvin indicated, the consumer backdrop remains favorable, as we are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates.
Historically, when interest rates have risen against a strong economic backdrop, the home improvement sector has delivered solid growth.
During these periods, housing affordability was supported by growth in jobs and personal income, which offset the impact of higher borrowing costs.
Today, housing affordability remains above the pre-pandemic average.
The market is expecting moderately higher interest rates in the coming quarters.
But keep in mind, rates are increasing off historic lows.
Home equity has increased due to rising home prices and consumer savings are about $2.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels, positioning consumers for continued residential investments.
Given all these factors, we are expecting another strong year of demand in the home improvement market.
Now, let me turn to capital allocation.
We remain committed to be best-in-class when it comes to our ability to create value for our shareholders through our strong capital allocation program.
In 2021, we generated $8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $15.1 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.
During the fourth quarter, we paid $551 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 16 million shares for $4 billion.
This brought the total to $13.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations of $12 billion.
This reflected better-than-expected financial performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders.
Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and nearly $1.9 billion for the full year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to both drive growth and enhance returns across the business.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy.
Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 1.98 times, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.75 times.
As I mentioned at our December 15 investor update, we are planning to return to our leverage target over the next two years, driven by our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy.
With that, I'd like to turn to the income statement.
In the fourth quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.78, an increase of 34% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year.
This increase reflected better-than-expected sales growth, improved gross margin rate and favorable SG&A leverage, driven by our productivity initiatives.
In the quarter, sales were $21.3 billion, reflecting a comparable sales increase of 5%.
Comparable average ticket increased 9.4% and with higher ticket sales in appliances, flooring and seasonal and outdoor living and 90 basis points of commodity inflation in both lumber and copper.
In the quarter, comp transaction count decreased 4.4%, but on a two-year basis, comp transactions increased 8.9%.
We continue to gain traction with our Total Home strategy as reflected in Pro growth of 23% and positive DIY comps on top of extremely strong DIY growth last year.
On Lowes.com, sales increased 11.5% in the quarter.
U.S. comp sales increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% on a two-year basis.
We saw acceleration in both our Pro and our DIY comp sales trends from our third quarter performance.
By month, our U.S. comparable sales were up 8.1% in November, up 7.4% in December and down 1.3% in January.
Recall that we cycled over government stimulus in late December and early January of last year.
comp growth on a two-year basis from 2019 to 2021, November sales increased 33.8%, December increased 37.4% and January increased 33.9%.
Gross margin was 32.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 115 basis points from last year.
Product margin rate increased 65 basis points, driven by our disciplined pricing and cost management strategies.
Improvements in both shrink and credit revenue benefited gross margin by 50 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.
These benefits were partially offset by roughly 30 basis points of pressure related to higher transportation and importation costs, as well as the expansion of our supply chain network.
I'd like to spend just a moment addressing the recent increase in lumber prices.
We are confident that we have an effective strategy to carefully manage our inventory and rapidly adjust pricing.
Although we are planning for our lumber margins to be compressed when prices decline, we are confident in our outlook for gross margin rate to be up slightly in 2022.
We levered 15 basis points versus LY, driven by higher sales and our relentless focus on productivity.
This quarter, we incurred $50 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to $165 million of COVID-related expenses last year.
This reduction in these expenses generated 60 basis points of SG&A leverage.
Additionally, we incurred $150 million of expenses related to the U.S. stores reset in the fourth quarter of last year.
As we did not incur any material expenses related to this project in '21, this generated approximately 75 basis points of SG&A leverage versus LY.
These benefits were pressured by 100 basis points related to the discretionary year-end bonus of $215 million for our store-based frontline associates.
Operating profit was over $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus LY.
Operating margin of 8.7% for the quarter increased 115 basis points over last year, largely driven by higher gross margin rate, as well as favorable SG&A leverage.
The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter, which is in line with prior year.
At year-end, inventory was $17.6 billion, up $920 million from Q3 and in line with seasonal trends and consistent with our effort to land spring products earlier.
Driven by both improved operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 35% for the year, up 760 basis points from 2020.
Now, turning to our 2022 financial outlook.
We closed out 2021 ahead of the expectations that we presented at our December 15 investor update.
comparable sales trends are in line with our fourth quarter performance on a two-year basis.
And based on the continued momentum that we are seeing in Pro sales, as well as higher expectations for commodity inflation, we are raising our sales outlook for 2022 to a range of between $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%.
Now, please keep in mind that our outlook assumes that lumber pricing will return to a more normalized level in the second half of the year.
We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY in 2022.
Keep in mind that we are cycling over an estimated 300 basis points of stimulus in the first quarter.
Also, as a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales.
We now expect gross margin rate in 2022 to be up slightly as compared to the prior year.
With higher projected sales, improving gross margin outlook and continued execution of our PPI initiatives, we are raising our outlook for operating margin to a range of 12.8% to 13% from a prior range of 12.5% to 12.8% for the full year.
We are also raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to a range of $13.10 to $13.60 from a prior range of $12.25 to $13.
In 2022, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $12 billion.
Finally, we are raising our outlook for return on invested capital to above 36% from our original outlook of approximately 35%.
In closing, we are off to a great start in 2022.
We have significant runway ahead of us to both grow our market share, expand operating margins and deliver meaningful long-term shareholder value.
","Lowe's reported strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2021. Comparable sales increased 5% for the total company (5.1% in the U.S.) on top of over 28% growth last year, with broad-based growth across product categories and both DIY and Pro customers. Earnings per share increased 34% on an adjusted basis to $1.78, driven by sales growth, improved gross margins, and productivity initiatives. For fiscal 2022, Lowe's raised its sales outlook to a range of $97 billion to $99 billion, representing a comparable sales range of down 1% to up 1%. Gross margin rate is expected to improve slightly, with operating margins estimated to range between 12.8% and 13%. The company continues to invest in its Total Home strategy, with Pro growth of 23% in Q4 and broad-based DIY growth. Lowe's is also expanding its online capabilities, with Lowes.com sales increasing 11.5% in the quarter and representing nearly 11% of sales. The company is also implementing perpetual productivity improvement initiatives that are expected to drive significant cost savings. Despite higher interest rates, Lowe's remains optimistic about the home improvement market due to strong consumer demand, increased home equity, and low housing affordability."
CPF_q2_2021.txt,"As always, we appreciate your interest in Central Pacific Financial Corp.
Let me start first with some positive updates on the Hawaii economic recovery.
Visitor arrivals from the U.S. Mainland to Hawaii have returned much quicker than anticipated, a good sign for economic recovery.
The daily arrival count have averaged about 30,000 per day since June, which is nearly at pre-pandemic level.
In early July, the state of Hawaii began allowing arriving passengers to skip pre-testing and quarantining with proof of full vaccination against COVID in the U.S. Although we are not immune to the spike caused by the Delta variant, Hawaii's COVID infection rates continue to be at very low level, with our infection rates currently at the lowest in the nation.
Nearly 60% of our state population is fully vaccinated as of July 21, 2021.
The state of Hawaii's unemployment rate declined to 7.7% in the month of June and is forecasted by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization to decline to 4.8% in 2022.
The housing market in Hawaii remains hot with the median single-family home price at $979,000 in the month of June.
Our financial results for the second quarter were very strong, with quarterly pre-tax income reaching a new record high.
With increased confidence in the Hawaii economic recovery and our continued solid asset quality, liquidity, and capital, we resumed share repurchases during the second quarter and continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend.
Against this backdrop, we are very optimistic about our future business profit.
Digital continues to be a key strategic priority for us.
Enhancements to our online and mobile banking platforms are being made on a continual basis.
Additionally, in the second quarter, we issued new contactless debit cards to all of our customers and increased mobile deposit adoption among our customer base.
Further, online chat is now available and online appointment schedule is coming soon to make banking easier and more convenient for our customers.
We continue to work diligently on our product and service development in the digital area.
First, I'd like to provide an update on the credit area.
We are pleased that our clients have weathered through the challenges of the pandemic.
Nearly all of the loans we granted, COVID-related payment deferrals have returned to pay status.
As of June 30, we have just $3.5 million in loans remaining on deferral, the majority of which are residential mortgages.
Additionally, our classified assets declined during the quarter to $42 million, and our nonperforming assets remain near historic lows at just nine basis points of assets.
I'd also like to share about a recent developments in the environmental, social, and governance or ESG area.
In the second quarter, we were pleased to publish our first annual 2020 ESG report.
We continue to develop our ESG reporting and look forward to providing further updates in the future.
CPB's legacy in helping the small business community is one of the pillars of our ESG program and remains a key priority for us.
Last week, we were pleased to announce the new program run by our CPB foundation call We, that is W-E By Rising Tide.
This program supports women entrepreneurs as we believe they are key to building a strong and resilient economy.
As part of this program, we selected our first cohort of 20 women entrepreneurs from seven different business sectors that will participate in a 10-week series of workshop on financial management, marketing, and leadership and receive free advertising and networking benefits.
Support of our employees is another color of our ESG program.
We believe that investing in our employees is critical to our success.
During the second quarter, we had our annual merit increases and we made a few key strategic new hires.
We also continue to prioritize the health and well-being of our employees and therefore, continue to allow flexible work schedule while developing our hybrid return-to-office plan.
Finally, we are pleased that the second and final phase of our Central Pacific Plaza revitalization was completed last month.
We expect smaller office projects to continue as we create collaborative, refreshed, and sustainable workplaces for our employees.
We also continue to refresh our branches and evaluate our branch network to meet the changing needs of our customers.
In the second quarter, our core loan portfolio decreased by $103 million or 2.3% sequential quarter, which was offset by PPP paydown of $163 million.
Year-over-year, our core loan portfolio increased by 3.7%.
The core loan growth was broad-based across all loan categories, except C&I, which as everyone knows, was because Customer segment most impacted by the pandemic and now in recovery.
Our residential mortgage production continues to be very strong, with total production in the second quarter of nearly $280 million and total net portfolio growth in residential mortgage and home equity of $48 million from the previous quarter.
We ramped up 2021 new PPP originations during the second quarter with over 4,600 loans totaling more than $321 million.
I am proud of our team for maintaining a leadership role in supporting our small business customers and the broader business community.
PPP forgiveness is also progressing well with 70% of the loans originated in 2020 already forgiven and paid down through June 30.
Assisting our customers with the forgiveness process has been a key priority for the bank as the local economy begins to recover and our business customers begin to pivot from surviving to thriving in.
During the second quarter, with confidence that the national economic recovery was gaining strength and the local economy was on its way to recovery, we resumed our consumer lending programs on the Mainland and in Hawaii.
During the quarter, we purchased an auto loan portfolio from one of our established partners and also restarted other consumer programs on an ongoing full basis for consumer direct and indirect loans on the Mainland and in Hawaii.
While it was a prudent process to span our consumer programs last year despite what we experienced in the economic downturn, both our Mainland and Hawaii consumer portfolios performed well, augmented by the support from federal stimulus programs.
With Hawaii's economic recovery expected to take traction, combined with our healthy loan pipeline, we anticipate strong loan growth for the second half of the year.
On the deposit front, we saw a strong inflow of deposits with total core deposits increasing by $279 million or about 5% sequential quarter growth.
On a year-over-year basis, total core deposits increased by $705 million or 13.8%.
Additionally, our average cost of total deposits outweigh the second quarter by just six basis points.
Finally, I want to mention that the Hawaii economy is recovering and consumer confidence is increasing.
We are seeing positive trends in transactional fee income recovery, including investment services fees.
Net income for the second quarter was $18.7 million or $0.66 per diluted share.
Return on average assets was 1.06% and return on average equity was 13.56%.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $52.1 million, which increased from the prior quarter, primarily due to greater recognition of PPP fee income due to higher forgiveness.
Net interest income included $7.9 million in PPP net interest income and net loan fees compared to $5.2 million in the prior quarter.
At June 30, unearned net PPP fees was $15.9 million.
Net interest margin decreased to 3.16% compared to 3.19% in the prior quarter.
The net interest margin normalized for PPP was 2.93% compared to 3.12% in the previous quarter.
The normalized NIM decrease was due to an acceleration of MBS premium amortization, excess balance sheet liquidity, and lower investment and loan yields.
Investment MBS premium amortization increased by $900,000 sequential quarter due to an acceleration of prepayments in the second quarter.
To mitigate the prepayment risk going forward, we executed a sovereign coupon MBS bond swap totaling $175 million.
We continue to deploy excess liquidity to the loan and investment portfolios to further support our net interest margin.
Second quarter other operating income remained relatively flat at $10.5 million.
During the quarter, there was a decrease in mortgage banking income, which was offset by higher service charges and fees and bank-owned life insurance income.
Other operating expense for the second quarter was $41.4 million compared to $37.8 million in the prior quarter, with much of the increase in the salaries and benefits line.
The current quarter increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to $1.2 million in nonrecurring reductions in the prior quarter and $2.8 million in higher incentive compensation and commission accruals, strategic hires to drive forward performance, and annual merit increase.
The efficiency ratio increased to 66.2% in the second quarter due to higher other operating expenses.
We expect the efficiency ratio to moderate and improve over time as we drive positive operating leverage based on our strategic investments.
Net charge-offs in the second quarter totaled $0.8 million, with the majority of charge-offs coming from the consumer loan portfolio.
At June 30, our allowance for credit losses was $77.8 million or 1.68% of outstanding loans, excluding the PPP loans.
In the second quarter, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to the provision for credit losses due to improvements in the economic forecast and our known portfolio.
The effective tax rate was 23.9% in the second quarter and going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range.
Our capital position remains strong and as Paul noted earlier, we resumed share repurchases this quarter with repurchases of 156,600 shares at a total cost of $4.3 million.
We've also repurchased an additional 78,000 shares of common stock month-to-date through July 20 at an average cost of $24.93.
Finally, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share, which was consistent with the prior quarter.
In summary, Central Pacific has a solid financial credit, liquidity, and capital position, and we continue to make positive forward progress on our core business strategy.
Further, we remain committed to providing support to our employees, customers, and the community as we continue to progress through the economic recovery.
At this time, we'll be happy to address any questions you may have.
Back to you, Andrew.
","Central Pacific Financial Corp.'s second-quarter earnings reached a record high, driven by strong financial results and economic recovery in Hawaii. Visitor arrivals to Hawaii have surged, with daily counts nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels and infection rates remaining low. The state's unemployment rate is projected to decline to 4.8% in 2022. Core loan portfolio increased by 3.7% year-over-year, with residential mortgage production remaining robust. Total core deposits saw a 5% sequential quarter growth and a 13.8% annual increase. Net income was $18.7 million, translating to earnings per share of $0.66. The company's financial position remains strong, with solid credit, liquidity, and capital, and it has resumed share repurchases and continued to pay quarterly cash dividends. Central Pacific remains focused on its core business strategy, digital advancements, ESG initiatives, and supporting the small business community and its employees."
DGX_q3_2021.txt,"I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.
Actual results may differ materially from those projected.
Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic's severity and duration; healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests; the pandemic's impact on the US healthcare system and the US economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control.
Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing.
Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.
Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business.
Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer.
While our base business continued to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year and 2019.
In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound in September.
Importantly, our base business continued to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery.
We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher than anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures.
The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day.
But before turning to our results into the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our progress we've made in our Quest for Health Equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods.
Since we've established just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing of vaccination events, to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico.
Recently, we announced a collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for Black and Hispanic scholars and drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief.
We're off to a good start and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year.
Now turning to our results for the third quarter.
Total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year.
The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business.
Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September to approximately $1.75 billion.
Now, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer.
Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July and peaked in early mid-September.
Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks.
We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests today in the third quarter and maintain strong average turnaround times of approximately one day for most specimens throughout the surge.
As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our non-clinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel and entertainment.
We're making testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country.
We are currently performing K through 12 school testing in approximately 20 states with five additional states ready to come online.
We're testing passengers on Carnival Cruise Lines and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month.
In the base business, we continue to make progress on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.
Now, here are some highlights from the third quarter.
Our M&A pipeline remained strong.
In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida.
We continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially insured lives in the United States.
At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life.
So here is a couple of examples.
We are working with National Health Plans to help their self-insured employers, employer customers improve quality outcomes and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees.
Also, effective October 1, we gained access to 1 billion Managed Medicaid members in Florida as their coverage transitions to Centene's Sunshine Health Plan.
We're getting good feedback from the provider community in our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity.
Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts.
As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from two of our largest PLS contracts to-date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann.
Altogether, our PLS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year.
Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels.
We also generated record consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter.
While COVID testing has been the strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing revenue to more than double this year.
Recently, we soft-launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers.
This expanded health plan panel offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile with a battery of test and biometric measurements to provide a personalized Health Quotient Score that can be used to track health progress over time.
And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users.
In advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers.
We're seeing strong growth in non-invasive prenatal testing significantly above 2019 levels and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics.
We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emerging variants, expanding the -- of the work that we performed in the quarter.
And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic from Agilent for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer.
Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians nationally at the end of the month.
Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence, we made progress and remain on track to deliver at our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business.
Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our Northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square foot next-generation lab in Clifton, New Jersey.
This state-of-the art highly automated facility services more than 40 million people across seven states.
In patient services, we are seeing all-time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our patient service centers.
Now, more than 50% of patient service center visits are now by appointment versus walk-ins and this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity of our phlebotomists.
Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated urinalysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network.
As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a one-time payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse cost they incurred during the pandemic.
Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard-earned time off.
Therefore, we are providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year-end.
For the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year.
Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenues.
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter and it was up nearly 2% excluding acquisitions.
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.3% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%.
Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%.
Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year.
We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the Delta variant and the timing of summer vacations.
Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter.
This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically total revenue and volumes typically step down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality.
As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country.
We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter.
So far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3 but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the Delta variant, while the base business continues to improve since September.
Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and, to a lesser extent, recent PLS wins.
Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations.
Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year.
On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year.
The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business.
Reported earnings per share was $4.02 in the quarter compared to $4.14 a year ago.
Adjusted earnings per share was $3.96 compared to $4.31 last year.
Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September year-to-date versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year.
Turning to guidance, we have raised our full-year 2021 outlook as follows.
Revenue is expected to be between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year.
Reported earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $14.69 [Phonetic] and $15.09 and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90.
Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.
Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook.
We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year.
At the low end of our outlook, we assume approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4 and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day.
As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through late January.
We expect reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year.
However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing.
Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4 versus 2019.
Getting to the midpoint or higher end of our outlook ranges assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business.
Well, to summarize, we had a strong third quarter.
We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher than anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as our continued progress we expect to see in our base business.
And finally, the momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day.
","Quest Diagnostics reported a solid Q3 with total revenue of $2.77 billion, a slight decrease from the previous year. The decline was attributed to lower COVID-19 testing revenue, offset by continued recovery in the base business. Despite the COVID-19 decline, base revenue grew 6% compared to Q3 2019, and volume increased 5.3% year-over-year. Notably, the base business rebounded in September following a slowdown in August. COVID-19 testing volumes increased in Q3 due to the Delta variant, averaging 83,000 molecular tests daily. Quest anticipates a decline in COVID-19 volumes but expects base business to continue growing. As a result, the company raised its full-year outlook, expecting revenue between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $13.50 and $13.90."
BDN_q3_2021.txt,"Although we believe these estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved.
Well, first and foremost, we hope that you and yours, continue to be safe, happy, healthy and engaged; and I think, looking at our business despite reopening delays related to the delta variant, the office market continues to improve, tour activity, lease negotiations and deal executions, remain on a positive trend line.
Our portfolio occupancy has increased to approximately 35%, the predominance of tenants returning has though expanded beyond just small employers, as occupancy for tenants 50,000 square feet and below is now over 50%.
During our prepared comments we'll review our third quarter results, discuss progress in our business plan and update you on our recent capital and development activity.
Tom will then also provide a financial overview and after that Dan, George, Tom and I are available to answer any questions you may have.
From a portfolio management standpoint, we remain focused on reducing forward rollover and providing a solid platform for growth.
These efforts have been successful.
We have reduced our forward rollover exposure through 2024 to an average of 6.8%, a slight improvement over last quarter.
Our forecasted rollover exposure is now below 10% annually, through 2026.
Revenue and earnings growth remain a top priority.
Key near-term earnings drivers for us are, as you all know, we have several key vacancies, that upon lease-up will generate between $0.07 and $0.10 per share of growth and we're delighted to report that we have now leased about 46% of that targeted square footage and achieved about 45% of that forward revenue growth, at an average mark to market of 12% cash and 19% GAAP and that income will be substantially in place by the third quarter of 2022, which can create a good growth opportunity for us.
Some notable components of that during the quarter, the last 38,000 square feet vacated by [Indecipherable] in Austin has been leased and we've also signed a replacement lease for the 42,000 square foot tenant in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
And lastly we did sign three new leases at Commerce Square, totaling just shy of 29,000 square feet.
We do see clear trend lines of tenants requiring higher quality space, which we do think positions our portfolio extremely well.
From a financial standpoint, for the third quarter, we posted FFO of $0.35 per share, which is 1% per share above consensus estimates, which Tom will walk you through.
We've also made excellent progress in all the other components of our 2021 business plan.
We do anticipate about a 100,000 square feet of positive absorption during the fourth quarter, and we will achieve our year-end occupancy and lease percentage guidance ranges.
And to reinforce our leasing progress to date, we are increasing our speculative revenue target by $500,000 from our mid-point range of $25.5 million to $21 million and we are over 99% complete on that revised target.
It's important to note that that $21 million target that we're now circling is about 15% above the bottom end of our original range and it does reflect ever improving office market conditions.
Looking at some other operating statistics.
We've also posted great results there for the quarter as well, tenant retention was above our 2021 business plan range.
Of the 59 new deals that we signed this year, the weighted average lease term is 7.8 years, 68% of those lease terms are longer than four years and our medium lease term has remained fairly consistent with what we are able to achieve in 2018, '19, and in 2020.
Third quarter capital cost came in below 8% of generated revenue, so well within our business plan range.
Cash mark to market was a positive 12% and our GAAP mark to market was a positive 16%.
Our year-to-date mark to market results are above our full year ranges.
However, as we noted on last quarter's call, based on leases already executed and commencing this in the fourth quarter, with lower mark to market results, we will finish the year within our business plan ranges.
We also expect that every region will post positive mark to market results on both a cash and GAAP basis this year.
Our third quarter GAAP same store NOI was 2% and year-to-date results were within our '21 range.
Our third quarter cash same store NOI was 5.5% and above our 2021 range of 3% to 5%.
But again, similar to our mark to market dynamic, tenants scheduled to take occupancy later this year will accelerate same-store growth, will enable us to achieve our 2021 business plan ranges.
We are still forecasting a 21 year end debt to EBITDA in the range of 6.3 times to 6.5 times.
And looking at leasing velocity we know that everyone is keenly focused on recovery data points and we have several encouraging signs to report.
The Philadelphia suburban market produced more than 350,000 square feet of leasing activity in the second quarter, it was at 42.7% increase quarter-over-quarter.
The CBD market also posted 181,000 square feet of leasing activity, and Philadelphia generally is making a strong recovery from the pandemic in comparison to a number of other major American cities.
Our vacancy rate is lower than the national average and based upon a major brokerage report Philadelphia is in the top 10 of all American cities for pandemic recovery, as measured by recovery rates and employment, vaccination and leasing activity.
During the quarter, we had a total of over 1,500 virtual tours and inspected over 758,000 square feet in line with second quarter results.
Physical tours were down slightly over the second -- from the second quarter and we attribute this really more to the summer months as third quarter physical tours outpaced first quarter tours by over 13%.
Our overall pipeline stands at 1.6 million square feet, which increased by about 600,000 square feet during the quarter.
Another good sign of more tenants entering the marketplace.
And while these recovery data points are encouraging.
They also do compare favorably to the pre-pandemic leasing trends.
So our pipeline today is 7% better than our third quarter '19 results.
Deal conversion rate was on par with previous quarter results as well.
Now as you might expect and we've reported last quarter, median deal cycle time continues to trail pre-pandemic levels by approximately 30 days.
But on a very positive note, during the quarter, we executed 464,000 square feet of leases, including 347,000 square feet of new leasing activity.
We also continue to see two favorable trends that we think positively impact our portfolio.
First, quality product does matter, since the beginning of the pandemic approximately 100,000 square feet of deals have moved up in the Brandywine buildings versus lower quality competitors.
Secondly, we have seen approximately 20 tenants expand their premises by approximately 122,000 square feet since the beginning of the pandemic.
In looking at our liquidity and dividend coverages, as Tom will report, we have excellent liquidity and anticipate having approximately $515 million available on our line of credit by the end of the year.
We have no unsecured bond maturities until 2023, have a weighted average effective rate of 3.73% as a fully unencumbered wholly owned asset base.
Our dividend remains extremely well covered with a 54% FFO and 81% CAD payout ratio and as we noted, our five year dividend growth rate has been 5.3% while our five year CAD growth rate has been just shy of 8%, well in excess of our core peer averages.
From a capital allocation standpoint, it was frankly another quiet quarter, but we continue to make progress on many other fronts.
As part of our land recycling program we did sell three non-core land parcels, generating just shy of $11 million of proceeds and at a $900,000 gain.
Also, as we noted in our supplemental package, during the quarter, at $50 million preferred equity investment in two office properties in Austin, Texas were redeemed.
We did record a $2.8 million incremental investment income during the quarter due to that early redemption, that $50 million preferred equity generated just shy of a 21% internal rate of return during the whole period.
Taking a quick look at our development opportunity set.
250 King of Prussia Road, which we note in our supplemental package, is a 169,000 square foot project under renovation in the Radnor Submarket, that was started in the second quarter and will be wrapped up by the second quarter of '22.
The project will accommodate heavy life science as well as office use.
Our cost did increase quarter-over-quarter due to the additional -- some additional MEP [Phonetic] work to facilitate broader life science penetration, as well as this adding an additional generator for our redundant -- for power redundancy.
Those two items did impact our targeted yields by reducing it about 20 basis points.
The project, as we noted before, is really the first delivery in our Radnor Life Science Center, which will consist of more than 300,000 square feet of life science space, and one of the region's best performing submarkets, our current pipeline for 250 King of Prussia Road totals more than 200,000 square feet, including 51,000 square feet in lease negotiations.
Looking at Schuylkill Yards, our Schuylkill Yards west project is on time, on budget for Q3, '23 delivery.
That project will be delivered -- a 7% blended yield, as you may recall, it consists of 326 apartment units, 200,000 square feet of commercial and life science space and 9,000 square feet of street level retail.
We have an active pipeline continuing to build on that project and our $56.8 million equity commitment is fully funded.
Our partners' equity investment is currently being made and the construction loan that we closed recently really will not have its first funding until the first quarter of 2022.
Looking at 405 Colorado and Austin, Texas; this project is now complete.
During the quarter we did increase our lease percentage from 24% to 44%.
We do have a growing an active pipeline now that that building has been fully delivered.
We did slide our stabilization date a couple of quarters to reflect the timing of these new lease signings, as well as the timing of our targeted pipeline.
The 522 space garage did open during the summer and is currently just shy of about 12% occupied and we have signed already 102 monthly contracts since we opened the garage.
3000 Market Street in University City, Philadelphia, is a 91,000 square foot life science renovation as part of our Schuylkill Yards neighborhood, base building construction is complete.
The building is fully leased for 12 years at a development yield of 9.6%.
The redevelopment did include increasing the building size from 64,000 to about 91,000 by converting below grade space into labs.
This property was placed in the service on October 1st.
Cira Labs, which we announced a couple of quarter agos, where we partnered with PA Biotech Center to create a 50,000 square foot, 239 seat life science incubator, within the CIra Center Project, that will be completed later in the fourth quarter and will open January 1, 2022.
Since we announced, we have had great leasing success announced and just shy of 50% -- about 49% leased, with 118 of that 239 seats leased and a pipeline with 17 additional proposals, aggregating more seats than we have available capacity.
So very excited about delivering that project on a substantially pre-leased basis.
And just looking at some future development at Schuylkill Yards and Broadmoor, within Schuylkill Yards the life science push really continues.
We can develop that 3 million square feet of life science space.
We've already delivered 3000 Market, the Bulletin Building, 3151 Market, which is our 424,000 net rentable square foot life science building, is fully designed, ready to go and with a strong leasing pipeline, and our goal remains to be able to start that project in early 2022 [Technical Issues] assuming market conditions permit and the pipeline continues to build.
At Broadmoor, Block A, which consists of 363,000 square feet of office and 341 apartments at a total cost of $321 million, will be starting later in the fourth quarter.
We are finalizing documentation including construction financing with our partner.
The first phase of Block F, which is a 272 apartment units will be starting in the same venture format in Q1 of '22.
And on the office leasing component, our leasing pipeline right now is slightly over 500,000 square feet with about an additional 1.5 million square feet of inquiries.
Just one additional note related to our third quarter earnings cycle, as we outlined last quarter, we would normally have provided '22 guidance for earnings in our business plan and FFO during the third quarter cycle.
However, consistent with what we did last year and based on the continued uncertain business climate, we will announce our '22 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Tom will now provide an overview of our financial results.
Our third quarter net income totaled 900,000 or $0.01 per diluted share and our FFO totaled 61.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share and that was $0.01 above consensus estimates.
Some general observations about the third quarter, while our results were above consensus, there were a number of moving pieces and several variances to our second quarter guidance.
Portfolio operating income at $68.5 million was in line with our guidance for the second quarter.
Interest and investment income totaled $4.5 million and was $2.5 million above our $2 million guidance number.
As Jerry mentioned this variance was due to the early termination of a $50 million preferred equity investment, which resulted in the acceleration of some fees, totaling about $1.5 million, and to make whole interest, on the investment income side of about $1.3 million, that's all was recorded in the third quarter.
We forecasted 2.3 million in land gains and tax provisions, which was $1.4 million below our actual results, two land sales were delayed and we believe they will both close in the fourth quarter.
As a result of those two that nets to a $0.01 increase to the reason we're above consensus.
Interest expense of 15.2 was below our second quarter forecast, by $800,000 and that was primarily due to higher than anticipated capitalized interest on our 405 Colorado.
Termination of other income totaled $1.8 million and was 400,000 above second quarter forecast, primarily due to the timing of some anticipated transactions, G&A was $7.1 million, 400,000 below our $7.5 million second quarter guidance.
And that was primarily due to lower employee costs.
Our third quarter, fixed charge and interest coverage ratios were 4.3 and 4.1 respectively, both metrics improved from the second quarter, primarily due to the higher investment income.
Our third quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA decreased to 6.5 and is currently at the high end of our 6.3 to 6.5 guidance.
This metric also benefits from the increased investment income.
On the additional reporting, as we look at cash collections, they were over 99%, continue to be very strong.
We did have some net operating write-offs of tenants, that totaled about 700,000 and did lower our portfolio operating income for the quarter.
For portfolio changes 3000 Market, based on Brandywine completing our base building obligations 3000 Market will be added to our core portfolio during the fourth quarter as it's 100% life -- 100% leased life science to Spark Therapeutics [Phonetic].
Looking at fourth quarter guidance for 2021, we anticipate the fourth quarter results to improve compared to the second -- to the third quarter and we have some of the following assumptions.
Portfolio operating income will total $70 million and would be sequentially higher in the third quarter, that's due to the approximately 212,000 square feet that's going to be moving in during the quarter at a positive mark to market and will commence, and in addition to 3000 Market.
FFO contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures will total about $6.1 million for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the third quarter.
G&A will total roughly $7.1 million again sequentially flat to the third quarter.
Interest expense will be approximately 15.5 with approximately $2 million of capitalized interest.
Termination fees and other incomes should total about $2.5 million.
Net management fees will be about $3 million and interest in other -- interest and investment income about $400,000.
We do anticipate land sales and tax provision to be about $1.3 million mainly based on the slides from the land sales that didn't occur in the third quarter, and this will generate about $6 million in net cash proceeds.
On other business plan assumptions there will be no property acquisitions, we did note one JV sale in our all state portfolio, which should generate about $12 million of net cash proceeds, no anticipated ATM or share buyback activity, no financing or refinancing activity in the quarter and our share count will be about 73.5 million diluted shares.
On the financing front, as previously mentioned, we did close on our construction loan at Schuylkill Yards, which represents a 65% estimate to -- estimated cost -- loan to cost.
Initial interest rate will be about 3.75% based on our current capital plan we will start drawing on that during the fourth quarter of 2022.
We plan to restructure and extend our current line -- our current loan, encovering our joint venture and 4040 Wilson [Phonetic] and that will lower our borrowing costs by about 100 basis points, generate minimal initial proceeds but allow for increased borrowings to complete the leasing of the vacant office space.
While we have no other financing or refinancing activity in our plan, we continue to monitor the debt markets ahead of our 2023 secured bond maturity.
Looking at our capital plan, our second quarter CAD was 65% of our common dividend and year-to-date coverage is within our range.
Our fourth quarter 2021 capital plan is very straightforward at 140 million, and includes $70 million of development and redevelopment activity, $33 million of common dividends, $15 million of revenue maintained and $15 million of revenue create capital expenditures and contributions to our joint ventures totaling about $5 million.
The primary sources will be cash flow from interest payments of -- after interest payments of $38 million, $42 million used as the line of credit, $42 million cash on hand and cash -- other sales and land totaling about $18 million.
Based on our capital plan, we will have about 558 available in line of credit.
The increase, in our projected line of credit, is partially due to the build-out of our incubator at Cira Center and we also project the net debt to EBITDA to fall within the 6.3 to 6.5 range with a big variable being this timing and scope of capital development payments that could reduce cash.
Our net debt to GAV will be 39% to 40%.
In addition, we anticipate our fixed charge ratios to approximate 3.6 on interest coverage and will approximate 3.9% -- Sorry fixed charge of 3.6 interest coverage at 3.9 which represent sequential decrease, again primarily due to some of the investment income that we received in the thirrd quarter.
So the key takeaways, as we wrap up our prepared comments, the portfolio and operations are in excellent shape.
We've made some really good progress on both building the pipeline as well as beginning the process of significantly filling some of those larger vacancies we have, that will be a great growth throughout to look at over the next couple of years.
And also the leasing pipeline certainly continues to increase as tenants return to the workplace, that pace is not as fast as any of us would like, but we certainly are seeing a lot of green shoots in terms of more tenancies coming into the market.
And along those lines.
We actually do expect, as we're beginning to see now, a compression of decision timelines later in the year and into early '22 and we are certainly anticipating a continuation of positive mark to markets, driven by improving market conditions, as well as the necessity of having a higher rents based on escalating construction prices.
Safety, health and amenity programs both in design and execution are remaining a top priority of all prospects, large and small, and based on that we really do believe that new development and our trophy inventory stock will remain in a very positive position.
We are very much focused on our two forward growth drivers, both delivering additional products within Schuylkill Yards, leasing up what we have under development and are delighted to be moving forward on the first phase of Broadmoor later this year and into the first quarter of '22.
The success we've had added 3000 Market, the Bulletin Building just reported results on Cira Labs, as well as a focus on starting 3151 early next year.
We'll have over a million square feet of life science space operating under construction, which starts to build that base of revenue diversification that we've talked about.
We certainly are very focused on continuing to grow cash flow and our attractive CAD growth over the last five years has really resulted in a well covered and attractive dividend that's poised to grow as we increase earnings.
And then just a final comment on financing and capital availability, private equity remains readily available at very effective pricing as well as we all know with a very competitive and advantageously priced debt market.
Strong operating and development platforms like Brandywine have significant traction for project level investments as certainly as evidenced by -- what we've demonstrated thus far Broadmoor and Schuylkill Yards, so we really do believe there is readily executable attractive financing available for our development at very attractive third party equity cost of capital.
We do ask that in the interest of time you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.
","Brandywine Realty Trust reports a solid third quarter with FFO of $0.35 per share, $0.01 above consensus estimates. The portfolio occupancy rate increased to approximately 35%, with tenant return expanding beyond small employers. The company has reduced its forward rollover exposure to an average of 6.8% through 2024. Revenue and earnings growth remain a priority, with several key vacancies targeted for lease-up that could generate significant growth. The company has leased approximately 46% of its targeted vacancy, resulting in a cash mark-to-market of 12% and a GAAP mark-to-market of 19%. Same-store NOI was positive for both the quarter and year-to-date, with tenants scheduled to take occupancy later this year expected to accelerate growth. The company expects to achieve its year-end debt-to-EBITDA target of 6.3 to 6.5 times. Leasing velocity metrics are encouraging, with a growing pipeline and a conversion rate on par with previous quarters. The company continues to see favorable trends, such as demand for higher-quality space and tenants expanding their premises. Brandywine maintains excellent liquidity, with approximately $515 million expected to be available on its line of credit by year-end. The dividend remains well-covered, with a 54% FFO payout ratio and an 81% CAD payout ratio. The company's development pipeline continues to progress, with several projects underway, including 250 King of Prussia Road, Schuylkill Yards, 405 Colorado in Austin, 3000 Market Street in Philadelphia, and Cira Labs. Brandywine anticipates further compression of decision timelines and continued positive mark-to-markets driven by improving market conditions and the necessity of higher rents. The company is focused on building cash flow and revenue diversification through its life science platform and expects to have over a million square feet of life science space operating or under construction by next year."
DLB_q4_2020.txt,"In particular, we expect that the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain at this time.
During today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
As for the content of today's call, Lewis will begin with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our first and second quarter 2021 outlook, and Kevin will finish with a discussion of the business.
I hope everyone is doing well.
Our Q4 revenue was above our guidance, but we are still down on a year-over-year basis and that reflects the ongoing impact of the pandemic.
So let's go through the numbers.
Fourth quarter revenue was $271 million, compared to $247 million in Q3 and $299 million in Q4 of last year.
Our revenue guidance coming into the fourth quarter was a range of $225 million to $255 million.
So compared to guidance, revenues were better than what we projected as we had a true-up of about $25 million in the quarter related to Q3 shipments, which was about $15 million higher than the true-up that we had last quarter, and with most of that improvement coming from TVs and set-top boxes, and PCs.
Total company revenue in Q4 increased sequentially by $24 million compared to Q3, as we benefited from higher unit volumes in TVs, set-top boxes, DMAs and PCs, along with the higher true-up that I just discussed.
And all of this was partially offset by lower revenue from mobile due to timing under contracts, and I will discuss that in a second.
Now looking at Q4 on a year-over-year basis, total company revenue is down by $28 million from last year's Q4 and we can attribute that mainly to COVID-19, especially in products and services, which were down by about $20 million or nearly 60% below last year.
The composition of Q4 revenue was $257 million in licensing and $14 million in products and services.
So let's break down licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast.
Broadcast represented about 47% of total licensing in the fourth quarter.
Broadcast revenues increased by about 2% year-over-year, helped by the higher true-up related to the Q3 shipments and also driven by higher adoption in TVs and set-top boxes.
And then this was then offset partially by lower recoveries in the quarter.
On a sequential basis, broadcast was up by about 35% due to higher volume in TVs and set-top boxes along with higher recoveries and the higher true-up.
Mobile represented approximately 15% of total licensing in Q4.
Mobile was down by about 13% over last year due to lower recoveries, but partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies.
For the sequential comparison, I should point out that last quarter Q3, Mobile was about 33% licensing, which was higher than normal, and that was due to timing of revenue under customer contracts, so we came into Q4 expecting Mobile revenue to decline this quarter and return to a more normalized percentage of revenue, which is what it did.
So accordingly Mobile revenue was down sequentially by about 50%, and that was primarily due to timing of revenue under customer contracts.
Consumer electronics represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, CE licensing was down by about 8%, mainly due to lower recoveries.
On a sequential basis, CE was about 68% higher than Q3.
And as a reminder, Q3 was lower than usual and only 9% of licensing because of timing under contract.
And so, the sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 was mostly a return to a more normal level.
PC represented about 12% of total licensing in Q4.
PC was higher than last year by about 26%, helped by the higher true-up and also because of the increased adoption of Dolby Technologies.
And sequentially, PC was up by about 32% that's for similar reasons.
Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter and they were down by about 19% year-over-year due to significantly lower Dolby Cinema box office share and that's because of the COVID restrictions and lack of big titles, and also because of lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles and/or recoveries in automotive.
On a sequential basis, other markets was up by about 32%, driven by higher revenue from gaming and from via admin fees and that's the patent pool that we administered.
Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $14.3 million in Q4, compared to $11.8 million in Q3 and $34 million in last year's Q4.
Our guidance had anticipated the large year-over-year decrease because most of this revenue comes from equipment that we sell to cinema exhibitors and these customers continue to be negatively affected by the pandemic.
And speaking of products and services revenue, going forward into Q1, we're winding down and exiting conferencing hardware sales, as we will now be fully focused on expanding the availability of the Dolby Voice experience through software solutions, such as interactivity APIs on our developer platform.
So later on, when I cover the outlook for FY '21, my comments on products and services revenue and gross margin will reflect the fact that we are exiting the conferencing hardware arena.
Now I'd like to discuss Q4 margins and operating expenses.
Total gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis.
Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter and a large portion of that consisted of charges for excess and obsolete inventory associated with conferencing hardware and that relates back to what I just said a minute ago, about our plans in that space.
Going forward into Q1, we anticipate that products and services margin will still be negative, but more along the lines of around minus $3 million or minus $4 million.
I'll cover this again in the outlook section in a few minutes.
Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $14.1 million in the fourth quarter, and my comments here are similar to what I just said for GAAP gross margins.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were slightly above the high-end of the range that we had guided, coming in at a $198.7 million, compared to $182.9 million in Q3.
And remember that Q3 was particularly low for us, because that was the first full quarter of reacting to COVID-19 and lots of our activities have been temporarily halted or pushed out.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $176.5 million, which is within our range and that was compared to $159.2 million in the third quarter, and basically the same comments that I made in GAAP apply here as well.
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $30.1 million on a GAAP basis or 11.1% of revenue, compared to $51.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q4 of last year.
Operating income in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $54.3 million or 20% of revenue, compared to $77.6 million or 26% of revenue in Q4 of last year.
Income tax in Q4 was 21.8% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
The effective tax rate was slightly higher than guidance, and that was due mainly to the mix of our income between different tax jurisdictions.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $26.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $43.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share in last year's Q4.
Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $45.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $67.6 million or $0.66 per diluted share in Q4 of last year.
For both GAAP and non-GAAP, net income in Q4 was above the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the quarter, and that was primarily due to revenue being above the high-end of our range, offset partially by the lower product and services gross margin that I mentioned a minute ago.
During the fourth quarter, we generated about $113 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $130 million generated in last year's fourth quarter.
We ended the fourth quarter with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
During Q4, we bought back about 640,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $187 million of stock repurchase authorization still available to us.
We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.
The dividend will be payable on December 4, 2020 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2020.
Before I go into the outlook for FY '21, let's summarize the results for the full-year FY '20.
Total revenue in FY '20 was $1,162 million that compares to $1,241 million in the prior year with a year-over-year decline due to the impact from COVID-19.
Within total revenue, licensing was $1,079 million, which was down about $28 million from last year due to lower consumer activity because of the pandemic, while products and services revenue was $83 million for the year, down about $51 million from last year due mainly to lower demand from the cinema industry because of restrictions brought on also by the pandemic.
Operating income for the full-year FY '20 was $219 million on a GAAP basis or about 19% of revenue and operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $318 million or about 27% of revenue.
Net income on a GAAP basis was $231 million or $2.25 per diluted share and net income on a non-GAAP basis was $305 million or $2.97 per diluted share.
And cash flow from operations for the full-year was $344 million and that's slightly up from the previous year, where cash flow from operations was $328 million.
So now let's discuss the full-year outlook.
First, let me say that we'll be facing some interesting dynamics in FY '21 with our year-over-year comparisons.
Because we have a September year-end, the first two quarters of FY '20 were mostly unaffected by COVID-19, while the last two quarters of FY '20 were fully affected by COVID.
And as we head into FY '21, COVID continues to persist and visibility is very limited, even more so the further out you tried to look.
So today, I'm going to provide an outlook scenario for the first half of the year, including our perspective on what Q1 and Q2 revenue could be and for the second half of the year because visibility is limited, we are not providing guidance at this time, but I will provide some color on some of the factors that could affect the second half.
So let's discuss the first half.
In the first half of FY '21, we currently anticipate year-over-year growth in licensing revenue, and that could be offset by year-over-year decline in products and services revenue.
The anticipated growth that we could get in licensing would come mainly from higher adoption of our technologies as industry analysts currently are projecting market TAM to be flat to slightly down in the first half.
And also, we anticipate Dolby Cinema licensing revenue to be significantly down year-over-year in our first half because of that COVID versus pre-COVID factor of comparison in the cinema industry.
And then for that same reason, we are anticipating cinema product sales to be down year-over-year.
Now within the first half of the year, based on what we currently see, here is the scenario we are assuming for Q1 and then Q2.
In the first quarter of FY '21, we anticipate that total revenue could range from $330 million to $360 million.
Within that, we estimate that licensing could range from $320 million to $345 million, while products and services is projected to range from $10 million to $15 million.
At the midpoint of the range, we anticipate growth in lights seem to be driven by a higher adoption of our technologies across a range of devices.
In addition, the Q1 licensing outlook is benefiting from timing of revenue under customer contracts, as well as potentially higher recoveries.
Now we are not anticipating as much revenue from these items, namely the timing of the recoveries in our second quarter.
And by the way, last year, it was Q2 not Q1 that benefited more from timing of recoveries.
So with that in mind, and based on what we currently see and having just gone over the Q1 revenue outlook, we currently see our Q2 revenue scenario looking like a range of about $270 million to $300 million.
And doing the math for you on the first half of FY '21 by combining the Q1 and Q2 figures that I just went over, our current outlook scenario assumes a first half FY '21 revenue range of $600 million to $660 million.
We will plan to update you on how this picture has evolved after Q1 is completed.
As for the second half, like I said, we are not giving guidance for the second half, but here are some points to consider.
On a sequential basis in our licensing revenue, we typically see second half revenue is lower than the first half because of lower seasonality in consumer device shipments and also because of the timing of revenue on the customer contract.
On a year-over-year basis, while we do expect to see continuing benefit from increased adoption of Dolby Technologies, it's worth noting that with respect to market TAM, current industry analysts reports are projecting markets like PC and TV TAM to be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half.
And that's because of an uptick in unit shipments that happened in the latter part of FY '20 that might not repeat in that same timeframe next year.
So, of course, it's much too early to know if that will be true, but that's what the current reports currently suggest.
And as for Dolby Cinema and cinema products, the year-over-year comparison should be favorable in the second half, but we don't know to what extent or at what pace.
So those are a few things to think about for the second half and we thought it was worth providing you that color.
So let me now finish up by providing the outlook on the rest of the P&L for Q1, already highlighted the revenue range scenario of $330 million to $360 million.
So Q1 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 90% to 91%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 91% to 92%.
Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from minus $3 million to minus $4 million on a GAAP basis, and from minus $2 billion to minus $3 million on a non-GAAP basis.
As I mentioned earlier, we are winding down and exiting the conferencing hardware space, and the demand for cinema products continues to be weak because of the industry conditions.
And as a result, we are reducing certain resources in manufacturing, as well as other areas that were connected with conferencing hardware and cinema products.
We anticipate that it will take several months to complete, various activities to smoothly transition our conferencing hardware partners and then customers.
With respect to the impact on our products and services gross margin, we estimate that we could start to see savings in our cost of goods sold by around the end of fiscal Q2, and that's because of these transitioning activities that we have to undertake.
Operating expenses in Q1 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $207 million to $219 million.
Included in this range is approximately $7 million to $9 million of restructuring charges for severances and related benefits that are being provided to employees that are impacted by the actions that I just mentioned a minute ago.
Operating expenses in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $175 million to $185 million, and this range excludes the estimated restructuring charge.
Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the quarter, and our effective tax rate for Q1 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
So based on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q1 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.70 to $0.85 on a GAAP basis and from $0.97 to $1.12 on a non-GAAP basis.
So that's it for me.
Over to you, Kevin.
I want to focus my comments on three main areas today.
I will start by highlighting our continued progress, increasing the number of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences around the world.
I'll then spend a few minutes on the changes we have made in our cinema and conferencing hardware business to adjust to the evolving conditions in certain markets.
And then I will share some thoughts on the exciting opportunity for Dolby to address a new world of content through our developer platform and related initiatives.
In a year where we all face challenges and disruptions, we have continued to bring more Dolby experiences to more people around the world, and they are the driving force behind the Dolby magic.
So let me start with the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos ecosystem that continues to grow.
With the launch of the iPhone 12, consumers are now able to see the benefits of Dolby Vision when they record video and share it.
We are excited about the opportunity to support this ecosystem so the Dolby Vision content can be enjoyed on social media, video sharing sites and more.
This will vastly expand the content that can be enjoyed in Dolby Vision, adding more reasons for devices and services to adopt our technology and creating new opportunities for Dolby.
During 2020, we continued to grow the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across the many ways that people enjoy movie and TV content.
At the beginning of the year we saw the launches of Disney+ and Apple TV+ with the combined Dolby experience.
Google Play, Showtime and PBS all began streaming in Dolby Vision this year.
In this quarter, Watcher a streaming service in Korea began supporting content in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
The momentum of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within movie and TV content continues to drive an expanding lineup of devices within the home.
The adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within 4K TV shipments grew significantly year-over-year.
Our partners like TCL, Sony, Panasonic and Skyworth added support for the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience deeper within their TV lineups and have also broadened the global reach of their offerings, including this year into India.
Xiaomi launched their first TV that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos just this year.
And we continue to bring new innovations to market, like Dolby Vision IQ, which optimizes the picture on your TV by adjusting to the surrounding line and to the type of content being viewed.
Our continued innovation brings new value to our partners and consumers and adds to the reasons for deeper adoption.
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos continue to grow across a broader range of devices.
Apple recently began enabling support for Dolby Atmos to the HomePod.
Earlier this year, Sonos launched its first Dolby Atmos product with the Sonos Arc and Roku began supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos with the Roku Ultra.
We are also beginning to see increasing adoption of the combined experience within set-top boxes, including the latest offerings from Free in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany.
Within Mobile and PC, Apple highlights the adoption of the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos playback with support throughout their iPad, MacBook and iPhone lineups.
We also have strong initial adoption of Dolby Atmos within the latest flagship mobile phones from Samsung, OPPO and Sony.
Lenovo launched several new PCs that support the combined experience and Dell began shipping Dolby Vision enabled PCs earlier this year.
We see significant growth opportunities within both Mobile and PC as we gain new wins, drive deeper adoption within our partners' device lineups and expand the types of content that can be enjoyed with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
In the same way, the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos enabled great movie and TV content, we see a significant opportunity to create immersive experiences within music and gaming.
These are important forms of entertainment that expand our current value proposition and grow the number of devices that can benefit from the Dolby experience.
Let me start with music.
A year ago, we launched Dolby Atmos for music with Amazon Music HD and the Amazon Echo Studio.
The music in Dolby experience has been met with deep and passionate engagement from artists.
For example, those that we highlighted in the stories from Lizzo, Post Malone, Coldplay and J Balvin.
Tidal became the second streaming service to support Dolby Atmos Music, enabling millions of Dolby Atmos devices within mobile and in the home.
Our increasing presence in music will create opportunities to grow adoption in mobile, automotive, smart speakers and headphones.
In gaming, Microsoft announced their new Xbox to be the first gaming console to support the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience for gaming.
We are also seeing a growing number of gaming PCs adopt the Dolby experience, including new products from Lenovo and ASUS this year.
As we grow the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within gaming content, we add to the value proposition for broader adoption within PCs, gaming consoles and mobile phones.
Our momentum for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across content, services and devices is strong and at the same time, we still see much of the opportunity ahead of us.
We continue to grow our presence throughout devices within the home, and we made it even earlier stages of adoption within mobile and PC.
We are focused on accelerating that adoption by increasing the amount of content and by broadening our presence in categories like music and gaming.
Let me shift now to talk about the areas where we have made some changes to adjust to the evolving conditions in certain markets.
The cinema environment remains challenging as the time of recovery is uncertain and the landscape is evolving.
As Lewis discussed, we have made some adjustments to operations and manufacturing here to reflect a lower outlook for demand.
At the same time, we remain confident that studios will continue to create great content that audiences will continue to want to experience these movies in the cinema and that they will take out the best experiences.
Let me spend a few -- just a few moments on Dolby Voice.
We entered the communication space with the goal of enabling higher quality and more natural meeting experiences.
Our value proposition of enabling higher quality interactions remains as strong and relevant as ever and we see significant opportunities to broaden the reach of our technologies.
As we move forward, we are winding down the sales of our conferencing hardware to focus all of our efforts on the larger opportunity to enable the Dolby Voice experience through our enterprise partners and our developer platform.
And that brings me to the opportunity to bring the Dolby experience to the vast and growing amount of content that are a part of our everyday lives, from user-generated content to social media and casual entertainment to everyday virtual interactions.
Today, developers can access our technology through Dolby.io to improve media and interactivity within their applications.
We have seen growing engagement from developers across a variety of industries and use cases from improving audio quality in podcast, media production and online marketplace videos to enabling interactivity in online education, social media, and live streaming applications.
This quarter, we began partnering with SoundCloud to enable artists to improve the quality of their tracks using our mastering APIs and have seen nearly 200,000 tracks mastered through our APIs in the few months since launch.
We are also working to integrate our media APIs onto the box platform this quarter to enable their customers to enhance content with our media APIs right within the box experience.
Additionally, we recently enabled our interactivity APIs to include the benefits of Dolby Voice and we have drawn strong engagement from developers since its release.
As we look ahead, we will continue to expand our offerings to address more audio and video features.
For example, now that consumers can create Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12.
We see opportunities to support content platforms seeking to make the most of this expanding world of Dolby Vision content.
While we are just at the beginning of these new opportunities, we are learning quickly from our early engagement with developers and evolving our offering to bring the Dolby experience to everyday applications and services.
So to wrap up, the momentum of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos with movies and TV content is strong as our partners continue to bring new devices and services to market.
Our opportunity remains ahead of us and we are enabling more content experiences in music and gaming that can accelerate the adoption across device categories.
Consumers can now capture and edit in Dolby Vision for the first time, expanding the Dolby experiences into the growing world of user-generated content.
And we are excited by the opportunity to bring the Dolby experience to new use cases and industries through our developer platform.
All of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future.
I look forward to updating you next quarter.
","Dolby's fourth quarter revenues surpassed expectations though remained below prior year levels due to COVID-19's ongoing impact. Total revenue reached $271 million, mostly driven by increased unit volumes in devices like TVs and set-top boxes, as well as higher true-ups from earlier shipments. While broadcast and PC licensing revenues increased year-over-year, mobile revenue declined due to timing of contracts. Gross margins were strong at 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income for the quarter was $54.3 million on a non-GAAP basis. For the first half of FY 2021, the company anticipates year-over-year growth in licensing revenue, offset by a decline in products and services revenue. Q1 revenue is estimated to range from $330 million to $360 million, with Q2 revenue forecasted between $270 million and $300 million. However, due to continued uncertainties, no guidance is being provided for the second half of FY 2021. Dolby remains focused on expanding the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across devices and content platforms, while also investing in new opportunities through its developer platform to address the growing market for user-generated and interactive content."
AVA_q2_2021.txt,"Our consolidated earnings for the second quarter of 2021 were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.26 for the second quarter of 2020.
For the year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $1.18 per diluted share for 2021 compared to $0.98 last year.
Now I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.
I hope your summer is going well and that you're staying safe.
On June 30, Washington State officially lifted most of the remaining restrictions that have been in place during the pandemic.
We're excited to see our local economies continue to recover.
We're experiencing increased loads, and customer growth is steady.
Like many other businesses, we continue to monitor the pandemic very closely and watch what's happening with variants and case count in our communities.
We're ready and able to successfully adjust our business as needed and also continue to provide care and compassion for those who are struggling.
Now let's look at some highlights from our second quarter.
We had a challenging second quarter, which included an unprecedented heat wave that brought with it several consecutive days of triple-digit record-breaking temperatures across the region.
On June 29, Spokane temperature soared to 109 degrees, setting new record -- a new record high temperature and was even higher in many of our neighborhoods.
That same day, Avista experienced a major increase in customer usage, which resulted in the highest energy usage in our company's 132-year history.
The intense temperatures, combined with record high usage, strained parts of our electrical system and caused some of the equipment that runs our electric grid to overheat.
Six of our 140 distribution substations were impacted.
To prevent the equipment from overloading and to avoid extensive and costly damage to our electric system, we implemented protective outages for customers served by the equipment that was most impacted by the heat.
Over the course of the event, we were able to reduce the impact to customers through system modifications.
We appreciate our customers' patience for those who experienced outages.
Higher customer loads, related to the extended heat wave, were the primary driver for an increase in net power supply cost to serve our customers, which negatively affected the Energy Recovery Mechanism, or ERM.
Overall, we've experienced hotter and drier-than-normal weather across the Pacific Northwest, which contributed to lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation and increased power prices.
For these reasons, we had to rely on thermal generation and purchased power at higher prices to serve those additional loads.
As a result, Avis Utilities' earnings were below expectations for the second quarter.
AEL&P's earnings met expectations in the second quarter, and they are on track to meet the full year guidance.
It was a strong quarter for our other businesses, which exceeded expectations due to gains on our investments and the sale of certain subsidiary assets associated with Spokane steam plant.
Wildfire resiliency continues to be a focus for Avista.
Our region has experienced extremely dry conditions all spring and summer.
And combined with high temperatures, wildfire risk is high.
In response to these conditions, Avista has been operating in, what we call, dry land mode since late June, and dry land mode decreases the potential for wildfires that could occur when reenergizing a power line.
Normally, under normal conditions, these lines, located in rural and/or forested areas, are generally reenergized automatically.
However, during the current dry weather conditions, Avista's line personnel physically patrol in outage area before a line is placed back into service.
This can require more time to restore service, but it decreases a potential fire danger.
This practice is in line with Avista's wildfire resiliency plan, which was released last year, building on prevention and response strategies that have been in place for many years.
Avista has committed to a comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that includes improved defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system.
In regards to regulatory matters, we are pleased to have reached an all-party settlement in our Idaho general rate case.
The new rates are fair and reasonable for our customers, the company and our shareholders and will allow Avista to continue receiving a fair return in Idaho.
Our Washington general rate cases continue to work their way through the regulatory process.
Our hearings have been held, and we expect a decision by the end of September.
In Oregon, we expect to file a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We are confirming our 2021 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share.
While we are confirming our consolidated range, we are adjusting our 2021 segment ranges to lower Avista Utilities by $0.10 per diluted share and raise other by $0.10 per diluted share.
For 2022, we are lowering consolidated earnings guidance by $0.15 per diluted share to a range of $2.03 to $2.23 per diluted share.
For 2023, we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $2.42 and to $2.62 per diluted share.
Although we expect to experience headwinds in 2022 from regulatory lag, we are confident that we can meet our earnings guidance for 2023 and earn our allowed return.
Looking ahead, we'll continue focusing on our utility operations, while prudently investing in the necessary capital to maintain and update our infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers and our communities.
I know everybody is sitting on the edges or seat waiting for the Blackhawk's next acquisition, which is a Spokane native.
We got Tyler Johnson, a 2-time Stanley Cup Champion, who is a Spokane native.
So we're pretty excited about that.
There's your Hawks update.
As Dennis mentioned, we're confirming our 2021 earnings guidance, lowering our utility guidance for '21 and also '22 and confirming '23 consolidated guidance.
Our guidance -- I'll spend a little time on that.
Our guidance assume, among other things, a timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions.
That's very important as we need -- Dennis mentioned, we settled our Idaho case.
We're still awaiting approval from the commissions, which we expect before those rates go into effect September 1.
For 2021, we expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.83 to $1.97 per diluted share, and the lower end of our guidance in '21 and '22 for the Avista Utilities is primarily due to increased regulatory lag.
That's due to increase capital expenditures primarily due to growth and higher-than-expected depreciation expense.
But that is, we believe, all timing, and we begin -- as we begin to plan for our next Washington general rate case to be filed early in the first quarter of '22, we expect that to be a multiyear rate plan as required under the new law.
We will seek to include all capital investment through the end of the rate plan period in rates in an effort to earn our allowed return by 2023.
In addition, we have experienced an increase, as Dennis mentioned, in actual and forecasted net power supply cost.
Although the midpoint of our guidance range does not include any benefit or expense under the ERM in Washington, the increase in power supply cost has reduced the opportunity for us to be in the upper half of the guidance range.
And our current expectation for the ERM is a surcharge position within the 90-10 sharing -- company sharing band, which is expected to decrease earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.
And recall, last quarter, our estimate for the ERM for the year was in a benefit position, which was expected to add $0.06 per diluted share.
In addition, we are also absorbing more net power supply cost under the PCA in Idaho.
For 2021, as Dennis mentioned, we expect AEL&P to contribute $0.08 to $0.11.
And we increased the range in our other businesses by $0.10, which really offsets the utility reduction, and that's largely due to a range of $0.05 to $0.08 of diluted share because of investment gains and the gain we experienced from the sale of Spokane Steam Plant.
Our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual or nonrecurring items until the effects are known and certain.
Moving on to earnings for the second quarter.
Avista Utilities contributed $0.11 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in 2020.
Compared to the prior year, our earnings decreased due to an increase in net power supply costs, as Dennis mentioned, mainly due to higher customer loads from the heat wave, and we had lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation because of the hot and dry conditions.
Our hydroelectric generation is about 91% of -- our expectations are normal for this year.
The ERM in Washington also moved significantly.
Had a pre-tax expense of $7.6 million in the second quarter of '21 compared to a pre-tax benefit of $0.4 million in 2020.
Year-to-date, we've recognized $3.3 million of expense in '21 compared to $5.6 million in benefit in 2020.
In addition to the higher power supply cost, we also had higher operating expenses in the quarter, mainly due to the timing of maintenance projects, as many of those maintenance projects were delayed in 2020 because of COVID-19, whereas in 2021, we returned to our original schedules and performed that maintenance in the second quarter.
The higher maintenance costs were partially offset by lower bad debt expense as we are continuing to defer bad debt through our COVID-19 regulatory deferrals.
Moving on to capital.
As Dennis mentioned, we're committed to be continuing to invest the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure.
We currently expect Avista Utilities to have increased capital expenditures up to $450 million in 2021 and $415 million in 2022 -- or $445 million in '22 and '23.
That's a $35 million and $40 million increase in '21, '22 and '23, $40 million in '23 as well.
And this is really to support continued customer growth.
Our customer growth's about 1.5%, which is up from 0.5% to 1% in prior expectations.
We expect to issue approximately $140 million of long-term debt and $90 million of common stock, including $16 million that we've already issued through June on the common stock side in 2021.
The increase in long-term debt and common stock is to fund the increased capital expenditures.
","Avista's financial performance showcased a decline in earnings for the second quarter of 2021, with earnings per share at $0.20 compared to $0.26 in the same period last year. Despite the decline, year-to-date earnings remain strong, with $1.18 per share in 2021 compared to $0.98 in 2020. The company's business segments performed variably, with Avista Utilities facing challenges due to increased power supply costs and lower hydroelectric generation, while AEL&P met expectations and other businesses exceeded forecasts. Avista confirmed its 2021 consolidated earnings guidance range of $1.96 to $2.16 per share while adjusting segment ranges to lower Avista Utilities by $0.10 and raise other businesses by $0.10. For 2022, consolidated earnings guidance has been lowered by $0.15 to a range of $2.03 to $2.23, reflecting regulatory lag. However, the company remains confident in meeting its 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.42 to $2.62."
OMI_q2_2021.txt,"I'd also like to call your attention to supplemental slides related to our 2021 outlook posted on our website in the Investor Relations section.
The company has explained some of these risks and uncertainties in its SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
Today I'm joined by Ed Pesicka, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Long, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I would like to start with a high-level recap of the strategic priorities that the Owens & Minor leadership team and I outlined during our Investor Day meeting in late May.
I spoke about our transformation based on our business blueprint that focused on; one, our culture, a culture that is based on hard work, stellar execution and an unrelenting focus on our customer, while being anchored by our mission and our ideal values.
Next our discipline, which is based upon the Owens & Minor business system that is laser focused on continuous improvement.
And third, our investments, our investments that are implemented in a disciplined manner enabling us to achieve our strategic priorities.
These three elements are ingrained in our corporate DNA, have set the foundation of our business blueprint, and have enabled us to ignite long-term profitable growth.
As committed during the Investor Day meeting, I will provide periodic updates.
Today let me start with an update on some of our investments, which we spent time at our Investor Day detailing.
These investments remain on track and are designed to provide attractive returns for our stakeholders.
Let me remind you of a few; one, we continue to expand our own manufacturing capability for nitrile gloves in our existing facility in Thailand.
This will put us in an advantaged position allowing us to have greater control and improved cost structure.
Our new capacity is expected to go live in early 2022.
Two, we remain focused on leveraging our manufacturing strength and brand value through the expansion of our product portfolio.
During the second quarter, we doubled our wound care product line and we remain on track to expand our incontinence care portfolio later this year.
Furthermore, we continue to identify additional product category opportunities to expand our proprietary product offering in the future.
Three, we are also diversifying into new verticals to sell specialty higher-margin products into new end markets.
For instance, we expanded into cleanroom glove market space under the HALYARD PUREZERO brand.
In addition, we recently launched our Safeskin consumer brand of gloves.
Next, we continue to invest in technology-based offerings that provide our customers with actionable data through our service solutions.
And finally, we are focused on the balance between technology and touch in our distribution centers, with continued investment in automation, AI and human capital, all of which expand our leading ability to be flexible and scalable to provide best service for our changing customer demands.
These initiatives are just a few examples of how we are investing to generate long-term profitable growth, while providing significant benefits for our customers.
In addition to having the Owens & Minor business blueprint in place and the investments that I just discussed, I'm equally proud of our focus on corporate social responsibility.
We are committed to delivering on both our financial and our corporate social responsibility obligations.
So far this year, we have launched the Owens & Minor Foundation, which is committed to improving our communities in which we operate and live.
Two, we released our first sustainability report, detailing the advancement that Owens & Minor has made in ESG.
And three, we undertook a first step in reducing our carbon footprint, with our electric fleet pilot initiative.
Our ESG efforts, just like our business blueprint, are part of who we are and that good corporate citizenship is fundamental to our mission and values.
Let me now shift gears to our second quarter performance.
I am extremely pleased to report another strong quarter that continues to build upon the solid performance from 2020.
A year ago, we were in uncharted waters due to the pandemic, but our ability to be flexible and adjust to meet the critical needs of our customers and the nation help to establish momentum that is carried into the second quarter.
Additionally, we continue to find ways to keep driving efficiency and be more productive, as markets begin to return to pre-pandemic form.
Now let me update you on the segments and I will start with our Global Solutions segment.
Within this segment, the medical distribution business performed well and posted much improved results.
We continue to bring in net positive wins, as a result of our market-leading service, combined with the trust we gained during the pandemic.
In addition, we saw volumes associated with elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels during the second quarter.
Related to our patient direct business, we continue to grow through new patient capture in this rapidly growing patient direct markets.
And finally, our ongoing investments in our Global Solutions segment are expected to provide continued growth in an attractive long-term outlook.
Moving on to the Global Products segment.
This segment produced significant top line growth, as sales of our surgical infection and prevention products, including PPE, remained strong.
The strong sales are a result of our increased output of previously added capacity to fulfill continued high usage, share gains made during the pandemic, stockpile fulfillment and increased elective procedures.
In addition, we saw favorable timing for cost pass-through on gloves adding to the top line growth.
In addition to the solid performance in our two reporting segments, our balance sheet remains strong, with net leverage at 1.8 times and total net debt of less than $1 billion.
This gives us the latitude to continue to make well thought-out investments to improve our operations and drive growth.
Moving from the second quarter and looking to the rest of 2021 and beyond.
We are excited about the long-term future.
We expect the rest of the year to be driven by S&IP utilization, elective procedures, opportunity pipeline and continued strength of our patient direct business.
In addition to this, we will continue to have a tenacious focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements.
As we have said, we believe that the usage for S&IP products, including PPE, will be defined by the new normal; the new normal in the healthcare industry.
We continue to believe that usage for many PPE categories will settle somewhere below the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, but in excess of the pre-pandemic levels as a result of established healthcare protocols, stockpile requirements and our share gains obtained during the pandemic.
In addition, we expect the expansion of our PPE into new markets like clean room and consumer to provide incremental opportunity.
However, as the year progresses, we expect moderation in both pricing and demand for PPE.
But let's not forget another factor to consider.
That is the elimination of PPE emergency use authorization which will create opportunity for our Americas-based, manufactured medical-grade PPE.
Let me give you a few examples.
First, most recently the FDA revoked emergency use authorization for non-NIOSH-approved disposable respirators, which will prohibit the use of these devices in the healthcare setting.
Second, the CDC has recommended that healthcare facilities return to conventional practices, and no longer use crisis capacity strategies like bringing in non-medical grade supplies.
And third, the EUA for Decontamination and Bioburden Reduction System has been revoked.
All of these actions by the federal agencies bring to light the significance of authorized medical-grade PPE in the healthcare setting.
Our unique value chain of vertically integrated Americas-based manufacturing footprint and supply chain will remain a distinct advantage for us, as we continue to work closely with the government and industry to help address the current and future needs for PPE requirements.
Next, on elective procedures, by the end of the second quarter we saw elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels.
And we expect this to continue through the second half of the year.
This expectation is consistent with our customers' outlook and assumes COVID rates don't get markedly worse across the country.
Moving on to our pipeline, our medical distribution continues to provide best-in-class service and is backed by our complete suite of products and services.
These together provide one of the industry-leading offering to best serve our customers.
We will continue to advance with a large pipeline of opportunity, while capturing net new wins.
Again, our medical distribution continues to provide market-leading operational performance and stability, that supports our customers' need for continuity supply and supply chain resiliency.
And lastly, our patient direct business, our patient direct business enjoys a leading national presence as the partner of choice for referral sources.
We are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of our customers in this fast-growing home health space.
We expect this business to continue to grow across our major product categories with an annuity-like recurring revenue model.
I'd like to conclude by underscoring the success we've achieved during the quarter.
Our strong second quarter gives us the confidence to affirm the range of our 2021 guidance for adjusted earnings per share and of $3.75 to $4.25 and adjusted EBITDA of $450 million to $500 million as well as affirm our previously issued 2022 guidance.
We continue to be excited about, what's ahead.
We have one of the strongest value chains in the healthcare solutions market while having the ability to be flexible and scale, along with the financial flexibility to invest as appropriate.
And finally, we have our great teammates that exemplify our high deal values everyday and live our humble mission to empower our customers to advance healthcare, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders.
Today I'll review our financial results for the second quarter and the key drivers for our quarterly performance.
And then, I'll discuss our expectations and assumptions for the balance of the year.
I'd like to start by saying that, we're delighted to report a record second quarter with solid growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share.
We're maintaining our expectations for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 to be in a range of $3.75 to $4.25 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $450 million to $500 million.
Also we are affirming our previously announced guidance for 2022.
I'll provide additional color on this later in my remarks.
Let's begin with the results for the second quarter.
Starting with the top line, revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year.
This represents 38% growth with strong performance in both of our segments.
Top line growth in the quarter was driven by ongoing recovery of elective procedures glove cost pass-through and higher levels of PPE.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 16.1%, an improvement of 117 basis points over prior year due to revenue mix from higher margin sales in the Global Products segment and patient direct business, timing of the pass-through of glove costs and improved operating efficiency.
These were partially offset by higher commodity prices in Global Products and transportation costs across the business.
Also compared to Q1, gross margin was lower by nearly 300 basis points due to margin compression in gloves as anticipated and discussed last quarter.
We also began to see commodity and transportation inflationary pressures in the beginning of the quarter and expect this to continue through Q3.
Distribution, selling and administrative expense of $294 million in the current quarter was $52 million higher compared to the second quarter of 2020.
The increase represents higher variable cost to support top-line growth, funding of ongoing investments across all business lines and higher incentive compensation, driven by our financial performance.
This performance coupled with the efficiency gains from enterprisewide continuous improvement led to adjusted operating income for the quarter of $116 million, which was $77 million higher or three times the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $128 million, which increased by $76 million or over two times year-over-year.
Interest expense of $12 million in the second quarter was down 47% or $10 million compared to last year, driven by lower debt levels and effective interest rates.
On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter was $66 million or $0.87 a share.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $80 million, which yielded an adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.06, which was over five times our performance from Q2 of last year.
The year-over-year foreign currency impact in the quarter was unfavorable by $0.02.
In the second quarter, the average diluted shares outstanding were 14.7 million higher year-over-year as a result of our equity offering in the fourth quarter of prior year and the impact of restricted shares for compensation.
Now I'll review results by segment for the second quarter.
Global Solutions revenue of $1.98 billion was higher by $429 million or 28% year-over-year.
The segment experienced continued growth, driven by ongoing recovery in volumes associated with elective procedures of approximately $300 million along with higher sales of PPE as well as continued strong growth in our patient direct business.
During the quarter, elective procedures continued to move toward pre-pandemic levels, while we recognize that a number of COVID hotspots remain throughout the country.
Global Solutions operating income was $18.5 million, which was $29 million higher than prior year as a result of higher volumes coupled with productivity and efficiency gains in our medical distribution business.
In our Global Products segment, net revenue in the second quarter was $689 million, compared to $370 million last year, an increase of 86%, which was led by higher S&IP sales particularly PPE volume as we benefited from our previous investments to expand capacity and the previously discussed impact of passing through higher acquisition costs of approximately $200 million.
Operating income for the Global Products segment was $95 million, an increase of 84% versus $52 million in the second quarter last year.
This was driven by higher PPE sales, favorable timing of cost pass-through on gloves, productivity initiatives and improved fixed cost leverage.
These were partially offset by higher commodity prices and elevated transportation costs.
Next, let's review cash flow, the balance sheet and capital structure.
In the second quarter, our cash flow was negatively impacted by our investment in working capital to support top line growth, inventory build to ensure supply given numerous supplier issues, global transportation delays and continued unfavorable payment terms with glove manufacturers.
We expect working capital to improve throughout the second half of the year as global supply chain issues subside and as payment terms to glove manufacturers return to historical levels.
As a result, we continue to expect 2021 cash flow to be back half loaded.
Total net debt at the end of the second quarter was $964 million and total net leverage was 1.8 times trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA.
I'd like to highlight that despite our working capital consumption, we maintained our leverage profile below two times adjusted EBITDA.
Still the improvements we've made to enhance our capital structure provide us with the operational flexibility and put us in a strong financial position to implement our growth strategy.
Our achievement in this regard was recently rewarded with another credit upgrade from S&P last month.
Finally, turning to the outlook.
Earlier today, we affirmed our guidance for 2021 and 2022.
The confirmation of our guidance range for 2021 is a result of our strong Q2 performance and improved visibility into the second half of the year.
Let me provide some context on the assumptions for our outlook.
Our recently installed PPE-related capacity has been fully deployed and our previously announced glove manufacturing capacity expansion is on track to begin contributing to our financial results in early Q1 of next year.
We now expect the full year top line impact of glove cost pass-through to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million.
Any sudden unforeseen declines in the market price of gloves could result in downside to our revenue and adjusted earnings per share projection.
In addition, we believe our patient direct business will continue to perform above market and demonstrate attractive patient capture and retention rates.
As I mentioned earlier, elective procedure-related volumes are at or very close to pre-pandemic levels in much of the country, and we expect the trend to continue in the second half of the year.
As experienced in Q2, we are now including a headwind from elevated commodity pricing and transportation costs and expect this to continue through Q3.
Guidance for adjusted earnings per share is based on 75.5 million shares outstanding.
The increase in our dilutive share count is related to the treatment of certain performance share grants and incremental restricted stock grants driven by our strong financial results.
Even with the 6% increase in shares and new inflationary headwinds, we are confirming our outlook for 2021, 2022 and targets for 2026.
In terms of the calendarization of our guidance, starting with revenue, we expect Q3 revenue to decline slightly from Q2 as the pass-through of glove cost begins to ease.
The 2021 quarterly earnings pattern is contrary to our typical seasonality with most of the year's profitability weighted toward the first half of the year.
Specifically, we continue to expect Q3 earnings to be softer than Q2 due to the timing of glove cost pass-through.
However, we expect Q4 to improve due to the seasonal impact of healthcare utilization across our businesses.
Also, remember that cash flow is expected to improve in the back half of the year, as working capital headwind soften as previously discussed.
Please note that these key modeling assumptions for full year 2021 have been summarized on supplemental slides filed with the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today and have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.
In closing, I'm delighted with another strong quarter and proud of the efforts of our teammates around the world.
As we further embed our business blueprint into our day-to-day activities, we'll be well positioned to deliver on our long-term objectives.
","Owens & Minor reported a strong Q2 with revenue growth of 38% driven by strong elective procedures and PPE demand. The company has reaffirmed its guidance for 2021 and 2022, with adjusted earnings per share expected to be between $3.75 and $4.25 for 2021. The company's strategic investments remain on track, with new manufacturing capacity for nitrile gloves expected to begin contributing to financial results in early 2022. Despite inflationary pressures and transportation costs, the company is seeing strong demand for its products and services. While Q3 revenue is expected to decline slightly due to easing glove cost pass-through, Q4 is expected to improve due to the seasonal impact of healthcare utilization. The company's strong financial performance and recent credit upgrade have provided it with financial flexibility to implement its growth strategy."
B_q4_2020.txt,"Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to investors.
These measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.
Please consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.
The resiliency of Barnes Group was apparent once again this quarter as we grew sequential revenues for the second consecutive quarter and delivered adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our October outlook.
Given the historic challenges resulting from the global pandemic for most of 2020, I'm very proud of the many contributions of our 5,000 employees across the globe who stepped up to the challenge by going above and beyond to meet the needs of our customers and support our communities.
And while I am happy with our performance, given the significance of the disruption, we at Barnes Group, remain mindful and respectful of the personal and social hardships caused by the pandemic across the world.
From the onset, our response to the pandemic was structured around four phases.
First and foremost, the health and safety of our employees.
Second, adjusting the business for the stark realities of lower demand.
Third, anticipating and adapting to structural shifts in some of our end markets.
And fourth, making key strategic investments to position Barnes Group for an economic recovery.
While we moved our current -- while we have moved our current focus to Phase 4, we have not lost sight of the first three phases as they continue to be important.
Through 2020, one thing that has remained unchanged is our vision to be a leading global provider of highly engineered products, differentiated industrial technologies and innovative solutions serving our diversified end markets.
For the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 21%, primarily as a result of lower volumes given the pandemics' continuing impact on our end markets, especially at Aerospace.
The fourth quarter saw a 7% increase over the third quarter with both segments generating sequential sales improvement.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.36, down 58% from last year.
Though, as mentioned, just above the high end of our October outlook.
Looking at the full-year, organic sales were down 22%, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.64, down nearly 50% from a year ago.
As difficult as those numbers are, early cost actions and a focus on cash generation, allowed us to maintain double-digit margins, positive earnings and strong cash flow throughout the year.
As we turn the page on 2020, our mindset is shifting and our focus has returned to driving growth, both organically and through acquisitions.
With a keen focus on our strategic filters, we continue to explore enabling technologies and market-leading businesses that would complement our current portfolio with several potential targets in the pipeline being analyzed.
We remain enthusiastic in our pursuit of value adding transactions, that strategically advance our transformation.
More immediately, an emphasis on organic investments will target growth-orientated capital expenditures, research and development efforts and further build out of our newly established innovation hub capabilities.
While these investments will influence margins in the short-term, they are instrumental to position the Company more favorably for the long run.
It's my expectation that we'll be talking frequently about our innovation and digital initiatives as we progress through 2021.
Moving now to a discussion of end market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.
At Industrial, we see the continuation of favorable trends discussed on our last call.
Manufacturing PMIs in our major geographic markets remain strong and correspondingly, we've seen fourth quarter organic orders at Industrial grow 10% over a year ago.
Sequential Industrial orders were up 9% over the third quarter and segment book-to-bill was slightly better than 1 times.
So, as we think about our Industrial expectations for the upcoming year, we feel bullish about the prospects for this part of our business.
Molding Solutions generated very strong orders in medical end markets, both year-over-year and sequentially, each with well over 50% growth.
Medical sales lagged a bit in the quarter given a very challenging comparable and the timing of deliveries.
We see that is normal given the nature of this business and expect sales to bounce back by the second quarter.
Packaging orders were very strong on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.
Sales were up over 20% from a year ago.
Meanwhile, personal care orders took a dip in the quarter and sales were slightly down versus a year ago.
However, sequential sales were strong increasing over 20%.
Our Synventive business, which is predominantly automotive hot runners, saw a modest increase in orders, both year-over-year and sequentially.
Although sales were relatively flat to a year ago, they were up 20% sequentially.
All-in, our expectations for 2021 is organic sales growth to be up in the low-double digits for Molding Solutions.
Sheet metal forming markets also continue to see a rebound, as Force & Motion Control orders were up high-single digits over last year and up high-teens over the third quarter.
While sales were down modestly from a year ago, sequential sales were up in the high-single digits.
We forecast Force & Motion Control to generate organic sales growth in the low-double digits for 2021.
At Engineered Components, organic orders were up nearly 20% on a year-over-year basis, with organic sales up mid-single digits versus a year ago.
Total sales were up high-single digits sequentially, continuing a rebound that we've seen over the last couple of quarters.
With General Industrial Markets on the upswing and global automotive production forecasted to be up meaningfully in 2021, we anticipate Engineered Components to grow high-single digits organically.
That said, we are very mindful about the current impact semiconductor shortages are having on automotive production and we will monitor that situation carefully as it unfolds.
Looking next at our Automation business.
It continues to demonstrate signs of a positive rebound as mid-single-digit orders growth over a year ago and third quarter were achieved.
Total sales growth was strong with both year-over-year and sequential growth of 20%.
Like last quarter, demand for our end-of-arm tooling solutions in automotive, and medical and pharma applications remain solid.
We expect 2021 to deliver low-double-digit organic growth as these markets remain healthy and as we launch new innovative products.
Speaking of new products, as I mentioned earlier, our investments in innovation and R&D are aimed at providing a solid foundation for organic growth.
As an example, we recently launched our comprehensive vacuum solutions product line with complete gripping solutions, advanced control systems and high-quality components.
The vacuum product range consists of about 1,100 items, including high-performance suction cups, vacuum pumps, sensors and related accessories that allow our customers to handle different objects in various industrial sectors with low energy consumption and reduce downtime.
Overall, for the Industrial segment, we see 2021 organic growth in the low-double-digit range with adjusted operating margins of 12% to 14%.
Moving now to our Aerospace business.
For the fourth quarter, Barnes Aerospace sales were down nearly 40% at OEM and nearly 50% in the aftermarket from the prior year.
Not surprising as commercial aviation remains significantly disrupted by the global pandemic, our outlook for Aerospace is certainly not as bullish as for our Industrial businesses.
That being said, we continue to believe the trough quarter of sales is behind us.
With OEM, production levels of narrow-body aircraft are expected to improve from here modestly, although wide-bodies will remain pressured.
The journey back to pre-COVID levels will most likely take a few years.
The OEM silver lining for the fourth quarter was book-to-bill of 1.6 times relative -- reflective of the strongest orders quarter since the third quarter of 2019.
One last point on our Aerospace business, OEM business, in particular, our estimates of OEM sales per aircraft for our major programs are unchanged from our prior view except for the 737 MAX.
With the award of the long-term agreement with GE Aviation on the LEAP program, mentioned on last quarter's call, we now forecast approximately $100,000 of sales per aircraft, up from our previous estimate of $50,000.
For the aftermarket, many of the factors discussed last quarter, lower aircraft utilization, weakened airline profitability and government imposed travel restrictions are still affecting the industry.
Recovery will require more widespread vaccine distribution, allowing people to feel more comfortable about flying, combined with the lifting of the various travel restrictions that currently exist.
Only then will we see commercial flights return in earnest, likely led by domestic travel, while international flights are expected to take a little longer to resume.
Until then, we anticipate aftermarket volume to remain pressured.
However, we do expect aftermarket activity to gradually improve beginning in the second half of 2021.
With that as the backdrop, for 2021, we see OEM sales up mid-single digits over 2020, with MRO down mid-single digits and spare parts down in the mid-teens.
We anticipate 2021 segment operating margin to be in the range of 13% to 14%, surely compressed by the lower aftermarket expectation.
In line with our continued focus on addressing the various topics of interest to our stakeholders, you may recall that last quarter on the topic of ESG, I took a few moments to address our commitment to make Barnes Group a more sustainable, socially responsible and diverse and inclusive Company.
While we've made great progress, there's definitely more work to be done.
Related to our ESG efforts, I'm proud to highlight that Barnes Group was recently named as one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek.
This acknowledgment is a testament to our employees across the globe who embrace our Barnes Group values each and every day.
So, to conclude, the extraordinary disruption in 2020 required many businesses to play defense, including Barnes Group, securing employee safety, keeping our essential operations running, adjusting to the lower demand -- levels of demand, focusing on costs and preserving liquidity were of paramount importance.
Given the circumstances, the financial results achieved are indicative of the quick and decisive actions taken by the strong leadership team and talented workforce at Burns.
With the arrival of 2021, we now turn to a more offense minded view, increasing our investments in innovation, research and development and growth programs across the enterprise.
While the high level of economic uncertainty still exists, we are squarely focused on controlling our own destiny, seeking out new opportunities and setting the Company up for long-term profitable growth.
Let me begin with highlights of our fourth quarter results on Slide 4 of our supplement.
Fourth quarter sales were $289 million, down 22% from the prior year period, with organic sales declining 21% as continuing impacts from the pandemic affect our end markets.
The diversified Seeger business had a negative impact of 3% on our net sales for the fourth quarter, while FX positively impacted sales by 3%.
Operating income was $32.7 million versus $61.3 million a year ago.
Adjusted operating income was $32.9 million this year, down 48% from $63.5 million last year.
Adjusted operating margin of 11.4% decreased 580 bps.
Net income was $17.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $41 million, or $0.80 per diluted share a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, net income per share of $0.36 was down 58% from an $0.86 a year ago.
Adjusted net income per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 excludes $0.01 of residual restructuring charges from previously announced actions with most of the impact reflected in other expense not operating profit.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted net income excludes a favorable $0.05 adjustment related to the finalization of Gimatic short-term purchase accounting and an $0.11 non-cash impairment charge related to the divestiture of Seeger, both in our Industrial segment.
Moving to 2020 full-year highlights on Slide 5 of our supplement.
Sales were $1.1 billion, down 25% from the prior year.
Organic sales were down 22% for the year.
The Seeger divestiture negatively impacted sales by 3%, while FX had a minimal positive impact.
Operating income was $123.4 million versus $236.4 million a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $144 million this year versus $244.1 million last year, a decrease of 41%.
Adjusted operating margin decreased 360 bps to 12.8%.
For the year 2020, interest expense was approximately $15.9 million, a decrease of $4.7 million as a result of lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates.
Other expense was $5.9 million, a decrease of $3 million, primarily as a result of lower FX losses this year as compared to last year, partially offset by higher pension expense.
The Company's effective tax rate in 2020 was 37.6% compared with 23.4% last year, with the increase largely due to a decline in earnings in jurisdictions with lower rates, the recognition of tax expense related to the completed sale of the Seeger business during the first quarter of 2020, the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income or guilty tax on foreign earnings in the US and tax charges related to prior year's stock awards.
For 2020, net income was $63.4 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared to $158.4 million, or $3.07 per diluted share a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, 2020 net income per share was $1.64, down 49% from $3.21 in 2019.
Adjusted earnings per share for 2020 excludes $0.27 of restructuring costs and $0.13 of Seeger divestiture adjustments.
While 2019 adjusted earnings per share excludes $0.03 of Gimatic short-term purchase accounting adjustments and an $0.11 non-cash impairment charge related to the disposition of the Seeger business.
Turning to our segment performance, beginning with Industrial.
Fourth quarter sales were $209 million, down 9% from a year ago.
Organic sales decreased 8%.
Seeger divested revenues had a negative impact of 5%, while favorable FX increased sales by 4%.
Sequential sales were up 6% from the third quarter.
Industrial's operating profit for the fourth quarter was $24.5 million versus $30.2 million last year.
As has been the consistent theme since the second quarter, the primary driver is lower sales volume, offset in part by our cost mitigation efforts.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes a small amount of restructuring charges and Seeger divestiture adjustments, fourth quarter operating income was down 24% to $24.7 million and adjusted operating margin was down 230 bps to 11.8%.
For the year, Industrial sales were $770 million, down 18% from $939 million a year ago, with organic sales down 14%.
The Seeger divestiture had an unfavorable sales impact of 5%, while favorable foreign exchange had a positive impact of 1%.
Operating profit of $66.6 million was down 42% from the prior year.
On an adjusted basis, operating profit was $85 million, a decrease of 30% from last year.
Adjusted operating margin was 11%, down 200 bps.
Sales were $80 million for the quarter, down 43% from last year and operating profit was $8.2 million, down 74%, primarily driven by the lower sales volume.
Operating margin was 10.2% as compared to 22.3% a year ago.
All-in, especially considering the meaningful decline in the high-margin aftermarket, the Aerospace team continues to respond well in a challenged environment.
For the full-year, Aerospace sales were $354 million, down 36% from a record $553 million a year ago.
Operating profit was $56.8 million, down 54% from last year's record $122.5 million.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes $2.3 million in 2020 restructure charges, operating profit was $59 million and adjusted operating margin was 16.7%.
Aerospace OEM backlog ended the quarter at $572 million, up 7% from the third quarter and we expect to ship approximately 45% of this backlog in 2021.
2020 cash provided by operating activities was $215 million, a decrease of approximately $33 million versus last year.
Nonetheless, solid performance in the current environment, given our focus on driving working capital improvement.
Free cash flow was $175 million versus $195 million last year and capital expenditures of $41 million were down approximately $13 million from a year ago.
Regarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was approximately 3 times at quarter end.
The Company is in full compliance with all covenants of our credit agreements and maintained adequate liquidity to fund operations.
As a reminder, the Company amended on a temporary basis, the debt limits allowed under our credit agreement.
Through the third quarter of 2021, our senior debt covenant maximum, our most restrictive covenant, has increased from 3.25 times EBITDA, as defined, to 3.75 times.
We anticipate leverage to peak with our first quarter 2021 results, though, well below the amended covenant level.
Our fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 51 million shares and our share repurchase activity remains suspended.
Turning to Slide 6 of our supplement, let's now discuss our initial outlook for 2021.
We expect organic sales to be up 6% to 8% for the year.
FX is not expected to have a meaningful impact.
Adjusted operating margin is forecasted to be between 12% and 14%.
We expect a couple of pennies worth of residual restructuring charges to come through, likely split evenly in the first and second quarters.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.90, approximately flat to up 16% from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share.
We do see a higher weighting of adjusted earnings per share in the second half with a 40% first half, 60% second half split.
In particular, we see the first quarter of 2021 being the low quarterly point, given delivery schedules in our longer cycle business in the range of $0.27 to $0.32, significantly lower than last year's strong first quarter.
A few other outlook items.
Interest expense is anticipated to be between $16.5 million and $17 million.
Other expense approximately $8.5 million driven by pension, and effective tax rate of approximately 30%.
Capex of $55 million.
Average diluted shares of approximately 51 million shares and cash conversion of over 100%.
To close, 2020 certainly was historic in terms of business disruption.
The Barnes Group team rose to the occasion to rapidly adapt to the realities of the economic environment with a focus on cost management and cash generation.
As Patrick mentioned, it's now time to shift our mindset to growth with necessary investments in key initiatives like innovation and digital that are targeted to help us accelerate through the anticipated recovery.
Our balance sheet is supportive of such investments and our sales volume and, as our sales volume returns, we expect further margin expansion as well.
","Despite the challenges of 2020, Barnes Group delivered sequential revenue growth and exceeded earnings expectations in Q4. The company's Industrial segment saw strong growth in medical end markets, leading to full-year organic growth projections in the low-double digits. Aerospace, while still impacted by the pandemic, is expected to improve in 2021, with OEM sales forecasted to increase mid-single digits. Barnes Group is prioritizing investments in innovation, research and development, aiming for long-term growth. In 2021, the company expects to generate organic sales growth of 6% to 8% and anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.90, representing a potential increase of up to 16% from 2020. With a strong balance sheet and a solid team, Barnes Group is well-positioned to overcome challenges and drive growth in the post-pandemic era."
HP_q1_2021.txt,"Such statements are based upon current information and management's expectations as of this date and they are not guarantees of future performance.
As such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.
You can learn more about these risks in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings.
Relieved that one of the most difficult years in the company's 100-year history is behind us and optimistic considering market share gains accomplished during the first fiscal quarter of 2021 and strengthening oil prices, which enhanced financial health of our customers.
We entered the new year, with 94 rigs running in U.S. land that's double the number we had in August, and the upward trend continues.
Around this time last year VTI prices were trading in the low-50s there were approximately 800 rigs operating in the U.S. land market and H&P was operating in a 194 of those rigs.
Contrast that with today, where oil prices are up over 10%, up into the upper 50s and the industry rig count is approximately 415 rigs and H&P is running 103 FlexRigs.
Obviously, a lot of happened between these two data points, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the short and medium term activity outlook from E&P companies is taking a while to take shape.
However, if market expectations for U.S. production levels continue to drop that should have a positive impact on oil prices, which further supports consensus of expectations for approximately 500 active rigs in the U.S. at year-end.
Taking this a step further, by our count, there are approximately 630 super-spec rigs available in the U.S. market.
Looking forward, we believe the vast majority of all working rigs drilling horizontal wells will continue to trend toward the super-spec classification and if activity does reach 500 rigs, the industry rig count would begin to approach utilization levels that have historically provided pricing power.
Today, we are hopeful and encouraged by the recent worldwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.
We are encouraged with an improving crude oil price picture and we're encouraged by the progress we continue to make on strategic efforts to deploy additional digital technology solutions and to advance new commercial models.
Even with the early success of vaccines for COVID-19, there remains a significant level of uncertainty regarding the global economic recovery as well as the changing political environment, and that certainly tempers our short-term optimism.
While it's encouraging to see oil prices higher than expectations, we are cognizant that even in a stable or improving environment, there remain several challenges ahead for the industry.
We are encouraged seeing the industry rig count begin to recover, the customers are still in the budgeting process to determine their capital allocation and those levels will set the tone for activity during the remainder of 2021.
We do expect public E&Ps to maintain financial discipline, related to their announced budgets.
We also expect private E&Ps to add rigs, however, we don't expect an outsized increase in fiscal '21 rig count, even if oil prices reach $60 per barrel.
A return-driven capital allocation strategy is in the best long-term interest of our industry, and that's what we're aiming to support with our solutions based offering.
H&P has a differentiated customer-centric approach of combining our people, rigs and leading-edge automation technology, which enables us to deliver the highest value wells for our customers.
And underlying principle of our performance contracts is the creation of a sustainable win-win scenario based not only on efficiency, but also by employing the advantages of automation related to wellbore quality and placement.
Our patented drilling automation software is a key driver in improving well economics for the customer by enabling the drilling of consistently higher quality and better placed wellbores throughout the drilling program.
To-date our autonomous AutoSlide technology is deployed on 25% to 30% of our FlexRig fleet and we currently have similar percentages for performance-based contracts.
Automation solutions improve the drilling efficiency of the well, but it also has a significant influence on the lifetime value of the asset by delivering a better wellbore to the completion phase, which will ultimately enhance production economics.
When successful, the combination of the FlexRig and digital technology solutions leads to superior well economics by lowering risk and increasing returns, for our customers, as well as for H&P.
We can't control the macro challenges, but we can remain laser focused on our technology solution deployment, our performance-based contracts and our value accretion for customers.
We're encouraged that several customers have adopted these new solutions, but we recognize that more work is ahead, an additional efforts aimed at change management must occur within the industry.
Accordingly, improvements in technology solutions and performance-based contract adoptions are not likely to be linear and may not always correlate with our rig count.
That said, we're seeing remarkable progress as being made today and we're steadfast and confident in our ability to lead and effect change in our industry.
I'm very pleased with our people's service attitude and the ability to quickly respond to customer demand and improve activity by roughly 35% during the first fiscal quarter.
Our market share today is back to pre-pandemic levels.
We are adding back more rigs in the competition due to our proven ability to reactivate rig safely, efficiently and cost effectively.
We believe there is an opportunity to grow our market share above 25%.
If you look at previous downturns we have faced since the 2008 Financial Crisis, we have emerged stronger with greater capability as we differentiated our offerings and grew market share in the premium part of the market.
Going forward, in a structurally smaller U.S. market, we believe super-spec rigs combined with digital technology solutions that provide improved value through wellbore quality will prevail.
Relative to the 800 rig drilling a year ago, many idle SCR and less-capable AC rigs may be permanently sidelined.
Further, not all of our competitors with super-spec rigs have the ability to enable firm coordination[Phonetic] features that many customers are beginning to require.
In the super-spec classification segment, we have approximately 37% of the U.S. capacity with 234 super-spec FlexRigs that are unique with their digital technology capability across our uniform fleet.
Another aspect of our asset deployment strategy, we plan to execute, will occur over the medium to long-term in international markets.
That strategy is to opportunistically reduce our U.S. super-spec concentration over time by deploying rigs internationally for appropriately scaled contracts.
Our international business development team is seeing some bidding activity in Argentina, Colombia, the Middle East as well as other markets.
At this time, these prospects are in early stages, but we are encouraged by the customer interest in H&P FlexRigs due to a combination of our expertise and unconventional drilling.
Our strong historical performance in these areas and the need for, what we would consider an imminent legacy rig replacement, driven by an evolution toward digital technology for wellbore quality and placement.
These are great opportunities for H&P in addition to our initiatives to improve our cost structure, where Mark will provide more details in his remarks.
On the last call, we discussed having made investments in geothermal projects and you may have seen some recent announcements by our strategic partners.
Along with looking at admissions reducing opportunities like geothermal, H&P will continue to explore and invest in new and diversified technologies as well as expand our digital technology capabilities for the long-term sustainability of the company.
Before turning the call over to Mark, I want to underscore once more the focus and success our company has made on its strategic objectives, particularly given the economic and industry headwinds we are navigating.
As we've indicated previously, introducing disruptive technologies and new business models, is a long, arduous and sometimes, unpredictable process.
I believe our dedicated teams are well equipped and our conservative financial stewardship will enable us to capitalize on the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Today, I will review our fiscal first quarter 2021 operating results, provide guidance for the second quarter, update full fiscal year 2021 guidance as appropriate and comment on our financial position.
Let me start with highlights for the recently completed first quarter ended December 31, 2020.
The company generated quarterly revenues of $246 million versus $208 million in the previous quarter.
The quarterly increase in revenue was due to higher rig count activity in North America Solutions as operators resumed some drilling activity.
Total direct operating costs incurred were $200 million for the first quarter versus $164 million for the previous quarter.
The sequential increase is attributable to the aforementioned additional rig count in the North America Solutions segment and the related rig recommissioning expenses.
General and administrative expenses totaled $39 million for the first quarter, higher than our previous quarter due to the resumption of short-term incentive accruals for fiscal 2021, but within our guidance for full fiscal year '21.
During the first quarter, we closed on the sale of an offshore platform rig to its long-standing customer as per a provision in the original long-term contract.
The sale closed for consideration of $12 million paid out over two years.
The rig had an aggregate net book value of $2.8 million and the resulting gain of $9.2 million as reported as a part of the sale of assets on our consolidated statement of operations.
In connection with the sale, we entered into a long-term management contract for this rig in our Gulf of Mexico segment.
Our Q1 effective tax rate was approximately 19%, which is on the lower end of our guided range due to a discrete tax expense.
To summarize this quarter's results, H&P incurred a loss of $0.66 per diluted share versus a loss of $0.55 in the previous quarter.
Absent these select items, adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.82 in the first fiscal quarter versus an adjusted $0.74 loss during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal '21 were $14 million below our previous implied guidance.
This is primarily due to the timing of spending, which has shifted to the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year.
Turning to our three segments, beginning with the North America Solutions segment.
We averaged 81 contracted rigs during the first quarter, up from an average of 65 rigs in fiscal Q4.
I will note here that at the end of fiscal Q1, all idle but contracted rigs, which I will refer to as IBC rigs thereafter have returned to work compared to an average of approximately 15 IBC rigs in the previous quarter.
During the first quarter, we doubled our rig activity from the prior quarter low of 47 active rigs.
We exited the first fiscal quarter with 94 contracted rigs, which was slightly above our guidance expectations as demand for rigs continue to expand from the low, reached midway through the end of the previous quarter.
Revenues were sequentially higher by $53 million due to the previously mentioned activity increase included in this quarter's revenues were roughly $4 million of unexpected early termination revenue from the cancellation of one rig contract.
North America Solutions operating expenses increased $47 million sequentially in the first quarter, primarily due to adding 25 rigs, a 35% increase in North America activity as well as reactivating 10 idle but contracted rigs, both of which resulting in one-time reactivation expenses of approximately $10.6 million.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 for North America Solutions.
As I mentioned earlier, we exited Q1 with slightly more rigs contracted and running than expected.
The activity level has continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace than the prior quarter as operators add rigs to maintain production levels with oil above $50 per barrel.
As of today's call, we have 103 rigs contracted with no IBC rigs remaining.
We expect to end the second fiscal quarter of '21 with between 105 and 110 contracted rigs.
As John discussed, our performance contracts are gaining customer acceptance and of the approximately 34 rigs that we have added to the active H&P rig count after September 30th through today, more than a quarter, are working under such performance contracts.
In the North America Solutions segment, we expect gross margins to range between $60 million to $70 million with new early termination revenue expected.
As we continue to add rigs, we will also incur related one-time reactivation expenses, such expenses are expected to be approximately $6 million in the second quarter.
As we have seen in previous cycles, there is a correlation between the reactivation cost per rig and the length of time a rig has been idle.
As a reminder, most of our rigs were stacked back in April of 2020, nine months ago.
Historical experience indicates that rig stacked for nine months or longer will incur cost of $400,000 to $500,000 to reactivate.
Reactivation costs are incurred in the quarter of start-up, so the absence of such costs in future quarters is margin accretive.
Our current revenue backlog from our North America Solutions fleet is roughly $448 million for rigs under term contract, but importantly this figure does not include additional margin that H&P can earn is performance contract criteria are met.
Regarding our International Solutions segment.
International Solutions business activity declined from five active rigs at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter to four active rigs at December 31.
This decrease is the result of an expected rig release in Abu Dhabi, due in large part to the disruption created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal '21 for International, our activity in Bahrain is holding steady with three rigs working.
We also have one rig under contract in Argentina.
In the second quarter, we expect to have a loss of between $1 million to $3 million, apart from any foreign exchange impacts, as the legacy structural cost in Argentina continue to hamper International margins.
Also we still have a pending rig deployment in Colombia that continues to be delayed, as our customer awaits on required regulatory approvals to begin work.
Turning to our Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment.
We currently have four of our seven offshore platform rigs contracted and we have active management contracts on three customer owned rigs, one of which is on full active rig.
Offshore generated a gross margin of $6 million during the quarter, which was at the lower end of our estimates.
As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal '21 for the Offshore segment.
We expect that Offshore will generate between $6 million to $9 million of operating gross margin.
Now let me look forward to the second fiscal quarter and update full fiscal year 2021 guidance as appropriate.
Capital expenditures for the full fiscal of '21 year are still expected to range between $85 million to 180 -- a 105 -- $85 million to $105 million, with remaining's been distributed over the last three fiscal quarters.
Our expectations for general and administrative expenses for the full fiscal 2021 year, have not changed and remain at approximately $160 million.
We also remain comfortable with the 19% to 24% range for estimated annual effective tax rate and do not anticipate incurring any significant cash tax in fiscal 2021.
The difference in effective tax versus statutory rate, is related to permanent book-to-tax differences as well as state and foreign income taxes.
Now looking at our financial position.
Helmerich & Payne had cash and short-term investments of approximately $524 million at December 31, 2020 versus $577 million at September 30.
Including our revolving credit facility availability, our liquidity was approximately $1.3 billion, not included in the previously mentioned the cash balance is approximately $35 million of income taxes receivable and related interest that we collected after the end of the first fiscal quarter.
Our debt-to-capital at quarter end was about 13% and our net cash position exceeds our outstanding bond.
H&P's debt metrics continue to be in best-in-class measurement among our peer group, but allows us to keep our focus on maximizing our long-term position.
As a reminder, we have no debt maturing until 2025 and our credit rating remains investment grade.
Now a couple of notes on working capital.
Our trade accounts receivable at fiscal year-end of $150 million grew by $38 million to approximately $188 million, due to the added rig activity, as previously mentioned.
The preponderance of our AR continues to be less than 60 days outstanding from billing day.
Also included in AR, there is another approximately $10 million of tax refund receivables.
Our inventory balances have declined approximately $5 million sequentially from June -- from September 30th to $99 million and we continue to leverage consumables across the entirety of U.S. basins to use and reduce inventory on hand.
These efforts are resulting in better spending rationalizations, that are reducing our out-of-pocket expenditures.
Our accounts payable terms optimization project, mentioned on the last earnings call will extend our payable terms with certain key vendors.
And finally of note, our one, the majority of our annual ad valorem taxes accrued through the year are paid annually in the fourth calendar quarter.
And two, the short-term incentive compensation accruing for fiscal year '21 will not be paid until the first quarter of fiscal year '22.
As I mentioned on the November call, we expected to use a modest amount of cash on hand, as we work toward a 100-plus rig count activity level.
As mentioned earlier in my comments we arrived at a 100 rig count level, during this second quarter.
We believe that this activity level, our point forward quarterly operating earnings, will fund our maintenance capital expenditures that service cost and dividends.
Based on our updated forecast, we expect to end fiscal 2021 with cash and short-term investments at or above the $500 million.
In closing, we are continuously working to manage our costs, both operating and SG&A expenses, as well as capital expenditures.
We believe active cost management is crucial in the now structurally smaller United States upstream market.
Various initiatives are under way to identify and drive our costs where possible to enhance margins going forward.
That concludes our prepared comments for the first fiscal quarter.
","Helmerich & Payne reported a quarterly loss of $0.66 per share, with an adjusted loss per share of $0.82. The company attributes the loss to a rise in total direct operating costs and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The corresponding quarter the prior year saw a loss per share of $0.55. Despite the loss, Helmerich & Payne's revenues increased to $246 million due to the resumption of drilling activity in the North America Solutions segment. Notably, the company has 94 rigs contracted and running, with an estimated 630 super-spec rigs available in the U.S. market. With optimistic market expectations for U.S. production growth, the company anticipates the industry rig count to reach 500 active rigs by year-end. Helmerich & Payne remains focused on deploying technology solutions, implementing performance-based contracts, and reducing costs to enhance its long-term position."
FCN_q3_2020.txt,"During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow.
To ensure our disclosures are consistent, these slides provide the same details as they have historically, and as I've said, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
With these formalities out of the way, I'm joined today by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer.
Well, I'm sure you've all noticed that it's the end of October and COVID is still with us.
And I'm guessing that's just as troubling for you and as it is for me.
I think most of us knew during the summer that the evidence suggested there would be a good chance that COVID would still be with us at this point.
I don't think any of us really expected that it would be completely gone, but I guess it's -- that most of us secretly hoped it would, and at least had some expectations it would be better than it is today.
Our company, as I'll talk about in a moment, we're in terrific shape.
We're not in perfect shape.
There's no company during COVID that's in perfect shape, but we are in terrific shape.
And that has only been possible because of the extraordinary efforts by our people, efforts to support clients, to support each other from home, efforts that collectively have put us in a strong position not only to weather COVID, but in my view, to soar coming out of this.
And today, as usual, I will let Ajay take you through the details of the quarter, but let me upfront share a couple of comments: one on the revision to guidance; and secondly, and at least as important, why I continue, notwithstanding that revision, to be so positive about this company's future.
Let me start with the adjustment to guidance.
It is really essentially an adjustment to our expectations about the fourth quarter.
The third quarter, though different from expectations and some specifics, did not come out too different from what we expected in aggregate.
But at the end of the last quarter, we had hopes that the evolution of COVID will allow for a stronger fourth quarter than we do today.
So, let me go into that in a little more detail.
As you know, I think, our fourth quarter results are typically our weakest, considerably less strong than the prior three quarters.
For example, if you look at the last five years, our fourth quarter earnings per share is roughly two-thirds of our prior three quarters because of holidays and some end-of-year factors.
This year, we thought the evolution of COVID might allow for better.
Back in July, we suspected that COVID would still be here in the fourth quarter.
But we, and I'm guessing most of you, did not believe it was going to be as present as it is today.
And therefore, we hoped for a somewhat more rapid unfolding of the opening of courts, more rapid derejudification of the legal system, more of an opening of cross-border travel, all of which, of course, would allow a faster return to normal for some of the businesses that were hurt by COVID.
We also thought that if that didn't happen at the speed we hoped for, onto the other side, we would see a continuation of the extraordinary strength we had in our restructuring business in the second quarter.
What has happened in reality is both of these, but unfortunately to a somewhat lesser extent than we had expected.
First, in terms of just the businesses that were negatively affected by COVID, they are in large part starting to come back.
We have started to see some signs of improvement in FLC and in other parts of our business that have been affected by travel restrictions and court closures.
But that recovery is at a considerably slower pace than we had hoped.
It's just not the hockey stick we expected to see begin in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter.
Second, in terms of the restructurings and bankruptcies, last quarter, if you recall, we talked about the fact that there is uncertainty -- there was uncertainty around that.
We talked about how we could, at a scenario where the government actions caused a temporary pause on bankruptcies and restructurings, at least in some parts of our world.
We believe then and continue to believe now that the restructuring market is going to be here for a considerable amount of time.
But we also understood that there could be waves because of government policies.
For example, the aggressive monetary stimulus that we have seen can affect or at least seriously delay bankruptcies and restructuring activity.
What has happened here recently is that market forces began to play out to be more in favor of loose money and against restructuring activity than we had expected, not extraordinarily worse, but around-the-edges worse.
You can see that in our third-quarter results, but you can also see it very vividly in external data.
Notably, if you look at, for example, August and September Chapter 11 filings and defaults, they fell to just over half the level that they were between May and July.
And I think the reason for that is essentially the loose money.
The loose money has allowed for an unprecedented issuance of speculative-grade bonds this year and at remarkably reasonable rates.
If you look at the rates right now, they are also not too different from where they were pre-COVID, and the spreads compared to March have halved.
And that has made a difference in the third quarter, and it's obviously making a difference at this point in time.
The consequence of that is not that our restructuring business is doing poorly.
To the contrary, it is still experiencing considerably higher demand than it did pre-COVID, but it is just not as strong as we had hoped and expected back in July.
And it is not as strong enough to offset the slower pace of recovery we are seeing in the other parts of our business.
So the combination of COVID being more significant and longer impact on parts of our business and the loose money have a slowing effect on the pace of bankruptcy filings and other restructuring activities, together, means that we just no longer feel confident in an anomalous fourth quarter, a fourth quarter that's higher or as high as the first three quarters of the year.
And if you build in a more typical ratio of fourth quarters compared to prior quarters, you get to the $5.25 to $5.75 range for adjusted EPS, that Ajay will now talk about, as opposed to the $5.50 to $6 that we had before.
So we've moved our guidance there.
That's all I was going to say on guidance.
Let me move on to what, I guess, is the next set of questions on many people's minds, which is, so what does that mean going forward?
How does that play out?
And I'm guessing there are two versions of that question.
One is, how does that play out near term?
And two, does that change the fundamental trajectory of the company longer term?
Let me talk to both of those with a caveat that perhaps counter-intuitively, it is easier to predict the medium and long term than it is the short term.
I'm sure that's also pretty counterintuitive, but that's my experience in this business.
And the reason for that is, in the short term, we can be and are buffeted by factors such as those I just described, factors that are external to us, loose money, M&A trends, regulatory activity, etc.
Whereas my view of our history is that over the long term in this business, over the long term whether we perform or not, is much more of a function to us, of what we do, which is ultimately in our control.
If we are well positioned around the core issues our clients are facing, if we have great people with great brands and if we are in the market in an effective way, my experience is, and I think the data show, we grow over any medium term.
The factors we can control over the medium term outweigh the short term factors.
As a result, in my mind, though, there is uncertainty in the short term.
I am at least as confident about the long term as when we went into COVID.
In the short term, of course, the trends we are seeing this could continue.
We are seeing a gradual strengthening of the businesses that are slow now, but it's gradual.
We don't see anything that suggests we're going to have -- go backwards, but we also don't see a current acceleration of those trends.
So we could be below our long-term expectations for some subsets of our business for a while.
And so of course, the loose money and the government stimulus could continue to erode the strong performance of Corp Fin for a while.
I should note, however, that, that can reverse itself incredibly fast, for example, with around couple of large bankruptcies or restructurings happening, we win then.
But for sure, it is possible that loose money could affect us for a while, notwithstanding our belief that loose money cannot ultimately offset forever the underlying economics of businesses.
So absolutely, there are things that are out of our control, and those things could mean there are slowness that continues into the first half of the year.
But over any medium or long-term period, one has to believe there's going to be litigation in the world, there's going to be investigations in the world, there are going to be tribunals to try cases.
Juries will eventually allow -- be allowed once again to sit in the same room at the same point in time.
There will be disputes.
We will have an M&A activity.
And the underlying economic realities will dictate there are bankruptcies and restructurings.
So over any medium term, our results, in my view, will be much less affected by forces outside our control and more dictated by questions like, are we well positioned, are we strengthening our businesses, are we going after the right adjacencies.
On the people side, are we retaining the best people, are we developing great people, are we an attractive place for people to join.
And as you know, we felt pretty good about the answers to those questions going into COVID.
In terms of the jobs and awards we had won around the world, the list had never been longer or more impressive.
We had extended into key new adjacencies that were supporting our business, cybersecurity, business transformation, public affairs and others.
We had expanded and enhanced our geographical footprint.
We had record numbers of new promotions and our ability to attract senior talent from the outside, as shown by the powerful number of senior hires that we have achieved, had never been as strong.
And a consequence of that, I'm sure you all remember, was unprecedented organic growth for this company in 2018 and '19.
Double-digit top line growth that drove record earnings.
And even if one discounts some of that growth as anomalous or a catch-up from prior years or you're having slower growth this year, our multiyear trajectory now for an extended period of time, still calculates it to be an impressive set of numbers.
Important this year, notwithstanding COVID and notwithstanding all of its challenges, we have continued to invest between each of those critical levers.
We have continued to also support our clients and what are turning out to be high-profile, brand-building assignments.
The largest bankruptcies globally, mega deals with antitrust implications, largest investigations happening in different parts around the world, Asia, Germany, the U.S. Companies facing an antitrust cases related to data privacy, and companies at the center of the COVID pandemic working toward a vaccine, among many other high-profile engagements.
As a result, we have deepened the most key client relationships in our firm and continue to win industry accolades, from leading The Deal bankruptcy tables for this 12th consecutive year, to having more employees named to who's who on Consulting Experts guide than any other firm globally for the fifth consecutive year, to ALM recently naming us a pacesetter for the financial crisis management, among many others.
Importantly, in the face of COVID, we have promoted more people this year than ever before.
Our employee engagement scores are the highest we have ever had.
Our retention rate is the highest we have ever had.
And our attractiveness to leading experts at other firms that now see FTI as a fabulous platform for advancing their careers, as measured either by the number of hires we've done or probably more currently than not -- our phone is ringing -- has never been higher.
As I'm sure you know, not all firms have gotten through COVID as well as we have thus far, and some of our competitors are experiencing other stresses.
And as a consequence, the number of conversations we're having with terrific people whose culture fits with us, who want to join us, is powerful indeed.
As a consequence, in the face of this COVID, and we have committed to and achieved record headcount growth, leaving us with a strength of team around the world that I believe is unprecedented in this company's history.
As a result, notwithstanding the incredible growth we were experiencing coming into the COVID, today, I feel at least as bullish, if not more, about our prospects coming out of it.
I'm pleased to report strong third-quarter results.
Most notably, our Forensic and Litigation Consulting, or FLC segment, delivered strong sequential improvement even with significant opportunity remaining for increased utilization.
Conversely, in the corporate finance and the restructuring segment, bankruptcies ebbed, perhaps in part due to government stimulus benefiting certain industries, which in turn had us reporting revenue in that segment at less than the level reached in the second quarter of 2020.
Underscoring our market-leading positions and resiliency, even in the face of a global pandemic, this quarter's revenue of $622.2 million was a record high.
Both billable headcount of 5,019 and year-over-year billable headcount growth of 15.8% were records that are giving us ample capacity for future growth and profits.
Let me take you through the details.
For the quarter, revenues of $622.2 million were up $29.1 million or 4.9%,, compared to revenues of $593.1 million in the prior-year quarter.
Our revenue growth year over year was driven by higher demand in our corporate finance and restructuring and economic consulting segments, which was partly offset by lower demand in our FLC and strategic communications segments and a decline in pass-through revenue as compared to the prior-year quarter.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.35 in 3Q '20, compared to $1.59 in the prior-year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.54, compared to $1.63 in the prior-year quarter.
The difference between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter reflects a $7.1 million special charge, which reduced GAAP earnings per share by $0.14 and $2.3 million of some noncash interest expense related to our convertible notes, which decreased GAAP earnings per share by $0.05.
The special charge is comprised of two items.
First, we announced in August that we have leased approximately 120,000 square feet of new space at 1166 Avenue of the Americas, consolidating from approximately 160,000 square feet of space in two offices in New York.
We expect to take possession of the space in April of 2021.
In advance of this, and given most employees are currently working from home, we have already abandoned 67,000 square feet of space resulting in around $4.7 million in lease abandonment and relocation costs.
Second, in the quarter, we took performance-related actions in our FLC segment that resulted in severance and other employee-related costs of $2.4 million.
As of September 30, 2020, our weighted average shares outstanding, or WASO, of 37.1 million shares, compared to 37.9 million shares of September 30, 2019.
WASO includes the potential dilutive impact of our convertible notes, which at the end of this quarter was approximately 337,000 shares.
We have more than offset both dilution from our convertible notes and from normal course equity compensation by repurchasing 1.9 million shares over the last 12 months.
Third quarter 2020 net income of $50.2 million, compared to net income of $60.4 million in the prior-year quarter.
The year-over-year decrease was largely because direct costs increased $36.3 million, which was primarily related to 15.8% increase in billable headcount.
We also have the $7.1 million special charge and FX remeasurement losses of $3.5 million due to weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, which, compared to a $2 million gain in the prior-year quarter.
These cost increases were only partially offset by higher revenues and a decline in SG&A expenses as well as a lower effective tax rate.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter of $122.1 million were the 19.6% of revenues.
This compares to SG&A of $128 million or 21.6% of revenues in the third quarter of 2019.
The decrease was primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expenses, resulting from COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lower bad debt, which was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee-related expenses driven by the 11% year-over-year increase in nonbillable headcount.
Third quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $90.9 million or 14.6% of revenues, compared to $92.3 million or 15.6% of revenues in the prior-year quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 22.3%, compared to 24.7% in the prior-year quarter.
The 2.4% decline was primarily due to a favorable discrete tax adjustment related to some share-based compensation.
Billable headcount increased by 685 professionals or 15.8%, compared to the prior-year quarter.
Sequentially, billable headcount was up by 374 professionals or 8.1%.
Now I'll share some insights at the segment level.
In Corporate Finance & Restructuring, revenues of $236.6 million increased 23.4%, compared to the prior-year quarter.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand and higher realized bill rates for our restructuring services and a full quarter of revenues from our Delta Partners.
On July 1 this year, we acquired Delta Partners.
And last year, in August, we acquired Andersch AG.
Acquisition-related revenues in the quarter were $15.4 million.
As a reminder, we consider revenues as acquisition-related for the first 12 months post acquisition.
As such, this quarter, one month of Andersch revenues and three months of Delta Partner revenues were considered acquisition-related.
Worth noting though, from an industry perspective, we experienced the strongest demand in restructuring in airlines, telecom, restaurants, energy, transportation, retail, healthcare, real estate, and media and entertainment.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $56.2 million or 23.8% of segment revenues, compared to $48.1 million or 25.1% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter as higher revenues more than offset an increase in compensation, primarily related to a 36.6% increase in billable headcount and higher variable compensation.
On a sequential basis, Corporate Finance & Restructuring revenues decreased $9.4 million or 3.8%.
As Steve mentioned, the volume of bankruptcies in the U.S. slowed in July and August, and we experienced a sequential decline in demand for our restructuring services.
This decline in restructuring revenues was only partially offset by an increase in revenues in business transformation and transactions, which includes the Delta Partners acquisition.
In transactions, we are seeing a good pickup in the activity in healthcare, telecom, media and technology, retail, chemicals and industrials, in particular with our private equity clients.
Sequentially, adjusted segment EBITDA declined more than revenue because of sharply higher headcount-related costs driven by the 18.1% increase in billable headcount.
SG&A expense also rose because of a onetime adjustment to earn-out accretion expenses related to our Andersch acquisition, and additional employee and infrastructure costs added as part of the Delta Partners acquisition.
Turning to FLC, our revenues of $119.1 million decreased 16.5%, compared to the prior-year quarter.
The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by lower demand for disputes and investigation services, in part because certain matters were at least deferred due to travel restrictions to client locations as well as foreclosures and delays.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $13.6 million or 11.4% of segment revenues, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27 million or 18.9% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
The year-over-year decrease in adjusted segment EBITDA was also primarily due to lower revenues with lower staff utilization, which was only partially offset by a decline in SG&A expenses.
Sequentially, FLC revenues increased $12.7 million or 12% as demand rose for our investigations, data and analytics and dispute services.
Notably, we saw a gradual opening of courts over the course of the quarter, and trial dates are getting scheduled.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased $22.6 million compared to the second quarter of 2020.
This impressive rebound is primarily due to the increase in revenues as well as lower compensation, which included variable compensation accruals and lower bad debt.
As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we took a special charge within our FLC segment, resulting from severance payments to 16 employees.
Our economic consulting segment's revenues of $155 million increased 9.4% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Like last quarter, revenue growth was driven by higher demand and realized bill rates for large M&A-related antitrust engagements.
Our adjusted segment EBITDA of $25.7 million or 16.6% of segment revenues, compared to $19.4 million or 13.7% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
The year-over-year increase in adjusted segment EBITDA was due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in compensation primarily due to a 15.2% increase in billable headcount and higher variable compensation.
Sequentially, Economic Consulting's revenues increased $3.5 million or 2.3%.
We delivered higher revenues in our International Arbitration business as the virtual testimony was introduced more broadly during the quarter.
Also noteworthy, we are seeing higher demand for our non-M&A-related antitrust services and higher demand for our financial economics and breach of contract services, driven by an uptick in demand arising from COVID-19-related disputes.
This was partially offset by a decline in revenues for our M&A-related antitrust services compared to the second quarter of 2020.
In Technology, revenues of $58.6 million increased 2.6% compared to the prior-year quarter.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand for global cross-border investigation and litigation services, which was partially offset by a decline in demand for M&A-related services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $11.9 million or 20.4% of segment revenues, compared to $12.3 million or 21.5% of segment revenues in this prior-year quarter.
The decrease in adjusted segment EBITDA was due to higher compensation primarily related to a 13.2% increase in billable headcount.
On a sequential basis, Technology revenues increased $11.5 million or 24.4% primarily due to higher demand for our investigation services and a surge in demand for M&A-related second request services.
Revenues in the strategic communications segment of $53 million decreased $7 million or 11.7% compared to the prior-year quarter.
The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower demand for corporate reputation and financial communications services and a $2.3 million decline in pass-through revenues.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $8.4 million or 15.9% of net segment revenues, compared to $12.6 million or 21.1% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
The decrease in adjusted segment EBITDA was primarily due to lower revenues.
Sequentially, strategic communications revenues decreased $3.9 million or 6.9%, primarily due to a decline for our restructuring and financial communications services, which had surged during the second quarter with a rush of bankruptcy filings.
Let me now discuss free cash flow and balance sheet items.
We generated net cash from operating activities of $111.6 million and free cash flow of $99.8 million in the quarter.
Total debt net of cash of $36.6 million decreased $21.2 million, compared to $57.8 million at September 30, 2019.
During the quarter, we have repurchased 749,315 shares at an average price per share of $110.57 for a total cost of $82.9 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $182.4 million remaining available for share repurchases under our current authorization.
Turning now to our guidance.
At the outset of the pandemic, parts of our business experienced a strong tailwind, particularly our restructuring business, while other parts of our business experienced a strong downdraft from deferral -- from a deferral of work, if not a reduction in demand.
The exact trade-offs between these opposing forces was and is uncertain.
Regardless, we maintained our guidance all through this year.
Now with three quarters under our belt, we are adjusting our guidance ranges for this 2020 only slightly downwards, with the higher end of our revised ranges still within our original range.
We now expect 2020 revenues will range between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion.
This compares to the previous revenue range of $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion.
We now expect 2020 GAAP earnings per share will range between $4.93 and $5.43.
This compares to the previous GAAP earnings per share range of between $5.32 and $5.82, and includes our third-quarter special charge of $0.14 per share and an estimated noncash interest expense of $0.18 per share related to 2023 convertible notes.
And we now expect 2020 adjusted earnings per share will range between $5.25 and $5.75.
This compares to the previous adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6.
First, we experienced a reduction in the volume of bankruptcies over the last few months compared to the second quarter of 2020.
And our revised guidance assumes a similar level of bankruptcies in the fourth quarter as we had this quarter.
As Steve mentioned, in terms of restructuring globally, the pandemic has had an uneven impact on many industries and government subsidies and policies have altered the natural course.
In aggregate, in the fourth quarter, we now expect continued distressed situations in oil and gas exploration, production and drilling; healthcare; automotive; department stores; airlines; restaurants; and entertainment and entertainment venues.
So the level of such demand is not expected to be as strong as earlier in the year.
Second, we delivered strong sequential improvement in our FLC segment.
While there remains significant room for further improvement from higher utilization, we expect such improvement to be gradual.
Other segments, despite the pandemic, are doing well.
However, we are also approaching year-end and are expecting our employees to take well-deserved vacations with ensuing typical seasonal impact to billings across all segments.
Before I close, I want to reiterate a few key themes that underscore the long-term strength and potential of our business.
First, we believe we are the leading in -- the world leader, in restructuring.
And we expect waves of defaults in the coming 12 to 24 months, so timing is uncertain.
With our record staff additions in this segment, and as we continue to invest for growth, we are better positioned now to help our clients globally than ever before.
Second, we have significantly diversified our offerings over the last several years with investments in areas such as non-M&A antitrust, international arbitration, business transformation, cybersecurity and public affairs.
Not only are we producing better results in FLC, but also, we are seeing these practices strengthening as we slowly emerge on the other side of this pandemic.
Third, we believe we are the choice employer in our practice areas and continue to attract talent because our colleagues are working on our highest profile engagements in their fields across the globe.
Fourth, at our core, we help our clients, especially in times of dislocation, as they navigate through their most complex business challenges.
This pandemic will undoubtedly result in a new genre of disputes, investigations and conflicts that our experts are already assisting with and supporting.
And fifth, in the last 12 months, we have reduced net debt by $21.2 million while repurchasing $212.2 million worth of our shares, and acquiring Delta Partners, the preeminent technology, media and telecom focused consulting practice.
Our good business generates tremendous free cash flow and our balance sheet is enviable, giving us the ability to continue to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders.
","FTI Consulting reported solid third-quarter results despite COVID-19's ongoing impact. Revenue reached $622.2 million, driven by strong performance in Corporate Finance & Restructuring (CFR). CFR revenues increased 23.4% due to higher demand for restructuring services and acquisitions. However, FLC revenues declined 16.5% due to lower demand for investigations and disputes. Despite this, FLC saw an impressive rebound in EBITDA in Q3. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.54, slightly below the previous guidance range of $5.50 to $6. However, the company revised its FY2020 guidance to $5.25 to $5.75 due to expectations of a slower pace of bankruptcy filings and slower recovery in FLC in the fourth quarter. Despite these adjustments, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, citing its leading market position in restructuring, diversification of offerings, and continued investment in growth. FTI Consulting continues to attract top talent and generate strong free cash flow, enabling it to invest and return capital to shareholders."
PEG_q2_2021.txt,"pseg.com, and our 10-Q will be filed shortly.
We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which differ from net income or loss as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021 versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter.
GAAP results for the second quarter were $0.35 per share net loss related to transition charges at PSEG Power, and that compares with $0.89 per share of net income for the second quarter of 2020.
Also in the quarter, PSEG Power recorded a pre-tax impairment of $519 million at its New England Asset Group, partly offset by a pre-tax gain of $62 million from the sale of the Solar Source portfolio.
We continue to make great progress on a number of fronts to position ourselves for the future.
We had a strong operating quarter that, once again, produced non-GAAP operating earnings in line with our expectations for the year.
Our results for the second quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the first half of 2021 to $1.98 per share.
This 9% increase over non-GAAP results of $1.82 per share for the first half of 2020 reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations and continued derisking at PSEG Power.
Slides 13 and 15 summarize the results for the quarter and the first half of the year.
It's been a year since we announced our intentions to explore strategic alternatives for our non-nuclear generation assets, and I'm pleased with the progress to date in what I believe is a compelling platform for future regulated growth at PSE&G.
Our utility, a clean energy infrastructure-focused business, will be complemented by a significantly contracted, carbon-free generating portfolio, consisting of our nuclear fleet and investments and opportunities in regional Offshore Wind.
The marketing of the fossil assets has garnered a significant level of interest from numerous qualified buyers in a competitive process, which is advancing as expected.
And we expect to provide you with more information on this process in the very near future.
I'm pleased that we've reached a balanced agreement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Division of Rate Counsel on PSE&G's transmission rate, which, if approved by FERC, will resolve a significant regulatory uncertainty for us and provide a timely rate reduction for customers.
PSE&G has agreed to voluntarily reduce its annual transmission revenue requirement, which includes a reduction in its base return on equity to 9.9% from 11.18%.
If approved by the FERC, a typical electric residential customer will save 3% on their monthly bills.
New Jersey continues to experience positive economic activity since Governor Murphy lifted the Public Health Emergency Order in June.
Our largest customer class in terms of sales, the commercial segment, has shown a rebound in electricity demand.
Electric sales overall adjusted for weather were up nearly 4% over the second quarter of 2020, led by an 11% increase in commercial sales, which was partly offset by a 5% decline in residential sales as people gradually returned to work outside the home.
The warmer-than-normal summer has also increased PSE&G's average daily peak load for the quarter to 5,480 megawatts compared to last year's second-quarter average of 5,100 megawatts and the 5,330 megawatts experienced in the pre-COVID second quarter of 2019.
And so far this summer, PSE&G's load has peaked at 10,064 megawatts on June 30, exceeding the 10,000-megawatt mark for the first time since July 19 of the year 2013, eight years ago.
Turning to clean energy developments in New Jersey, the BPU in June awarded a second round of Offshore Wind projects totaling 2,658 megawatts and is now halfway toward the state's goal of procuring 7,500 megawatts of Offshore Wind generation by 2035.
The award was split between the 1,510 megawatt Atlantic Shores project and Orsted's 1,148 megawatt Ocean Wind 2.
The OREC price is set in the second round range from about $86 to $84 for the Atlantic Shores and Ocean Wind projects, respectively.
And last week, the BPU approved a new solar successor incentive framework that consists of two programs: an administratively determined incentive; and a competitive solicitation incentive, which would apply to larger projects defined as five megawatts and above.
Incentive levels for the administratively determined segment range from $90 per megawatt-hour for net-metered residential projects to $70 to $100 per megawatt-hour for the commercial and community solar segments and up to $120 per megawatt-hour for certain public entity projects.
You will recall that the prior program consisting of solar renewable energy credits or as we frequently refer to them as SRECs, average well above $200 per megawatt-hour over the past decade.
And combined with net metering subsidies and federal tax credits provided later incentives topping $300 per megawatt-hour.
So this successor program is a positive step toward balancing the need for clean energy while recognizing the importance of affordability for our customers.
PSEG's existing solar programs are essentially fully subscribed.
We'll continue to work with the state MBP on programs that can help meet the solar goals in the Energy Master Plan.
PSEG continues to make tangible progress on our own decarbonization and ESG goals.
In the second quarter alone, we closed on our 25% equity stake in the 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project in New Jersey, that's the Ocean Wind one project, obviously.
We retired our last coal unit at Bridgeport Harbor in Connecticut, making our generating fleet coal-free, and moved up our net-zero vision by 20 years to 2030.
But not only do we accelerate the net-zero vision, we also expanded it to include Scope one direct greenhouse gas emissions, and Scope two indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations at both PSEG Power and PSE&G.
Expanding the net-zero vision to include both the utility and power operations is a significant move forward in our decarbonization efforts and one that will both inspire and challenge us to do more and do it better.
Coming up, PSEG is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build Offshore Wind transmission infrastructure.
This solicitation is intended to procure transmission solutions to this important New Jersey 7,500-megawatt Offshore Wind target by 2035.
The potential projects can cover onshore upgrades, new onshore transmission connection facilities, new offshore transmission connection facilities, and a network to offshore transmission system.
Proposals may address any or all of these four components.
The decision-making criteria is expected to include, among other things: an evaluation of reliability and economic benefits; cost; constructability; environmental benefits; permitting risks; and other ""New Jersey benefits"".
This competitive transmission open window will be jointly conducted by PJM and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
PJM will lead the technical analysis of the proposed transmission solutions, and the BP will be the ultimate decision-maker.
We support the state's efforts to procure transmission in a manner that is most reliable, constructible, and cost-effective for our customers.
All of this is great progress on our decarbonization efforts and continues to demonstrate our alignment with the state's Clean Energy agenda and our industry leadership on environmental stewardship.
New Jersey's recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by our New Jersey nuclear plants through the second zero-emission certificates, I'll refer to that as ZEC for the rest of this conversation, extends the $10 per megawatt-hour carbon-free attribute recognition through May of 2025.
This extension will allow us, along with stakeholders in New Jersey and at the federal level, the time we need to work on a long-term economic solution to keep our merchant nuclear fleet economically viable and preserve its currently unmatched contribution of reliable, carbon-free baseload generation, the most cost-effective clean generation source available.
During the ZEC deliberations, a growing recognition of these nuclear units were economically at risk, but vitally important to New Jersey's ability to reach its clean energy and carbon goals gain further traction.
The importance of the New Jersey nuclear units to the state's climate goals was also recognized in the BPU Staff's recent resource adequacy report.
The report recommends that New Jersey should continue exploring a regionwide or New Jersey-only integrated clean capacity market, with the fixed resource requirement, often, we refer to that as an FRR.
We expect that the BPU will be closely watching to see whether FERC accepts PJM's just filed modifications to the minimum offer price rule which appears to better align the PJM capacity market with New Jersey's clean energy goals.
The results of the first PJM capacity auction in three years, influenced by a COVID-19 pandemic stifled demand curve, served as further evidence of the market risks faced by our nuclear units.
This sentiment is shared by Biden administration officials, including DOE Secretary Granholm and White House Domestic Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, who have both spoken publicly on the importance of nuclear energy as a clean energy resource.
We continue to work on promoting a federal nuclear production tax credit proposal where the value of the credit declines as market revenue increases.
This is the primary federal policy that would help prevent premature closing of merchant plants whose market revenues are not currently covering cost and risk.
Other options, such as the federal nuclear grant program administered by the Department of Energy are also being discussed.
However, we and others in the industry share the view that a competitive grant program will not provide timely relief nor the certainty these plants need to remain operational.
Nonetheless, we're encouraged by the attention that at-risk nuclear plants are getting in Washington.
And we especially appreciate the efforts of New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell, who's leading this effort in the House of Representatives, and Senators Cardin, Manchin, and Booker in the Senate.
That said, we do expect the federal infrastructure effort to take the better part of the rest of the year to unfold.
On the social side of ESG during the second quarter, we recognized the Juneteenth holiday by giving employees paid time off to commemorate and celebrate this important day in our nation's history and supported our LBGTQ+ community with numerous events for Pride Month.
Also in June, PSEG was named to JUST Capital's Top 100 companies supporting healthy families and communities.
Overall, we had a solid quarter and results for the first half of the year have positioned us to update our full-year guidance somewhat earlier than has been our practice.
We are raising by $0.05 per share at the bottom end of PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for full-year 2021 to a range of $3.40 to $3.55 per share, based on favorable results of PSE&G and Power through the first six months of the year.
This update also incorporates an August one effective date to implement the transmission rate settlement and the expectation that the fossil assets will contribute to consolidated results through the end of the year.
We're on track to achieve the Utilities 2021 planned capital spending of $2.7 billion on schedule and on budget.
This spend is part of PSEG's consolidated five-year, $14 billion to $16 billion capital plan, which we still intend to execute without the need to issue new equity, while also continuing to offer the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend.
Before closing, I do want to recognize the contributions of Dave Daly, who will be retiring on January 4, 2022, after 35 years of dedicated service to the company.
Kim Hanemann, who had been named PSE&G's Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to succeed Dave as President and COO of PSE&G effective June 30.
In support of a seamless transition of leadership at PSE&G, Dave is serving as an executive advisor through the end of the year.
With her promotion, Kim is the first woman to lead New Jersey's largest electric and gas utility in our 118-year history.
Many of you know Kim is the power behind the transmission buildout over the past 10 years, and I hope all of you will have the opportunity to meet here in the near future.
Speaking of meeting, New Jersey has among the highest rates of fully vaccinated people in the country, but vaccination rates in the state have recently plateaued.
So we're carefully monitoring the impact that highly contagious variants are having on updated health and safety protocols.
So whether in person or virtually, we are looking forward to hosting an investor-owned -- an investor event in the fall when we expect to share with you the many good things that are happening at PSEG regarding our improved business mix, increased financial flexibility, and solid growth opportunities.
As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of 2021 at $0.70 per share versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter.
We've provided you with an information on Slides 13 and 15 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter and the year-to-date periods, and Slides 14 and 16 contain corresponding waterfall charts that take you through the net changes in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business.
I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.
PSE&G reported net income of $309 million or $0.61 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with net income of $283 million or $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2020.
PSE&G's second-quarter results reflect revenue growth from ongoing capital investment programs.
Growth in transmission added $0.01 per share to second-quarter net income, reflecting continued infrastructure investment as well as the timing of transmission O&M in the quarter and true-ups from prior year filings.
Electric margin added $0.02 per share to net income compared to the year-earlier quarter, driven by commercial and industrial demand, reflecting higher margins in April and May compared to the COVID-19 restrictions that affected prior year results; and the implementation of the Conservation Incentive Program or CIP mechanism in June.
Gas margin added $0.01 per share, driven by the Gas System Modernization Program rate rollings.
Gas-related bad debt expense and O&M expense were both $0.01 per share favorable compared to the year-earlier quarter, driven by the timing of COVID-related deferrals since the issuance of the BPU's order in the third quarter of last year.
An increase in distribution-related depreciation due to higher rate base lowered net income by $0.01 per share.
Nonoperating pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the second quarter of 2020, reflecting the continued recognition of strong asset returns experienced last year.
Tax expense was $0.02 unfavorable compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by the timing of adjustments to reflect PSE&G's estimated annual effective tax rate.
The transmission agreement between PSE&G, the BPU, and Rate Counsel that Ralph mentioned earlier has been filed with FERC for approval with an August one requested effective date.
There's no timetable from when FERC must respond, however, we will begin recording the impacts of the settlement on our financials starting with the August one requested effective date.
The agreement would reset the base ROE for PSE&G's formula rate to 9.9% from 11.18%, which lowers the annual transmission revenue requirement by about $100 million per year on a pre-tax basis.
Other key elements of the settlement lower annual depreciation expense by approximately $42 million, which has a corresponding reduction in revenue that results in no net impact on earnings and an improved cost recovery methodology for our administrative and general costs and investments in materials and supplies.
The agreement also includes an increase of PSE&G's equity ratio from 54% to 55% of total capitalization.
The financial impact of the settlement agreement is expected to lower PSE&G's net income by approximately $50 million to $60 million or $0.10 to $0.12 per share on an annual basis in the first 12 months once implemented.
Weather for the second quarter was significantly warmer than the second quarter of 2020, with the temperature-humidity index that was 34% higher than normal and a significantly higher than normal number of hours at 90 degrees or greater.
The New Jersey economy continued to recover in the second quarter, increased by total weather-normalized electric sales by approximately 4% compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was at the height of the COVID-19 economic restrictions.
On a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric and gas sales were each higher by approximately 1%, with residential electric and gas usage up by 4% and 2%, respectively.
The Conservation Incentive Program, which started June one for electric sales, removes the variations of weather, economic activity, efficiency, and customer usage from our financial results, resetting margins to a baseline level.
This new mechanism supports PSE&G's ability to maximize customer participation in energy efficiency programs without losing margins from lower sales.
A similar program covering gas sales will commence October one and replace the weather normalization clause.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule.
PSE&G invested approximately $700 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date through June.
This capital was part of 2021's $2.7 billion Electric and Gas Infrastructure Program to upgrade transmission and distribution facilities and enhance reliability and increase resiliency.
We continue to forecast over 90% of PSEG's planned capital investment will be directed to the utility over the 2021 to 2025 time frame.
PSE&G's forecast of net income in 2021 has been updated to $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion from $1.41 billion to $1.47 billion.
Now moving on to Power.
PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of $0.10 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $159 million.
This compares to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.24 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $258 million for the second quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation, and amortization expense.
We also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the first half of 2021 on Slide 24.
PSEG Power's second-quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were affected by several items that combined lowered results by $0.14 per share below the quarter from a year ago.
Recontracting and market impacts reduced results by $0.09 per share, reflecting seasonal shape of hedging activity and higher cost to serve load versus the year-ago quarter.
Generating volume and zero-emission certificates were each down by $0.01 per share, affected by lower nuclear output related to the spring refueling outage at the 100% owned Hope Creek Nuclear Plant.
PJM capacity revenue added $0.02 per share to the year-ago quarterly comparison.
For the year ended June 30 -- for the year-to-date ended June 30, capacity is $0.05 per share favorable compared to the first half of 2020, reflecting the scheduled higher price of approximately $167 per megawatt day for the majority of the first half of 2021 versus the $116 per megawatt day for the same period in 2020.
Higher O&M expense reduced results by $0.04 per share compared to last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the planned Hope Creek refueling outage and higher fossil operating expenses.
Lower depreciation expense, reflecting the sale of the solar source portfolio and the early retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor coal-fired generating station, combined with lower interest expense, to add $0.02 per share versus the year-ago quarter.
Taxes and other items were $0.03 per share unfavorable, reflecting the absence of a multi-year tax audit settlement included in the second quarter 2020 results.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2020 was $28 per megawatt-hour compared with $33 per megawatt-hour for last year's second quarter.
The decline quarter-over-quarter reflects the seasonal price impact of recontracting, that is anticipated to result in a negative $2 per megawatt-hour price decline in the hedge portfolio for the full year.
We expect recontracting results in the third quarter of 2021 to be similarly negative, as we mentioned last quarter, will more than offset the $0.03 per share benefit seen in the first quarter of this year.
Now let's turn to Power's operations.
Total generation output declined by 1% to 12.6 terawatt-hours in the second quarter as the refueling outage at Hope Creek and subsequent forced out its lower nuclear output versus the second quarter of 2020.
The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86% for the quarter, producing 7.2 terawatt-hours, down by 7% versus last year, which represented 57% of total generation.
Power's combined-cycle fleet produced 5.3 terawatt-hours of output, up 8% in response to higher market demand helped by warm weather.
Power is forecasting generation output of 25 to 27 terawatt-hours for the remaining two quarters of 2021 and has hedged 95% to 100% of its production at an average price of $30 per megawatt-hour.
Also during the quarter, we're pleased to remind you that PSEG Power eliminated all coal from its generating mix with the early retirement of Bridgeport Harbor Station three.
Power's quarterly impairment assessments, including consideration of its strategic review of the non-nuclear fleet, determined that the ISO New England asset grouping showed an impairment as of June 30, 2021.
As a result, Power recorded a pre-tax charge of $519 million for this asset group.
PJM and New York ISO asset groupings did not show an impairment as of June 30, 2021.
However, a move of these assets to held for sale, which would be effective upon an anticipated sale agreement, would be expected to prompt an additional material impairment to the fossil portfolio.
Such a move to held for sale would also prop the cessation of depreciation and amortization expense for the held-for-sale units, resulting in a favorable impact to GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings through the close of the transaction.
In June of 2021, PSEG completed the sale of PSEG's Solar Source, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $62 million and income tax expense of approximately $63 million, primarily due to the recapture of investment tax credits on units that operated for less than five years.
For the remainder of the year, depreciation expense will also decline by approximately $0.03 per share as a result of the Solar Source sale.
Forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 has been updated to $295 million to $370 million, from $280 million to $370 million, while our estimated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $850 million to $950 million.
Now let me briefly address operating results from Enterprise and Other and provide an update on PSEG Long Island.
For the second quarter of 2021, PSEG Enterprise and Other reported a net loss of $3 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2021, which was flat compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2020.
The net loss for the second quarter of 2021 reflects higher interest expense at the parent initially offset -- partially offset, I should say, by the ongoing contributions from PSEG Long Island.
In June, PSEG Long Island entered into a nonbinding term sheet with the Long Island Power Authority, that would resolve all the authorities claims related to Tropical Storm Isaias.
The terms will be adopted into amendments to our operation service agreement, or OSA, and submitted to New York state authorities for approval later this year.
The OSA contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend.
For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million.
PSEG's financial position remains strong.
At June 30, we had approximately $4 billion of available liquidity, including cash on hand of about $107 million, and debt represented 52% of our consolidated capital.
During the first half of 2021, PSEG entered into 2,364-day variable rate term loan agreements totaling $1.25 billion.
During the second quarter, PSEG Power retired $950 million of senior notes maturing in June and September 2021 and ended June with debt as a percentage of capital of 20%.
In May, Moody's changed PSE&G's credit rating outlook to negative from stable.
Their first mortgage bond rating remains Aa3.
We still expect to fund PSEG's $14 billion to $16 billion capital investment program over the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity, while also continuing to offer consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend payment.
As Ralph mentioned, we've raised the bottom end of our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $3.40 to $3.55 per share, up by $0.05 per share based on the solid results we have seen in the first half of the year that give us confidence that we can deliver results at the upper end of our original guidance.
That concludes my comments.
And Carol, we are now ready to answer questions.
","PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease from $0.79 per share in the previous year. Despite a net loss of $0.35 per share in GAAP results due to transition charges at PSEG Power, the company's results for the first half of 2021 reflect a 9% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings to $1.98 per share, driven by growth in regulated operations and derisking at PSEG Power. The company has made progress in its strategic review of non-nuclear generation assets, with the marketing of fossil assets garnering significant interest. PSEG has reached an agreement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Division of Rate Counsel on PSE&G's transmission rate, which, if approved by FERC, will reduce PSE&G's annual transmission revenue requirement and provide a rate reduction for customers. PSE&G's electric sales adjusted for weather increased by nearly 4% over the second quarter of 2020, led by an 11% increase in commercial sales. PSEG's existing solar programs are fully subscribed, and the company is working on developing new programs that can help meet solar goals in the Energy Master Plan. PSEG has closed on its 25% equity stake in the 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project in New Jersey, retired its last coal unit at Bridgeport Harbor in Connecticut, and moved up its net-zero vision to 2030. The company is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build Offshore Wind transmission infrastructure. New Jersey's recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by its nuclear plants extends the $10 per megawatt-hour carbon-free attribute recognition through May 2025, which allows for time to work on a long-term economic solution to keep the merchant nuclear fleet economically viable."
TRI_q4_2021.txt,"Today marks my final earnings call as head of investor relations for Thomson Reuters.
I'm pleased to announce that we're also joined by Gary Bisbee, who will assume the role of head of investor relations for Thomson Reuters on March 1, in advance of my retirement in July.
I couldn't be more pleased to place the baton in the very capable hands of Gary, who many of you already know.
Gary has covered Thomson Reuters on the sell side of Bank of America Securities for the past three years, and I know will do a very terrific job.
After 18 years at Thomson Reuters, including 71 earnings calls and eight investor days, it's time for my next adventure and to spend more time with my wife and family.
I truly enjoyed my time at TR, having worked with four CEOs, three CFOs and hundreds of very talented colleagues over that time.
I also will miss speaking with many of you.
You challenged me, informed me and even entertained me a bit of times, and helped me do this job better.
And for that, I am grateful.
Lastly, I've watched Thomson Reuters evolve to become one of the preeminent business information services companies in the world.
And under Steve and Mike's leadership, I'm confident TR will continue to build on its progress, further strengthening its position for the benefit of our investors, customers and employees.
And now, to the results.
A lot to share today, so to enable us to get to as many questions as possible, we'd appreciate if you would limit yourselves to one question each and one follow-up when we open the phone lines.
We believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business.
For comparability, we will revise our 2021 results and during when we report our first quarter 2022 results in May.
These changes will not have any impact on our consolidated results.
First, we will record intercompany revenues for Reuters News for content-related services that it provides to our legal professionals, corporates and tax and accounting professionals businesses.
Previously, these services have been reported as a transfer of expense from Reuters to these businesses.
So there is no impact on any segment's adjusted EBITDA.
Two, we will transfer $9 million of revenue from the corporates business to our tax and accounting business, where it will be managed and where it fits better.
I'd like to direct you to the investor relations section of our website, where we posted a schedule that reflects our revised full year 2019, 2020 and 2021 results, as well as our revised 2021 quarterly results in the manner we will begin reporting in 2022.
Actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the COVID impact and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies.
You may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
I'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter.
Revenue and sales growth were again strong, exceeded our expectations, and we closed out the year on a solid footing.
This performance has created momentum as we started 2022.
And it has helped build our confidence as we work to achieve our 2022 and 2023 targets.
We are increasingly in a position of strength.
Since March 2020, when COVID began to negatively impact the global economy, professional markets have remained resilient and continued to grow, helped by a significant global shift by our customers to upgrade legal, tax, and risk, fraud, and compliance products.
Customers also continued to exhibit more confidence in their own future prospects.
And our products are proving well suited to enable our customers to effectively serve their clients, targeting investment in products that are driving faster growth and where we have strong positions in growing markets.
This dynamic enabled us to achieve 5% organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, the highest growth rate in over a decade, while also improving our underlying profitability and free cash flow.
Our fourth quarter results reflect an improving performance.
Four of our five business segments again recorded organic revenue growth of 6% or greater and total company organic revenues grew 6%.
We continue to make steady progress with our Change program as we transform to a content-driven technology company.
And we have achieved over $200 million in savings thus far, one-third of our $600 million target.
We also achieved all of our 2021 guidance targets that we increased throughout the year.
Given the momentum in the business and our growing confidence, today, we increased our 2022 and 2023 guidance from what we provided at this time last year.
Now, for the results for the quarter.
Fourth quarter reported and organic revenues were up 6%, attributable to strong results from the Big 3 businesses in Reuters.
And similar to the last quarter, this performance included strong organic growth of more than 20% from our Latin American businesses and nearly 10% growth from our Asia and emerging markets businesses.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 14% to $452 million due to cost related to the Change program, higher performance bonus expense and a discretionary investment of $25 million to better position the business for 2022, which Mike will discuss.
This resulted in a margin of 26.4%.
Excluding Change program, Costs, adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1%.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.54 per share in the prior year period.
The additional $25 million we invested in the quarter lowered adjusted earnings per share by $0.04.
Turning to fourth quarter results by segment.
The Big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, reflecting strength across each of the businesses.
U.S. legal market was very healthy throughout 2021.
And our performance benefited from that dynamic.
Legal's fourth quarter performance was again impressive with organic revenue growth of 6%, the third consecutive quarter of 6% growth.
Full year revenue growth was also 6%, the highest annual growth rate since 2008.
Sales was strong throughout the year, including Q4.
We exited the year in a good position, recording double-digit recurring sales growth in Q4, reflecting customers' willingness to invest in productivity-enhancing product.
For example, Westlaw Edge continued to achieve strong sales growth in the end of the quarter with an annual contract value, or ACV, penetration of 65%, achieving the top end of our guidance with more opportunity in 2022 with a target of 70% to 75% penetration and the expected launch of Edge 2.0.
Second, practical law, as reported in the Legal segment, had a terrific quarter and year, growing mid-teens in both periods.
We forecast another strong performance in 2022 for practical law as we continue to invest in this key legal workflow initiative.
Third, our government business, which is managed within our Legal segment, grew 7% organically in Q4 and 9% for the year and achieved strong sales in Q4, setting it up well for strong growth in 2022.
And fourth, our Legal businesses in Canada and Asia grew double digits in the quarter while Europe grew mid-single digits.
Turning to the corporates business.
Organic revenue growth continued to accelerate and was up 7% from 6% in Q3 and 4% in the first half of the year.
This improvement came from increasing demand for customers for our legal, tax and risk products.
And tax and accounting had a terrific quarter and year with organic revenue growth of 9% for both periods and strong Q4 sales.
Reuters News organic revenues increased 12% in Q4 with growth across all of the business lines, particularly the professional business, which includes digital advertising, custom content and Reuters Events, which continues to recover from the negative impact of COVID-19 in 2020.
And finally, global print organic revenues declined 4%, more than expected due to a continued gradual return to office by our customers and higher third-party print revenues.
So in summary, we're very pleased with our results, and we're very excited about the momentum we're building.
We expect further improvement to our performance this year as we invest to further strengthen our positions across the business segments.
Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly and was just shy of $2 billion due to cost related to the Change program and higher performance bonus expense, resulting in a margin of 31%.
Excluding Change program costs, adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.9%, about 100 basis points higher than 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year was $1.95 compared with $1.85 per share in the prior year.
Now, let me discuss several of the key contributors to our accelerating growth and improving prospects.
During our investor day in March last year, I shared with you that we're investing in seven strategic growth priorities with the Big 3 segments.
These businesses grew 6.5% on a combined basis in 2021 with several growing double-digit and our foundational Westlaw product up 4%.
We continue to believe that our opportunity is about powering the world's most important professionals.
And we're helping forge their future through digital automation, augmentation and collaboration, powered by a combination of unique content, world-class AI and machine learning and best-of-breed workflow software, and these products do precisely that.
Against this frame, we'll continue in investing heavily in these strategic priorities, and we'll continue to shift the proportion of capital investment allocated to these initiatives.
These investments are expected to continue to help accelerate organic growth and enable us to achieve our revenue growth target of 5.5% to 6% in 2023.
M&A is also expected to play an important role in accelerating our organic growth and priorities.
And we have an active pipeline of potential future acquisitions across our core segments.
Additionally, we recently launched our new Thomson Reuters venture fund, which will invest up to $100 million of seed funding to start-up companies to cultivate innovation and expand our M&A pipeline.
Let me finish on the financials for full year by noting that we met or exceeded each of our 2021 guidance metrics, which reflects the resilience of the business and the visibility we have in our businesses and markets.
I would now like to update you on the progress related to our Change program, including highlighting the progress from our product and innovation teams.
You will recall, I presented this slide at our investor day last year.
And it's as relevant today as it was then.
We continue to benefit from fundamental and prevailing tailwinds due to increasing legal, tax and regulatory complexity, which favors business information services markets and providers.
And as we enter the third year of the pandemic, its lasting impact on the market segments we serve is becoming clearer.
Digital transformation has accelerated, driven by virtual working and client demands to engage digitally with the firms and departments that serve them.
It's unlikely to be a passing fad.
Hybrid and virtual working is here to stay, which is increasing customer expectations of digital experiences.
And demand for content-enabled, cloud-based, AI-powered solutions that drive professional efficiency and effectiveness continues to grow.
Hesitation to embrace new technologies in our core -- in our more traditional customer segments is giving way to an appreciation of the benefits to be gained from doing so.
And our goal of becoming a content-driven technology company includes excelling at product innovation and successfully integrating our products to provide customers with a seamless offering while delivering an excellent customer experience.
We believe this approach will further improve customer loyalty and increase retention as we continually enhance our products, adding to organic growth.
Our Change program is targeted at achieving these objectives.
And we're making good progress.
Let me share several examples of that progress.
I won't take you through each of the items on this slide.
Rather, I want to highlight the progress we've made last year in transforming to a more integrated, simple, agile company.
We are reducing complexity in our operations and technology group, which is critical for us to achieve the Change program goals and margin targets.
We've made significant progress, which you can see on this slide, including 37% of our revenue is now on a cloud solution, and we're on track to achieve our target of 90% of our revenue available in the cloud by the end of 2023.
SMB digital sales increased to 29% as a percentage of total sales.
Improving our internal process within order-to-cash has reduced customer-facing incidents, invoice rework and have brought together our product, content and editorial strategies to improve customer delivery and drive efficiencies.
Each of these achievements are critical if we are to simplify and improve the customer experience we provide.
We also reduced our global footprint of office locations from 102 to 46 and our call centers from 99 to 77.
And one additional point here.
Talent is key to completing our initiatives.
And our goal is to build the best team in business information services by developing and attracting top global talent and delivering a differentiated employee experience.
Over the past two years, we have brought in new key talent into our organization within product, engineering, marketing, data and analytics, design, operations and technology, among other key areas, adding talent with different perspectives and approaches, which have complemented the skills and experiences of existing leadership.
I'm very, very pleased with the progress we're making.
A few additional points regarding the Change program.
We made progress toward shifting customers to a more digital, automated experience with the launch of self-serve capabilities and automated tools for support.
Delivery of the customer experience of the future is underway.
And our goal remains to create fast, frictionless, connected, transparent and personalized customer experiences.
Our key areas of focus continue to be: First, a digital-first approach for small customers.
Second, a 360-degree view of the customer.
Third, simplified and standardized commercial terms, billing processes, and customer support.
Fourth, seamless digital product trials and digital purchasing.
And fifth, data-driven and AI-powered sales and marketing.
We expect these changes to redefine our customer experience to match their expectations by the end of 2023, by which time a large portion of customer-facing sales, sales operations and support could be digitized and automated.
The impact of this should be twofold.
First, we believe delighting our customers will translate to improved Net Promoter Score, leading to improved retention and new sales opportunities.
And second, decreasing the cost to serve customers enables us to reallocate funds to pursue new organic growth opportunities, improving our agility to test new product ideas quickly with customers, which we believe would lead to further improvements in the top and bottom lines.
So let me now turn to product innovation.
Last year, we ramped up our focus and our investments in product innovation, and we will continue to do so.
We expect new products and product enhancements will be a key lever to accelerate revenue going forward.
And our product development teams are making good progress.
Entering 2022, the product organization is prioritizing resources where we can build and maintain leadership positions and support fewer products, a shift from our historical approach of making small investments in many products.
The organizational design model enables us to work as a better integrated, more effective team, moving from an organization with data to a data-driven organization.
Our content is a significant competitive advantage and differentiates us against our key competitors.
The new product organizational structure we formed last year positions us to achieve greater success by leveraging that valuable content, enriching it with world-class AI and machine learning and best-of-breed software and delivering it in the cloud.
Investing in an improved user experience across our products is another important priority so that our customers can interact with our content with minimal points of friction.
And we're increasing investments in our people, as well as our technology and product organizations to expand and accelerate innovation and speed to market.
We believe this will enable us to continue to be leaders within our core market segments and allow us to expand into adjacent market opportunities.
And lastly, here are some examples of products and initiatives in which we're investing that are contributing to higher organic growth.
Practical law and indirect tax, two of our strategic seven initiatives, released new and enhanced product modules last year, which were well received by customers.
And we expect they will again contribute to higher organic revenue growth in 2022 and beyond.
We also made good progress last year forming a centralized partnership team, led by our corporates group, which we are seeing good traction having signed partnership agreements with Oracle, SAP, AWS, and Alteryx.
And in 2021, we accelerated the work we're doing to provide our content and workforce solutions to customers via our APIs.
For 2022, we'll accelerate and expand our API ecosystem, where we can improve the experience for both existing and new customers.
We're confident this will open up new channels, new business models and new product offerings and will help grow our partner ecosystem.
And as our capabilities surrounding APIs continue to grow, it will enable us to further integrate our best-in-class content and solutions into our customers' workflows, contributing to our growth.
I am very pleased to report that given the positive trajectory of the business, we're increasing our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow guidance from that which we provided at investor day in March 2021.
We now forecast total company organic revenue growth of approximately 5% for 2022 and 5.5% to 6% for 2023.
Let me remind you that 2021's organic revenue growth of 5% included about 100 basis point benefit from easier year-over-year comps related to COVID-19 items in 2020.
Big 3 organic revenue growth is forecast between 6% and 6.5% in 2022 and 6.5% to 7% in 2023.
We forecast an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35% for 2022 and between 39% and 40% for 2023.
And free cash flow is now forecast at about $1.3 billion for 2022 and between $1.9 billion to $2 billion with free cash flow per share between $3.90 and $4.10 for 2023.
I'm confident we'll achieve these higher targets.
As a reminder, I will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis.
Let me start by discussing the fourth quarter revenue performance of our Big 3 segments.
Revenues were up 7% organically and at constant currency for the quarter.
This marks the sixth consecutive quarter our Big 3 segments have grown at least 5%.
Legal professionals' total revenues increased 5% and organic revenues increased 6% in the fourth quarter.
Recurring organic revenue grew 6% and transaction revenues increased 6%.
Fourth quarter organic revenue growth was driven by practical law, Elite, FindLaw and our government business.
Westlaw Edge added about 100 basis points to Legal's organic growth rate, is maintaining a healthy premium and is expected to continue to contribute at a similar level going forward, supported by the planned release of Edge 2.0 during the second half of this year.
Our government business, which is reported within legal and includes much of our risk and compliance businesses, grew 7% for the quarter and 9% for the year and exited Q4 with strong sales and good momentum entering 2022.
Quarter-to-quarter performance can vary for this business, given the government contracting process, project work, and fiscal year funding from the various agencies.
We believe 2022 will be another year of healthy revenue growth, supported by strong Q4 2021 sales.
In our corporates segment, total and organic revenues increased 7% for the quarter due to recurring organic revenue growth of 7% and transactions organic revenue growth of 4%.
Recurring revenue was driven by clear, practical law, indirect tax and legal software, as well as our businesses in Latin America.
And transactions organic revenue increased 10%.
Moving to Reuters News.
Fourth quarter performance was very strong with total and organic revenue growth of 12%.
Reuters achieved growth across all business lines, including the bounce-back in the Events business as it continues to recover from the negative impact from COVID in 2020.
In global print, total and organic revenues declined 4%, better than expected.
On a consolidated basis, fourth quarter total and organic revenues each increased 6%.
Before turning to profitability, let's look closer at recurring and transaction revenue results for the fourth quarter.
Starting on the left side, total company organic revenue for the fourth quarter 2021 was up 6% compared to 2% in the prior year period, which was impacted by COVID.
Fourth quarter 2021 performance for the Big 3 was strong with organic revenues up 7% compared to 5% in the same period last year.
This was partly driven by strong performance in the corporates segment, which grew 7% organically compared to 3% in Q4 2020.
Total company recurring organic revenues grew 6% in Q4, 110 basis points above Q4 2020 with Big 3 recurring organic revenues up 7%, above last year's fourth quarter growth of 6%.
Turning to the graph on the bottom right of this slide.
Transaction revenues in Q4 were up 16% compared to the prior year period, when COVID affected our implementation services and the Reuters Events business.
We continue to remain encouraged by our momentum in 2021, especially for recurring revenues.
This gives us confidence in the trajectory of the business and our ability to achieve our 2022 growth targets.
Turning to our profitability performance in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Big 3 segments was $488 million, down 2% from the prior year period, driven by higher performance bonus expense.
Fourth quarter costs also included a discretionary investment of $25 million related to go-to-market initiatives, product development initiatives and data and analytics tools to support the customer experience to better position us for 2022.
I will remind you the Change program operating costs are recorded at the corporate level.
Moving to Reuters News.
Adjusted EBITDA was $15 million, $9 million more than the prior year period, driven by revenue growth.
Global print's adjusted EBITDA was flat at $61 million with a margin of 35.9%, 130 basis points higher than Q4 2020.
So in aggregate, total company adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $452 million, a 14% decrease versus Q4 2020.
Excluding costs related to the Change program, adjusted EBITDA increased 1%.
Fourth quarter's adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4% and was 31.1% on an underlying basis, excluding costs related to the Change program.
For the full year, total company adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%.
Excluding costs related to the Change program, full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.9%.
Now, let me turn to our earnings per share and free cash flow performance.
Starting with earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.43 per share versus $0.54 per share in the prior year period.
Of note, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was reduced by approximately $0.04 due to the additional $25 million investment in Q4.
Let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the full year 2021.
This performance reflects the momentum of our businesses as we transition into 2022 and continue to execute on the Change program initiatives.
Reported free cash flow was $1.3 billion, $74 million lower than in 2020.
Consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting free cash flow performance.
Working from the bottom of the slide upwards, the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $51 million more than the prior year.
tax authority related to our former Refinitiv business.
For the full year, we made $166 million of Change program payments as compared to Refinitiv-related separation cost of $95 million in the prior year.
So if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was just shy of $1.5 billion, $189 million better than the prior year.
This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA and dividends from our interest in LSEG.
We'll now provide an update on our Change program progress.
In the fourth quarter, we achieved $85 million of annual run rate operating expense savings.
This brings the cumulative annual run rate operating expense savings to $217 million for the Change; program, which exceeds our target of $200 million.
This puts us more than a third of the way toward achieving our goal of $600 million of gross savings by 2023.
As a reminder, we anticipate reinvesting $200 million of the projected $600 million savings back into the business for a net savings of $400 million.
Now, an update on our Change program costs for the fourth quarter and full year 2021.
Spend during the fourth quarter was $125 million, comprised of $78 million of opex and $47 million of capex.
For the full year, Change program opex and capex spend totaled $295 million, at the lower end of the range of $290 million to $320 million we have forecast last year.
Spend is forecast to step up in 2022 related to cloud migration, streamlining internal systems and product engineering.
We are still expecting to incur approximately $600 million over the course of the program.
And there is no change in the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex.
I'll now provide an update on our capital structure at year-end.
As you can see, our capital structure and liquidity position remained strong as we exited 2021.
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow last year.
We had $0.8 billion of cash on hand at December 31.
We have an undrawn $1.8 billion revolving credit facility.
And we also have a $1.8 billion commercial paper program.
From a liquidity and capital structure standpoint, we entered 2022 in a very strong position.
And we would like to put that capital to work to further accelerate our growth.
We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions within our core markets and have the ability and desire to move quickly if an opportunity presents itself this year.
We received notices from the U.K. tax authorities requiring us to pay about $80 million in March related to an ongoing tax matter.
While we believe we will prevail on these issues and be refunded substantially all the payments, including those made last year, we are required to pay the amount upfront while contesting them.
Any payment would not reflect our view of the merits of the case as we believe our position is supported by the weight of law.
Regarding our investment in the London Stock Exchange Group.
The pre-tax value of our 72.4 million shares is currently $7 billion, or an estimated $14 per share in TR stock price.
In March 2021, we sold 10.1 million shares to pay taxes related to the transaction.
We expect to receive dividends from LSEG of more than $75 million in 2022 based on LSEG's current annual dividend payout.
I will remind you, dividends from the investment are part of our free cash flow.
We remain subject to a lockup for our LSEG shares until January 30, 2023.
At which time, we can sell approximately one-third of the shares.
The remaining two tranches can be sold in January 2024 and 2025.
We view our equity interest in LSEG as a store value, which we expect to continue to monetize over time, which provides us with a significant level of financial flexibility related to the use of proceeds.
And finally, today, we announced a 10% annualized dividend increase, the largest percentage increase since 2008, taking our annual dividend to $1.78 per share, up $0.16 per share from $1.62.
This also marks the 29th consecutive year of annual dividend increases for the company.
The increase will be effective with our Q1 dividend payable next month.
These annual dividend increases speak to the solidity of our business and consistent and growing free cash flow generation.
We'll now turn to our outlook for 2022 and 2023.
As Steve mentioned, we are increasing our guidance for both years since we expect to continue the positive trajectory for all key metrics.
Organic revenue is expected to continue its upward trajectory as we work to become a consistent and sustainable mid-single-digit grower.
We forecast organic revenue growth of about 5% in 2022 and 5.5% to 6% in 2023.
Key drivers include continued investment in our seven strategic priorities and delivering on our digital and sales effectiveness work streams and the Change program.
We forecast the Big 3 organic revenues to grow between 6% and 6.5% in 2022 and between 6.5% and 7% in 2023.
We also believe our legal business can grow 5% to 7% over the cycle versus the 5% to 6% we mentioned at investor day last year with continued margin expansion.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow.
Our guidance in 2022 reflects the dilutive impact of the Change program investments.
We forecast adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 will increase to about 35% with an underlying margin of over 37%, putting us on a path to achieve our 2023 margin target of 39% to 40%.
Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and includes Change program spend of over $300 million.
Free cash flow is expected to increase to between $1.9 billion and $2 billion in 2023, driven by higher revenue growth and savings and efficiencies from the Change program.
Let me conclude with our updated and detailed guidance for 2022 and 2023.
This slide includes the guidance we provided in February 2021, enabling you to compare the changes and raised guidance.
I will also note, we expect our first quarter revenue growth rate and adjusted EBITDA margin to be comparable to our full year 2022 guidance targets.
Now, the guidance metrics on the slide are self-explanatory.
But I would like to address the outlook for our effective or book tax rate and our cash tax rate for 2022 and 2023 based on current tax law.
In 2021, our effective or book tax rate was 14% and included a 200-basis-point benefit from the reversal of reserves for prior tax year.
This benefit will not reoccur in 2022.
We also forecast in 2022 minimum taxes this year, which bumps the expected ETR up to between 19% and 21%.
Looking to 2023, we expect our ETR to decline to the upper-teens.
And as a rule of thumb, our cash tax rate is forecast to be approximately 5% below our book or effective tax rate.
This is fully reflected in our 2023 free cash flow guidance of $1.9 billion to $2 billion.
To conclude, our confidence in achieving our 2022 and 2023 guidance has only increased from one year ago.
We continue to believe we can achieve faster revenue growth, higher profitability, lower capital intensity, and significantly higher free cash flow as we benefit from transitioning to a content-enabled technology company.
I will conclude by saying that we're very pleased with our 2021 performance, but we still have much more work ahead.
Our confidence is strengthened by our 2021 organic revenue, and we have good momentum entering 2022.
The Change program is progressing well.
And we're confident in achieving our $600 million savings target and our $100 million incremental revenue target.
We have numerous levers to pull that should help us accelerate our growth.
And we're building a strong leadership team with new talent that's brought different perspectives, which complemented the skills of existing leadership and has energized our teams.
And lastly, to elevate our ambition, we kicked off the year with confidence by announcing our new company purpose, which is to inform the way forward.
This unites our commercial strengths, the critical role we play in society.
Customers and employees have responded very positively to this, redoubled commitment to serve professionals, advance critical institutions and to build trust through our products and with our actions.
","Thomson Reuters reported a 6% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, maintaining its strong organic revenue growth at 5% for 2021. Despite a 14% decline in adjusted EBITDA, the company exceeded its guidance targets due to cost savings from its Change program and other initiatives. The Big 3 businesses (Legal, Corporates, and Reuters News) drove organic revenue growth, with Legal outperforming at 6% and Reuters News continuing its recovery with 12% growth. Corporates' organic revenue also grew by 7%, reflecting increasing demand for its legal, tax, and risk products. The Change program achieved over $200 million in savings, surpassing its initial target of $600 million. The company remains confident in its transformation to a content-driven technology company and expects to achieve its 2023 revenue growth target of 5.5% to 6%. It anticipates further growth in 2022 and 2023, supported by strategic investments and acquisitions. The company also announced a 10% increase in its annual dividend, reflecting its strong free cash flow generation."
SMP_q3_2020.txt,"Here is the agenda for today, Eric will begin by reviewing the highlights of the quarter, then Jim will give a brief review of operations.
Nathan will go into a more detailed review of the numbers, and then I will have a short wrap up before we open it to questions.
As part of an essential industry, we had to jump through many hoops to stay operational so that people could come to work safely and I'm just so appreciative of everyone whose dedication, intelligence and skills lead us through this unprecedented experience.
These folks are the true heroes.
Okay, so on to business.
As mentioned on our last call, we came out of the second quarter experiencing strong demand and I'm pleased to say that the trend continued throughout the third quarter.
Let me discuss each of the divisions separately, starting with Engine Management.
Engine Management sales were up 6.7% for the quarter, clawing back about a third of our sales shortfall in the first half.
Consumer demand has been robust, which we believe reflects the deferred maintenance from the early days of the pandemic when costs were idled in driveways, but we're also experiencing a general surge in the aftermarket, the result of people staying at home and working on their vehicles.
And we believe this has especially impacted the DIY segment.
Good evidence of this is a strong performance of our wire and cable business.
It fits older vehicles and is relatively easy to install which are two hallmarks of DIY business, and while this line has recently been trending down 7% or so per year due to varied [Indecipherable] in lifecycle, it spiked up 10% in the quarter, which we have to assume is a temporary phenomenon.
Customer orders for all of Engine Management have been consistently solid and this has continued into October.
That said, our forecast remains low single-digit growth over the long term.
Our Temperature Control Division was up 25% in the quarter driven by two dynamics.
The first was related to timing.
If you recall, pre-season orders from our last, from our customers were very light this year.
In fact, our first half was down almost 20%.
And then it got hard out creating a surge in demand across the country.
These two factors combined for a very strong quarter, though year-to-date we are slightly behind last year.
This is why we always suggest looking at Temperature Control on a full year basis.
There are often quarterly anomalies but they typically balance themselves out.
We are pleased to report that the quarter set an all-time record for SMP.
Jim and Nathan will provide some detail on the drivers, so I just want to take a moment to speak to COVID-related savings.
As we have mentioned in the past, we put in place short-term cost reduction measures ratcheting back various discretionary expenses as well as cutting Executive and Board compensation.
We do plan to assess what we've learned and identify areas where we believe the savings can be sustained, however, we do recognize that many of these reductions will in fact be temporary.
We had also taken steps to conserve cash including suspensions of both our quarterly dividends and our share repurchase plan and we are pleased to reinstate both of these programs as they are core aspects of how we return value to our shareholders.
So in summary, needless to say, it's been a roller coaster of a year.
After a mediocre first quarter and a truly difficult second quarter, we were able to make up much of the lost grounds with a very strong third quarter.
We always experienced a certain amount of volatility period to period, and while this year, it has been substantially more exaggerated, it does show that our business tends to balance over time, and we do expect that to continue going forward.
Before I hand this off, I would just like to make a few comments about the future.
First, we were delighted, but not surprised to see our industry once again show its resilience.
The basic fundamentals are solid and there are many favorable trends taking us forward.
And while the crisis is certainly not over, we are confident that we are smarter now than we were before, our team were stronger as a result of managing our way through it and we are well equipped to tackle whatever is thrown at us.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim who will talk about our operations.
I will provide an overview of our business from an operational perspective.
I plan to touch on the basics from supply chain manufacturing through distribution.
As we have all experienced, the past six months to seven months has been challenging and demanding.
Our baseline was a 40% decrease in volume in April.
This was followed by a relatively quick rebound in customer POS numbers in May and June that turned into increased orders to us in June and July.
This momentum increased as we progressed through Q3 and remained steady.
From a supply chain view, this meant working feverishly with our vendors to be able to meet our materials demand.
Overall, with a few exceptions, our vendors and supply team have been able to keep supply flowing to our factories.
Turning to our manufacturing base, we face surging demand with a significant mix shift toward older technology SKUs, driven by our customer sales in the DIY channel.
Early in the third quarter, we were hampered with a shortage of available labor, a combination of higher demand and the COVID impact with high risk employees out and disruptions from contact tracing.
I'm happy to report that we have been able to secure additional manpower along with the return of our high-risk employees.
What is the result of the surge in demand?
Production levels are significantly up in all our manufacturing facilities, generating favorable overhead absorption, which can be seen in our very strong Q3 gross margins.
Engine Management was 31.5% and Temperature Control was 29.2%.
These higher margins were generated from the surge in production volume, which we expect to level off.
While this favorable momentum should carry into Q4, we expect sales and production to return to normal in 2021.
Our longer-term gross margin targets would be Engine Management, 30% plus and Temperature Control 26% plus.
We are fortunate to have a substantial manufacturing footprint in North America, including three low cost operations in Mexico, reducing our China exposure.
I will also note on occasion, we have transferred production back to the U.S., the benefit of automating previous manual assembly processes.
Quickly looking around the globe, our Poland operations, which is our coil manufacturing center of excellence, along with other switches and sensors has steadily grown in size and value.
Over the past year, we have approved the added capacity for Poland to meet our increasing ignition coil demand.
Our three China joint ventures, all in the Temperature Control product categories recovered very early from the pandemic at the start of the year.
All three JVs provide us a steady source of supply, whereby we can control costs, quality and lead times.
Finally, our North American distribution centers are our last touch point with our products.
Our Q3 surge in demand present the challenges for our DC shipping performance.
Similar to our manufacturing operations, we experienced the shortage of available labor to meet demand.
The impact from this was slower turnaround time in our DCs to ship orders.
During this period, our DCs were working six and seven days per week to keep up.
Tremendous efforts were put forward by our DC employees to satisfy our customer needs.
We have made great strides securing additional head count and I'm happy to report that we are covering [Phonetic] again and meeting our shipping turnaround goals.
In summary, we are very fortunate to be a resilient industry that bounced back so quickly.
Unfortunately, this is not the same for many other industries that have suffered dearly.
I commend our frontline heroes that were on the job, six and seven days per week to satisfy the customer.
Customer satisfaction is ingrained in our SMP culture and we just do it.
Looking now at the results in the P&L, our consolidated net sales in Q3 2020 were $343.6 million, up $35.9 million or 11.7% versus Q3 last year.
Our net sales for the first nine months of the year were $845.9 million, down $50.8 million or 5.7%.
By segment, our Engine Management net sales in Q3 excluding wire and cable sales were $190.9 million, up $10.1 million or 5.6%.
But for the first nine months of the year were down $40.5 million or 5.7%, finishing at $498.2 million.
The increase in sales during the quarter we believe was due to pent-up demand from earlier in the year and strong customer POS.
But looking in total at the first nine months, the quarter increase only partially offset the declines we saw earlier in the year related to the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic.
Wire and cable net sales in Q3 were $38.7 million, up $3.5 million or 10% and for the first nine months were $105.6 million down $2.9 million or 2.6%.
While the wire and cable business continues to be in secular decline and we still believe it will decline 6% to 8% on an annual basis, sales this year have been positively impacted by an increase in DIY sales as consumer stayed at home during the pandemic.
Our Temperature Control net sales in Q3 2020 were $110.4 million, up $22.1 million or 25%.
However, for the first nine months, sales were down $7.4 million or 3.1% versus last year, ending at $234.2 million.
As Eric noted, Temp Control net sales in the quarter were driven by a very hot summer across most of the U.S. aided by very light pre-season ordering earlier in the year.
Net sales on a year-to-date basis in this segment are more in step with last year, down slightly from the first nine months of 2019.
Our consolidated gross margin in Q3 2020 was 31.4% versus 29.9% last year, up 1.5 points, for the first [Technical Issues] 28.7% [Phonetic] [Indecipherable] versus 28.9% last year, down 0.2 points.
Looking at the segments, Engine Management gross margin in the third quarter was 31.5%, up 0.8 points from Q3 last year, while for the first nine months of 2020, it was down 0.3 points to 29%.
Temperature Control gross margin in Q3 2020 was 29.2% up 3.2 points from 26% last year and for the first nine months, it was up 0.5 points to 26%.
Margins for the quarter reflect the strong sales volumes we experienced in both segments and the positive impact of high fixed cost absorption, resulting from the compression of production into just a few short months as Jim alluded to earlier.
On a year-to-date basis, gross margin in both segments, more closely aligned with long-term trends as Engine Management margins are really flat with last year and Temp Control margins ended just slightly ahead of the prior year.
Consolidated SG&A expenses in Q3 were $59.5 million, down $0.4 million in Q3 '19 and came in at 17.3% of sales versus 19.5% last year.
For the first nine months, SG&A spending was $163.7 million, down $16.8 million at 19.4% of net sales versus 20.1% last year.
While our SG&A expenses in the quarter were roughly flat with last year, the improvement as a percentage of sales is reflective of the higher sales volumes we experienced this year.
Lower SG&A expenses in the first nine months were helped by cost reduction plans put in place as a response to the impact of the pandemic and overall better leverage of expenses as a percentage of sales.
Our consolidated operating income before restructuring and integration expenses and other income net in Q3 of '20 was $48.3 million or 14% of net sales, up 3.6 points from Q3 '19 and for the first nine months was 9.3% of net sales, up 0.5 points from last year.
As we note on our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of operating income, our performance resulted in third quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share of $1.59 versus $1.02 last year and for the first nine months, diluted earnings per share of $2.53 versus $2.51 in 2019.
The increase in our operating profit for the quarter was mainly due to higher sales volumes, while the increase for the first nine months, primarily reflects lower SG&A expenses across the Company which slightly more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes.
Turning now to the balance sheet, accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $238 million up $102.5 million from December 2019 and up $69 million from September 2019.
The increase over year-end reflects seasonal patterns in our business while the increase over last year reflects the strong sales we experienced in the third quarter as well as the timing of this in the quarter as compared to last year.
Inventory levels finished the quarter at $311.4 million, down $56.8 million from December 2019 and down $28.8 million from September 2019.
The decrease from both year-end and September last year mainly reflects the sharp recovery in sales we experienced in the third quarter, after having lower production levels earlier in the year in response to general expectations of slowdown in sales.
Looking at the cash flow statement, it reflects [Phonetic] the cash generated from operations in the first nine months of 2020 of $78.6 million as compared to a generation of $43.1 million last year.
The increased cash generation during the first nine months of this year was driven mainly by timing, both of movements in inventory and accrued customer returns and offset by an increase in accounts receivables stemming from strong sales during the quarter.
We expect this timing around cash flows to normalize as sales and production levels stabilize.
During the first nine months, we continue to invest in our business and use $13.2 million of cash for capital expenditures, which was higher than the $12.3 million used in the first nine months of 2019.
Financing activities included $5.6 million of dividends paid and $8.7 million of repurchases of our common stock, both of which occurred during the first quarter.
Financing activities also included $44.9 million of payments on a revolving credit facility.
We finished the third quarter with total outstanding borrowings of $12 million and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $238 million.
Larry, you're on mute.
As you saw in the release, come January 1st, I'm going to be moving from Executive Chairman to Chairman of the Board and this reflects the fact that I'll be stepping back a bit from day to day activities, but I'll still remain closely connected to the Company as Chairman of the Board.
I believe this is an appropriate and a proper move after 53 glorious years, where I had the privilege of being part of the Company's growth from roughly $20 million in our core business when I began to well over a $1 billion today.
And we still have many plans for future growth.
I'm confident it's going to be a very seamless transition as all our major moves have been.
We have in place, what I believe is the strongest and deepest management team I can remember who proved themselves on how well we performed during this very difficult year.
So I am very confident about the future.
","After a slow first half of the year, Standard Motor Products experienced a strong rebound in the third quarter, with overall sales increasing by 11.7% to $343.6 million. Engine Management sales rose by 5.6%, driven by strong consumer demand, while Temperature Control sales surged by 25% due to increased summer demand and delayed pre-season orders. The company also saw a temporary surge in its wire and cable business, which benefited from increased DIY sales. Gross margins improved due to higher sales volumes and favorable overhead absorption, reaching 31.4% overall. Despite cost-saving measures implemented during the pandemic, SG&A expenses remained flat with the prior year, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.59 for the quarter. The company has reinstated its quarterly dividend and expects to continue generating strong cash flow in the future."
WCN_q2_2021.txt,"Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Q2 increased 17.5% and 23%, respectively, over the prior year period, primarily as a result of continued improvement in solid waste pricing volume growth and strength in recovered commodity values.
These trends drove year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points and adjusted free cash flow of over $585 million, up 18.5% year-over-year, and given expected continuing momentum and margin expansion from these trends position us to raise our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted free cash flow.
2021 also has the potential to be another outsized year of acquisition activity.
Year-to-date, we have signed or closed 14 acquisitions with total annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, including $75 million of franchise operations in California, Nevada and Oregon expected to close later this year.
We continue to see record amounts of seller interest driving elevated acquisition dialogue, and as communicated throughout the year, expect closings related to most of this activity to be more weighted to the second half of the year, which will provide further upside to our increased outlook for the year and strong rollover growth into 2022.
On the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections on both a dollar basis and per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.
Management uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations.
Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently.
In the second quarter, solid waste price plus volume growth of 11.4% exceeded our expectations by almost 150 basis points, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected volumes as the recovery trends that began in Q1 continued throughout the quarter, with landfill tons and roll-off pulls returning to levels about in line with or above prepandemic levels.
Total price of 4.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, was above our outlook on higher core pricing of 4.7%, once again reflecting the strength of pricing retention we noted in Q1, plus about 20 basis points in fuel and material surcharges.
Our Q2 pricing ranged from 2.6% in our mostly exclusive Western region to a range of about 4.5% to 7% in our more competitive regions.
Looking ahead, we are positioned for higher sequential pricing growth during the second half of the year as a result of incremental price increases we have already put in place to offset certain cost pressures.
Reported volume growth of 6.5% in Q2 reflected sequential improvement of approximately 1,000 basis points from Q1 and was led by those regions where markets were hardest hit during the pandemic including the Northeast U.S. and Canada.
All regions showed sequential improvement from Q1 and all reported positive volumes in Q2.
Volumes range from about 4% in our Central region, where comparisons to the prior year were tougher as many markets were relatively less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, to almost 10.5% in Canada, one of our most impacted regions where the volume recovery have been remarkably strong, arguably outpacing the reopening activity particularly when considering that many restrictions in Canada extended through Q2 of this year.
Also noteworthy is our Western region, where volumes led our other regions going into the pandemic and continue to be the strongest in the U.S. at about 8.5% in Q2.
Looking at year-over-year results in the second quarter on a same-store basis, all lines of business increased by double digits Commercial collection revenue was up 16% year-over-year.
Roll-off pulls increased by over 11% year-over-year, led by Canada, up almost 20% and back to above pre-COVID-19 levels.
In the U.S., pulls were up about 10%, and all regions showed year-over-year improvement, most notably in our more impacted markets, including in the Northeast.
Landfill tons were up 17% year-over-year on MSW tons up 11%, C&D tons up 20% and special waste tons up 33%.
As a result, landfill tons have returned to above pre-pandemic levels in all of our regions, except the Eastern region, which was slightly below prior levels as a result of the delayed reopening activity in markets in the Northeast.
Looking more closely at results.
As noted, all waste types were up double-digit percentages year-over-year.
However, the outsized amount of special waste activity was particularly noteworthy as Q2 activity propelled tons back to 13% above pre-pandemic levels with all regions up year-over-year, perhaps due to a little pull forward from Q3.
Looking at Q2 revenues from recovery commodities, that is recycled commodities, landfill gas and renewable energy credits, or RINs.
Excluding acquisitions, collectively, they were up about 95% year-over-year resulting in a combined margin tailwind of about 130 basis points, 90 basis points of which was from recycling and 40 basis points from landfill gas and RINs.
Recycling revenue increases were driven by both higher commodity values, including old corrugated containers or OCC, up 25%; and plastics and metals, both up over 100%.
Higher volumes also contributed year-over-year, again, reflecting the pandemic impact.
Prices for OCC averaged about $135 per ton in Q2 and our RIN pricing averaged about $2.72.
And finally, on to E&P waste activity.
We reported $31.2 million of E&P waste revenue in the second quarter, up 26% sequentially from Q1, reflecting increased activity across multiple basins.
Looking at acquisition activity.
As noted earlier, we've already signed or closed 14 acquisitions with annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, approaching what we would consider an average amount of activity for the full year.
These transactions include multiple West Coast franchise markets, which are core to our strategy and provide unique opportunities to expand our exclusive contract portfolio.
Moreover, our pipeline still reflects record levels of seller interest driving the potential for outsized activity in 2021, primarily given tax-related considerations.
That said, we continue to be selective and disciplined in our approach to acquisitions as we recognize the importance of value creation for our shareholders as well as market selection and asset positioning.
Now I'd like to pass the call to Mary Anne to review more in depth the financial highlights of the second quarter and our increased outlook for the year and to provide a detailed outlook for Q3.
I will then wrap up before heading into Q&A.
In the second quarter, revenue was $1.534 billion, about $44 million above our outlook due primarily to higher-than-expected solid waste growth and recovered commodity values.
Revenue on a reported basis was up $228 million or 17.5% year-over-year, including acquisitions completed since the year ago period which contributed about $47.6 million of revenue in the quarter or about $44.1 million net of divestitures.
Commodity-driven impacts account for about 100 basis points of margin expansion, net of a 30 basis point impact from higher fuel on diesel rates up almost 20% year-over-year.
Ex fuel solid waste collection transfer and disposal margins expanded by 50 basis points as we more than offset a 60 basis points increase in incentive compensation costs, 50 basis points from higher medical and 50 basis points from increased discretionary expenses.
And finally, acquisitions completed since the year ago period accounted for about 10 basis points of margin dilution.
Regarding discretionary expenses, we've begun the process of returning to a more normalized operating environment, including in-person training, meetings and other activities we consider integral to sustaining our culture and expanding our bench strength ahead of future growth.
Given the challenging labor environment, we have also proactively implemented supplemental wage adjustments in many markets as we anticipate or combat labor constraints.
These purposeful wage and discretionary cost additions, along with higher incentives, medical and other costs resulting from more typical activity levels, largely replaced last year's COVID-19-related frontline support costs, the majority of which did not repeat this year.
As noted earlier, we've already implemented incremental price increases to address these higher costs, resulting in full year 2021 price of approximately 5%, up from 4% in our original outlook.
We delivered adjusted free cash flow up 18.5% year-over-year through Q2 at $585 million or 20% of revenue, putting us on track to achieve our revised adjusted free cash flow outlook of approximately $1 billion.
I will now review our outlook for the third quarter 2021 and our updated outlook for the full year.
Before I do, we'd like to remind everyone once again that actual results may vary significantly based on risks and uncertainties outlined in our safe harbor statement and filings we've made with the SEC and the Securities Commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada.
We encourage investors to review these factors carefully.
Our outlook assumes no significant change in underlying economic trends, including as a result of or related to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic or the delta variant of the coronavirus.
It also excludes any impact from additional acquisitions that may close during the remainder of the year and expensing of transaction-related items during the period.
Looking first at Q3.
Revenue in Q3 is estimated to be approximately $1.56 billion.
We expect solid waste price plus volume growth of about 7% in Q3 with pricing of about 5%.
Recovered commodity values and E&P waste revenue are expected to remain in line with current levels, with RINs generally in line with Q2 levels and OCC trending slightly higher.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 is estimated to be approximately $495 million or 31.7% of revenue, up 60 basis points year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter is estimated to be about 13.3% of revenue, including amortization of intangibles of about $33.8 million or a rounded $0.10 per diluted share net of taxes.
Interest expense, net of interest income, is estimated at approximately $40 million.
And finally, our effective tax rate in Q3 is estimated to be about 21.5%, subject to some variability.
Revenue for 2021 is now estimated to be approximately $5.975 billion or $175 million above our initial outlook, with the primary drivers being an additional 150 basis points of solid waste price plus volume growth and higher recovered commodity values as compared to our initial outlook, plus $25 million from acquisitions completed year-to-date.
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is now estimated to be approximately $1.875 billion or about 31.4% of revenue and up about $75 million over our initial outlook.
Moreover, full year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is 40 basis points above our initial outlook, up 90 basis points year-over-year.
At 31.4%, our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook reflects continued year-over-year margin expansion in the second half of 2021 in spite of wage and inflationary pressures and tougher year-over-year comparisons.
Adjusted free cash flow in 2021 is now expected to be approximately $1 billion or over 53% of EBITDA and up $15 million from our initial outlook despite capex up $50 million from our original outlook.
Last week, we closed our new $2.5 billion credit facility, which increased borrowing capacity by almost $300 million, reduced borrowing spreads and enhanced flexibility for continued growth.
Our balance sheet strength, together with this increased capacity, positions us for potential above-average acquisition activity and an increasing return of capital to shareholders.
We have already returned over $400 million to shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases and dividends.
And we are in the process of renewing our normal course issuer bid, authorizing the repurchase of up to 5% of our outstanding shares per annum.
We will continue to approach share repurchases opportunistically and anticipate announcing another double-digit percentage per share increase in our cash dividend in October.
Again, broad-based strength continues to drive results ahead of expectations as we benefit from reopening activity in a supportive macro environment, including tailwinds from recovered commodity values.
We've once again demonstrated the importance of being selective about markets and intentional about driving results.
Quality of revenue and comparative price retention across markets matter.
We're extremely pleased to be in a position to raise our outlook for the full year.
We are set up for continuing margin expansion through the second half of 2021 as proactive unbudgeted price increases offset wage and inflationary pressures.
We are on track for adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins back above pre-COVID-19 levels.
Finally, we expect to announce another double-digit percentage increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend in October and remain well positioned for potential significant increase in acquisition outlays to drive further growth in 2021 and beyond.
We appreciate your time today.
","Waste Connections reported strong Q2 results, driven by solid waste price plus volume growth (11.4%), which exceeded expectations. Revenue increased 17.5% YoY to $1.534 billion. The adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded by 110 basis points, leading to an adjusted free cash flow up 18.5% to $585 million. The company expects continued momentum and margin expansion in the second half of the year, leading to an increased outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2021. Waste Connections remains optimistic about acquisition activity, with 14 acquisitions signed or closed year-to-date, highlighting the potential for significant growth in 2021."
BDX_q3_2021.txt,"We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures regarding our performance.
Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period.
When we refer to the base revenues, were referring to our total revenues less our COVID diagnostic testing revenues, which include COVID-related revenues from Veritor, BD MAX and swabs.
When we refer to base margins, we are adjusting for estimated COVID diagnostic testing profitability and the related profit we have reinvested back into our business.
When we refer to any given period referring to fiscal period, it must be noted as a calendar period.
Finally, when we refer to NewCo during todays call, were referring to the planned spinout of our Diabetes Care business into an independently public traded company following the effective trade date of the spin, which was announced on the second quarter earnings call.
RemainCo refers to BD post separation.
As a reminder, this transaction is subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by BDs Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC.
On todays call, I will provide highlights of the quarter and discuss the continued strong progress we have made on our BD 2025 strategy.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, the leadership team and the company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service to BD.
Im confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless, and his leadership and experience will make him an excellent director for NewCos Board.
Now lets jump into our results.
We were very pleased with our third quarter performance, powered by strong growth and momentum in our base business across all three segments.
Revenues totaled $4.9 billion, and our adjusted earnings per share was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations.
Total revenues were up 26.9% on a reported basis and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis.
Results included COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth.
Excluding COVID testing revenues, our base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units.
The strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective procedures and its impact on medical device utilization in the year ago quarter.
But Q3s result also reflects the continued momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025 strategy.
Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 fiscal 21 increased 3.9% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the impact of the Alaris ship hold.
If you exclude the U.S. infusion systems business, our total revenues would have increased 6.6% relative to our prepandemic third quarter fiscal 2019.
Our Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology and Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers, where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively, over 2019 levels.
Bioscience revenues were up 9%.
Surgery and Peripheral Intervention revenues are both up 8%.
Elsewhere, we see opportunities for improvement ahead in fiscal 22 and beyond.
For example, our MDS revenues are up about 2% versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-based purchasing.
As hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here.
Also, as I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues are impacted by the Alaris ship hold, and we expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.
While Im pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, Im equally pleased with the process were making in improving our working capital and cash flows.
Cash flow performance has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics.
Year-to-date, cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior year period.
This improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance our more balanced capital allocation strategy this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately $242.
This marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017 and the largest amount we have repurchased since 2012.
Even with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4 times.
Overall, Im really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive momentum in our base business.
This gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption.
We now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis.
This is higher than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth.
We continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated.
We now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%.
Our positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 while continuing to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess and obsolete COVID testing inventory.
We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share range to be $12.85 to $12.95.
Chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call.
Next, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my number one priority.
Last week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts.
Working with the FDA, we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to version 12.1.
2 following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version.
This new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020, recall notice and provide programming, operational and cybersecurity updates to affected devices.
However, the software update has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.
To address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA.
As Chris will later discuss, we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY 22 outlook.
We believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance time lines.
Next, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify and empower.
First, Id like to focus on our growth pillar.
We continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable core business while purposely investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead.
Ive spoken about these three innovation and growth focuses before.
And weve been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%.
Through this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time.
And this year, weve launched several innovative products and solutions across the continuum of care, across our business units and across the globe.
And after completing our strategic portfolio review last month, I can share with you that our pipeline is very deep and wide across our businesses.
Its been further enhanced by our acquisitions over the past 18 months.
And youll hear much more about our innovation pipeline at our Investor Day on November 12.
But let me highlight a few of our organic innovations that were advancing in the near term.
In our Life Sciences business, Im pleased that we will start shipping our BD MAX and BD Veritor combination flu COVID assays this month, in time for the upcoming respiratory season.
Our BD Veritor combination test can detect and distinguish between COVID, flu A and flu B in a single rapid test with a digital readout.
We see the combination test becoming the standard of care moving forward, advancing our strategy to enable better outcomes in nonacute settings.
Another innovation area Id like to highlight is our Biosciences business.
Biosciences has been a strong performer this year, and we expect the unit to deliver high single-digit growth for the full year.
In June, we launched our new e-commerce site, bdbiosciences.com, which is an entirely new and innovative digital marketplace designed to provide a best-in-class online purchasing experience for our flow cytometry customers.
Early feedback has been outstanding, and were already seeing excellent traction and early adoption.
We also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer, with the launch of our FACSymphony A5 SE, which is our first BD spectral analyzer, and provides an even higher cellular parameter analysis.
Weve launched our FACSymphony A1 as well, which offers high-end technology and a cost-effective bench top design.
In addition to these launches, we have a healthy innovation pipeline of modular, scalable new instruments and next-generation dyes that will allow our customers to fully leverage our complete and integrated solution suite of instruments, reagents, informatics, single-cell multiomics and scientific support services.
Our products and solutions are being used to uncover new insights on the immune system and develop treatments for many related chronic diseases.
You can hear more about our Life Sciences strategy from Dave Hickey, our Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences; and Puneet Sarin, our Worldwide President of BD Biosciences, at the upcoming UBS Genomics 2.0 and MedTech Innovation Summit on Wednesday, August 11.
Next, lets turn to our inorganic innovations that weve added to our portfolio.
As you know, we continue to be focused on tuck-in M&A as a means of adding innovative products and solutions that leverage our core market leadership positions and advance us into higher-growth adjacencies.
Year-to-date, weve completed seven tuck-in acquisitions.
While at the same -- at the time of the acquisitions, these individual deals were not meaningful from a revenue perspective.
As we integrate these transactions into our portfolio, we expect them to strengthen our growth profile.
Our three most recent transactions, Velano Vascular, Tepha, Inc. and ZebraSci are good examples of our M&A strategy.
Let me begin with Velano Vascular, which is being added to our MDS business.
Velano has an innovative needle-free technology that enables high-quality blood draws from existing peripheral IV catheter lines, eliminating the need for multiple needle sticks.
This technology will help customers transform the patient experience through the vision of a 1-stick hospital stay.
Velanos PIVO device will be integrated into our sales teams bag of broader catheter solutions initially in the U.S.
This is a great example of how were expanding and strengthening our base business.
The second transaction is Tepha, Inc., a leading manufacturer of a proprietary resorbable biopolymer technology.
Over the past several years, through our long-standing relationship, weve been commercializing this platform via our Phasix resorbable hernia mesh platform.
The acquisition benefits are twofold.
First, it provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform.
But more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.
Lastly, we acquired ZebraSci, a pharmaceutical services company.
This acquisition provides the opportunity to expand our Pharmaceutical Systems business beyond injectable device design and manufacturing to include best-in-class testing for drug device combination products.
ZebraSci allows us to further engage and collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies and particularly smaller companies, where a large amount of the pipeline is, to support the transition of their molecules into prefilled combination devices.
Next, I want to update you on our Simplify initiatives, which are advancing well.
Through Project Recode, we are optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our plant network and simplifying our business processes.
Project Recode remains on track to achieve $300 million of cumulative savings by the end of FY 24.
We are also continuing the rollout of our BD production system, which is a standardized BD approach to driving the next level of lean processes and continuous improvements across our plants.
The BD production system is already helping to drive improvements in quality and reductions in our inventory days.
We also continue to advance Inspire Quality, our quality, regulatory and risk mitigation program.
The last pillar of our BD 2025 strategy is empower, which represents the changes in our culture and capabilities that were driving to empower our strategy.
In Q3, we completed our Voice of Associates survey with over 86% participation.
And what stood out was that our associates said were making strong progress with improvements in 95% of the metrics since our last survey in 2018.
And most notable were improvements in our focus areas of growth mindset, strong teams, quality and excitement about the future of BD.
Were also advancing our 2030 sustainability strategy, which addresses a range of challenges in our industry while helping to make a difference on relevant issues that affect society and the planet.
Our strategy will ensure we remain focused on shared value creation, meaning how we address unmet societal needs through business models and initiatives that also contribute to the commercial success of BD.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on the progress of our proposed diabetes spin-off, which remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022.
We are making steady progress with our separation activities.
We recently announced that two directors from BDs Board will be appointed as future directors of the Diabetes NewCo.
Retired Lieutenant General David Melcher will serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.
And Dr. Claire Pomeroy will serve as a director.
Their appointments will be effective upon the completion of the spin, at which point they will transition from the BD Board to the Board of NewCo.
Lieutenant General Melcher brings extensive experience in spin-offs, having served as the CEO of Exelis following its spin-off from ITT.
And under his leadership, Exelis spun off its mission systems business as a separate public company.
Dr. Pomeroy brings broad experience in healthcare delivery, administration, medical research and public health.
Im confident their combined experience, along with future planned board members, will help to set NewCo well on its path to becoming a successful independent publicly traded company focused on growth.
While continuing to evaluate additional Board members, we are also continuing to build a new Diabetes Care leadership team through a combination of current BD leaders and new hires, including Dev Kurdikar, who will be NewCos CEO; Jake Elguicze, who will be CFO, and most recently, Jeff Mann.
Jeff Mann joined our Diabetes Care organization and will be General Counsel and Head of Corporate Development for NewCo.
Jeff brings more than two decades of experience in M&A and transactions, securities law and corporate governance.
Most recently, he served as General Counsel and Secretary of Cantel Medical group.
We are also progressing with the Form 10, which will have the carve-out financials, and we expect it to be publicly available around the end of the calendar year.
Before turning it over to Chris, I will leave you with some key thoughts.
First, our base business momentum and our recovery from COVID continues, and it is broad-based.
We expect that momentum to carry into fiscal 22 and beyond.
As Chris will share with you, todays results underscore our confidence in strong mid-single-digit top line growth for our base business next year.
Second, we are executing well against our innovation-driven growth strategy, which includes our internal R&D as well as advancing our tuck-in M&A strategy.
And third, Im proud of the substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy and how that will unleash our growth potential in the years to come.
Well deliver innovations for our customers, empower our associates and create value for you, our shareholders.
Ive been with BD for 20 years, and Ive never been more excited.
We just completed our annual strategic review process, as I said, and the road ahead is looking more exciting than it did a year ago.
We look forward to sharing our BD 2025 strategy in greater detail at our November 12 Investor Day.
We hope you can join us.
Im also very pleased with our overall performance in the quarter, particularly with the base business, which showed continued strong momentum.
Third quarter revenues of $4.9 billion increased 26.9% on a reported basis and 22% on a currency-neutral basis and were ahead of our expectations.
Our current quarter results also include $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, compared to $98 million in the prior year period.
Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues in both periods, our base business revenues increased 17.6%.
Our base business reflects continued strong performance as the market continues to recover from the COVID pandemic, the impact from which was most acute in Q3 of last year.
The BD Medical segment revenues totaled $2.4 billion and were up 7.7% versus the prior year.
MDS revenues increased 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in the U.S., led by strong growth in catheters and vascular care devices.
Additionally, worldwide revenues included $18 million from COVID vaccination devices.
In MMS, the double-digit increase in our dispensing revenues was more than offset by the expected declines in our infusion solutions.
As you may recall, when the pandemic started, we saw a higher level of demand for infusion pumps and sets globally.
Diabetes Care benefited from an easy comparison to the prior year, the timing of sales and slightly better-than-expected market demand.
Pharm Systems continued to deliver strong growth with revenues up 12%, driven by demand for our prefilled devices.
BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.4 billion and were up 43%.
This included the $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, $212 million related to our BD Veritor system, with the remaining $88 million from BD MAX collection, transport and swabs.
Year-to-date, COVID diagnostic testing revenues were over $1.6 billion.
Despite lower average selling prices, driven in part by geographic mix, we are still on track to deliver on our target of total worldwide revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year.
Excluding COVID diagnostic testing revenues, our Life Sciences segment grew revenues 27%, driven by strong performances in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences.
IDS revenues increased 49%.
Excluding COVID diagnostic testing, IDS revenues increased 27%, driven by strong double-digit performance across specimen management and microbiology.
Biosciences increased 27%, driven by both research and clinical solutions.
We continue to see strong demand for research reagents and instruments as lab activity is returning to normal levels.
We also continue to see steady demand for research reagents globally, fueled by COVID research activities related to vaccines and variants, especially from academic research and biopharma companies.
BD Interventional sales totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up nearly 35%, reflecting the COVID anniversary impact on elective procedures.
Surgery revenues increased 68%, and Peripheral Intervention increased 32%.
Both businesses saw the greatest recovery in the U.S. and Western Europe, which experienced the greatest impact on elective procedure volumes in the prior year quarter.
We saw sequential improvement in both surgery and peripheral intervention.
However, in the last several weeks, we are seeing some impact from the COVID delta variant on elective surgeries in certain U.S. states.
Urology and Critical Care revenues were up approximately 14%, driven by continued growth in our PureWick and Targeted Temperature Management franchises.
Now turning to our P&L.
As we expected and have communicated, our gross margins this year are being negatively impacted by COVID-related expenses, manufacturing variances and FX headwinds, which are more acute in the second half of the year.
Also, as expected, our gross margin declined sequentially.
Our gross margin was 51.5%.
However, this included a net negative 90 basis point impact from COVID testing and reinvestments.
The 90 basis point impact includes a negative 140 basis point impact from an inventory provision related to COVID testing.
Adjusting for the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments, our underlying base business gross margin was 52.4%.
On a sequential basis, our base business gross margin declined from our second quarter rate of 53.7% due to three factors: 70 basis points of incremental FX headwinds; 40 basis points from inflationary pressures, including higher raw material costs and inbound freight as these costs roll through our inventory; and 20 basis points of other expenses, including Alaris quality remediation.
Now turning to SSG&A.
Our total SSG&A spending increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis to $1.2 billion or 25.2% of revenues.
As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented several cost-containment measures in response to the COVID pandemic.
In addition, we are continuing to see higher shipping costs.
This quarter also included higher expenses related to our COVID profit reinvestment initiatives.
As a reminder, the COVID testing reinvestments we made in FY 21 will not reoccur.
Our R&D spending totaled $321 million, an increase of 31.1% on a currency-neutral basis.
The higher R&D reflects the timing of project spending, including a higher spending related to the BD Innovation and Growth Fund.
Our R&D spending was 6.6% of revenues, which is higher than our long-term target of 6%.
On a currency-neutral basis, our operating income increased 26.5% as compared to our revenue growth of 22%.
Our operating margin of 19.8% was slightly below our guidance of below 20%.
The inventory provision related to COVID testing I referenced earlier negatively impacted operating margins by approximately 150 basis points.
Interest and other expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $98 million.
The adjusted tax rate was 5.8%, lower than we previously expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter.
The lower tax rate essentially offsets the impact from the COVID diagnostic inventory provision in the quarter.
The average diluted share count used to calculate our earnings per share in the quarter was 291.9 million.
We repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion at an average price of approximately $242.
Our adjusted earnings per share increased 24.5% over the prior year to $2.74 on a reported basis and were up 25.9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now Id like to turn to guidance for the balance of the fiscal year.
Our guidance continues to assume no major widespread hospital restrictions on elective procedures related to the COVID pandemic.
However, we did start to see some impact on elective procedures from the COVID delta variant in the last one to two weeks in certain U.S. states and have assumed some continuation of this in our guidance.
That said, given the continued positive momentum of the base business, we are pleased to be able to cover this and still raise our currency-neutral revenue growth to about 14%, up from our previous range of 10% to 12%.
Our revised revenue range would incorporate a base business currency-neutral growth assumption of 7.5% to 8%.
Further, we reaffirm our previously communicated COVID diagnostic test revenue range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.
We now expect a favorable 250 to 300 basis point impact from currency.
This brings our total reported revenue growth to approximately 16.5% to 17.5%.
For the full year, we now expect our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $12.85 to $12.95.
This higher guidance reflects the positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate.
These benefits allow us to continue to invest while offsetting the COVID testing inventory provision and lower COVID selling prices.
Next, I want to share with you our expectations for gross operating margins for full year fiscal 21 and provide you with an estimate of the net impact of COVID testing and the related reinvestments of profits on our margins.
We expect our full year adjusted gross margins to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%, and this range includes a net neutral to slight positive impact from COVID testing reinvestments.
We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%.
This range includes a 200 basis point contribution from the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments.
Finally, Id like to address FY 22.
We plan to provide our specific fiscal 2022 guidance on our November earnings call, but we wanted to provide some directional color today.
To give you a sense as to what a floor could look like in fiscal 22, we have taken the following approach: As you know, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the level of COVID testing.
Therefore, we have not modeled any testing revenue beyond the typical flu season.
With the continued momentum we are seeing, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 22 over our fiscal 21 base revenues, which, as a reminder, adjusts for COVID diagnostic testing revenues.
With respect to Alaris, our filing is comprehensive and more complex than most submissions.
As we have previously stated, it is possible that the review could be in line with past pump time lines.
However, as we have also mentioned, it was more likely to take longer for the FDA to review and ultimately grant clearance.
It is inherently difficult to predict clearance timing.
We are not assuming Alaris 510(k) clearance.
It is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process.
At this time, we have incorporated the assumption that revenues associated with Alaris will be approximately similar to FY 21.
We believe it is prudent and responsible not to definitively predict FDA clearance time lines.
That said, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA to obtain comprehensive 510(k) clearance.
We expect to drive base business gross and operating margin expansion.
We expect the operating margins for our base business to expand more than our traditional annual target of at least 50 basis points and translate into double-digit operating income growth.
For reference, we expect our base business operating margins to be between 21.5% to 22% in fiscal 2021.
With these assumptions, we expect an adjusted earnings per share floor of at least $12.
This represents approximately low teens growth over our expected base business earnings in fiscal 2021.
Now before opening it up for Q&A, I want to take a moment to comment on todays announcement of my upcoming retirement.
With our strong base business momentum, our strengthened balance sheet and improved cash flows, which is evident by the increased number of tuck-in acquisitions that weve been doing and the restart of our share buyback program for the first time since 2017, I feel that now is the right time for the transition as the company is well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and impact the lives of patients around the world.
I look forward to helping to ensure a seamless transition to the new CFO.
And Im very excited about the value-creating opportunities ahead for NewCo and helping to ensure this success as a member of their Board.
And Kristen, I think its -- we should open up the -- operator, open up the line to Q&A.
","BD reported strong Q3 results, with revenue of $4.9 billion, a 26.9% increase on a reported basis and a 22% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues grew 17.6% driven by strength across all business segments. The growth was particularly impressive considering the tough comparison to the prior year quarter, when elective procedures were halted due to the initial COVID wave. Excluding COVID testing, base business revenues increased 3.9% relative to pre-pandemic Q3 2019 on a currency-neutral basis. The company also reported a strong adjusted earnings per share of $2.74, ahead of expectations. For the full year, BD has raised its base revenue growth assumption to approximately 7.5% to 8% on a foreign exchange (FX)-neutral basis, higher than the previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. The company also announced a higher adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance in the range of $12.85 to $12.95, enabled by strong base business momentum and a lower tax rate."
UAA_q4_2021.txt,"It is important to note that the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its potential effects on the global retail environment could continue to impact our business results going forward.
You may also hear us refer to amounts under U.S. GAAP.
At the beginning of last year, we were confronted with significant uncertainty about our business due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
With dynamic changes in purchase behavior and marketplace demand, we faced several obstacles as we worked through what we believe to be a recovery year following a difficult 2020.
At that point, it would have been easy to stay conservative and adopt a wait-and-see strategy, yet the tremendous progress we made following our multiyear transformation, including healthier demand for the Under Armour brand, and the passion that this team shows up with every day meant going on offense was the only path for 2021.
And because we stayed on offense, Under Armour delivered a record year of financial results, a year that exemplifies the power of our long-term strategic plan and our ability to stay hyperfocused on execution while leveraging our core strengths to position us more strongly for our next chapter of growth.
Throughout 2021, we worked methodically to expand our brand's awareness and engagement, ensuring we showed up more consistently, louder and with a sharper point of view about the distinct role we play in an athlete's journey to compete.
We underscored our commitment to performance by delivering some of the most innovative products that we've ever produced.
We forged deeper and more productive relationships with our key wholesale partners.
We saw significant progress in our largest long-term growth drivers, our international, direct-to-consumer, women's and footwear businesses.
And we're stronger financially than we've ever been.
In this respect, looking at some of our highlights.
While our year-over-year comparisons benefited from the significant COVID-19 impacts we experienced in 2020, we are equally pleased with our performance over the past two years.
For the full year 2021, revenue was up 27% to reach $5.7 billion, which is a record.
Versus 2019, revenue is up 8%.
So solid progress from before the pandemic, and the result driven by several strategies that have lifted the quality and composition of our sales compared to a few years ago.
Wholesale revenue increased 36% to $3.2 billion in 2021.
On a two-year basis, wholesale is up 3%.
As detailed in previous calls, this performance has been tempered by the strategic decisions we've made to improve brand health by reducing our sales to the off-price channel and exiting approximately 2,500 undifferentiated retail doors in North America, an effort which is now concluded.
Our direct-to-consumer business was up 26% to $2.3 billion in 2021.
Versus 2019, direct-to-consumer is up 29%, with strong momentum in our owned and operated stores and our e-commerce business.
Following a 40% increase in 2020, our e-commerce business was up 4% in 2021, equating to 45% growth on a two-year stack.
This result gives us confidence that this business is well-positioned following a prolonged period of elevated promotional activities.
2021 gross margin was up 210 basis points to a record 50.3%.
Versus 2019, gross margin is up 340 basis points, so excellent progress over two years, driven by benefits from pricing and a more favorable channel mix being offset by supply chain headwinds related to COVID-19 and the absence of MyFitnessPal, which we sold at the end of 2020.
Rounding out the P&L.
Our full year operating income reached $486 million, net income was $360 million, and our diluted earnings per share was $0.77, all three of which are records.
We also realized strong balance sheet and cash flow performances with inventory down 9% to an absolute dollar value that is only slightly higher than in 2015 when we were a $4 billion business.
And finally, one more record having ended the year with $1.7 billion in cash.
All in, what an incredible period for Under Armour.
Having operated for nearly two years amid a global pandemic, I am proud of the progress we've made, the resilience we've shown and the potential we have to do even better in the future.
By staying focused on our key strategies, we are competing and executing at progressively higher levels, helping us unlock value and returns for our shareholders.
Driving us forward at the heart of why we exist is our purpose.
We empower those who strive for more.
For Under Armour, everything is about the journey.
From an awful workout when you want to quit but don't, to pushing through that last rep and adding one more, to earning that PR because you put in the work, Under Armour makes you better.
We do this by delivering innovative products, experiences and styles influenced by athlete insight and real-world data.
Innovations wrapped in our engineering to empower the journey to sport through training, competition and recovery, 2021 was an exceptional year for Under Armour products.
There are too many to list, but a few standouts on the apparel side include RUSH, Iso-Chill, Rival Fleece, Crossback, Infinity, Unstoppable and Meridian, all names that delivered a 33% increase in revenue we achieved.
On the footwear side, franchises like HOVR Sonic, Machina and Infinite; UA Flow Velociti Wind; Charged Pursuit, Assert, Aurora; Curry; and Project Rock contributed nicely to 35% growth, validating one of our largest long-term growth opportunities.
2021 was also an exceptional year in Under Armour's progress to connect our brand even more deeply with consumers.
From the optionality we created in our P&L, we were able to make incremental marketing investments, which we expect to fuel even stronger brand momentum in the years ahead.
At the center of these efforts, product, experience and inspiration fits The Only Way is Through.
More than a mantra, it's become an ethos, synonymous with the hard work necessary to power the journey, and it's always a journey.
From an initial product drawing to shopping bag to the closet, we obsess athletes and those who strive for more.
However, being purpose-led means that it's about more than just shirts and shoes.
And sport is so much more than just a game.
It teaches us to push past our limits, to be collaborators, to be leaders.
It increases confidence, reduces stress and improves mental health.
Yet many young athletes face barriers that prevent them from starting their journey to sport.
With a lack of fields and courts, gaps in coaching, shrinking leagues and the shortage of gear to play, train and compete with, we recognize that not everyone has access to sport.
Addressing this opportunity, a few weeks ago, we announced the long-term commitment of our resources, focus and energy to break down these barriers.
As we lay the foundation for our Access to Sport initiative, we are excited to share more in the years ahead as we build opportunities for millions of youth to engage in sport by 2030, ensuring that the next generations of focused performers are inspired even more holistically than those before them.
Now back to our business.
And the last two years have proven to be one of the most dynamic yet opportunistic times in Under Armour's history.
Managing the marketplace prudently through our constant focus on operational excellence to ensure we're keeping the brand healthy and moving forward, we are delighted with our results.
That said, let's look at how our regions performed in 2021, starting with North America, where revenue was up 29% to $3.8 billion or up 4% since 2019.
In our largest market, we continue to focus on three fundamentals.
First is becoming a better retailer by creating more compelling in-store experiences and delivering best-in-class service across our fleet.
Additionally, this means continuing to build on the momentum we've seen in our e-commerce business.
Realizing we'd likely see traffic declines compared to the abnormality that was 2020, we stayed focused on quality by investing in high-return vehicles like targeted PLAs and improved product wayfinding to improve our online shopping experience, and it's working.
In 2021, while we did experience a year-over-year traffic decline, it was more than offset by meaningful increase in conversion and therefore, solid revenue growth.
Second, with the critical mass of undifferentiated wholesale door exits behind us, we are encouraged by the productivity KPIs we're seeing across this channel in North America.
A more premium position driven by outstanding inventory management and promotional discipline is translating nicely to additional shelf space opportunities with our largest strategic partners, higher AURs and significantly better turns.
And that last point turns, which is really about execution, is a core element that gives me confidence that we're in an excellent position to adapt to however the environment may develop over the short term.
Third, we are continuing to drive performance by investing more smartly in marketing, which shows up in improved brand affinity scores around awareness, consideration and conversion.
Gaining better productivity from how and where we spend has always been the goal.
By delivering higher quality traffic through strategic paid media and targeted email activations, our ability to connect more meaningfully across key moments and multiple platforms has never been greater.
Turning to our international business.
Revenue in EMEA was up 41%, driven by nearly 50% growth in our wholesale business and continued momentum in direct-to-consumer.
We are encouraged by the quality of business results delivered in 2021.
Our efforts to position Under Armour as premium performance, healthier wholesale relationships and improved retail capabilities continue to validate the power of our playbook.
Our two-year performance is strong as well, with revenue in EMEA up 36% versus 2019.
Next up is Asia Pacific, where revenue was up 32% in 2021, driven by nearly 50% growth in our wholesale business and a strong increase in direct-to-consumer sales.
Clearly, the story here is about a more challenging environment that has developed in China as of late as evidenced by a 6% decline in our fourth quarter APAC revenue.
The recent market trends in China are impacting our business.
However, our focus in China remains the same: staying premium; continuing to invest in digital innovation, including working to deliver much improved end-to-end consumer engagement platform; and ensuring that store expansions are done at an appropriate pace in the dynamic market conditions.
Versus 2019, revenue in Asia Pacific was up 31%, so strong growth on a two-year basis.
And finally, revenue in our Latin America region in 2021 was up 18%, driven by strength in our full-price wholesale and distributor businesses.
As a reminder, we have transitioned certain countries in this region to a strategic distributor model, a decision we believe will begin to optimize this region's ability to grow and contribute more profitably in the years to come.
Versus 2019, revenue in Latin America is about flat on a two-year basis.
So in closing, we remain both confident and cautious in this operating environment.
And while current macro factors are having material impact on our business, we have no intentions of sitting idle.
Innovation, consumer connectivity and inspiring those to strive for more are not tactics at Under Armour.
They are a way of life.
Moving forward, we believe that the things we can control will continue to serve us as strengths, just as they did in fiscal 2021.
Regardless of the short-term environment, we are running a stronger, better company, one that is increasingly more capable of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders over the long term.
I am pleased with where Under Armour is sitting, incredibly proud of this team.
And in my nearly five years here, I have never been more excited about our future.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave.
Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, our intent has been to deliver appropriate financial performance while protecting the Under Armour brand and positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.
Leveraging the strength of a data-driven, consumer-centric strategy and a constant focus on operational excellence, we believe we can emerge from this unprecedented time as a stronger, more profitable company.
Despite the high level of uncertainty, we committed to staying agile to minimize downside risk while executing against our playbook to help us capitalize on upside opportunities as they arose.
In 2021, we did just this.
That isn't to say that uncertainty is over.
We remain vigilant about the dynamic environment we are operating in, including ongoing supply chain headwinds, rising wages and inflationary input cost pressures that continue to permeate the marketplace.
Yet we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our plan by staying focused on our business strategies and remaining nimble as we implement them.
Our fourth quarter results reinforce that confidence.
Compared to the prior year, revenue was up 9% to $1.5 billion.
As a reminder, we expected several headwinds in the quarter, including lower sales of SPORTSMASKs, lower sales to the off-price channel, the absence of MyFitnessPal and proactive supply constraints, among others.
Versus our previous expectation, our revenue overdrive was primarily due to higher demand across our full-price wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, particularly in North America, coupled with better-than-expected supply chain execution during this challenging environment.
From a channel perspective, fourth quarter wholesale revenue was up 16%, driven by strong performance in our full-price business, partially offset by lower year-over-year sales to the off-price channel.
Our direct-to-consumer business increased 10%, led by 14% growth in our owned and operated retail stores and 4% growth in our e-commerce business.
In addition, our e-commerce business is up more than 30% on a two-year basis.
And licensing revenue was down 33%, driven primarily by the recognition timing of minimum royalty payments.
By product type, apparel revenue was up 18%, with strength in our training and outdoor businesses.
Footwear was up 17%, driven primarily by our running and training categories.
And our accessories business was down 27% due to planned lower sales of our SPORTSMASKs compared to last year's fourth quarter.
From a regional and segment perspective, fourth quarter revenue in North America was up 15% to $1.1 billion, driven by premium growth in our full-price wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses.
So excellent barometers to improving brand strength and consumer demand in our largest region.
Compared to 2019, North American revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher quality revenue than two years ago.
In our international business, EMEA revenue was up 24%, driven primarily by strength in our wholesale business.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue in EMEA was up 11%.
Next up is APAC, where the business was down 6% in the quarter, driven by softer demand in our wholesale business, which more than offset DTC growth.
Compared to 2019, total APAC revenue was up 19%.
And finally, in line with expectations, Latin America revenue was down 22% due to the change in our business model as we moved certain countries to distributors, an effort which is now completed.
Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, Latin America was down 20%.
Related to gross margin, our fourth quarter improved 130 basis points to 50.7%.
This expansion was driven by 350 basis points of pricing improvements due primarily to lower promotional activity within our DTC business, favorable pricing related to sales to the off-price channel and lower promotions and markdowns across our wholesale business.
And 90 basis points of benefit related to lower restructuring charges.
These improvements were partially offset by 190 basis points of COVID-related supply chain impacts, driven by higher freight costs, which meaningfully offset product cost benefits during the quarter; 80 basis points related to the absence of MyFitnessPal; and 50 basis points of unfavorable product mix, related primarily to lower SPORTSMASK sales, which carry a higher gross margin.
Versus our previous expectation, our fourth quarter gross margin overdelivery was primarily due to favorable pricing developments from lower-than-planned promotional activity within our DTC business, more favorable pricing related to sales to the off-price channel and lower-than-planned promotions and markdowns within our wholesale business.
SG&A expenses were up 15% to $676 million, primarily due to increased marketing investments, incentive compensation and nonsalaried workforce wages.
Related to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $14 million of charges in the fourth quarter.
So we now expect to recognize total planned charges ranging from $525 million to $550 million.
Thus far, we've realized $514 million of pre-tax restructuring and related charges.
We expect to recognize any remaining charges related to this plan by the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.
Moving on, our fourth quarter operating income was $86 million.
Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $100 million.
After tax, we realized a net income of $110 million or $0.23 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter.
Excluding restructuring charges, income related to our first year of the MyFitnessPal divestiture earnout and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes, our adjusted net income was $67 million or $0.14 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.
From a balance sheet perspective, inventory was down 9% to $811 million, driven by continued improvements in our operating model and inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures.
Our cash and cash equivalents were $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility.
Finally, following last year's convertible bond exchanges, we are proud to share that our cash position less debt of $663 million nearly doubled to $1 billion by the end of the fourth quarter.
Looking forward, one last reminder about our fiscal reporting year change.
Mechanically, the current period we're in right now, January 1 through March 31, 2022, will serve as a transition period until we begin our new fiscal year 2023 on April 1.
To revisit what we detailed last year, we believe this change, namely putting our two largest quarters in the middle of our new fiscal year, will provide us with greater visibility when providing our initial annual outlook.
In this respect, by the time of our next call, which is expected in early May, we'll have booked orders in hand for the majority of our fall/winter wholesale business.
That said, let's turn to our outlook for the current transition quarter.
From a revenue perspective, we now expect our transition period to be up at a mid-single-digit rate compared to the previous expectation of a low single-digit rate increase.
This includes approximately 10 points of revenue headwinds related to reductions in our spring/summer 2022 wholesale order book from supply constraints associated with ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacts.
Moving forward, we expect many of these headwinds to continue well into fiscal 2023 until longer-than-usual transit times, backlogs and congestion find balance, associated freight and logistics costs normalize and inbound shipping delays subside.
At this time, we do expect these uncertainties to cause material impacts and variability in our future results.
And accordingly, we will remain cautious and agile as we operate our business into fiscal 2023.
That said, the proactive strategies we're employing, greater operational agility and overall demand for the Under Armour brand give us confidence in our ability to navigate this dynamic and challenging business environment effectively.
And we believe these COVID-related supply chain pressures are just a temporary speed bump on our road to continued profitable growth over the long term.
Turning to gross margin.
We expect our transition quarter rate to be down approximately 200 basis points against our Q1 2021 adjusted gross margin, which includes approximately 240 basis points of negative impact from higher freight expenses related to ongoing COVID-19 supply chain challenges in addition to an unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by pricing benefits.
With that, we expect operating income to reach approximately $30 million to $35 million and diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
In closing, we're proud of the record results we achieved in 2021 and the consistent progress we've made over the past couple of years.
This gives us great confidence in our brand and business and our team's ability to navigate this dynamic environment.
As we work through our transition quarter and head into fiscal 2023, we're monitoring and tracking the dynamic supply chain and inflationary pressures.
And we'll be mindful of the uncertainty and volatility that comes along with it.
These conditions demand that we maintain a high degree of agility, and I am confident we will.
","Under Armour delivered record financial results in 2021, with revenue increasing 27% to $5.7 billion. This was driven by growth across all channels, including a strong performance in international markets. Gross margin improved to 50.3%, and net income reached $360 million. The company also made progress in its efforts to improve brand health by reducing sales to off-price channels and exiting undifferentiated retail doors. Despite ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver sustainable growth over the long term, driven by continued innovation, consumer connectivity, and the execution of its strategic plan. In its most recent quarter, revenue increased 9% to $1.5 billion, while gross margin expanded to 50.7%. The company expects to recognize $525-$550 million in charges related to a restructuring plan and projects a mid-single-digit revenue increase and diluted earnings per share of $0.02-$0.03 for the current transition quarter. While supply chain and inflationary pressures remain, the company's operational agility and strong demand for its brand provide confidence in its ability to navigate these challenges effectively."

Please also note that we will present certain historical and forecasted non-GAAP financial measures in today's call, including adjusted diluted EPS, backlog, EBITDA and free cash flow.
Lastly, if you would like to be notified when Quanta publishes news releases and other information, please sign up for email alerts through the Investor Relations section of quantaservices.com.
We also encourage investors and others interested in our company to follow Quanta IR and Quanta Services on the social media channels listed on our website.
We will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations.
Additionally, total backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with the customers, favorable end market dynamics and continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies.
As many of you are aware, several weeks ago, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Blattner, which is a premier utility scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and a strong safety culture.
We believe the energy transition in North America is on the cusp of a significant acceleration, and at moving to a carbon-neutral economy will require sizable and decades-long investment in renewable generation and related infrastructure.
We believe this transaction puts Quanta in a unique position to enable the energy infrastructure for North America's energy transition.
Since announcing our intention to acquire Blattner in early September, customer reactions and conversations across our customer base have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive.
Further, we previously commented about how remarkably similar Quanta and Blattner are operationally and culturally, which has become increasingly apparent to working with the Blattner management team on integration.
We were all excited about our combined growth opportunities when we first announced the transaction.
And I can tell you that today, we are even more excited and increasingly confident in the value proposition, innovative solutions and growth synergy opportunities at Quanta and Blattner are positioned to provide existing and new customers.
Now turning the call to our operating results.
Our Electric Power Solutions operations continued to perform well with record revenues and strong margins driven by robust demand for our services, solid and safe execution, high utilization of our resources and operational excellence.
We are proud of our execution and confident that our strong market position will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities created by a favorable long-term trends driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions.
Demand for grid modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnection services remain active, and discussions around opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities continue to advance.
Our electric power backlog remains strong, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth we generated in the first half of this year.
During the quarter, Hurricane Ida made landfall over Louisiana, which ultimately left 1.2 million customers across eight states without power, including one million outages in Louisiana alone.
Quanta deployed significant resources to support utility customers through electric power infrastructure who was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 2,500 line workers and front-end support services and engineering staff.
Our comprehensive response resulted in record emergency restoration revenue and highlights our ability to quickly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need.
Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality over the coming decades, which is planned to be achieved in large part through increasing renewable generation investment.
We believe public policy and a positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly toward renewables over the near and longer term.
Blattner's utility scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's complementary and holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives.
For example, Blattner is currently constructing more than 30 utility-scale renewable energy projects across the country, and another Quanta company is currently working on the largest solar-powered battery storage projects in North America.
Additionally, we are seeing accelerated demand for our services that enable renewal generation, including transmission interconnections and substations.
We continue to scale our communication operations and progress to our strategy.
For example, we have developed our wireless capabilities and are expanding our wireless services into certain markets.
Communications revenues grew significantly in the third quarter as compared to last year.
And though we incurred higher costs on certain jobs due to descoping of certain contracts and project closeouts, which impacted profitability for these operations, these issues were not meaningful to the overall electric power segment or Quanta as a whole.
Nevertheless, demand for our communication services remains high and the majority of our communication operations are performing at or near our double-digit margin targets.
Our underground utility in Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter despite being impacted by work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and work inefficiencies associated with the recent surge of the COVID-19 Delta variant in certain areas.
We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability.
We expect our industrial services to strengthen through next year, along with the continued recovery of the global economy and demand for refined products as well as the return of our customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market.
Looking to the coming years, we believe the opportunity Quanta has with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities may be underestimated.
Here are several examples of such initiatives and project opportunities.
Gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow.
To that end, Quanta is working with several gas utility customers on hydrogen pilot programs.
Certain refiners are building renewable and biofuel processing facilities, which could create opportunities for our industrial services.
Natural gas power plants are also exploring blending hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel source to power their turbines, which could create opportunities for our pipeline infrastructure services.
Lastly, we are actively pursuing carbon sequestration projects in the United States, which could utilize our engineering and pipeline construction services.
In Canada, Pembina Pipeline and TC Energy have proposed a plan to jointly develop a carbon transportation and sequestration system called the Alberta Carbon Grid, which is envisioned to serve as the backbone of Alberta's carbon capture utilization and storage industry and could include participation by other pipeline companies.
The initiative would leverage existing pipelines, requires a new pipeline and facility investment, which when fully constructed would be capable of transporting more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.
The North American energy transition is just that a transition process.
We roll our electric power infrastructure solutions play, and the energy transition is clear.
However, we believe Quanta's underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations could play in an evolving and increasing role in this transition in support of our customers' carbon reduction initiatives.
Progress continues in Washington, D.C. toward enacting the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better plan.
As commented on prior calls, our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on either of these packages.
But if either or both enacted, they could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over both the near and longer term.
These packages include funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets.
In particular, the Build Back Better plan currently contains policy and incentives representing the largest clean energy legislative package in American history.
While additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we've seen recently.
We have profitably grown the company and executed well this year and expect to continue to do so.
We are confident in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook.
We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solution-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects, the addition of Blattner's renewable generation solutions and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic.
Looking to the medium and longer term, as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives are increasingly implemented in addition to the primary drivers of our business currently, we believe our visibility could increase and our growth opportunities could expand and accelerate.
We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment, and that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta's history.
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership.
We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.
We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.
Today, we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues to $3.4 billion.
Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share.
And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.48.
Our electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 10% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2020.
This increase was driven by continued favorable dynamics across our core utility and communications market and associated demand for our services.
Also contributing to the increase were revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $55 million.
Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q '21 were 12.4%, slightly lower than 12.7% in 3Q '20 but better than our initial expectations.
Operating margins benefited from record emergency restoration revenues of approximately $230 million, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization as well as overall solid execution across our electric operations.
Additionally, segment margins benefited from approximately $10 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture.
Otherwise, the slight reduction in operating margin versus prior year was attributable to normal job variability and mix of work and our communications operations, which delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter.
As a reminder, last year's third quarter electric power results also included what was at the time a record level of emergency restoration revenues.
Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.02 billion for the quarter, 12% higher than 3Q '20 due primarily to increased revenue from gas distribution and industrial services.
Though our operations experienced increased activity year-over-year, current quarter revenues and margins in our industrial operations were negatively impacted by disruptions along the Gulf Coast attributable to Hurricane Ida in both our industrial and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics.
Third quarter operating income margins for the segment were 6.7%, 170 basis points lower than 3Q '20, but generally in line with our expectations.
Margins for the year -- margins for the third quarter of 2020 benefited from favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects with both scope changes and favorable closeout in the quarter.
Our total backlog was $17 billion at the end of the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter we've posted record total backlog.
Additionally, 12-month backlog of $9.8 billion also represents a quarterly record.
Our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings.
The Blattner acquisition occurred after September 30.
And accordingly, their backlog is not included in our current reported levels.
However, the total backlog from Blattner and the other 4Q acquisitions is approximately $1.8 billion.
For the third quarter of 2021, we generated negative free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $40 million compared to $70 million of positive free cash flow in 3Q '20.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was down due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to prior year, which benefited from lower revenues and a corresponding lower use of working capital.
Also, 3Q '20 benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act, 50% of which are due by December 31, 2021, with the remainder due by December 31, 2022.
Partially offsetting these dynamics was a favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 3Q '20.
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of seven days compared to the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of six days compared to December 31, 2020.
The increase was primarily due to elevated working capital requirements associated with two large Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets.
Specific to the Canadian projects, both continue to encounter work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires impacting access to work sites.
These dynamics created substantial inefficiencies and production delays resulting in increased project costs.
We are in active discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs, some of which have already been approved with the remaining amounts being pursued in the normal course.
In addition, normal variability in work production and associated payment cycles across our operations contributed to slightly higher DSO in the quarter.
As Duke discussed and as we previously announced, we closed on the acquisition of Blattner on October 13.
Prior to the closing, in September 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.12%, receiving net proceeds of $1.48 billion.
Accordingly, as at quarter end, we had approximately $1.7 billion of cash.
Subsequent to the quarter, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, provide a term loan facility of $750 million, which was fully drawn and combined with the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to fund a substantial majority of the cash consideration payable to the Blattner shareholders at closing.
I'll highlight that our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment-grade ratings subsequent to these financing transactions.
From a capital allocation perspective, Blattner represents the largest acquisition in Quanta's history and a strategic opportunity to expand the solutions we deliver to support North America's transition to carbon neutral energy infrastructure.
Capital deployment for strategic acquisitions has always been a key part of our strategy.
But as we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our existing operations.
While the debt issued to support the Blattner acquisition moved our leverage profile above our target range, it remains well below the financial covenant requirements in our credit facility, and we believe we can efficiently delever while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions.
These incremental transactions further enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to our North American utility and communications customers.
Turning to our guidance.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the strength of our core utility-backed operation, which continued to deliver solid results with robust year-over-year growth.
However, the results of companies acquired during and subsequent to the third quarter, including Blattner's operations, will be included in our consolidated financial statements, which makes comparability to our previous expectations' challenge.
It should be noted that we are in very early stages of establishing Blattner-specific opening balance sheet, which includes assessing the positions of ongoing projects as of the closing and valuing the tangible and intangible assets acquired.
The result of those ongoing efforts will have a meaningful impact on Blattner's fourth quarter contribution, which we've attempted to address in the range of our fourth quarter expectations for the acquired businesses.
That said, excluding the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect full year revenues from our legacy operations to range between $12.15 billion and $12.35 billion.
Due to the strength of our consolidated performance for the first nine months of the year, we are increasing our expectations for the contribution of our legacy operations to adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.17 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint of the range representing an increase over our previous guidance and 13% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA.
As it relates to our current reportable segments, while we continue to evaluate how these changes may change with the addition of Blattner, I wanted to provide some color on our current expectations compared to our previous commentary, again, excluding contributions from the recently acquired businesses.
We continue to expect full year revenues to range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for our legacy electric segment operations.
However, based on the strong performance through the first nine months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins expected to come in slightly above 11%.
Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to lower third quarter revenue levels than previously expected.
Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for the segment with revenues now expected to range between $3.45 billion and $3.55 billion while segment margins are now expected to range between 4.5% and 5%, which includes a $23.6 million provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter, a nearly 70-basis-point negative impact on a full year basis.
With regard to the recently acquired companies operations I spoke of earlier, including Blattner, we expect post-closing revenue contributions for the year to range between $400 million and $500 million and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, ranging between $40 million and $60 million.
Accordingly, including the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect our consolidated full year revenues to range between $12.55 billion and $12.85 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between and $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion.
Corporate and unallocated costs will increase significantly, primarily due to the acquired companies.
We currently estimate amortization expense for the full year will be between $149 million and $159 million, with $60 million to $70 million attributable to the recently acquired companies.
Stock compensation expense for the full year is now expected to be approximately $89 million, with approximately $2 million attributable to restricted stock units issued to employees of the acquired company.
Acquisition and integration costs are expected to be approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $36 million for the year.
This includes approximately $10.5 million of expenses associated with change of control payments awarded to certain employees of Blattner by the selling shareholders, which require expense accounting as they have a one-year service period requirement.
We expect a comparable dollar amount will be accrued each quarter post closing until the one-year anniversary of the transaction, at which time the payments will be made to the employee.
We intend to include this amount as an adjustment to arrive at our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures.
Below the line, we expect interest expense for the year to be around $67 million, which includes approximately $16 million of incremental interest expense associated with debt financing used to fund the cash portion of the Blattner acquisition.
Additionally, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 24%, reflecting a slight reduction from our prior expectations due primarily to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions.
As a result, our expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.20 and $3.40.
And our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.62 and $4.87.
On a consolidated basis, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $350 million and $500 million.
This slight decrease is primarily due to potential timing of payments associated with emergency restoration efforts as well as the likelihood that the dynamics impacting the larger Canadian projects continue to pressure DSO in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, while we expect Blattner will be meaningfully accretive to our cash flow profile on an annual basis, we expect certain favorable billing positions at the time of acquisition could unwind as Blattner incurs costs in the fourth quarter to finish projects for which they've already received payments.
This dynamic could minimize Blattner's cash contribution during the quarter, which we factored into our range of expectations.
As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations.
Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle, and the acquisition of Blattner further differentiates us in the markets we serve and expand our ability to deliver solutions to support North America's transition to carbon neutral energy infrastructure.
We remain confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities in front of us while maintaining the financial flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value.
","Quanta Services reported record third-quarter revenues of $3.4 billion, driven by strong demand for utility and communication services. Electric Power Solutions revenue increased 10% to $2.3 billion, benefiting from $230 million in emergency restoration revenues. Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions revenue climbed 12% to $1.02 billion, primarily due to growth in gas distribution and industrial services. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.48, surpassing earlier expectations. Total backlog reached a record $17 billion, with the addition of Blattner's $1.8 billion backlog expected to further enhance Quanta's positioning. The company sees favorable market dynamics, including the need for renewable energy infrastructure, grid modernization, and environmental initiatives. Quanta's full-year revenue guidance is $12.55 billion to $12.85 billion, with adjusted EBITDA between $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion. The acquisition of Blattner, a utility-scale renewable energy solutions provider, is expected to contribute to long-term growth and enable Quanta to capture opportunities in North America's energy transition."

That's always been obvious investment strategy favored at the end of every cycle.
These are really just select the few dominant technology masters of the universe that everyone loves, sit back and enjoy the multiple expansion.
Meantime, valuation spreads between cheap and expensive have reached all-time highs all over the world.
Further, the volume of questions about whether value will ever work again or whether there is a new definition of value have been -- have become commonplace.
This is reminiscent of the late 1990s Internet bubble, when Michael Lewis' 1999 book, The New New Thing, described it all you needed to know.
Investors then like investors today, were mesmerized.
But values day is coming, paying less than the present value of future cash flows remains a winning strategy for long-term investment success, and the environment today makes this path even more attractive than normal.
We would argue that the seeds for unwinding today's extremes are right in front of us, especially as our COVID dominated world has led us into a recession, that history shows it's the key marker for the shift.
Considering the following four possible catalysts that could already be signaling that a shift is upon us.
First, the recession is in place and the path toward economic recovery is becoming clear.
We examined recessions in the U.S. over the last 100 years and in Japan over the last 45 years, and the evidence is compelling.
The U.S. experienced 14 recessions during the past century.
I'm looking at the five year returns, measuring from the beginning of the recession, the value outperformed the broad market by an average of 5% per year.
Second, interest rates stop falling, bringing multiple expansion from growth stocks to an end.
Interest rates have been in structural decline for the past 40 years.
The trend has led us to a world where you can buy value stocks at PEs of 10 just like at any time in the past 70 years, while average growth stock multiples have doubled from 30 times to 60 times earnings.
Even if rates don't rise, the tailwind enjoyed by growth stocks should dissipate.
Exuberant growth expectations for the technology masters of the universe revert to normal.
Consider the math using Microsoft as an example.
Microsoft's stock price is up ten-fold during the past 10 years.
That's 25% per year, helped by strong growth in cloud technology replacing on-premises hardware demand.
This has led to 8% annual growth in operating income.
To get an 8% annual stock price appreciation going forward given Microsoft's high multiple would now require 20 years of 10% operating income growth.
But considering that, market analysts estimate that public cloud penetration of data needs has reached 30% to 35%, and that the possible maximum penetration for the public cloud would be approximately 70%.
We're about halfway to saturation.
So where will 20 years of growth come from?
We have yet to see.
And finally, the conventional wisdom that technological change comes entirely at the detriment of the existing franchises proves to be mistaken.
Let's consider the case of electric cars and Tesla versus VW.
Conventional wisdom and stock price suggest that the answer is obvious, Tesla will win.
But even if Tesla grows, does it make sense that VW has to shrink?
Tesla's stock is one of the darlings rising over ten-fold during the past five years.
VW's stock on the other hand has barely changed in the same period.
But there are ultimately only two ways to win an auto manufacturing.
One, charge higher prices.
In other words, maintain a brand premium or two, manufacture at lower costs.
It seems inevitable, but these truths will apply to electric vehicles and that VW will succeed importing their brands strengths, think Porsche and Audi and scale advantages into the electric vehicle competition.
In fact, VW leads all competitors in the number of new electric vehicles that will be introduced over the next several years.
Turning to the business front, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net inflows.
For the previous 12 months, we had net positive flows of approximately $2.1 billion.
In fact, we have had positive net flows for each of the last three calendar years and six of the last eight years.
No small feat in a world questioning the efficacy of value investing.
We reported diluted earnings of $0.16 per share for the third quarter compared to $0.13 last quarter and $0.19 per share for the third quarter of last year.
Revenues were $33.9 million for the quarter and operating income of $15 million.
Our operating margin was 44.1% this quarter, increasing from 36.4% last quarter and decreasing from 46.3% in the third quarter of last year.
Taking a closer look at our assets under management, we ended the quarter at $33.3 billion, up 5.7% from last quarter, which ended at $31.5 billion and down 7% from the third quarter of last year, which ended at $35.8 billion.
The increase in assets under management from last quarter was driven by net inflows of $1.1 billion, as I've just mentioned, and market appreciation including the impact of foreign exchange of $0.7 billion.
A decrease from the third quarter of last year reflects $4.8 billion in market depreciation, including the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by net inflows of $2.1 billion.
September 30, 2020, our assets under management consisted of $13.3 billion and separately managed accounts, $18 billion in sub-advised accounts and $2 billion in our Pzena funds.
Compared to last quarter, separately managed account assets increased, reflecting $0.4 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, partially offset by $0.1 billion in net outflows.
Sub-advised account assets increased, reflecting $1.3 billion in net inflows and $0.3 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, and assets in Pzena funds decreased slightly to $0.1 billion in net outflows.
Average assets under management for the third quarter of 2020 were $33.1 billion, an increase of 11.1% from last quarter and a decrease of 8.1% from the third quarter of last year.
Revenues increased 12.7% from the last quarter and decreased 8.4% from the third quarter of last year.
The fluctuation in revenues primarily reflects severance [Phonetic] and average assets under management over the period as well as the impact to performance fees and fulcrum fees recognized.
During the quarter we did not recognize any performance fees similar to last quarter when compared to $0.3 million recognized in the third quarter of last year.
The third quarter also reflects a reduction in the base fees of certain accounts related to the fulcrum fee arrangements of one client relationship.
These fee arrangements require a reduction in the base fee if the investment strategy underperforms its relevant benchmark or allows our performance fee if the strategy outperforms its benchmark.
During the third and second quarters of 2020, we recognized $1 million reductions in base fees related to these accounts compared to $0.5 million reduction in base fees during the third quarter of 2019.
These fees are calculated quarterly and compare relative performance over a three year measurement period.
To the extent that three year performance record at this account fluctuate relative to its relevant benchmark, the amount of base fees recognized may vary.
Our weighted average fee rate was 41 basis points for the quarter compared to 40.4 basis points last quarter and 41.2 basis points for the third quarter of last year.
Asset mix and the impact of swings in performance fees and fulcrum fees are all contributors to changes in our overall weighted average fee rate.
Looking at operating expenses, our compensation and benefits expense was $15.8 million for the quarter compared to $15.6 million last quarter and $16 million for the third quarter of last year.
G&A expenses were $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $3.6 million last quarter and $3.9 million for the third quarter of last year.
The decrease from last quarter and the third quarter of last year, primarily reflects a reduction in travel costs and professional fees.
Other income was $0.5 million for the quarter, driven primarily by the performance of our investments.
Looking at taxes, the effective tax rate for our unincorporated and other business taxes was negative 6.8% this quarter compared to a positive 4.1% last quarter and negative 5.1% in the third quarter of last year.
The negative effective tax rate this quarter and in the third quarter of last year reflects the benefit associated with the reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities and interests due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.
We expect the effective rate associated with the unincorporated and other business taxes of our operating company to be between 3% and 5% on an ongoing basis.
Our effective tax rate for our corporate income taxes, ex-UBT and other business taxes, was 26.5% this quarter compared to our effective tax rate of 26.6% last quarter and 24.4% for the third quarter of last year.
The fluctuation in these effective rates reflects certain permanently non-deductible expenses.
We expect this rate excluding these items to be between 23% and 25% on an ongoing basis.
The allocation to the non-public members of our operating company was approximately 78% of the operating company's net income for the third quarter of 2020 compared to 77.7% in the last quarter and 74.5% in the third quarter of last year.
The variance in these percentages is a result of changes in our ownership interest in the operating company.
During the quarter through our stock buyback program, we repurchased and retired approximately 102,000 shares of Class A common stock for $0.5 million.
At September 30, there was approximately $10.7 million remaining in the repurchase program.
At quarter end, our financial position remained strong with $49.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as $70.3 million in short-term investments.
We declared a $0.03 per share quarterly dividend last night.
We'd now be happy to take any questions.
","Despite a surge in technology-focused investments in recent years, the transcript emphasizes that value investing remains a viable long-term strategy. The current economic recession, combined with the potential for interest rate stabilization, could lead to a shift away from growth stocks and towards value stocks. Historically, during recessions, value outperformed the broad market by an average of 5% annually over the next five years. Skepticism towards conventional wisdom that electric vehicles will eliminate traditional automakers is warranted, as companies like VW demonstrate potential for success in this evolving market. The company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.16, up from $0.13 last quarter, on revenues of $33.9 million. Net inflows reached $1.1 billion, resulting in positive net flows for three consecutive years. Assets under management increased 5.7% from last quarter to $33.3 billion, despite a decrease of 7% from the same period last year. The company's weighted average fee rate was 41 basis points. Quarterly dividend remains at $0.03 per share."
AEO_q1_2021.txt,"These statements are based upon information that represents the Company's current expectations or beliefs.
The results actually realized may differ materially based on risk factors included in our SEC filings.
As a note, due to the significant impact COVID-19 had on fiscal 2020 financial results, our first quarter fiscal 2021 results are compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which we believe is a more meaningful comparison.
I am extremely pleased with the pace of our business and the outstanding financial performance in the first quarter.
Even as we compare to the pre-pandemic 2019, our results were truly remarkable and validate the strength of our value creation plan.
We exceeded expectations in essentially all areas of the business, giving us a strong start to the year.
We had record first quarter revenue of over $1 billion and the highest first quarter operating income in our history of $133 million, which was up 170% from 2019.
Importantly, we saw strength across both the American Eagle and Aerie brands.
We ran an extremely healthy business as margins hitting the highest levels in many years.
The actions we took in 2020, including our strategic growth pillars, combined with the favorable external environment, are having a very meaningful impact on our business.
Starting with our first pillar, accelerating Aerie to $2 billion, this quarter provided even more evidence that Aerie is the most exciting brand in retail today.
On nearly 90% revenue growth, operating earnings rose well over 700%.
Aerie is truly hitting its stride.
We have increased digital penetration, expanded geographically and pushed new and explosive categories like OFFLINE, leggings and additional apparel items.
As Jen will review, we continued to gain new customers at a fast clip.
We're spending more on our brand.
At this pace, we expect to hit our $2 billion target faster than expected, fueling significant earnings growth.
As I said back in January, American Eagle is a strong and highly profitable brand with significant opportunity for both growth and profit improvements.
The first quarter demonstrated that potential.
We are seeing a favorable response to our product and new marketing.
While the jeans category continues to dominate, across the brand, we hit high margin rates with promotional [Indecipherable].
I'm very proud of the great progress under Jen's leadership.
I know we are only at the beginning of realizing American Eagle store potential.
Next, customer-facing priorities delivered in the first quarter, fueled by our leading omni capabilities.
Digital growth was terrific as momentum continued.
We also saw an improvement in our store business as consumers are starting to get out more.
Our loyalty relaunch was a homerun and producing a stronger customer experience, positive margin contribution and higher ROI.
The supply chain delivered great results, even in the face of logistic headwinds.
Deliveries were on time and we were able to successfully chase into top-performing items.
The multi-year investment we made in these areas continue to pay off.
Our fifth pillar, to strengthen ROI discipline, is clearly evident in our results.
First quarter growth in our profitability is a testament to the incredible collaboration across teams.
We have not taken our eye off the ball and remain focus on ensuring strong financial management as a top priority.
And lastly, ESG initiatives.
I'll highlight our environmental goals, where we continue to make great progress.
We are reducing water, utilizing more sustainable raw materials and reducing energy to ultimately achieve carbon neutrality in our own facilities by 2030.
We know sustainability is important to our customers and [Indecipherable] on our commitment to social responsibility and I&D, this month we awarded our first 15 Real Change scholarships for Social Justice.
We are excited to support educational pursuits of our amazing associates who are actively driving anti-racism, equality and social.
Before I turn to it Jen, clearly 2021 is off to a great start.
I am so proud of the excellent execution across all areas of the Company.
The past several months truly validates my belief that we have more opportunity than at any time in the past.
We have two of the best brands in the industry with significant momentum, and we have the right teams and leadership in place to achieve our goals.
The macro environment is favorable with pent-up demand and new trends that play to our strength.
At this pace, we expect to achieve our 2023 goal of $550 million of operating income way ahead of schedule.
I hope everyone is doing well.
To say the least, we've had an incredible start to the year across both Aerie and American Eagle.
There is clearly strong demand and momentum for our brands.
Our strategies to expand into new categories, strength in product and marketing and fuel our brand platform are having a meaningful impact in our business.
It's truly gratifying to see strong sales and customer growth, and a very high level of profit flow-through.
Let me begin with Aerie.
I am thrilled by the incredible excitement and energy for Aerie and our merchandise collection.
We continue to set records across the brand.
Building on the momentum throughout last year, the first quarter accelerated.
Sales rose an incredible 89% from 2019.
The consistency we are experiencing is truly amazing.
This was the 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
As aerie.com becomes a go-to destination for our customers, the online business more than doubled, posting a growth of 158%.
Store revenue increased 36% with about one-third from new store opening.
Aerie's active customer file expanded approximately 40% as we entered new markets, and we increased engagement on social channels, including TikTok where we saw tremendous response.
With new customers attracted to our brand and demand for our merchandise accelerating, brand equity scores show growing awareness.
Sales metrics were strong across the board, and notably our AURs were up 50%.
High demand is driving greater pricing power.
A significant reduction in promotions contributed to an over 700% increase in operating profit and a 23.5% operating margin.
Across categories, we saw broad-based strength with all areas rising in the double-digit.
Intimates was terrific as was swimwear, where product innovation and newness are fueling demand.
Aerie signature legging business is exceptional and continues to expand with the success of our new OFFLINE by Aerie activewear brand.
Related categories such as fleece, tanks and sports bras are also tracking very well.
Geographic expansion is a major priority and opportunity for Aerie.
We opened six new stores in the quarter, including a new OFFLINE by Aerie store, bringing our running total of OFFLINE openings to five stores.
We are very pleased with the early results.
As Mike will review, we plan to continue our market expansion strategy.
Shifting gears now to American Eagle.
As I said at our Investor Day in January, AE has a wonderful heritage defined by individuality, purpose and heart.
My goal has been to harness AE's iconic image and update it for today's youth.
Harmonizing the old with the new, we want to leverage our dominance in jeans and focus on more outfitting.
We are also optimizing our inventory for better margin.
I'm so excited with the progress we've made in such a short period of time.
We've achieved the best margins in many years, and customer demand is strengthening across all categories.
This quarter, we saw a 39% increase in operating profit, with operating margins rising 20.8%.
Our focus on inventory optimization and profit improvement drove merchandise margin expansion.
We made better decisions around promotional activity and drove greater full-price selling.
We are also pleased with the improvement in sales, led by a 20% increase in the digital business.
Customer engagement was up 2% with new digital acquisitions up 17%.
Demand across our jeans and bottoms business remains very strong.
We continue to solidify our position as the number one brand within our demo and the number one women's brand across all ages.
With the new denim cycle under way, we are innovating and investing to maintain our leadership position and to offer the absolute best to our customers.
As silhouettes transition, I'm excited for what's in the pipeline.
In the first quarter, I'm pleased to report that we had our best quarter ever in fleece and graphic.
We plan to lean into this momentum in the back half of the year.
As bottoms evolve, we have the opportunity to delight our customers with new styles across tops and greater outfitting.
Just six months into rewriting our strategy, the success we've seen reinforces my excitement for our longer-term opportunity.
The team is energized and I can't wait to share what's in-store for AE in the coming quarters.
Lastly, I can't say enough about the great work our teams continue to deliver.
The dedication and drive of the Aerie team is simply amazing.
They strive for greatness quarter-after-quarter.
It's been terrific to work with the AE as well over the past several months.
We have extraordinary talent, and I look forward to driving our vision together.
I'm really proud of how quickly and enthusiastically our teams embraced our Real Power.
The results out of the gate in 2021 are tremendous, and they affirm that we are positioning our operations in the right way to fuel our next chapter of growth.
At the heart of our operating strategy is a truly customer-centric focus.
The investments we've made in our systems, our data analytics, omni-channel and supply chain are yielding results.
I firmly believe that the strength of these capabilities and our ongoing investments are a unique competitive advantage.
Today, I'm going to talk about three important areas of our business; our selling channels, our customer focus, and our supply chain transformation.
Let me start with digital, which continues to post remarkable result.
Our revenue rose 57% from 2019, producing incremental revenue of $150 million in the first quarter.
Online traffic and transaction -- transactions increased well into the double digit.
We achieved strong AURs and significantly higher margin.
Further fueling an already highly profitable channel, digital penetration increased to 40% of total revenue, up from 30% in 2019.
As customers continue to embrace online shopping, we are delivering an ever-improving experience.
For example, we recently introduced a new tab structure to provide greater ease of shopping across brands while enabling more immersive brand experiences.
We also introduced more personalization and enhanced curbside and in-store pickup features, which yielded great results.
We improved our mobile experience and redesigned our app, resulting in 70% increase in revenue from total mobile.
Stores improved in the first quarter, despite continued COVID-related traffic pressure.
Fleet optimization work is under way and we are pleased with the initial transfer rates from recent store closures, which are running well ahead of our 40% goal.
Proactive customer engagement has been a driving factor in retaining customers, transitioning them to nearby stores or online.
Our customer base is extremely healthy and growing.
Nearly 1 million new customers have been added since 2019.
The average spend per customer is up in the double digits, with a greater number of customers shopping across both brands.
This speaks to the quality of our engagement, our product, our marketing and technology enhancements.
The relaunch of our loyalty program last summer has been highly successful, not only in attracting new customers but fueling more frequent engagement, more purchases and an improvement to margin.
Across the board, our operational teams delivered exceptional results this quarter.
As I've discussed before, we are highly focused on supply chain transformation aimed at improving inventory productivity, delivering efficiency and better and faster customer experience.
This work is yielding result.
For example, we reduced SKU counts across assortments to focus on the most productive styles, which resulted in faster turns and a meaningful increase in product margins in the first quarter.
Our regional fulfillment nodes are resulting in better placed inventory, creating efficiencies and enabling faster service to both stores and to customers.
In the first quarter, we leveraged e-commerce delivery expense, had fewer shipments per order and delivered to customers 1.5 days faster than in the first quarter of 2019.
Our supply chain team anticipated and successfully managed through shipping delays, with very minimal disruption to our business.
We also successfully executed chase strategies to replenish high demand items and supported outperformance of Aerie, OFFLINE, swimwear and a variety of fashion choices.
This really speaks to the strength of our team, our capabilities and our vendor partnerships.
Now, as I look ahead, we are staying in front of ongoing supply chain challenges and we have continued to see favorability in our product cost for the remainder of the year.
In light of our strengthened operations, focus on driving higher margins, inventory optimization, as well as our well-positioned and growing brands, I'm very confident that we're positioning AEO for continued success.
And with that, I'm going to pass the call over to Mike.
I'll start by saying we are obviously extremely pleased with the first quarter during which we had a number of all-time highs and milestone.
Results were well ahead of our expectations across the board.
Our strategies are clearly working and we're making great progress on our Real Power.
This performance reflects a few major factors.
Our brand is strong and our merchandise is in demand, fueling very healthy sales and KPIs.
Our inventory optimization initiatives are working, resulting in lower promotions and significant growth in our merchandise margin.
Both of our selling channels are delivering positive results and our investments in our supply chain capabilities are effectively supporting our growth.
These factors, plus a favorable environment, led to record first quarter performance.
Revenue of over $1 billion and operating income of $133 million marked all-time highs for the Company.
Demand for Aerie continues at a rapid pace, driving significantly higher sales, margins and profitability.
American Eagle saw a slight topline growth and experienced one of the brand's highest merchandise margin rates on record with more runway ahead.
As Judy mentioned, I will review first quarter 2021 against the same period in 2019.
Consolidated first quarter net revenue increased 17%.
Across brands and channels, sales metrics were exceptionally strong with our average unit retail up over 20% fueling a healthy transaction value.
Conversion rates across channels were also favorable.
Digital revenue rose 57%, with Aerie up 158% and AE up 20%.
This strong growth reflects the benefits of our multi-year investments to capitalize on the customer migration to digital and omni-channel e-commerce.
Online sales for the quarter represented approximately 40% of our total mix, increasing significantly from 30% in the first quarter of 2019.
Store revenue was flat, a nice improvement from the fourth quarter.
Additionally, U.S. stores posted positive revenue in the quarter with our stores in Canada affected more by lower traffic and store closures related to COVID-19.
At a brand level, AE revenue increased slightly to $728 million.
Strong demand, lower promotions, along with inventory optimization initiatives, led to a record merchandise margin.
AE's operating profit jumped 39% to $151 million and the operating margin expanded 570 basis points to 20.8%.
These results are a clear proof point of the margin opportunity for AE which we reviewed back in January.
While the quarter showed great progress, the work continues.
Jen reviewed the progress in the product side, and we still have opportunities to maximize inventory productivity.
Aerie had another standout quarter with growth accelerating.
Revenue increased 89% to $297 million.
Operating income hit $70 million, rising over 700%.
The operating margin expanded to 23.5% from 5.3% in 2019.
As I've highlighted quite a few times now, Aerie is at an inflection point in its growth trajectory.
We'll continue to realize significant flow-through of incremental sales to the bottom line.
Total consolidated AEO gross profit dollars were up $111 million or 34% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and gross margin expanded 550 basis points to 42.2%.
Merchandise margin expanded significantly, reflecting continued promotional discipline and benefits from our inventory optimization initiatives.
Our product assortments were well received, which enabled higher full-priced selling.
Rent dollars were lower and leveraged significantly as a result of negotiated savings, store closures and benefits from impairments.
Offsetting this, we saw higher delivery, distribution and warehousing costs, as well as higher incentive compensation.
SG&A leveraged 40 basis points as a rate to sales.
The dollar increase of $34 million from the first quarter 2019 was due to compensation in line with our performance-based incentive program, an increase in corporate salaries and higher variable selling expenses, partly offset by lower travel expense.
Operating income of $133 million increased 170% compared to $49 million in adjusted operating income in the first quarter 2019.
The operating margin of 12.9% expanded 730 basis points, marking a 14-year high for the Company.
Corporate unallocated expense increased 29% to $88 million, primarily due to incentive compensation.
As a result of historically high profit delivered this quarter, incentive accruals are higher than normal and up against the minimal accrual in 2019.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 per share in the quarter, marking a record first quarter outcome for us.
Our diluted share count was 207 million and included 34 million shares of unrealized dilution associated with our convertible notes.
Ending inventory was up 2% compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
American Eagle inventory was down 15% due to continued inventory optimization initiatives and significantly reduced clearance levels.
Aerie's inventory increased approximately 50% versus 2019, supporting the strong sales growth, new stores and product expansion, including OFFLINE by Aerie.
Across brands, inventory is well positioned and below current demand levels.
As Michael said, we're comfortable with our ability to receive goods through our supply chain and have successfully chased into strong items.
I'm very pleased with our liquidity and the health of our balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $792 million in cash and short-term investments.
Even excluding proceeds from the convertible bond issuance, our liquid, cash balance is up $36 million versus 2019.
Capital expenditures totaled $37 million in the quarter.
For 2021, we continue to expect capital expenditures of $250 million to $275 million, in line with the average annual target we shared at our investor meeting.
We expect this to be back half loaded, given the timing of Aerie and OFFLINE new store openings.
Regarding our store fleet, we are pleased with the transfer rates of recently closed locations and continue to expect incremental closures this year.
We've had productive negotiations with landlords and have continued to secure lower rents and build flexibility into the portfolio.
The vast majority of our 2020 renewals were short term, resulting in almost 450 leases coming to term in 2021.
This year, we plan to open approximately 60 Aerie stores and over 30 OFFLINE by Aerie stores, which will be a mix of stand-alones and Aerie side-by-side locations.
Now as we look ahead, we are encouraged by our continued trend early in the second quarter.
Both brands continue on a healthy pace.
There is still uncertainty ahead, but as we reflect on our 2023 targets provided back in January of $5.5 billion in revenue and $550 million in operating profit, we believe we are on pace to achieve the profit goal this year, obviously well ahead of expectations.
We're excited about this prospect and what it could imply for our future profitability as we continued to implement and execute on our long-term growth strategies.
As a reminder, our reported second quarter 2019 results included a $40 million benefit to revenue and $38 million benefit to operating profit from the termination of our licensing partnership with a third party operator in Japan.
We are extremely pleased with the speed and success with which we are putting our Real Power.
As I said back in January, I believe we're heading into the most exciting period in our history.
Our brand is stronger than ever, our business model is sound and our first quarter results bear testament to the quality of our strategies and strength of our execution.
","In the first quarter, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) experienced a surge in revenue and profitability, surpassing expectations. Digital sales skyrocketed by 57%, led by Aerie's 158% growth and American Eagle's 20% increase. Both brands achieved record-breaking quarterly revenue and operating income. Aerie, in particular, saw an impressive 89% revenue increase and a 700% operating profit increase, further supporting the company's goal to grow the brand to $2 billion faster than anticipated. American Eagle also demonstrated strong performance with a merchandise margin expansion, reflecting favorable customer response and inventory optimization efforts. The company's focus on customer-centric initiatives, including a successful loyalty relaunch, contributed to increased customer spending and engagement. Additionally, AEO's supply chain transformation initiatives led to improved inventory management, efficient logistics, and reduced delivery time, further supporting the company's growth. As a result of these positive results, AEO anticipates achieving its 2023 target of $550 million in operating income well ahead of schedule."
IEX_q1_2021.txt,"This is Mike Yates, vice president and chief accounting officer for IDEX Corporation.
The format for our call today is as follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of our business, an update on our M&A activity and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our end markets.
Bill will then discuss our first-quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the second and -- quarter and full-year 2021.
Finally, Eric will conclude with an update on our sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Before we begin, a brief reminder.
With that, I'll now the call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.
Once again, our teams across IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've achieved together.
I don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago.
Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve us well.
We're seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point.
We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago.
Although tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping a close eye on.
Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward.
Customers are more confident in their outlook but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments.
As for COVID, the conditions vary widely around the world.
In the U.K. and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late.
In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now.
The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had in our businesses.
The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles in a variety of staffing challenges, this was far from smooth sailing.
I'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results.
The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off.
Pivoting a moment to capital deployment.
With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night, covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note.
And we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities.
We recently allocated some of our most talented resources toward focused strategy and business development roles, and we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX.
Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition.
We seek to both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses as well as established positions within new market niches where the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders.
We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy toward these efforts.
Moving on to Slide 7.
Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum Group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million.
Airtech engineers and manufactures high-performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps.
Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid-30s range in 2020.
It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits.
Within the IDEX family of businesses, they complement and expand upon the solutions provided by Gast Manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower, air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems.
While there are some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of Airtech's product lines will be complementary.
They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation.
This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter, will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health & Science Technology segment.
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8.
The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter.
Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels.
I'll go into more details in a minute.
Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all-time high for us.
Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019.
As we look across our segments, health and science technologies and fire and safety/diversified products delivered strong organic order growth, with fluid and metering technology slightly lagging.
As growth rates in HST and FSDP begin to naturally level off, we expect FMT will drive additional growth due to the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year.
These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers.
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets.
To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery.
Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year, and we continue to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic.
We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels.
Many of our markets have fully recovered, and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets.
In our fluid and metering technologies segment, industrial day rates continued to increase throughout the quarter.
As I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large capex projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back toward 2019 levels.
Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong.
Our water business is stable.
We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic on municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill.
Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector.
Moving to the health and science technologies segment.
We experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets, semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings.
The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance.
Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound as the impact of the pandemic in the United States has improved.
Day rates are improving, but projects are lacking.
One last item for HST. We do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been taking -- talking about in this segment, specifically around testing.
The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval which will impact volumes for this year.
We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk.
Finally, in our fire and safety/diversified products segment, dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment.
Much like our automotive exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins, coupled with an improved market.
In fire and rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in Europe and India as budgets have not been released, delaying tenders.
The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending.
The other ligand category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT's energy and aerospace exposure along with some industrial applications in fire and rescue.
We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain.
This persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year.
Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year.
I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11.
Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter.
Organic orders grew sequentially and year over year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide.
First-quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically.
We experienced growth across all our segments, with over 75% of our business units increasing year over year.
Strength in semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter.
Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9% but was up 110 basis points sequentially.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with ABEL, mix and onetime inventory reserves.
The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic-related electrostatic sprayer businesses not materializing at the rate we expected.
Excluding acquisitions and the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year.
First-quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year.
Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year, offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned.
I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide.
Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior-year ETR of 20% due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
This drove a $0.05 headwind on earnings per share for the quarter.
First-quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year.
Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted earnings per share would have been up $0.23 or 17%.
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income.
The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of our working capital initiatives.
Moving on to Slide 12.
As Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021.
We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls we put in place last year.
Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year.
Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior-year gross margin rate.
The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million, and we were able to net $4 million from price productivity, partially offset by inflation.
After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through was extremely strong at 58%.
Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%.
As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities.
We have already started those investments and expect the associated costs from these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters.
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2021.
I'm on Slide 13.
For the second quarter, we are projecting earnings per share to range from $1.60 to $1.63, with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%.
The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23%, and we expect a 2% top-line benefit from the impact of FX.
Corporate costs in the second quarter are expected to be around $21 million, with the increase primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier.
Turning to the full-year outlook.
We are increasing our full-year earnings per share guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20.
We are also increasing our full-year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8%, up to 9% to 10%.
We expect operating margins of approximately 24 and a half percent.
We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top-line results.
Our full-year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million.
Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income.
And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year.
Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges.
ABEL Pump is now included in these estimates, with the deal closed in the first quarter.
Airtech is not included in these estimates.
We will update our guidance accordingly once the deal closes.
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.
I'm on the final slide, Slide 14.
We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report.
This report is our first to adopt the sustainable Accounting Standards board's sector standards, also known as SASB.
We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity and environmental impact.
Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture.
Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and were able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company.
We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable fostering dialogue on these important issues.
We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias, and we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers.
IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses.
Our superior economic model depends upon problem-solving and decision-making at the point of impact, closest to our customers.
Our collective work within this important area, as outlined in this report, is an essential component of our next phase of business growth.
","IDEX Corporation reports robust first-quarter results, with a 10% overall increase in orders and sales, driven by strong organic growth of 6%. Despite the pandemic's lingering effects, IDEX is optimistic about its end markets, with most segments expected to fully recover by year-end. Notably, the company's Fluid and Metering Technology segment anticipates additional growth in the second half due to project-based businesses returning. IDEX has announced the acquisition of Airtech Vacuum Group for $470 million, expanding its pneumatics platform. The company has also raised its full-year guidance to $6.05 to $6.20 in adjusted earnings per share, driven by an expected organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%. IDEX remains committed to sustainability and diversity initiatives, promoting an inclusive culture and enhancing its efforts in these areas."
BRO_q3_2020.txt,"Before we get into the results for the quarter, I want to make some high level comments.
They continue to be laser focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers.
Operating in the current environment is not easy, but our team finds creative ways to serve and support our existing customers engage with new prospects.
I'm very impressed with how our teammates are leveraging the investments we've made in technology over the past few years to enhance our capabilities and customer interactions.
These include everyone from producers, service, marketing, brokers and underwriting teammates.
At this stage, we do not see face-to-face interactions returning to the pre-pandemic levels for quite some time and more than likely the new normal will be different than in the past.
As we navigate our way through the pandemic, I'm confident that we will continue to leverage innovation in our sales and service model to help further our growth and support our customers.
We've talked a lot in the past about how we're built for the long term and think about delivering shareholder value.
On Tuesday of last week, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 9%.
With this increase, we are now on our 27th year of consecutive increases, something we're very proud of.
Now let's transition to the results of the quarter.
I'm on slide number three.
We had a great quarter and I'm very pleased with our results.
We delivered $674 million of revenue, growing 8.9% in total and 4.3% organically.
I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.
Our EBITDAC margin was 32.8%, which is up 130 basis points from the third quarter of 2019.
Our net income per share for the third quarter was $0.47, increasing 14.6% on an as reported basis.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.52, an increase of 33.3% over the prior year.
Our team has done an outstanding job of growing our revenue while managing our expense base in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19.
During the quarter, we completed another six acquisitions with annual revenues of approximately $31 million.
From a capital perspective, we issued $700 million of 10.5-year bonds in September.
We're very pleased with a coupon of 2.375%, particularly considering that we issued bonds in March of 2019 with a coupon of 4.5%.
Our insurance was very well received by the debt markets, which we believe is a true reflection of Brown & Brown's credit quality.
With this capital and our cash flow generation, we're well positioned to further invest in a disciplined manner in our business and deliver future results.
In summary, we're very pleased with the strong performance for the quarter as the strength of our operating model continues to perform well through these unprecedented economic times.
I'm on slide number four.
As you may remember, in April, we thought our third quarter would be the most challenging due to the expected decrease in exposure units for our customers.
And then we performed slightly better than anticipated in the second quarter and during our second quarter earnings call, we indicated that third quarter would not be as low as originally anticipated.
As a result of good new business, higher retention and rate increases, we had a really good third quarter.
We saw companies doing their best to restart their businesses, which included some rehiring of employees or taking them off furloughed.
We saw employers and we saw individuals who start to lose employee benefits coverage through layoffs or reductions in force, which would also drive a decline in workers compensation coverage.
We saw this in certain industries.
However, there are many industries that have been quite resilient or have even grown over the past six months.
As a result of our diversification across geography, customer size, industry lines of coverage and capabilities, we've continued to grow.
Please don't take my comments out of context.
We have customers that are struggling, and we're doing our best to help them.
We believe that there is going to be challenges over the coming quarters and consequently expect there will be ups and downs in the path to recovery.
During the quarter we saw rate increases similar to the last few quarters and in some cases, they've increased slightly.
For the most part admitted market rates are up 3% to 7% across most lines.
Commercial auto rates were the exception, as they remain up 10%.
There is a lot of talk about workers compensation rate starting to turn positive during the quarter.
We're not seeing this across the board.
Generally workers' compensation rate are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters.
From an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%.
Coastal property, both wind and quake are up 15% to 25%.
Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry.
For both of these lines there can be outliers.
One area where we're seeing the most pressure right now is personal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast States.
The continued reduction in carrier appetite has been caused by fires and tropical activity, resulting in a reevaluation of all CAT-exposed property.
We believe the reduction in personal lines capacity in CAT areas will continue to decrease in the near term.
In connection with the increasing rates, the placement of coverage for many lines, certain industries where customers with significant losses continues to be challenging.
This would include access or umbrella coverage where a carrier or carriers might want to reduce their limit by half, but keep the premium constant.
Just to give an example.
We do not expect this trend to change for the next few quarters.
We've been active in the M&A space closing six transactions during the quarter with annual revenues of approximately $31 million.
During the first three quarters, we closed 16 transactions with annualized revenues of approximately $117 million.
And in addition, we've already closed a few deals for the fourth quarter.
I'm now on slide number five.
Let's discuss the performance of our four segments.
Our retail segment, organic revenue grew by 4.1% in the third quarter.
It's a really strong performance recognized across substantially all lines of business, driven by a combination of good retention, improving new business wins and continued rate increases.
We're very pleased with how our team is prospecting new account in both the traditional face to face model, as well as virtually.
Our National Programs segment grew 8.4% organically, delivering another impressive quarter.
Our growth was driven by continued strong performance from many of our programs, including our lender place, our commercial and residential earthquake and our wind programs, just to name a few.
Our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 8.2% organically for the quarter.
We realized improving new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage.
Brokerage was the fastest growing, while our binding authority business delivered modest growth as many main street businesses are not back to full operation and we experience continued headwinds in the personal line space.
We expect this rate pressure to continue for at least the next few quarters until carriers reevaluate the risk appetite or allocate more capacity to this challenged area.
The organic revenue for our services segment decreased 13.1% for the quarter.
The main drivers of the decline were lower claims volume for our social security advocacy businesses, a prior year terminated customer contract and lower claims for many of our other businesses related to COVID-19.
We expect organic revenue in the Services segment will be down in the low to mid single-digit range for the fourth quarter.
Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights, including our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables.
We're over on the slide number six.
For the third quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $55.3 million or 8.9% and organic revenue growth of 4.3%.
Our EBITDAC increased by 13.2%, growing faster than revenues as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our expenses in response to COVID-19.
Both of these factors were able to offset the headwinds associated with certain non-recurring items related to legal cost, the write-off of uncollectible receivables for one of our programs, increased non-cash stock-based compensation and a gain on the disposal of businesses recognized in the prior year.
A quick comment regarding our employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
The employee compensation and benefits ratio increased slightly as compared to the prior year, driven by higher non-cash stock-based compensation cost as we were performing above the targets for our long-term stock incentive plans.
In addition, with the market recovery during the quarter, there was an increase in the value of deferred compensation liabilities.
Please remember, the impact on EBITDAC margin is substantially zero as this increase was offset within other operating expenses.
The ratio of other operating expenses decrease due to the continued management of our variable expenses in response to COVID-19 and to a lesser extent, the benefit of the aforementioned change in deferred compensation cost.
Our income before income taxes increased by 4.3%, growing at a slower pace than EBITDAC.
This was driven primarily by the $21 million year-over-year increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
On the next slide, we will discuss our results, excluding this adjustment.
Our net income increased by $18.4 million or 15.9% and our diluted net income per share increased by 14.6% to $0.47.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 15.5%, compared to 23.9% in the third quarter of 2019.
The lower effective tax rate, which was in line with previous guidance was driven by the tax benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards.
Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.085 or 6.3% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Moving on to slide number seven.
This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years.
During the third quarter of 2020, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was about $15 million, representing an increase of approximately $21 million as compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Remember that we adjusted certain earn-out liabilities down in the first quarter of this year at the onset of the pandemic, based on our estimates at the time.
Since then, certain businesses have rebounded faster than anticipating causing us to increase the estimated earn-out liabilities in the third quarter of this year.
On a year-to-date basis, the net impact of the change in estimated earn-out payables that they charge of about $5 million as compared to a credit of approximately $7 million for the same period last year.
Excluding the change in acquisition earn-out payables in the third quarter of both years, our income before income taxes, grew $27.2 million or 18.6% growing faster than EBITDAC due primarily to lower interest expense.
Our net income on adjusted basis increased by $35.3 million or 31.6% and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.52, increasing 33.3%.
These grew faster than income before income taxes due to the lower effective tax rate for the quarter.
Overall, it was a strong quarter.
Moving to slide number eight.
This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance.
For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 8.7% and our contingent commissions and GSCs were substantially flat.
Our organic revenues, which exclude the net impact of M&A activity increased by 4.3% for the third quarter.
Over to slide number nine.
Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 6.5%, driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 4.1%, which was driven by growth across most lines of business and slightly lower contingent commissions and GSCs.
For the quarter, retail realized about a 100 basis points of incremental organic revenue growth from the timing of new business and certain renewals we expected to recognize in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 250 basis points and EBITDAC grew 16.2% due to higher organic revenue growth and cost savings achieved in response to the pandemic, both of which were partially offset by a prior year gain on disposals, higher non-cash stock compensation cost and higher inter-company IT cost.
Our income before income tax margin increased 50 basis points and grew slower than EBITDAC, due primarily to a change in estimated acquisition earn-outs.
Over to slide number 10.
Our National Programs segment increased total revenues by $25.1 million or 17.6% and organic revenue by 8.4%.
The increase in total revenue was driven by strong organic growth, recent acquisitions and an increase in profit sharing contingent commissions.
EBITDAC growth of 12.7% was slower than total revenue growth due to the write-offs of certain receivables in one of our programs.
Combined with higher inter-company IT charges, these items more than offset margin expansion from strong organic growth, as well as variable cost savings in response to COVID-19.
Income before income taxes increased by $600,000 or 1.3% with the growth primarily impacted by increased acquisition earn-out payables and higher intercompany interest expense.
Over to slide number 11.
Our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 16.2% and organic revenue growth of 8.2%.
Total revenues grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions.
EBITDAC grew by 21.1% and the margin improved by 160 basis points as compared to the prior year due to strong organic growth and the delivery of reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19, which more than offset higher inter-company IT charges and higher non-cash stock-based compensation cost.
Our income before income taxes, grew by 21.1%, substantially in line with EBITDAC growth.
Over to slide number 12.
Total revenues and organic revenues for our services segment declined by 13.1%, driven by the items Powell mentioned earlier.
For the quarter, EBITDAC declined by 22.8%, driven by lower organic revenue and higher inter-company IT expenses.
These were partially offset by reducing certain variable expenses in response to the pandemic.
Income before income taxes decreased 59.5% due to a credit of $6.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2019 for the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables and there was no adjustment in the third quarter of this year.
Few comments regarding cash conversion and outlook for certain items.
Regarding cash flow from operations, as a percentage of revenues, it decreased as expected for the third quarter due primarily to about $50 million of second quarter taxes that were paid in the third quarter as permitted by the Cares Act.
For the first nine months of 2020.
Our cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue was approximately 27% as compared to 25% realized at the same period of the prior year.
The increase is driven by our expanded margins, lower cash taxes, and continuing to manage our working capital.
Regarding liquidity and interest expense, Powell mentioned earlier that we issued $700 million of 10.5 year senior notes in late September with spread decreasing materially and the receptivity of the debt markets we thought it was prudent to access the additional capital at long-term rate materially below our prior issuances.
Our incremental debt is $500 million as we repaid $200 million on the revolving line of credit.
With the additional debt, our interest expense will increase by approximately $3 million per quarter.
With this additional capital, our revolving line of credit and strong generation of cash, we are well positioned from a capital perspective to fund in a disciplined manner, additional investments to help further grow our business.
Through 10 months, we've seen 6.4 million acres burn in California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado with 4.3 million of those acres in California alone.
There have been 27 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes with five of these hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast region and one may hit this week.
Rates are also increasing in most instances and interest rates are at historic lows.
All of this is in addition to COVID-19 and the related choppy economic environment.
We have customers laying off large numbers of employees and others are the busiest they've ever been.
Even under these extraordinary circumstances, our diversified businesses performed very well.
For the first nine months, we grew our business 3.5% organically, delivered improving EBITDAC margins of 32.4%, adjusted earnings per share was up 21.4%.
Overall, we'd say our performance and financial results have been strong.
With rates continuing to rise, you'll see new capital coming to the marketplace opportunistically.
This will be in certain lines of coverage, but not universally across the board.
In addition, very few senior leaders at insurance companies will discuss if rates are exceeding loss costs.
When that happens, they usually point to rates moderating or flattening.
We're not sure if we've reached at this point yet.
The acquisition space continues to be hot.
There's a lot of competition between private equity and long-term strategics.
We don't see this competition slowing down anytime soon.
Our ability to continue investing in our business was further bolstered by our recent bond offering.
Quite honestly, I didn't think our cost of borrowing for 10-year money would ever be 2.375%.
Our pipeline is good, but as you know, we don't count anything till it's signed.
Finally, we continue to drive our technology agenda across the company through digitization, data and automation and prioritize technology investments around the following.
One, continually optimizing and enhancing our data and analytics program.
Two, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services.
And three, engaging an initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.
We are constantly thinking about how we can serve our customers better and faster.
In closing, we thought it was a really good quarter.
","Brown & Brown delivered a strong quarter with 8.9% total revenue growth and 4.3% organic growth, totaling $674 million in revenue. The company's EBITDAC margin expanded 130 basis points to 32.8%. Net income per share increased 14.6% on a reported basis and an impressive 33.3% on an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition earn-out adjustments. The company's solid performance was supported by strong organic growth across all segments except Services, which was impacted by COVID-19 and other sector-specific headwinds. Despite these challenges, Brown & Brown has maintained strong liquidity and recently issued $700 million of 10.5-year bonds at a favorable rate of 2.375%. The company completed six acquisitions during the quarter, totaling $31 million in annual revenue, and expects continued M&A activity in the industry."
AZO_q1_2022.txt,"It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and CEO.
Sir, the floor is yours.
autozone.com under the Investor Relations link.
Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well being of our customers and AutoZoners.
Everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I am very proud of how our team has responded.
Since the start of the pandemic, we have reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners.
As our sales volumes have remained at historic all time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing WOW Customer Service, regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way.
The Assistance Fund is an independent non-profit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to AutoZoners who find themselves in a very difficult place.
We are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way.
To me it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values.
We'll also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year.
On to our sales results.
Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter on top of last year's very strong 12.3%.
Our team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and delivered amazing results.
Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere.
Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%.
Commercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales.
And now we've delivered $900 million in sales in one quarter, an incredible accomplishment.
On a trailing four quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, up 27%.
We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter, reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year.
On a two year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%.
Many people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial.
In short, it is not one thing, and I want to repeat that.
It is not one thing.
It's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years.
Those initiatives include improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub coverage and access, the continuing strength of the Duralast brand, leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver.
We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance.
We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY.
We ran a 9% comp this quarter on top of last year's 12.7%.
While our DIY two year stack comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20% two year comp in this sector of our business.
From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains.
Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long-term.
Now let's focus on our sales cadence.
Same-store sales increased sequentially from September through November.
However, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed.
Given the dynamics of the past 20 months, we like others who benefited from the pandemic, believe it is more instructive to look at two year stacked comps.
On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable.
For Q1, our two year comp was 25.8% and the four week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3%, 26% and 25.3% respectively.
Regarding weather, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the Northeastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends.
Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter.
As we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter.
Historically, extreme weather, be that hot or cold, helps drive parts failure.
Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was up 1%, while our ticket was up 7.5%.
This low-single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year as expected due to the elimination of stimulus, the reduce -- the elimination of enhanced unemployment, stay at home orders and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year.
In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers.
It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong.
And we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months.
During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are.
While last quarter we saw roughly 400 basis point gap in comp performance between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country, we did not see that gap this quarter.
In fact, the Northeastern Midwestern markets slightly outperformed.
The market share data suggests that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country.
Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter.
Our same-store sales were up 13.6% versus last year's first quarter.
Our net income was $555 million.
And our earnings per share was $25.69 a share, increasing an impressive 38.1%.
Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter.
As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well.
We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses, like batteries, that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year.
We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more.
Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing.
This quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was up about 2% on a like-for-like basis.
We believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system.
We could see mid-single-digit inflation in retails as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers.
We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to mid-term sales.
What I will say is that the past three quarter sales have all been consistent on a two year stack comp basis and both our DIY and commercial businesses have been remarkably resilient.
While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors and are maintaining and/or continuing to grow those gains.
Currently, the macro environment, while more uncertain than normal, is certainly favorable for our industry.
And if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long-term.
For FY '22, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives.
As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge.
As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter.
Our growth initiatives continue to deliver strong results.
And the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions.
For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.6 billion, up 16.2%.
Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives.
Starting with our commercial business, for the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 29.4% to $900 million and were up 41% on a two year stack basis.
Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total sales.
And our weekly sales per program were $14,400, up 25% as we averaged $75 million in total weekly commercial sales.
Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew over 25% in the quarter.
Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business.
The disciplined investments we are making are helping us grow share.
And we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market.
We now have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts.
This quarter, we opened 32 net new programs, finishing with 5,211 total programs.
We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers.
As I said on last quarter's call, in fiscal year '22, commercial growth will lead the way, and our first quarter results reflect this dynamics.
Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share.
We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share.
Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past six quarters.
Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace.
And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses.
Let me add a little more color on our progress.
As I mentioned last quarter, our mega hub strategy is giving us tremendous momentum, and we're doubling down.
We now have 62 mega hub locations and we expect to open approximately 16 more over the remainder of the fiscal year.
As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as a fulfillment source for other stores.
The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY businesses, and we are testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results.
By leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we are expanding our market reach driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times.
These assets continue to outperform our expectation, and we would expect to open significantly more than 110 locations we have previously targeted.
In commercial, we are building a meaningful competitive advantage and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business.
On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was up 9% and up 21.4% on a two year stack.
The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained over three points of market share since the start of the pandemic.
As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in traffic versus the prior year as our initiatives are continuing to drive tremendous sales and share growth along with a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers.
These initiatives include improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing.
These dynamics along with favorable macro trends and miles driven, a growing car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continue to fuel sales momentum in DIY.
And the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers gives us a key competitive advantage.
I'm also very pleased with the competitive position of our DIY business and our outlook going forward.
Our in-stock positions, while still below where we would like for them to be, are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment.
We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs.
DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company.
And while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business remained strong.
Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business.
We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil.
During the quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico to finish with 666 stores and one new store in Brazil to finish with 53.
On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries.
We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future.
With approximately 10% of our store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins.
For the quarter, our gross margin was down 65 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business where the shift in mix coupled with the investments in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 14.9%.
I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year where we were down 82 basis points.
However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements, primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome.
As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation and distribution center costs.
We continue to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational.
We would expect our margins in the second quarter to be down in a similar range as the first quarter.
All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way.
We are laser focused on taking care of our existing customers, driving new customers to AutoZone and over time growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate.
Moving to operating expenses.
Our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leverage of 171 basis points.
The leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales results.
While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these extraordinary high sales growth times.
We're also investing in IT to underpin our growth initiatives.
And these investments will pay dividends and user experience, speed and productivity.
We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.
Moving to the rest of the P&L.
EBIT for the quarter was $754 million, up 22.6% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top-line growth.
Interest expense for the quarter was $43.3 million, down 6.3% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year.
We're planning interest in the $45 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's second quarter.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% versus 22.2% in last year's first quarter.
This quarter's rate benefited 159 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 134 basis points.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.
Moving to net income and EPS.
Net income for the quarter was $555 million, up 25.5% versus last year's first quarter.
Our diluted share count of 21.6 million was lower by 9.1% from last year's first quarter.
The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $25.69, up 38.1% over the prior year's first quarter.
Now let me talk about our cash flow.
For the first quarter, we generated approximately $800 million of operating cash flow.
Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed.
You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward.
And we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong.
We're also managing our inventory well, as our inventory per store was up 10% versus Q1 last year.
Total inventory increased 3% over the same period last year, driven by new stores.
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $207,000 versus negative $99,000 last year and negative $203,000 last quarter.
As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.4% versus last year's Q1 of 114.1%.
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program.
We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter.
As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 20.7 million shares outstanding.
At quarter end, we had just over $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and just under $700 million of excess cash.
The powerful free cash we've generated this quarter allowed us to buy back approximately 2.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the quarter.
We bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buy back inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.
We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach.
We expect to maintain our long-term leverage target in the 2.5 times area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.
To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 25.5% increase in net income and a 38.1% increase in EPS.
We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings in cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders.
Our strategy is working.
And I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.
Fiscal 2022 is off to a stellar start, and we continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution.
That and our culture is what defines us.
From July 4, 1979 when our first store opened in Forest City, Arkansas, customer service has been paramount to our success.
At the end of the day, it is why customers come back to us.
Whether they are a seasoned professional or a new DIYer, they trust us.
They trust us to help them with their needs.
We continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on our own opportunities for the new year.
We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the foreseeable future.
Our customers across the Americas want to get out, get out and drive,.
and we'll be there when they need helpful advice.
Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers, and together they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for all retailers.
While we are not where we'd like to be on our store in-stock levels, we believe we are better than most retailers, and I think our results support that belief.
For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives.
We are focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis.
We will be announcing significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses.
We are also targeting to open 16 more new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses.
We will also be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico.
For the fiscal year, we will open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business.
These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our growth prospects.
We are being disciplined yet aggressive.
Our company, our customers, our leadership team, and in particular, our AutoZoners have greatly benefited from Mark's 19 years of remarkable service.
Mark spent the majority of his years with AutoZone leading our merchandising team and has played a critical role leading our supply chain and marketing teams in recent years.
He leaves our organization much, much better than he founded and leaves us well positioned for accelerated growth.
I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, and doing so in a very safe manner.
First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs.
And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success.
We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now.
I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone.
","AutoZone experienced strong performance in Q1, with domestic same-store sales increasing by an impressive 13.6%. This led to a 38.1% surge in earnings per share to $25.69, a notable increase from the previous year. Commercial sales reached a record $900 million and delivered a 29% growth, while DIY retail sales grew by 9%. The company attributes this growth to various initiatives, including improved store availability, hub and mega hub coverage, and strong customer service. Despite inflationary pressures, AutoZone has been able to offset costs through pricing actions and maintained gross margins. Operating expenses increased by 10.4%, mainly due to customer service investments and technology upgrades. The company remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, having repurchased $900 million worth of shares during the quarter. AutoZone's long-term outlook remains positive, as it anticipates continued growth in both the retail and commercial sectors and plans to expand its supply chain and open more mega hubs throughout the fiscal year."
A_q3_2021.txt,"Joining in the Q&A after Bob and Mike's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.
You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website.
Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months.
Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent Board member for nine years.
As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others.
I know that the Agilent team is not alone and recognize that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed and we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family.
Now, on to the third quarter review and our updated outlook for the year.
In Q3, the very strong broad based momentum in our business continues.
The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations.
Q3 revenue of $1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core.
This is against the mass decline of 3% in Q3 of last year, so we are well above fiscal year 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
In addition, as other positive sign of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter.
Our growth is broad based across all business groups, markets and geographies.
The combination of strong top line performance and execution translated into excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share.
Our Q3 operating margin is 26%, this is up 230 basis points from last year.
EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year.
Agilent's success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess.
We are developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast growing businesses while delivering outstanding customer service and continue to drive profitability.
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerged even stronger as a company.
While we have yet to leave COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results.
Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, but I want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, pharma and chemical energy.
We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments.
Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall pharma revenue, up from the mid 20s just a few years ago.
In chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter.
This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half and our order funnel continues to strengthen.
Looking at our performance by business unit, The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $680 million.
LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core, off just a 4% decline last year.
LSAG's growth is broad based across all end markets.
Our performance is led by strength in pharma, which is up 22% and chemical energy up 31%.
All businesses delivered strong growth led by Cell Analysis at 38% growth and our LC and LCMS businesses, which grew 22%.
We continue to strengthen our position in the fast growing large molecule market segment.
During the quarter, the LSAG team launched three InfinityLab Bio LC systems at the well attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June.
These new products further extend our LC leadership position.
In addition, building on our already strong pharma offerings, we launched new compliance ready LC/Q-TOF and LC/TOF solution to our portfolio in the quarter.
The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $560 million, this is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis.
These results are on top of 1% growth last year.
The business is benefiting from increased activity and customer labs and instrument connect rates.
This is leading to more contracted services, on-demand services and consumables consumption across all end markets.
All end markets grew mid teens or higher with the exception of environmental and forensics, but still grew 9%.
The pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business, with ACG grown each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged.
Our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends.
Looking forward, instrument placements and demand bode well with continued strong performance by ACG as we drive attachment rates and increased customer lifetime value.
The Diagnostics and Genomics Group produced revenue of $346 million, up 44% reported and up 37% core, compared to an 8% decline last year.
The growth was broad based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP oligo business.
The ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well.
The quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily surpassing the $30 million revenue milestone, while one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing the output in a high quality manner.
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate of revenue with existing capacity.
In addition, the Train B manufacturing line expansion is well underway and on schedule.
Our genomics instrumentation and consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter as did our pathology-related businesses.
For the first time in several quarters, we saw a diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels.
While we are watching Delta variant very closely, to date we have not seen a meaningful negative impact on testing volumes.
I also want to highlight our performance in China.
While still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter.
We continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position.
In Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China based biopharma company.
Earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line.
We are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG product and services offerings.
In addition, the integration of Resolution Bioscience team is going well and we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast growing NGS based cancer diagnostic market.
It was a busy quarter at Agilent.
So, I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you.
Last month, we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
At a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a company.
We've been addressing these issues since our founding more than two decades ago.
I would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website.
We're also very pleased to receive recognition of the Great Place to Work in United States by the Great Place to Work Institute.
This result is just one more example of Agilent having a highly engaged and energized team, and as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market.
Looking ahead, building on another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be an outstanding fiscal year 2021.
As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance.
I will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth and earnings generation.
While the world has yet to fully emerge from a global pandemic, Agilent is well positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter.
I remain very proud of the Agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders.
I will now hand the call off to Bob.
In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on Q3 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics.
I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year.
As Mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the third quarter.
Revenue was $1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of 26%, core revenue growth was 21%.
Currency added 4.5% for the quarter and M&A added 0.5 point.
In addition, COVID-related revenues were in line with the prior year.
All end markets performed well with pharma and chemical and energy as standouts versus our expectations.
Our largest market pharma grew 27% during the quarter, after growing 2% last year.
The performance was led by the continued strength in our Large Molecule business growing 52%, while our Small Molecule business grew mid teens, and all regions in the pharma market grew double-digits.
Our Large Molecule business was driven by our NASD division and demand for LC and Mass Spec instrumentation and solutions, while our Small Molecule business was primarily driven by QA-QC refresh.
Chemical and energy also performed well this quarter with 23% growth.
Even after accounting for the comparison against the 10% decline last year, this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic.
This result was driven by increasing momentum in demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth.
Our view is that the chemical and energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward.
The diagnostics and clinical market grew 28% against the decline of 10% a year ago, our softest quarter last year.
We are very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth.
On a regional basis, all regions grew with China up 41% and Americas delivering 38% growth.
In the academia and government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity.
On a regional basis, Europe led the way.
The food market continued its double-digit performance growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year.
Food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity.
A developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the U.S. also contributed to growth in this market and regionally the food market was led by the Americas and Europe.
Rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth.
On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations.
The performance was broad-based across all markets.
And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year.
All three business groups grew in China during the quarter.
Pharma, chemical and energy and diagnostics were the key drivers.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L, third-quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 80 basis points from a year ago despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency.
Our strong top line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team drove the year-on-year improvement.
And our supply team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers, despite the increase in demand.
Gross margin improvement -- performance along with continued operating expense leverage resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year.
Putting it all together, we delivered earnings per share of $1.10, up 41% versus last year.
Our tax rate was 14.75% and share count was 306 million shares, as expected.
We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year while crossing the $1 billion mark in nine months.
During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million.
Year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases.
And we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.8.
Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.
We are increasing our full-year revenue projection to a range of $6.29 billion to $6.32 billion, up $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4% and core growth of 14.5% to 15%.
Included is roughly three points of impact from currency and a small amount from M&A.
In addition, we are on track to deliver roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year.
We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year.
This translates the fourth quarter revenue ranging from $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion.
This represents reported growth of 10% to 12% and core growth of 8.5% to 10% on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns.
In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high watermark in our COVID related revenue.
And as a result, we expect to see roughly a one point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter.
So, our core growth excluding COVID would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%.
We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.18 with growth of 17% to 20%.
We believe our strategy is the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results we’ve been producing without the excellent execution by the team.
With that Parmeet, back to you for Q&A.
Paul, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now?
","Agilent Technologies reported strong results in Q3, exceeding expectations with revenue of $1.59 billion (up 21% core) and earnings per share of $1.10 (up 41%). Growth was broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies. Pharma (up 27%) and chemical energy (up 23%) were particularly strong end markets. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group saw a significant increase (up 44% core) led by its NASD GMP oligo business. For the full year, Agilent raised its revenue projection to $6.29-6.32 billion (up 14.5-15% core) and increased earnings per share guidance to $4.28-4.31 (up 30-31%). Q4 revenue is expected to range from $1.63-1.66 billion (up 8.5-10% core) with earnings per share between $1.15-1.18 (up 17-20%)."
MTN_q3_2021.txt,"Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
So with that said, let's turn to our fiscal 2021 third-quarter results.
Given the continued challenging operating environment as a result of COVID-19, we are very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020, 2021 North American ski season.
Results continued to improve as the season progressed, primarily as a result of stronger destination visitation at our Colorado and Utah resorts, including improved lift ticket repurchases relative to the fiscal 2021 second-quarter results.
destination, mountain resorts and regional ski areas for the third quarter was only a down 3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Whistler Blackcomb's performance continued to be negatively impacted due to the continued closure of the Canadian border to international guests, including guests from the U.S., and was further impacted by the resort closing earlier than expected on March 30, 2021, following a provincial health order issued by the government of British Columbia.
Whistler Blackcomb's total visitation for the third quarter declined nearly 60% to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
While visitation and revenue trends improved throughout the quarter, our ancillary lines of business continue to be significantly and negatively impacted by COVID-19-related capacity constraints and limitations, particularly in food and beverage and ski school.
We maintained disciplined cost controls throughout the quarter and continue operating our ancillary lines of business at reduced capacity.
As Rob mentioned, we're very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020-2021 North American ski season.
As a reminder, in the prior year, we announced the early closure of the 2019-2020 North American ski season for our ski areas, lodging properties, and retail rental stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning on March 15, 2020.
These actions had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter of 2020.
Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limitations and restrictions on our operations continued to have an adverse impact on our results for the third fiscal quarter of 2021.
Net income attributable to Vail Resorts was $274.6 million or $6.72 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $152.5 million or $3.74 per diluted share in the prior year.
Resort reported EBITDA was $462.2 million in the third fiscal quarter, which compares to resort reported EBITDA of $304.4 million in the same period in the prior year.
ski season in the current year with particularly strong demand at our Colorado and Utah destination resorts.
Resort-reported EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 52%, exceeding both the prior-year period of 43.9% and fiscal 2019 third quarter of 50.2%.
These results reflect our rigorous approach to cost management, as well as a higher proportion of lift revenue relative to ancillary lines of business compared to prior periods.
Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2021.
Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. is expected to be between $93 million and $139 million for fiscal 2021.
We expect the resort-reported EBITDA for fiscal 2021 will be between $530 million and $570 million, and we expect the resort-reported EBITDA margin for fiscal 2021 will be approximately 28.9% using the midpoint of the guidance range.
Our guidance assumes all of our operations are open and aligned with current health and safety protocols and capacity restrictions.
Current demand trends continue.
We experienced normal weather conditions throughout the Australia's East season and North American summer season, and there is no impact from potential COVID-19-related shutdowns or lockdowns.
The guidance specifically assumes no impact from potential demand or operational disruptions associated with the current lockdowns in Victoria, Australia.
We continue to maintain significant liquidity.
Our total cash and revolver availability as of April 30, 2021, was approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of cash on hand, $419 million of U.S. revolver availability under the Vail Holdings credit agreement, and $203 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement.
As of April 30, 2021, our net debt was 2.8 times trailing 12 months total reported EBITDA.
We remain confident in the strong cash flow generation and stability of our business model, and we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital with a focus on high-return capital projects, continuous investment in our people, and strategic acquisition opportunities.
While we are not reinstating the dividend this quarter, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and our board of directors will continue to closely monitor the economic and public health outlook on a quarterly basis to assess the appropriate time to reinstate the dividend.
We're very pleased with the results for our season pass sales to date with guests showing strong enthusiasm for the enhanced value proposition of our pass products, driven in part by the 20% reduction in all pass prices for the upcoming season.
pass product sales through June 1, 2021, for the upcoming 2021-2022 North American ski season increased very significantly as compared to the sales through June 2, 2020, for the 2020-2021 North American ski season due to lack of any spring sales deadlines in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, making the year-over-year comparison to the spring 2020 results not relevant for performance trends.
Compared to sales for the 2019-2020 North American ski season through June 4, 2019, pass product sales for the 2021-2022 season to June 1, 2021, increased approximately 50% in units and 33% in sales dollars.
Pass product sales are adjusted to include Peak Resorts' pass sales in both periods and eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of $0.83 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar in both periods for Whistler Blackcomb.
As a reminder, pass product sales for the full selling season through December 6, 2020, as compared to the full selling season through December 8, 2019, increased approximately 20% in units and approximately 19% in sales dollars.
Relative to season-to-date pass sale products -- relative to season-to-date, pass product sales for the 2019-2020 season through June 4, 2019, we saw very strong unit growth with our renewing passholders and even stronger unit growth in new passholders, which includes guests in our database, the previously purchased lift tickets or passes that did not buy a pass in the previous season and guests who are completely new to our database.
We saw our strongest unit growth in our destination markets, particularly in the Northeast, and also had very strong growth across our local markets.
Compared to the period ended June 4, 2019, effective pass price decreased 10% as compared to the 20% price decrease we implemented this year.
We believe this highlights how our lower pricing has increased the propensity of passholders to spend a portion of the new discount to purchase higher-valued pass products.
We expected that the price reduction would result in higher pass renewal rates, increased trade up to higher-value passes, and drive incremental guests to our network.
We are encouraged that each of these trends is evident in the season-to-date pass sales results, which we believe supports our expected results for next year, as well as the expected long-term benefits of increasing guest lifetime value.
The pass results exceeded our original expectations to the impact of the 20% price reduction.
However, we still have the majority of our pass selling season ahead of us, and it is not yet clear if these trends will continue through the fall.
In addition, we are very pleased that ongoing sales of the Epic Australia pass, which ends on June 15, 2021, are up approximately 43% in units through June 1, 2021, as compared to the comparable period through June 4, 2019, representing significant growth following the acquisition of Falls Creek and Hotham in April 2019.
Given the recent COVID-19-related lockdowns in Victoria, Australia, we will be monitoring any impacts on the Epic Australia pass sales.
Our commitment to reinvesting in our resorts and the guest experience remains one of our highest priorities.
As previously announced this summer and fall, we will be completing several signature investments subject to regulatory approvals.
In Colorado, we are moving forward with a 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in the signature McCoy Park area of Beaver Creek, further differentiating the resort's high-end family focused experience.
We also plan to add a new four-person high-speed lift at Breckenridge to serve the popular peak 7, replace the Peru lift at Keystone with a six-person high-speed chairlift and replace the Peachtree lift at Crested Butte with a new three-person fixed-grip lift.
At Okemo, we plan to compete a transportational investment, including upgrading the Quantum lift from a four-person to a six-person high-speed chair lift and relocating the existing four-person Quantum lift to replace the Green Ridge three-person fixed-grip chairlift.
These investments will greatly improve uplift capacity, further enhance the guest experience, and complete our $35 million capital plan for the season.
We remain highly focused on investments that will further our companywide technology enhancements to support our data-driven approach, guest experience, and corporate infrastructure.
As part of these efforts, we are continuing to invest in resources and technology to improve our customer service experience, including significant staffing increases in our call centers and self-service technology that will provide our guests the ability to better manage their own accounts.
We will also continue to invest in ongoing maintenance capital to support infrastructure across our resorts.
As we head into next year, we know that talent and staffing will be critical for our success, as it always is.
And we have announced that we will be raising our minimum entry wages in Colorado, Utah, Washington, and California to $15 per hour while also making material increases in the entry wages of our Eastern resorts, which will be set based upon their local market dynamics.
This will be our largest discretionary investment in operating expense this year, which we believe will be offset by a portion of other savings we will carry from this year into next year.
I'm deeply grateful for the commitment our teams continue to demonstrate throughout these unprecedented circumstances.
","Vail Resorts experienced a successful third quarter, reporting strong visitation at its Colorado and Utah resorts. While overall destination visitation was only down 3% compared to 2019, Whistler Blackcomb faced challenges due to international travel restrictions, resulting in a 60% decline. Ancillary businesses continued to be impacted by capacity constraints, but cost controls led to a strong EBITDA margin of 52%. Despite ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, Vail Resorts remains optimistic, with projected fiscal 2021 net income ranging from $93 million to $139 million and EBITDA between $530 million and $570 million. The company is also investing in resort enhancements, technology upgrades, and employee wages, demonstrating its commitment to the guest experience and long-term success. Pass product sales for the upcoming season are significantly up compared to 2019, with strong growth in both new and renewing passholders, particularly in destination markets."
MTN_q2_2021.txt,"So with that said, let's turn to our fiscal 2021 second-quarter results.
Given the challenging operating environment as a result of COVID-19 and we are very pleased with our results to this point in the 2020-2021 ski season across our 34 North American resorts.
While our results for the second quarter continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, total visitation across our North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas were down approximately 5% compared to the same period in the prior year.
The strong visitation for the quarter highlights the underlying resiliency of our business, the loyalty of our guests and the strong appeal of skiing in guests leisure travel plan.
As we moved past the peak holiday period, which was constrained by capacity limitations driven by both COVID-19 and below average snow conditions, we saw improved results in January, particularly with lift ticket sales.
While visitation trends improved throughout the quarter, our ancillary lines of business continue to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 related capacity constraints and limitation, particularly in food and beverage and ski school.
We experienced strong results in the quarter from both our local and destination guests with local visitation up slightly compared to the same period in the prior year and destination visitation proving more stable than we expected.
destination Mountain Resorts skier visit, excluding complimentary access.
Despite the travel challenges associated with COVID-19, which compares to 57% in the same period in the prior year.
International visitation, as expected, decreased significantly due to COVID-19 related travel situation.
with destination guests, including international visitors, declining to 15% of Whistler Blackcomb visits, excluding complimentary access, which compares to 48% in the same period in the prior year.
Our season pass unit sales growth of 20% for fiscal year 2021, created a strong baseline demand heading into the season across our local and destination audience and will be one of the most important drivers of our performance and relative stability for the season.
For the fiscal 2021 second quarter, 71% of our visitation came from season pass-holders compared to 59% of visitation in the same period in the prior year.
Our growth in pass-holders this past year also positions us well as we head into the 2021/2022 season.
We remain even more committed to the benefits advanced commitment offers our company and intend to remain aggressive in providing the best value to skiers and riders who purchase in advance of the season and continuing our strategy to move lift ticket purchases into our Pass program.
We are excited to launch our 2021/2022 lineup of Epic Pass products on March 23, 2021.
We maintained disciplined cost control throughout the quarter as we operated the business at reduced capacity.
Resort reported EBITDA margin for the fiscal 2021 second quarter was 40.3% compared to the prior year period of 40.9%, while resort net revenue decreased $240.1 million over the same period.
As Rob mentioned, our results for the second quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting impacts to our North American mountain resorts.
Net income attributable to Vail Resorts was $147.8 million or $3.62 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $206.4 million or $5.04 per diluted share in the prior year.
Resort reported EBITDA was $276.1 million in the second fiscal quarter, which compares to resort reported EBITDA of $378.3 million in the same period in the prior year.
And the decrease was primarily a result of the negative impacts of COVID-19.
Turning to our season-to-date metrics for the period from the beginning of this ski season through Sunday, March 7, 2021, and for the prior year period through Sunday, March 8, 2020.
The reported ski season metrics are for our North American destination mountain resorts in the most areas and exclude the results of our Australian ski resorts in both periods.
The reported ski season metrics include growth for Season Pass revenue based on estimated fiscal year 2021 North American season pass revenue compared to fiscal year 2020 North American season pass revenue.
Fiscal year 2020 season pass revenue was adjusted to exclude the impact of the deferral in Pass product revenue as a result of pass-holder credits offered to 2019/2020 North American pass-holders.
Fiscal Year 2021 season pass revenue does not include the Pass product revenue recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as a result of unutilized pass-holder credits.
This approach results in a year-over-year comparison of season pass revenue, exclusive of the impact of discounts provided to our 2019/2020 pass-holders.
The metrics include all North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas and are adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying current period exchange rates to the prior period for Whistler Blackcomb results.
The data mentioned in this release is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter end review and adjustments.
We continue to be pleased with the positive momentum we are seeing in demand as we begin the third quarter with visitation continuing to improve throughout the North American ski season.
Season-to-date total skier visits were down 8.2% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.
Season-to-date total lift revenue, including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period, was down 8.9% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.
Season-to-date ski school revenues decreased 43.2%.
Dining revenue decreased 56.9%, and resort retail and rental revenue decreased 31.6%, all compared to the prior year season-to-date period.
Our results continued to improve in January and February as we expanded capacity with more open terrain as conditions improved and has certain COVID-19 related restrictions eased.
Additionally, as more reservations became available following the peak holiday period, we've seen a significant improvement in lift ticket purchases.
Our ski school, food and beverage and retail/rental businesses continue to be more significantly impacted than visitation due to the significant capacity and operating restrictions associated with COVID-19.
While our U.S. resorts saw a material improvements in financial performance since the peak holiday period, Whistler Blackcomb's financial performance continues to be severely impacted by the continued closure of Canadian borders to international travel, a trend that will likely continue through the rest of the season.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2021.
As we approach the end of the North American ski season, we are providing guidance for the nine-month period ending April 30, 2021.
We expect net income attributable to Vail Resorts to be between $204 million and $247 million, and Resort Reported EBITDA is expected to be between $560 million and $600 million, assuming current regulations, health and safety precautions and the levels of demand and normal conditions persist through the spring, consistent with current levels.
Given the ongoing uncertainty of COVID-19, we will not be providing full-year guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time as we continue to evaluate the potential economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 on our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter results, particularly for our three resorts in Australia and our primary summer operations in North America, which we currently anticipate fully opening around our typical opening dates with certain capacity constraints associated with COVID-19.
revolver availability under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and $179 million of revolver availability under the Whistler credit agreement.
As of January 31, 2021, our net debt was 4.2 times trailing 12 months total reported EBITDA.
As previously announced, the company raised $575 million of 0% convertible notes in December 2020, which provides added flexibility in terms of our ability to pursue high-impact acquisitions as well as reinvest in our resort portfolio.
We remain confident in the strong cash flow generation and stability of our business model, and we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital with a focus on high-return capital projects, continuous investment in our people and strategic acquisition opportunities.
While we are not reinstating the dividend this quarter, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and our Board of Directors will continue to closely monitor the economic and public health outlook on a quarterly basis to assess the appropriate time to reinstate the dividend.
Turning to our calendar year 2021 Capital plan, we remain committed to reinvesting in our resorts, creating an experience of a lifetime for our guests and generating strong returns for our shareholders.
We plan to maintain a disciplined approach to capital investments, keeping our core capital at reduced level, given the continued uncertainty due to COVID-19.
We have increased our core capital plan by approximately $5 million based on our updated outlook and now expect to invest approximately $115 million to $120 million, excluding onetime items associated with integration of $5 million and $12 million of reimbursable investments in real estate-related capital.
As previously announced, the calendar year 2021 capital plan includes several signature investments which were previously deferred from calendar year 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and are subject to regulatory approvals.
In Colorado, we are moving forward with the 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in the signature McCoy park area of Beaver Creek, further differentiating the resort's high-end family focused experience.
We also plan to add a new four-person high-speed lift at Breckenridge to serve the popular Peak 7, replace the Peru lift at Keystone with a 6-person high-speed chairlift, and replace the Peachtree lift at Crested Butte, with a new 3-person fixed-grip lift.
At Okemo, we plan to complete a transformational investment, including upgrading the Quantum lift from a four-person to a six-person high-speed chair lift and relocating the existing four-person Quantum lift to replace the Green Ridge three-person fixed-grip chairlift.
These investments will greatly improve uphill capacity, further enhance the guest experience and complete our $35 million capital plan for Triple Peaks.
We remain highly focused on investments that will further our companywide technology enhancements to support our data driven approach, guest experience and corporate infrastructure.
As part of these efforts, we are continuing to invest in resources and technology to improve our customer service experience including significant staffing increases in our call centers and self-service technology that will provide our guests the ability to better manage their own accounts.
We will also continue to invest in ongoing maintenance capital to support our infrastructure across our resorts, including onetime items associated with integrations of $5 million and $12 million of reimbursable investments in real estate related capital we expect our total capital plan to be approximately $135 million to $140 million.
We have had stronger-than-expected financial results, and our employees have been a primary reason for this success.
I'm deeply grateful for the commitment our teams have demonstrated day in and day out to navigate a truly unusual season.
","Despite COVID-19 challenges, Vail Resorts saw strong visitation for the quarter, with a 5% decline from last year. Season pass unit sales increased by 20%, resulting in a solid demand baseline. However, ancillary services like food and beverage and ski school remain impacted by capacity constraints. Resort EBITDA margin stood at 40.3% compared to 40.9% last year. Net income reached $147.8 million, down from $206.4 million, due to a $240.1 million decrease in revenue. Season-to-date skier visits and lift revenue decreased by 8.2% and 8.9%, respectively. Ski school, dining, and retail/rental revenue suffered due to COVID-19 restrictions. Vail anticipates fiscal 2021 net income between $204 million and $247 million and resort reported EBITDA between $560 million and $600 million for the nine months ending April 30, 2021.

PPG_q4_2021.txt,"Once again, this is John Bruno.
Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, chairman and chief executive officer; and Vince Morales, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. markets closed on Thursday, January 20, 2022.
Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.
Now, let me introduce PPG chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening.
For the fourth quarter, we achieved record net sales of about $4.2 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for $1.26.
To quickly summarize that quarter, we had favorable sales versus our forecast that incurred significant manufacturing challenges due to COVID-related staffing shortages, intermittent customer order patterns, and raw material supply challenges.
Our adjusted earnings were aided by a lower-than-expected tax rate in the fourth quarter, as we recognized more favorable discrete items.
Excluding the favorable impact from the tax rate, our adjusted earnings per share was about 10% below the financial guidance we've provided in October.
Our sales performance for the fourth quarter was solid as we achieved higher than sales in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected automotive OEM global production, higher selling price realization, and strong above-market sales volumes and several of our end-use markets.
Overall demand remains robust.
Our PPG-Comex business delivered yet again another excellent quarter and finished with 10% organic sales growth for the full year of 2021.
This business had record sales and earnings growth for 2021 and continued to expand its concessionaire network.
And in January, we will have 5,000 concessionaire locations in our network.
And we recently added our traffic solutions products to its portfolio.
The protective and marine business continued its trend of strong top line results, this time led by improvements in the marine coatings where industry builds are expected to grow for the next several years.
We also continue to grow our share in automotive refinish, where our full suite of advantaged products and services differentiate PPG from our competition.
And in automotive OEM, we were awarded new 2022 business based upon our expanded mobility product offering.
And finally, we realized higher increased selling prices globally.
Lastly, the recently acquired Tikkurila business delivered record sales and earnings for any fourth quarter despite the difficult operating environment.
As I mentioned, overall sales would have been better, but we experienced continuing supply chain disruptions and a significant increase in COVID cases that hampered our ability to fully and consistently operate and prevented us from fully meeting our strong customer order books.
Recently, some of our manufacturing facilities have had up to 40% of their workforce out.
In several businesses, we continue to face certain raw material shortages with the biggest impacts in U.S. architectural coatings and traffic solutions.
Overall, our sales backlog grew, and in total, was about $150 million exiting the quarter, most notably in our aerospace and automotive refinish and general industrial businesses.
Our segment earnings did not meet our expectations.
While we benefited from higher sales and increased selling prices, it was not sufficient to offset significant inflation, supply disruptions, and operational inefficiencies caused by the rapid increase in COVID cases within our employee base, and those of our customers and suppliers.
Raw material cost inflation was up approximately 30% compared to prior year.
And transportation costs spiked due to shortages of available trucks and drivers.
In addition, operating costs were progressively higher during the quarter due to manufacturing interruptions at both our facilities and our customers' operations stemming from COVID.
These increased operating costs impacted the quarter by $0.20 per share, and COVID-related absenteeism has continued in January.
Once we see some normalization, we are confident that we will quickly be able to return our legacy of strong manufacturing performance.
We've been taking actions to further diversify our supplier base and increase our internal resin manufacturing capability.
PPG has in-house large-scale resin manufacturing in each major region.
And we are expanding our capability in 2022 to mitigate future risks.
As one example, PPG-Comex sources a high percentage of its residents internally, which has resulted in minimal disruptions.
In addition to the historically high level of commodity raw material prices, we're also experiencing rising costs in other areas, such as labor and utilities.
We expect to continue to proactively work with our customers to implement additional selling price increases in the first quarter.
In aggregate, our selling price realization in the fourth quarter was about 8%, with a higher price realization in our industrial reporting segment.
Our price capture remains broad, with good traction in all businesses and all regions.
And the pace of price -- excuse me, the pace of price capture is much faster than the pace of prior inflationary cycles.
Reflecting back to 2021, we achieved all-time record sales of $16.8 billion led by strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth of 10% despite the various ongoing supply chain challenges we incurred.
In addition, we delivered record earnings per share growth of more than 10% even with raw material cost inflation of about 20% for the full year, the highest level of coatings industry inflation in recent memory.
We, once again, lowered our SG&A as a percentage of sales, decreasing by about 200 basis points, aided by delivering $135 million in restructuring savings in 2021.
We also advanced our digital capabilities in many businesses, most notably the architectural coatings business or sales transaction on a digital platform increased by 20% compared to 2020, as we see our customers' digital patterns become more ingrained.
In 2021, we had strong accretive cash deployment, including the funding of our acquisitions, share repurchases made in the fourth quarter, and increase in our quarterly dividend for the 50th consecutive year.
We're among a small number of companies that have achieved this milestone, along with even fewer companies paying a dividend for more than 120 consecutive years.
Our working capital as a percent of sales remain at historically low levels and comparable to last year, even though we purchased more raw material than typical in the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have lowered our net debt by about $350 million since funding Tikkurila in June and exited 2021 with a strong balance sheet and optionality for future accretive cash deployment.
Throughout 2021, we took actions to bolster our ESG program.
As an example, in the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our overall ESG corporate governance structure.
We define accountability and oversight for all major elements of our ESG efforts under respective board committees.
We also redefined and renamed our Technology and Environmental Committee to the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, with a key focus on tracking our sustainability progress and defining climate-related risks and opportunities.
Looking ahead, demand continues to be robust in most of our end-use markets.
Tightened supply and COVID-related disruptions evidenced in the fourth quarter are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2022 impacting our ability to manufacture and deliver product.
We expect economic activity to be soft in China during the first quarter as more severe operating restrictions have recently been imposed due to COVID and during the Winter Olympics.
We anticipate more favorable economic conditions in the second quarter.
We plan to implement further selling price increases in all our businesses as raw materials and other cost inflation remain at elevated levels and are increasing further in certain areas.
We will continue to aggressively manage all aspects of our cost structure and are managing to minimize the cost impacts of the current supply challenge.
The first quarter earnings per share guidance that we provided has a wider range than normal.
As is typical, the month of March will be the largest component to our quarterly sales.
Our current visibility to the second half of the quarter is limited due to uncertainties around the supply chain disruptions and the various impacts of omicron globally.
While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I expect that as 2020 progresses, we will start to experience more economic reopenings and an easing of supply chain problems, general inventory rebuilding across many end-use markets, and a healthy consumer willing to spend.
I remain very optimistic about future earnings capability of our company and see many catalysts to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed them.
This includes: first, continued recovery in the automotive refinish, OEM, and aerospace coatings businesses, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales and where we have broad global businesses supported by advantaged technologies.
The volume for these businesses remain about 15% below pre-pandemic levels.
And we are already experiencing improving order flow that is being crimped by supply availability; second, normalization of commodity raw material costs, which should moderate over time as supply dislocations improve; third, higher operating leverage on sales volumes supported by our lower cost structure; fourth, year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 and 2023 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions, including a 15% increase to our original synergy target; and finally, above market organic growth driven by our advantaged and leading brands, technology, and services.
This initiative strongly supports our asset-light strategy by adding more than 2,000 distribution locations.
Together with The Home Depot, we are positioned to outgrow the pro market in the U.S. Considering all of these catalysts, I believe we have a path to at least $9 of earnings per share in 2023.
Every day, their hard work and commitment to delivering on our company's purpose to protect and beautify the world are reasons why we are well-positioned today and in the future.
","PPG reported record Q4 sales of $4.2 billion, surpassing forecasts. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.26, impacted by lower-than-expected tax rates. Despite high sales, earnings missed guidance due to significant inflation (30% raw material cost increase), supply disruptions, and operational inefficiencies from COVID-related absenteeism (up to 40% in some facilities). The company experienced strong growth in PPG-Comex, protective and marine coatings, and automotive refinish. The acquired Tikkurila business also delivered record results. Challenges remain with supply chain disruptions, COVID-related absenteeism, and elevated costs (raw materials, labor, utilities), which are expected to continue into Q1. PPG plans to implement additional price increases to offset inflation. Despite these challenges, demand remains robust, and the company expects a gradual easing of supply chain issues and economic recovery in the second half of 2022. Catalysts for future earnings growth include recovery in automotive-related businesses, cost normalization, synergy capture from acquisitions, and organic growth. PPG aims for $9 per share earnings by 2023."
MAN_q4_2020.txt,"We'll start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter.
Then Jack will go through the operating results in the segments, our balance sheet and cash flow and guidance for the first quarter.
I will then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session.
But before we proceed, Jack will now cover the safe harbor language.
These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs.
During our earnings call in October, we talked about signs of recovery in the third quarter.
Pleased to say we saw this trend of slow and steady recovery continuing into the fourth quarter.
Despite experiencing a series of new COVID-19-related restrictions around the world, our results reflect a stronger market environment than we had anticipated with revenue growth and new opportunities in select markets.
We're now seeing clear signs of a case shaped to speed recovery.
The bifurcation is evident between industries able to adjust to the uncertain environment than others like travel, hospitality and entertainment industries being significantly impacted by the lockdowns.
This is also reflected in the labor market divide where demand for workers has improved in some industries and in others remain stalled with high unemployment rates.
Organizations investing in digitization and automation are already emerging stronger.
And that is driving an acceleration in the polarization of the workforce between the skilled and the unskilled, creating a risk of continued post-pandemic skills-based polarization of labor markets in many countries.
This is also captured in our recent Skills Revolution thought leadership series, Renew, Reskill and Redeploy, conducted across 26,000 employers in 40-plus countries.
Those companies that plan to speed up the digitization plans as a result of the pandemic are maintaining or increasing their headcount in contrast to others who've put their plans on hold.
Many of the trends we've been predicting have accelerated significantly.
Adversity can often be a force for society to change at an accelerated pace.
Companies have digitized better speed and scale they could never have imagined and we expect these actions will continue into 2021.
With that context, I would now like to turn to our financial results.
In the fourth quarter, revenue was $5.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year in constant currency, a significant improvement from the 14% decline in the third quarter on the same basis.
On a reported basis, we recorded an operating profit for the quarter of $138 million.
Excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was $151 million, down 24% in constant currency.
Reported operating profit margin was 2.7%, down 100 basis points from the prior year.
And after excluding restructuring, operating profit margin was 3%, down 70 basis points from the prior year.
Reported earnings per diluted share of $1.33 reflects the impact of restructuring charges.
Excluding the restructuring charges, our earnings per diluted share was $1.48 for the quarter, representing a decrease of 39% in constant currency.
Turning to the full year results for a moment.
Reported earnings per share for the year was $0.41.
Excluding restructuring charges and special items, earnings per share was $3.67 and represented a constant currency decrease of 53% year-over-year.
Revenues for the year decreased 14% in constant currency to $18 billion and reported operating profit was $188 million.
Excluding restructuring and special items, operating profit was $377 million, which represented a 48% constant currency decline year-over-year.
Although 2020 was one of the most challenging years in recent history, we were able to reduce operational SG&A to significantly offset gross profit declines while remaining committed to our strategic investments for digitization, diversification and innovation.
In our Manpower business, logistics demand was strong in the fourth quarter driven by the shift in how consumers are buying and an extended holiday delivery peak.
While we are seeing increases -- increasing cases of COVID-19 in several places, we're also seeing strong safety protocols, increased testing advanced by technology, allowing companies to avoid full shutdowns, manage plant productivity by segregating production lines, all reducing the infection risks and ensuring a safe work environment.
In Experis, our IT and resourcing and solutions business, we're seeing positive trends in many industries.
And there continues to be good demand for a range of IT skills in a number of markets.
Many organizations that put investments on hold or made cuts in 2020 are beginning to rebuild and reinvest.
Others are seeking the offerings of our Talent Solutions business as they look to optimize their supplier management and delivery solutions and shift more to full-service HR providers with the tools and tech across markets to build just-in-case resilience and flexibility.
Going back to the quarterly results on slide three, revenues in the fourth quarter came in above our constant currency guidance range.
Our gross profit margin came in at the low end of our guidance range.
On a reported basis, our operating profit was $138 million.
Excluding restructuring charges, our operating profit was $151 million, representing a decline of 21% or a decline of 24% on a constant currency basis.
This resulted in an operating profit margin of 3% before restructuring charges, which was above the high end of our guidance.
Breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail.
After adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 4%, our constant currency revenue declined about 6.5%, which rounds to 6% on a single-digit percentage basis.
As acquisition and billing days had no net effects, the organic days adjusted revenue decline was also about 6.5%.
This represented an improvement from the third quarter revenue decline of 15% on a similar basis and two consecutive quarters of significant improvement from the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to the earnings per share bridge on slide five.
On a reported basis, earnings per share was $1.33, which included the restructuring charges of $12 million, which, including related tax impacts, represented a negative $0.15.
Excluding the restructuring charges, earnings per share was $1.48, which exceeded our guidance range.
Included within this result was improved operational performance of $0.38; better-than-expected foreign currency exchange rates, which added $0.03; a lower weighted average share count from share repurchases that added $0.02, offset by higher other expenses that had a negative impact of $0.05.
Looking at our gross profit margin in detail.
Our gross margin came in at 15.8%.
Underlying staffing margin contributed to a 40 basis points reduction.
The anniversary of the incremental fee-owned subsidies in France in October and the mix of higher seasonal year-end enterprise activity within the Manpower brand drove the overall additional year-over-year staffing margin decline from the third quarter result of down 20 basis points year-over-year.
A lower contribution from permanent recruitment also contributed 30 basis points of GP margin reduction.
10 basis points of increased gross profit margin from career transition growth within Right Management was offset by a 10 basis point decline driven by a higher mix of seasonal other nonstaffing activity.
Next, let's review our gross profit by business line.
During the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 65% of gross profit, our Experis Professional business comprised 20% and Talent Solutions brand comprised 15%.
During the quarter, our Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit decrease of 11%.
This was an improvement from the 17% decline in the third quarter.
Gross profit in our Experis brand declined 14% year-over-year during the quarter on an organic constant currency basis, which represented an improvement from the 19% decline in the third quarter.
The lower contribution from perm gross profit drove a more significant gross profit decline compared to the revenue decline in Experis.
Talent Solutions includes our global market-leading RPO, MSP and Right Management offerings.
Organic gross profit crossed back over to growth in the quarter at 1% in constant currency year-over-year, which is an improvement from the 2% decline in the third quarter.
This was primarily driven by our MSP business, which had a very strong fourth quarter with double-digit GP growth and increased year-over-year career transition activity within our Right Management business.
Our RPO business experienced a significant improvement in the rate of decline during the fourth quarter from the third quarter, reaching single-digit percentage declines in the fourth quarter.
Our reported SG&A expense in the quarter was $661 million, including the restructuring charges of $12 million.
Excluding the restructuring charges, SG&A of $649 million represented a decrease of $19 million from the prior year.
This underlying decrease was driven by $40 million of operational cost reductions, a decrease of $2 million from net dispositions, partially offset by an increase of $22 million from currency changes.
On an organic constant currency basis, excluding restructuring, SG&A expenses decreased 6% year-over-year, which represented a very strong recovery against the 10% gross profit decline.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue continued to improve sequentially and represented 12.8% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring.
The Americas segment comprised 20% of consolidated revenue.
Revenue in the quarter was $1 billion, a decrease of 3% in constant currency.
OUP was $48 million and OUP margin was 4.7%.
The U.S. is the largest country in the Americas segment, comprising 61% of segment revenues.
Revenues in the U.S. was $622 million, representing a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year.
Adjusting for franchise acquisitions, this represented a 5% decrease, which is a significant improvement from the 16% decline in the third quarter.
During the quarter, OUP for our U.S. business decreased 11% to $30 million.
OUP margin was 4.8%.
The U.S. continued to benefit from higher-margin career transition activity within Right Management year-over-year but at a reduced level from the third quarter.
Within the U.S., the Manpower brand comprised 36% of gross profit during the quarter.
Revenue for the Manpower brand in the U.S. was down 2% when adjusted for days and franchise acquisitions, which reflects a material improvement from the 21% decline in the third quarter.
We expect the Manpower business to cross over to growth on a quarterly basis in Q1.
The Experis brand in the U.S. comprised 27% of gross profit in the quarter.
Within Experis in the U.S., IT skills comprised approximately 80% of revenues.
Revenues within our IT vertical within Experis U.S. declined 13% during the quarter and total Experis U.S. revenues declined 14% as the finance and engineering verticals experienced greater decreases.
This trend reflects a slight improvement from the third quarter year-over-year rate of revenue decline.
Talent Solutions in the U.S. contributed 37% of gross profit and experienced revenue growth of 6% in the quarter.
Within Right Management in the U.S., revenues increased 8% year-over-year driven by career transition activity during the quarter.
MSP business continues to perform very well in the current environment and again experienced year-over-year increased revenues during the fourth quarter.
The U.S. RPO business crossed back over to revenue growth during the fourth quarter, moving to a low double-digit revenue increase driven by RPO client wins as well as additional projects during the fourth quarter.
Provided there are no significant business restrictions impacting our clients across the U.S., in the first quarter, we expect ongoing improvement in an overall rate of decline in the very low single digits for the quarter overall.
Our Mexico operation experienced a revenue decline of 6% in constant currency in the quarter, representing an improvement from the 9% decline in the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, the President of Mexico introduced the labor proposal that would prohibit certain types of temporary staffing outside of specialized services.
If enacted, we expect this could significantly restrict our activity in Mexico.
The bill is still under development in the Mexican legislator and could be finalized in March or April.
We will provide an update during the first quarter earnings call, at which time we expect to have greater clarity on the likelihood of adoption and the specific restrictions as they would apply to us.
Mexico represented between 2.5% and 3% of our global revenues in 2020.
Revenue in Canada declined 10% in constant currency during the quarter.
This represented a slight improvement from the third quarter billing days adjusted revenue decline of 11%.
Revenue in the other countries within Americas crossed back over to growth with a 4% increase in constant currency, reflecting a significant improvement from the 6% decline in the third quarter.
This was driven by significant revenue growth in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
Southern Europe revenue comprised 46% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.
Revenue in Southern Europe came in at $2.3 billion, a decrease of 7% in constant currency.
This is a significant improvement from the third quarter trend driven by France, Italy and Spain.
OUP, including restructuring costs, equaled $100 million.
Excluding restructuring costs, OUP decreased 25% from the prior year in constant currency and OUP margin was down 100 basis points.
The $4 million in restructuring costs represented France real estate optimization.
France revenue comprised 56% of the Southern Europe segment in the quarter and was down 11% from the prior year in constant currency.
This reflects a steady rate of improvement over the course of the quarter.
OUP, including restructuring costs, was $62 million in the quarter.
Excluding restructuring costs, OUP was $66 million and OUP margin was 5%.
Although improvement was steady in France during the fourth quarter, January has experienced a softening in the revenue trend as COVID-19 concerns have increased and the government has imposed more restrictions.
We are cautiously estimating ongoing sequential improvement in the revenue trend and are estimating a constant currency decline in revenues in the mid-single-digit percentage range in the first quarter overall.
Revenue in Italy equaled $423 million in the quarter as Italy crossed back over to growth.
Revenues increased 3% in constant currency during the quarter, which was a significant improvement from the 12% days-adjusted decline in the third quarter.
This reflects a progressive improvement over the course of the quarter and a particularly strong December driven by large year-end seasonal logistics activity from enterprise clients.
OUP declined 25% year-over-year in constant currency to $24 million and OUP margin decreased 200 basis points to 5.6%.
We estimate that Italy will have low single-digit year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter.
Revenue in Spain also crossed over to significant revenue growth in the fourth quarter also driven by enterprise seasonal activity.
Revenue increased 18% on a days-adjusted constant currency basis from the prior year in the quarter.
This represented a significant improvement from the 6% decrease in the third quarter.
Considering the drop-off of the year-end seasonal activity, we estimate that Spain will have revenue growth in the mid-single-digit constant currency range in the first quarter.
Revenue in Switzerland decreased 14% on a days-adjusted constant currency basis from the prior year in the quarter.
This represents a slight decline from the 13% decrease in the third quarter as our Switzerland business did not experience the year-end seasonal increases that the other large markets in Southern Europe experienced.
Our Northern Europe segment comprised 22% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.
Revenue declined 11% in constant currency to $1.1 billion, representing a significant improvement from the 22% decline in the third quarter driven by the U.K. and the Netherlands.
OUP, including restructuring costs, represented $9 million.
Excluding restructuring costs, OUP was $18 million and OUP margin was 1.6%.
The $9 million in restructuring cost relates to Germany, where we restructured a majority-owned venture with a third-party partner.
Our largest market in Northern Europe segment is the U.K., which represented 36% of segment revenue in the quarter.
During the quarter, U.K. revenues decreased 7% in constant currency, which represented a significant improvement from the 22% decline in the third quarter.
The improvement was driven by significant year-end public sector activity particularly in December.
We are cautious in our outlook for the U.K. business and estimate a rate of constant currency revenue decline in the high single digits range during the first quarter, representing the nonrecurrence of certain year-end activity.
In Germany, revenues declined 31% in constant currency adjusted for billing days in the fourth quarter, which did not represent a significant change from the 32% decline in the third quarter.
We remain very cautious on our Germany business in the near term and expect improvement in the revenue trend in the first quarter.
In the Nordics, revenues declined 6% on a days-adjusted constant currency basis.
The two primary businesses in Nordics are Norway and Sweden.
On a days-adjusted constant currency basis, Norway experienced a decline of 6% and Sweden declined 4%.
Both countries experienced a significant improvement in the rate of decline from the third quarter trend.
Revenues in the Netherlands decreased 12% on a days-adjusted constant currency basis, which represents a significant improvement from the third quarter decline of 23%.
Belgium experienced a days-adjusted revenue decline of 25% in constant currency during the quarter, which also reflects improvement from the third quarter trend.
Other markets in Northern Europe crossed over to growth in the quarter.
Revenue increased 9% in constant currency, which represents a significant improvement from the third quarter decrease of 5% in constant currency.
This was driven by strong revenue growth in Poland, Russia and Ireland.
The Asia Pacific Middle East segment comprises 12% of total company revenue.
In the quarter, revenue decreased 1% in constant currency to $617 million.
OUP represented $18 million and OUP margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year.
Revenue growth in Japan was up 5% on a constant currency basis, which represents a slight decrease from the 6% growth rate in the third quarter.
Our Japan business continues to perform very well.
And we expect the constant currency revenue trend of low single-digit growth in the first quarter.
Revenues in Australia declined 2% in constant currency on a days-adjusted basis.
This represents an improvement from the 7% decline in the third quarter.
Revenue in other markets in Asia Pacific Middle East declined 7% in constant currency, also representing an improving trend from the third quarter.
I'll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet.
Free cash flow equaled $886 million for the year.
During the fourth quarter, free cash flow equaled $201 million compared to $302 million in the prior year quarter.
At quarter end, days sales outstanding decreased by about 3.5 days to 54 days.
Our businesses have displayed outstanding collection and cash management practices throughout this crisis.
Capital expenditures represented $51 million during 2020.
During the fourth quarter, we purchased 2.5 million shares of stock for $201 million.
Our purchases for the full year totaled 3.4 million shares for $265 million.
As of December 31, we have 3.4 million shares remaining for repurchase under the six million share program approved in August of 2019.
As previously announced, we also increased the semiannual dividend paid in December 2020 by 7.3%.
Our balance sheet was strong at quarter end with cash of $1.57 billion and total debt of $1.12 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $443 million.
Our debt ratios remain comfortable at quarter end, with total gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of 2.48 and total debt to total capitalization at 31%.
Our debt and credit facilities have not changed in the quarter and the earliest euro note maturity is not until September of 2022.
In addition, our revolving credit facility for $600 million remained unused.
Next, I'll review our outlook for the first quarter of 2021.
Our guidance continues to assume no material additional lockdowns or business restrictions impacting our clients in any of our largest markets beyond those that exist today.
On that basis, we are cautiously forecasting earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.72, which includes a favorable impact from foreign currency of $0.07 per share.
Our constant currency revenue guidance range is between a decline of 4% to a decline of 6%.
The midpoint of our constant currency guidance is a decline of 5%.
On a days-adjusted basis, we note there is about one less billing day in Q1, which would improve the days-adjusted rate of revenue decline.
This is offset slightly by the impact of net dispositions.
At the midpoint, this would yield an organic days-adjusted rate of revenue decline of 3% for the first quarter, representing an ongoing improvement from the 6.5% decline in Q4.
We expect our operating profit margin during the first quarter to be down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting a third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the year-over-year rate of adjusted operating margin decline.
This reflects continued strong underlying cost actions within the businesses and higher corporate expenses year-over-year based on increased technology investment.
Regarding the effective tax rate, the government of France finalized their budget with the expected 50% reduction in the French business tax and a continuation of the corporate income tax reductions.
Combined, this serves to reduce our underlying effective tax rate by about 4%.
However, we will continue to have an elevated tax rate until we are closer to precrisis levels of pre-tax earnings and are estimating a full year 2021 effective tax rate of approximately 35%.
The effective tax rate in the first quarter will be slightly lower at 34% based on the inclusion of certain discrete items.
As usual, our guidance does not incorporate restructuring charges or additional share repurchases.
And we estimate our weighted average shares to be 56.2 million.
We're well positioned to be able to provide the strategic and operational workforce expertise and flexibility our clients and candidates are looking for: sourcing and developing in-demand talent across the globe and delivering new work models across the HR solution spectrum.
We strengthened our brand portfolio during 2020 and launched Talent Solutions as a separate brand to include our RPO, MSP and Right Management offerings.
This accelerates our diversification strategy by focusing on higher-margin, high-growth market segments in all brands.
We also remain laser-focused on delivering our digitization plans with our PowerSuite technology and continued this investment even during the pandemic.
We have already implemented PowerSuite in our front office and in businesses across 17 countries, are in the process of implementation in another wave of businesses across 17 more countries.
Based on this progress, we expect to have the majority of our businesses on our New PowerSuite front office by the end of this year.
Our PowerSuite front office is improving efficiency and productivity enabled by technology by cloud, mobile and analytics.
We also continue to roll out our new web platform for candidates.
Our B2C digital investments build off the success of Mon Manpower, our French associate app, which has had more than 1.3 million downloads, the most downloaded and the most highly rated in the French market.
In France, 1/3 of our applicants are sourced via the app with an average of 150,000 active users a month enjoying a full portfolio of B2C services, including on-demand access to current targeted assignment opportunities, time management and payroll technology and other services, including online carpooling.
The success of this market-leading tool is helping us to scale and expand our B2C technology elsewhere as well.
We continue to invest in and advance our analytics capability, laying strong foundations for the creation of our data lake.
It will be our data science and database decision-making that will continue to create new value, helping clients better predict performance and supporting candidates so they know more about their skills and potential.
These, together with our investments in next-gen infrastructure programs, will continue to be critical enablers for the next step of our process transformation and growth.
And what we knew all along has been confirmed as well.
It is the combination of tech and our people-first approach, the talent, the skills and dedication of our teams with last-mile delivery capability that allows us to confidently manage uncertainty, volatility and collaborate remotely to deliver the solutions and talent organizations need while being more agile than we ever believe possible.
As we execute our strategic priorities, we remain committed to our values and broader purpose that meaningful, sustainable employment has the power to change the world.
As a member of the International Business Council, we have committed to the IBC's new stakeholder capitalism metrics developed by the Big four global accounting firms, focused on people, planet, prosperity and governance.
This important framework will enable our organization and others to be more explicit on our commitments and progress we're making to create long-term value to shareholders and operate a sustainable business model that addresses the long-term imperatives of society.
Our social impact report that we released in December is the demonstration of the critical role we already play in being part of the solution.
Case in point, in 2020, we were recognized as a catalyst for change among 70-plus companies, outpacing our global peers and advancing women, particularly women of color, along with being placed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 12th year, helping people and companies respond and reset, redeploy and reskill.
And this skills revolution remains the defining challenge of our time.
And it is what our clients, candidates and employees expect us to help them with today and even more so in the future.
Finally, I'm very proud and grateful for the relentless resilience and commitment of our people to support and deliver to each of our stakeholders during these challenging times, our employees, associates, clients, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.
As digitization continues at pace, we're confident that our strategy is even more relevant as structural changes take hold in a post-pandemic world and as we continue to execute our strategy to diversify, digitize and innovate.
It is positioning ManpowerGroup for greater success, improved returns and profitable growth in the future.
I'd now like to open the call for Q&A.
","In the fourth quarter of 2020, ManpowerGroup reported a revenue of $5.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year but indicating a steady recovery trend from the 14% decline in the third quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was $151 million, a 24% decrease on a constant currency basis. Earnings per diluted share were $1.48, excluding restructuring charges, reflecting a 39% decrease in constant currency. For the full year, reported earnings per share were $0.41, while excluding restructuring charges and special items, earnings per share were $3.67, representing a 53% constant currency decline. Despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the company remained committed to its digitization, diversification, and innovation strategy, reducing operational SG&A expenses to offset gross profit declines. ManpowerGroup's Talent Solutions business line experienced positive trends, particularly in RPO and MSP services, with organic gross profit growth in the quarter. The company anticipates continued improvement in rate of revenue decline to the very low single digits for the first quarter of 2021, with ongoing improvement in operating profit margins."
CHE_q3_2021.txt,"Before we begin, let me remind you that the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
Kevin McNamara, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed Corporation; Dave Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chemed; and Nick Westfall President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed's VITAS Healthcare Corporation subsidiary.
Sherri is retiring at the end of the year, and this is her last introduction to our quarterly conference call.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter.
And David and Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.
Our third quarter 2021 operating results released last night, reflect very solid performance for both VITAS and Roto-Rooter.
On a go-forward basis, I would like to share with you some of the macro issues we are dealing with as we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic.
For VITAS, the most important issue, we are managing labor.
Staffing of license professionals has been exceptionally challenging to ensure adequate mix of license healthcare workers on a market by market basis.
This is particularly challenging during the pandemic, as we deal with dynamic fluctuations in patient census in every market.
Turnover within our license staff remains above our pre-pandemic rates, but we are seeing indications of normalization, as we continue to expand our hiring and retention initiatives in many markets.
Beyond managing our staffing levels, we are observing increasing pressure on salaries and wages.
To date, we've managed these pressures with increased paid time off or PTO, we view it as inevitable that healthcare wages will increase if we continue to have a nationwide systemic imbalance in supply and demand for license healthcare professionals.
Fortunately, for VITAS and the hospice industry, there is a natural hedge against the inflationary pressures on costs, specifically labor.
The annual increase in the Medicare and Medicaid hospice reimbursement rates is based primarily on inflation in the hospital wage index basket, as measured by the federal government's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Typically, the annual inflation measured as of March 31 is used to determine the following October 1 reimbursement increase.
This should give the hospice industry reasonable stability in operating margins in an inflationary environment, albeit with a six month lag from the inflation measurement to the actual reimbursement increase.
The second critical challenge for VITAS is the continued disruption to senior housing occupancy and the latest hospice referrals.
A recent admission data suggests senior housing is in the process of recovery pre-pandemic nursing home base patients represented 18% of our total average daily census or ADC.
The nursing of ADC ratio hit a low of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021 nursing home base patients increased 60 basis points to 14.9%.
And then, the third quarter of 2021, our nursing home patients represented 15.6% of our total ABC.
Our updated 2021 guidance anticipates sequential improvement in senior housing base patients in the fourth quarter of 2021 with acceleration in senior housing admissions anticipated in 2022.
For Roto Rooter, our must significant challenge has been to increase manpower.
We've expanded technician manpower by 8% in 2021.
However, based on our current demand levels, we continue to remain understaffed in many of our markets.
Technician compensation plays a role in recruiting new employees as well as retention of our existing employee base.
Our average 2021 technician and field sales force compensation is over $81,000 per year.
Most of our technicians are paid out on a commission basis of revenue generated.
As a result, pricing for our services is a critical component in increasing technician wages.
We're anticipating passing to inflationary price increases in all our markets in the fourth quarter of this year.
Demand for plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, and water restoration services remain at record levels.
I want to give additional color on the depth and breadth of this increase in demand.
Let's compare Q3 2021 revenue to Q3 2019.
Excluding the HSW acquisition, which was completed in September 2019, under this unit for unit comparison, residential services have experienced incredible growth.
In aggregate, residential branch revenue increased 46.2% over this two-year period.
On a service segment basis, residential plumbing revenue increased 37.1%; drain cleaning expanded 36%; excavation increased 65.6%; and water restoration increased 48.1%.
Commercial demand has been more challenging, however, commercial revenue has experienced a significant recovery since the 40% decline in commercial demand noted in April 2020.
Overall, commercial revenue declined 3.1% over this 2-year period.
On an individual service segment basis, commercial plumbing service declined 4.9%, drain cleaning expanded 1.8% excavation declined 10.2%, and water restoration increased 7%.
We anticipate continued strengthening in commercial demand in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as throughout 2022.
Over the past 20 years, the country has faced 9/11, the Great Recession, and now a global pandemic.
In each of these crises, Roto-Rooter remained operating and materially increased market share revenue and operating margin.
Just as important, post-crisis, Roto-Rooter held on to these increases in revenue market share and margins.
Roto-Rooter is well positioned postpaid pandemic, and we anticipate continued expansion of market share, by pressing our core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time, 24-7 call centers and Internet presence.
With that, I would like to turn the teleconference over to David.
VITAS's net revenue was $317 million in the third quarter of 2021, which is a decline of 5.8% when compared to the prior year period.
This revenue decline is comprised primarily of a 5.3% decline in days of care, partially offset by a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase, including the suspension of sequestration of approximately 1.2%.
Our acuity mix shift had a net impact of reducing revenue approximately $3 million or nine-tenths of 1% in the quarter, when compared to the prior-year revenue and level of care mix.
The combination of Medicare Cap and other contra-revenue changes, negatively impacted revenue growth, an additional 80 basis points.
VITAS accrued $100,000 in Medicare Cap billing limitations in the quarter.
This compares to $4.1 million reversal of Medicare Cap billing limitations in the third quarter of 2020.
Of our 30 Medicare provider numbers, 27 of these provider numbers currently have a Medicare Cap cushion of 10% or greater.
One provider number has a cap cushion between 0% and 5%.
And two of our provider numbers have a fiscal 2021 Medicare Cap billing limitation liability.
Roto-Rooter, generated quarterly revenue of $221 million in the third quarter of 2021, which is an increase of $30.1 million or 15.7% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Roto-Rooter's branch residential revenue in the quarter totaled $151 million, which is an increase of $22.2 million or 17.2% over our prior year period.
This aggregate residential revenue growth consisted of drain cleaning, increasing 11.7%, plumbing expanding 17.4%, excavation increasing 14.1%, and water restoration increasing 28%.
Roto-Rooter branch commercial revenue in the quarter totaled $52.3 million, which is an increase of $4.7 million or 10% over the prior year.
The aggregate commercial revenue growth consisted of drain cleaning increasing 17.6%, plumbing increasing 9.3%, and commercial excavation declining 1.3%.
Water restoration also increased 9.4%.
Now, let's turn to Chemed on a consolidated basis.
During the quarter, we repurchased 350,000 shares of Chemed stock for $164 million, which equates to a cost per share of $467.80.
As of September 30 of 2021, there is approximately $148 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under this plan.
Chemed restarted its share repurchase program in 2007.
Since that time, Chemed has repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares, aggregating approximately $1.7 billion, at an average share cost of $113.04.
Including dividends over the same period, Chemed has returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders.
We have updated our full-year 2021 guidance as follows: VITAS was 2021 revenue, prior to Medicare Cap, is estimated to decline approximately 5% when compared to the prior year period.
Average daily census in 2021, is estimated to decline 5.5%.
In our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin, prior to Medicare Cap, is estimated to be 18.8%.
We're currently estimating $6.6 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations release calendar year 2021.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve full-year 2021 revenue growth of 17.3%.
Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 is estimated to be between 28.5% and 29%.
Based on the above full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock option exercises, cost related to litigation and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of $19 to $19.20.
This compares to our initial 2021 adjusted earnings guidance per diluted share of $17 in $17.50.
This revised 2021 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate on adjusted earnings of 25.1%.
This compares to Chemed's 2020 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $18.8.
In the third quarter, our average daily census was 18,034 patients, a decline of 5% over the prior year and 0.2% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2021.
This year-over-year decline in average daily census is a direct result of pandemic related disruptions across the entire healthcare system since March of 2020.
Our hospital generated emissions have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels.
Referrals from senior housing, specifically nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, continue to be disrupted.
During the third quarter, we've seen admission stabilization and pockets of improvement in senior housing admissions.
However, it remains too early to accurately project the pace and time line for senior housing admissions to fully return to pre-pandemic levels.
In the third quarter of 2021, total VITAS admissions were 17, 598.
This is a 1.9% decline when compared to the third quarter of 2020 admissions and a 4.5% sequential increase when compared to the second quarter of 2021.
In the third quarter, on a year-over-year basis, our hospital directed admissions declined 0.8%.
Total home-based pre-admit admissions decreased 8.3%, nursing home admits declined 0.2%, and assisted living facility admissions declined 8.6%.
When you compare our third quarter 2021 admissions to the second quarter of 2021, we generated solid sequential improvement with hospital directed admissions improving 2%, total home based pre-admit admissions increasing 16.3%, nursing home admits expanding 8.9%, and assisted living facility admissions increasing 5% sequentially.
Our average length of stay in the quarter was 96 days.
This compares to 97.1 days in the third quarter of 2020 and 94.5 days in the second quarter of 2021.
Our median length of stay was 13 days in the quarter and compares to 14 days in the third quarter of 2020, and is equal to the second quarter of 2021.
I will now open this teleconference to questions.
","Chemed Corporation reported solid performance for both its VITAS and Roto-Rooter subsidiaries in Q3 2021. While VITAS's revenue declined by 5.8% due to a decrease in days of care and a shift in acuity mix, Roto-Rooter's revenue increased by 15.7% driven by strong demand for residential services, particularly in plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, and water restoration. Despite challenges in managing labor costs and disruptions to senior housing referrals, VITAS's margins are expected to remain stable thanks to the natural hedge provided by Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement based on inflation. Roto-Rooter also anticipates passing on inflationary price increases in Q4. Both VITAS and Roto-Rooter remain well-positioned for continued growth in the post-pandemic environment. Chemed repurchased 350,000 shares of its stock in Q3 and updated its full-year 2021 guidance, with adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding non-cash expenses now estimated at $19.00 to $19.20, above the initial guidance of $17.00 to $17.50."
ALL_q3_2021.txt,"Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials to our website at allstateinvestors.com.
Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results.
Let's start on slide two.
So this is Allstate's strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before.
We have two components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand the protection solution.
Those are the two ovals you see on the left with the intersection between them.
The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel.
Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%.
Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers.
As a result, we now have almost 192 million policies in force across the enterprise.
Financially, the results were more mixed.
Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter.
Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs in settling auto insurance claims.
We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss cost, and Transformative Growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes.
This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return programs that include significant reinsurance recoverables.
They were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income.
Capital deployment results were excellent, with $1.5 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter.
We also completed the divestitures of our two largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week.
So let's go to slide three.
Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both the higher earned -- National General acquisition, Allstate brand, homeowners premium growth and higher net investment income.
Property-Liability premiums and policies in force increased 13.5% and 12.5%, respectively.
Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost about $300 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio.
Net income was $508 million in the quarter, and that's compared to $1 billion in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income.
Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and it's decreased $683 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs.
Net income for the first nine months of 2021 was below the prior year, and that's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business, which we reported earlier in the year.
Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first nine months, and that was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses [Technical Issues] more than offset higher loss costs.
What I would do is put the pandemic in a longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results, and it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do.
But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruption, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic.
So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from, really, governments around the world.
The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents.
And of course, due to this unprecedented driver in frequency, we proactively provided our customers with some money back, which increased customer retention.
Since then, since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed and severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefit.
Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary Shelter-in-Place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction and took some modest overall reductions in rate levels.
This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency with large percentage increases.
And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below prepandemic levels, the national and general nonstandard business is back to the levels before the pandemic.
Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption, and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts, and Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides.
From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases in auto insurance prices.
From a growth standpoint, at the onset of the pandemic, we began to see a material increase in the consumer acceptance telematics, and we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile, and that's led to substantial increase in our telematics product.
Now the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio, and this is the tale of the beginning and the end as well.
So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down, and this had a negative impact on investment results.
Then, of course, on -- and we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade really investing in these kinds of funds.
And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's three, five or 10 years.
But -- so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity valuations going up, and our returns have come back strongly.
In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio.
But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter.
And many of our other businesses have been impacted some positively, some negatively, but it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder value.
So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how Transformative Growth positions of Allstate for continued success.
Let's move to slide five to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter.
The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter.
This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as well as higher catastrophe losses and non catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates.
The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter.
As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity.
Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart had a negative 1.4 point impact on the combined ratio as favorable reserve reestimates recorded in 2020 from wildfire subrogation settlements positively impacted the prior year quarter.
Gross catastrophe losses were higher but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrating the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program.
Noncatastrophe prior year reserve strengthening of $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines.
This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the runoff Property-Liability segment following our annual comprehensive reserve review.
This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior year quarter.
Moving to slide six.
Let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability.
Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first nine months of 2021.
The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss cost due to higher accident frequency, increased severity and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year.
While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to prepandemic levels.
Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020 but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019.
The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility.
The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital.
Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021 lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019.
Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus two years ago, as you can see from the red bar.
The cost reductions implemented as part of Transformative Growth reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results.
As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims.
This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increase part prices.
The chart on the lower right shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019.
Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI.
This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles.
Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we increased expected loss costs for the first two quarters of 2021, and this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter.
Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first two quarters of 2021 increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left.
So let's flip to slide seven, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability.
As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time, with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise.
To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness and continuing the lower costs.
After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter, with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022.
The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and fourth quarter as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the fourth quarter.
Those states denoted with the caret are top 10 states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020.
In the third quarter, we've received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September.
We adapted quickly to higher severities in the fourth quarter, with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states.
We have already implemented rate increases in eight states during the fourth quarter, with an average increase of 6.7% as of November 1.
Looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end.
We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation and premium generation.
As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities.
We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies.
Cost reductions as part of Transformative Growth will also continue to be implemented.
As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter referred to as the adjusted expense ratio.
This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising.
It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable.
We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business.
Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018, with further improvement occurring through the first nine months of 2021.
Over time, we expect to drive an additional three points of improvement from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024.
This represents about a 6-point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of one point per year over six years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns.
Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes, enabling the retirement of legacy technology, operating efficiency gains from combining organization -- combining organizations and transforming the distribution model to higher growth and lower costs.
Transitioning to slide nine, let's go up a level to show how Transformative Growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of Transformative Growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth.
As you know, Transformative Growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal Property-Liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution.
This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem.
We've made significant progress to date across each component.
Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns.
Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing.
Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions lets consumers know about this better value proposition.
New technology platforms, lower costs and enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property liability customers.
This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value.
Turning to slide 10.
Let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway.
As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior year quarter.
National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of four million policies, and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased by 231,000 driven by growth across personal lines.
Allstate brand auto policies in force increased slightly compared to the prior year quarter and sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end, as you can see by the table on the lower left.
The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year.
[Technical Issues] 38% increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents.
As you know, we've significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower cost.
The addition of National General also added 502,000 new auto applications in the quarter.
Moving to slide 11.
Protection Services continues to grow revenue and profit.
Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 23.3% to $597 million in the third quarter.
Protection Plans and net written premium increased by $139 million due to the launch of the Home Depot relationship focusing on appliances.
Our quarterly net written premium is now 5.5 times the level of when the company was acquired in 2017.
Arity expanded revenues due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.
ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device sales driven by growth in the Milewise products.
Policies in force increased 12.5% to 150 million driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection.
Adjusted net income was $45 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of $5 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher profitability at Allstate Identity Protection and Arity.
This was partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses related to investments in growth.
Now let's shift to slide 12, which highlights our investment performance.
Net investment income totaled $764 million in the quarter, which was $300 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income, as shown in the chart on the left.
Performance-based income totaled $437 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting increases in private equity investments.
As in prior quarters, several large idiosyncratic contributors had a meaningful impact on our results.
These results represent a long-term and broad approach to growth investing, with nearly 90% of year-to-date performance-based income coming from assets with inception years of 2018 and prior.
Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior year quarter.
The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was somewhat mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income.
Our total portfolio return was 1% in the third quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting income and changes in equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates.
We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk for appropriate investment horizons.
Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value.
While the performance-based investment results continue to be strong in the third quarter, we manage the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns.
On the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons.
Consistent with broader public and private equity markets, our portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters.
While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect our performance-based returns to moderate in line with our longer-term results.
Now let's move to slide 13, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position.
Allstate's balance sheet strength and excellent cash flow generation provides strong cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth.
Significant cash returns to shareholders, including $1.5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends, occurred during the third quarter.
Common shares outstanding have been reduced by 5% over the last 12 months.
Already in the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of SafeAuto on October one for $262 million to leverage National General's integration capabilities and further increased personal lines market share.
We also recently closed on the divestitures of Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York.
These divestitures free up approximately $1.7 billion of deployable capital, which was factored into the $5 billion share repurchase program currently being executed.
Turning to slide 14.
Let's finish with a longer-term view of Allstate's focus on execution, innovation and sustainable value creation.
Allstate has an excellent track record of serving customers, earning attractive returns on risks and delivering for shareholders, as you can see by the industry-leading statistics on the upper right.
F Innovation is also critical to the execution, and our proactive implementation of Transformative Growth has positioned us well to address the macroeconomic challenges facing our business today and in the future.
Sustainable value creation also requires excellent capital management and governance.
As an example, Allstate is in the top 15% of S&P 500 companies and cash returns to shareholders by providing an attractive dividend and repurchasing 25% and 50% of outstanding shares over the last five and 10 years, respectively.
Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value.
","In the third quarter, Allstate's total revenues grew by 16.9% year-over-year to $12.5 billion. Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%, and Protection Plans saw a 12.5% growth. Net income, however, decreased from the previous year's quarter due to higher auto insurance loss costs, which were partly offset by increased investment income and reinsurance recoveries. The company implemented price increases to address the rising loss costs and continues to focus on expense reduction through its Transformative Growth initiative. Allstate Protection Services experienced revenue and profit growth, and net investment income was significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to strong performance-based income. The company's balance sheet remained strong, allowing for significant cash returns to shareholders and the acquisition of SafeAuto to further increase market share. Allstate is committed to sustainable value creation through execution, innovation, and capital management, with a history of attractive dividend payments and share repurchases."

First, let me begin by sending our thoughts and prayers to our colleagues and partners who were in the wake of Ida.
We hope you and your loved ones are all safe and sound.
Now on the quarter.
Our performance this quarter reflects continued momentum in our Inspiring Brilliance transformation to maximize jewelry category strength and capture market share over the last year.
Specifically, we are advancing and better integrating our banner value propositions, product newness, always on marketing and connected commerce experiences.
Our team continues to accelerate our transformation and delight new and loyal customers through their passion, dedication and expanding capabilities and talents.
It's an honor to work alongside them.
There are three key messages that I'd like to leave you with today.
First, we outperformed expectations and are raising our fiscal '22 guidance.
Data-driven insights and our bespoke research capabilities enabled our team to quickly identify and make the most of changing consumer trends.
Second, our Inspiring Brilliance strategies are working in an integrated manner.
Our continued refinement of our banner value propositions are serving distinct customers with differentiated product assortments and experiences.
Our Connected Commerce strategy is increasingly enabling more consumers to shop with us whenever, however and wherever they want.
And third, we are continuing to strengthen our culture of innovation and agility.
And our team members are embracing new capabilities with excellence.
By investing in our people and attracting the best talent across industries, our people and culture are becoming an even stronger competitive advantage.
Now let me share some highlights from the second quarter.
We delivered total sales of $1.8 billion this quarter.
That's a same-store sales improvement of 97.4% compared to last year.
We're pleased with this performance but are also mindful that we didn't meaningfully reopen our stores until about two-thirds of the way through the second quarter last year.
A better indicator of our performance is the comparison to two years ago, when our fleet was fully operational.
On that basis, this quarter represents same-store sales growth of 38.1%.
Total revenue was nearly $425 million higher than two years ago despite having roughly 450 fewer stores, a 16% reduction in store count.
This performance points to the importance of both Connected Commerce and our store footprint optimization.
As we continue to transform our operating model, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% this quarter, representing an 860 basis point improvement compared to this time two years ago.
As a result of this strong momentum, our view of the back half is more positive than it was a few months ago, particularly for the third quarter.
We are seeing a delay in the anticipated shift of spending toward travel and experiences, which we believe is primarily related to the COVID Delta variant.
While we continue to put the health and safety of both our employees and customers first, we don't anticipate significant store closures in the back half of the fiscal year.
These factors are why we're raising our guidance today, reflecting second quarter outperformance and third quarter momentum while remaining cautious given potential macro headwinds.
To explain our second-quarter performance, it's important to point out how our Inspiring Brilliance strategies are enabling our team to stay agile and create competitive opportunities.
While category tailwinds existed in Q2, it was our differentiated assortments that resonated with customers, our Connected Commerce capabilities that increased conversion and our always on targeted marketing that all worked in combination to deliver strong growth this quarter.
Recall that the Inspiring Brilliance phase of our transformation is built on four where-to-play strategies: winning in our biggest businesses, accelerating services, expanding accessible luxury and value and leading in digital commerce.
As we aim to win in our big businesses, we focused on leaning into four consumer trends that our data identified early and our team worked to quickly execute against.
The first of these trends is strong consumer confidence.
While this index took a step back in August, it was heightened throughout our second quarter and remains similar to levels earlier this year.
Confidence is highest among millennials and higher-income customers.
Our recent research also shows that 80% of U.S. consumers believe they are the same or better off economically today than they were before the pandemic.
We've responded by providing additions to our assortments that offer higher-quality pieces at higher price points.
The second trend is gifting at higher price points as customers continue to celebrate those closest to them.
We identified this trend early and leaned into it at Valentine's Day and again at Mother's Day.
In the week leading up to Mother's Day, we drove brick-and-mortar same-store sales growth of more than 30% to two years ago, with average transaction value up 18%.
Similarly, growth in eCommerce over the same time period was more than 90%, showing that our Connected Commerce experience is resonating, both in store and online.
The third trend is higher self-purchasing among both women and men.
Customers are seeking ways to express themselves by spending discretionary dollars on better quality pieces that both hold their value over time and reflect their personal style.
open and now available at sales.
This new 60-piece collection is a testament to Serena's self-love and strength and has been met with strong initial customer response.
Another good example is our decision to expand the fashion assortment available through James Allen.
While still a relatively small portion of its overall sales, James Allen's second quarter fashion sales were up more than threefold to this time two years ago.
The fourth trend I'd like to highlight is the rising tide of engagements.
Our research indicates 15% of committed couples or approximately 2.3 million couples plan to get engaged this calendar year, which is up high single digits to a typical prepandemic year.
As a company, we have tremendous expertise in providing customers with education and counsel, both in store and online, which builds trust on such an important decision.
Customers are responding as we saw total sales of our bridal category increased over $150 million or 25% this quarter to two years ago.
While our strategies are working together to respond to these trends, I think the continued refinement of our banner differentiation shines brightest here.
Recall that while our banners are well positioned to serve any customer journey, each of them is best positioned to serve a specific one.
For example, our data analytics on Kay shows that new customers are 700 basis points more likely to be on a milestone gifting and holiday or holiday purchase journey, aligning with Kay's target of the generous sentimentalist.
Meanwhile, Zales continues to refine their approach to attract the bold statement maker, and we can measure our progress.
Zales' new customers in the first half of the year are 400 basis points more likely to be on a self-purchase journey than two years ago.
One of the ways that we've driven this differentiation is through the continued refinement of our assortment.
This includes engagement rings at Kay with the larger center stones and more fancy cuts, higher-quality diamonds and metals available through the Chosen line at Jared or our increasing assortment of diamond pieces at Pagoda.
Alongside our efforts to provide a differentiated and consumer inspired assortment is our focus on a healthy inventory position.
Through a series of integrated initiatives, we've driven a 40% improvement to our overall inventory turn since we began our transformation.
First, we've improved the design and testing phase of our merchandise cycle so that we can lean into trends faster and at a scale that is unmatched in our category.
Second, we are rationalizing our SKUs dynamically with data-driven precision to focus on assortments that resonate most, thereby reducing buildups of sell down or clearance merchandise.
These efforts enable us to lower inventory levels while giving customers higher access to newness.
A clear example here is Kay.
New or high-turn inventory penetration at Kay is now 50% higher than it was two years ago.
I'd also note that we've applied this playbook to our Memo inventory as well, a decision that has led to more effective purchasing and has bolstered our vendor relationships.
Given potential macroeconomic headwinds, these improvements to our inventory and merchandise strategies are important to helping us remain agile.
Services is our second where-to-play strategy, and we're making good progress here as well.
We see an opportunity to grow services into $1 billion business.
Not only do services carry higher margins, they are strategic as they drive trust and long-term relationships.
Trust is key when a customer hands us a treasured piece of jewelry to repair or when they ask us to safely pierce a part of their body or when they act on the counsel of our jewelry consultants to choose and customize the perfect engagement ring.
Every time we earn a customer's trust, we take a step toward building a relationship that will last a lifetime.
And we're working to provide services at every relevant touch point in a customer's purchase journey.
For example, in July, we took another step in the transformation of our financial services.
We now have long-term agreements with strategic credit partners, which lower our costs and provide customers with a broader and more flexible range of payment options.
Customization is also an increasingly important service.
In a recent survey, 36% of retail consumers expressed interest in customizing their products and services and 20% indicated that they're willing to pay a premium.
Over 80% of bridal customers express interest in some level of customization for their engagement and wedding rings.
These insights are reflected in the performance of our Jared foundry experience.
Stores with foundries delivered roughly 10% higher sales than Jared locations without them this quarter.
This unique offering combines on-site jewelers with computer-assisted design software and 3D printing to provide an experience that customers cannot get at most other jewelry stores.
With roughly 50 foundry locations today, we will continue investing in its rollout as we plan to have more than 70 Jareds with foundry experience this fiscal year.
Our third where-to-play strategy is expanding the mid-market by growing accessible luxury and value through the continued differentiation of our banner portfolio.
As an example, take Kay and Jared.
Kay is our broadest reaching banner, positioned squarely in the mid-market.
We've been pushing Jared toward the higher end of the mid-market or what we refer to as accessible luxury.
The traction of this strategy is proving out in our results.
In the second quarter, Jared's average transaction value was 86% higher than Kay's, up from roughly 31% differential this time two years ago.
This differentiation allows our scaled banner portfolio to reach more customers with their ideal assortment and value.
On the value end of the mid-market, we've continued the rollout of our rebranding test, Banter by Piercing Pagoda, that we began in 100 stores at the end of April.
Based on promising results, we expanded to bring the total to 200 stores on August 2.
At the same time, we launched banter.com.
This new mobile-first site represents an exciting opportunity because the target customer is digitally savvy and most likely to shop from their mobile device.
But our eCommerce penetration has historically been among the lowest of our banners.
Results of this new site are still very early, but encouraging.
Online traffic has doubled, and interaction times on the site have increased 25%.
Importantly, we're seeing a lift from both new customers and existing Pagoda customers, unlocking new levels of customer acquisition and growth.
Our fourth and final where-to-play strategy is leading digital commerce in the jewelry industry.
I want to put particular emphasis on this because it is so fundamental to our strategy.
If winning in our biggest businesses is our foundation, then leading in Connected Commerce is our accelerator.
The two together, combined with services and mid-market expansion, are multipliers.
Connected Commerce is not brick-and-mortar or eCommerce or digital.
It's the integration of customer experiences, leveraging in store and online and mobile and ubiquitous delivery as both a mindset and a capability.
It's data-driven and channel-agnostic, and it is seamless.
It brings our people and our technology together in a more powerful way.
In fact, our Connected Commerce capabilities are adding more opportunities to meet our customers through video calls, buy online, pick up in-store services and more.
Customers are also growing more comfortable buying jewelry online.
We recognize that the pandemic was a factor in this shift as 78% of consumers have said that the pandemic made them realize that shopping online is better and easier than their previous perception.
We continue aiming to be at the forefront of this trend by working to provide an innovative digital shopping experience.
Of engaged couples in 2021, roughly 30% said they bought their engagement ring online, which is more than double the amount in calendar 2019.
Customers are also looking for convenience, capabilities like virtual consulting, buy online, pick up in-store and ship from store are changing the way that many customers shop with us.
In Kay, more than 25% of online orders this quarter utilized at least one of these capabilities.
And in Jared, it was over 30% of online orders.
Last quarter, we implemented Google Business Messenger and Apple Business Chat as additional ways for customers to reach our virtual jewelry consultants.
This is important because we know that when our virtual consultants establish a human connection through these conversations or help customers book an in-store appointment, we drive higher rates of conversion.
For example, within Ernest Jones, 20% of our in-store business is now the result of appointments that were made online.
Of those appointments, over 70% results in a sale that averages four times what a walk-in customer spends.
We continue to believe that blending physical and virtual experiences will be a core customer expectation for fine jewelry and a Signet competitive advantage in the years to come.
Now a few words on the potential headwinds ahead.
Our research indicates that younger unvaccinated customers, those aged 18 to 49 and particularly those with young children, are more concerned about COVID variants than older customers.
This growing concern may impact shopping behaviors among younger people.
So we're preparing to meet them wherever and however they want to shop with us across our Connected Commerce ecosystem, including online, curbside pickup, same-day concierge delivery.
That said, we also know that these customers are relatively more comfortable being in malls and shopping centers than on planes, in concert venues and at spas.
So as travel and experiences take a backseat, we're advancing our flexible fulfillment options while also meeting customers' desires to celebrate those closest to them with gifts of significance and lasting value.
Inflation is the other concern that we're seeing in our research.
As prices for essentials increase and as stimulus programs wane, naturally, customers' discretionary income decreases.
However, within jewelry, this trend still plays to our competitive strengths and to our optimized assortments.
Customers, particularly higher-income and engagement customers, will continue to spend discretionary dollars focused on purchases with lasting value.
With our scale and trusted network of vendors, we're able to offer product assortments that provide excellent value across a variety of price points, which also align with our margin goals.
In summary, our ability to capitalize on category momentum with increasingly strong execution of our Inspiring Brilliance strategies as well as remain agile in a time of uncertainty is a reflection of our culture and our people.
In a recent survey, 85% of our team members said they are proud to work at Signet, illustrating the dedication and commitment to performance within our company.
We're unlocking incredible discretionary effort among our team, while also attracting top talent from within the retail industry and beyond.
All of this creates a powerful cycle, capabilities that translate into positive customer experiences, continuing innovation, productive execution and talent advancements.
And it's the strength of our organization and improving agility of our culture that drives my confidence in our near- and long-term performance more than any other factor.
On that note, I'll turn this over to Joan, who will share her insights into what's working and what's ahead.
The team delivered strong results this quarter, working to maximize the jewelry category strength with our new capabilities.
As I talk to our performance, there are three key messages to highlight.
First, we expanded operating margin by leveraging fixed costs, growing merchandise margin and achieving higher labor productivity and additional cost savings.
Second, we are raising guidance to reflect our Q2 beat and a stronger Q3, given current business momentum and the delay of the anticipated shift to experience-related spending, which we believe is primarily due to the Delta variant.
We are maintaining a conservative view of the fourth quarter due to macro uncertainty related to COVID-19 variants and the impact of government support policies on consumer spend.
And third, aligned with our capital priorities, we've expanded our authorized repurchases to $225 million to reflect our confidence in our longer-term growth opportunities and the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow.
Now turning to the quarter.
Our total sales of $1.8 billion reflect growth of more than 100% over last year.
We continue to overcome lower levels of retail industry foot traffic through higher conversion, higher average transaction values and Connected Commerce capabilities.
I'd also note that this quarter reflects the return of brick-and-mortar business for our U.K. banners.
Moving on to gross margin.
We delivered approximately $780 million this quarter or 40% of sales.
This is a 650 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter two years ago.
Leveraging of fixed cost contributed more than 400 basis points of the improvement.
The remaining factors were driven by sustained cost savings and merchandise margin expansion.
A favorable merchandise mix, complemented by increasing levels of service revenue, enhanced discount controls and targeted promotions drove the expansion.
This combination of drivers is an example of the strategy we detailed at our virtual investor event earlier this year.
SG&A was approximately $503 million or 28% of sales.
This rate reflects a 210 basis point improvement to two years ago.
Our data-driven labor model continues to be one of the largest factors in our cost efficiency.
It's worth noting that this model continues to make use of flexible store hours by removing unproductive store operating hours where possible.
In other words, though overall traffic is down, we're increasing traffic per store hour.
This model has delivered a sales per labor hour improvement of more than 70% to this time two years ago, while also contributing to our decrease in employee turnover compared to the same time period.
Non-GAAP operating profit was $223 million compared to an operating loss of $41.7 million in the prior year.
Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.57, including a discrete tax benefit of $0.80 per share.
This is due to a release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as our performance has significantly improved since it was recorded.
This compares to prior year non-GAAP diluted loss per share of $1.13 and diluted earnings per share of $0.51 two years ago.
Turning to the balance sheet.
We made significant progress in strengthening our financial health this quarter, and I'd like to offer some additional perspective.
Starting with inventory, we're improving the health of our inventory, both in productivity and margin capture as well as broadening the accessibility of our inventory to customers.
This has resulted in both a 40% improvement to inventory turn and a reduction in overall inventory levels.
To achieve this, we took three key strategic actions.
We reduced the level of end-of-life and slow-turning product through strategic promotions.
We are also leveraging flexible fulfillment capabilities such as ship from store and buy online, pick up in store, driving increased inventory access and visibility for our customers and team members.
We've leaned into our consumer insights, improved design and test cycle to ensure that the new product that we bring in is better aligned with our banner value propositions, thereby reducing the amount of inventory that reaches the sell-down or clearance stage of product life cycle.
Moving on to liquidity.
We have financial flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth, recently enhanced by the extension of our ABL facility.
Alongside this, we removed customer credit risk from our balance sheet with the recently announced agreements with financial services partners.
We're in a net cash position, including both our long-term debt and preferred share obligations, positioning us well to deliver on our capital priorities.
Our first priority is to invest in the business.
This primarily includes investment in digital capabilities, technology and banner value propositions.
This also includes the evaluation of acquisition opportunities that align with our Inspiring Brilliance strategy, such as Rocksbox, which we announced earlier this year.
Our second priority is to focus on our debt, with the goal of reducing our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to below three times.
And I'd note that the recent extension of our ABL facility through July 2026 provides us an additional option to address our 2024 senior note and preferred share obligations.
Our third priority is returning capital to shareholders.
Last quarter, we reinstated our common dividend.
And as we announced today, we've expanded our current authorization of share repurchases to $225 million, which we'll evaluate on an opportunistic basis.
Now I'd like to discuss our fiscal 2022 financial guidance.
We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the Q2 beat and current business momentum.
Factor into our view of Q3 is a delay in the anticipated shift to experiences-related spending primarily a result of the Delta variant.
We are maintaining a conservative view of the fourth quarter due to macro uncertainty related to COVID-19 variants and the impact of government support policies on consumer spend.
Building on last year, our back half strategy includes always on marketing, earlier receipt of holiday assortment and a promotional cadence designed to drive earlier holiday shopping into the third quarter to create less reliance on the fourth quarter.
We expect third-quarter sales in the range of $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion, with same-store sales in the range of down 3% to up 1% and non-GAAP EBIT of $10 million to $25 million.
Within Q3 guidance, we've embedded higher marketing and store staff expenses to last year as well as the favorable impact from our recently enhanced credit agreements.
Implied in our guidance is fourth quarter negative same-store sales in the range of low to mid-single digits.
For the fiscal year, we now expect total sales within range of $6.8 billion to $6.95 billion with same-store sales in the range of 30% to 33% and non-GAAP EBIT of $618 million to $673 million.
Our guidance assumes no significant level of store closures resulting from COVID variants.
And as we've already begun acting on our holiday strategy, we assume no meaningful impact to sourcing or fulfillment arising from inflation or pricing environment changes.
As we continue to optimize our footprint, we remain on track to open up to 100 locations and close at least 100.
We've opened 37 locations so far this year and closed 33, including 10 mall closures that were then reopened in off-mall locations.
Recall over the past 18 months, we've evolved our real estate strategy from strict fleet rationalization to fleet optimization.
This quarter has shown the benefits of this approach as our mall and off-mall locations drove similar performance levels.
Lastly, recall that I mentioned expected capital expenditures in the range of $190 million to $200 million.
This represents a narrowing of our previous range of $175 million to $200 million as we continue fueling Connected Commerce.
Further, as we've identified incremental cost savings within gross margin and other indirect spend, we're raising our expected cost savings for the year from a range of $75 million to $95 million to a range of $85 million to $105 million.
Our team continues to be a driving force for this company as their commitment to our strategies delivered strong performance this quarter.
It is an exciting time for Signet as we continue through our transformation, and I'm proud to work alongside such a devoted team.
","Signet Jewelers reported strong second-quarter results, with total sales reaching $1.8 billion, a 38.1% increase from two years prior. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 12.5%. The company attributed its success to its Inspiring Brilliance strategy, which includes differentiating its banners, expanding its product offerings to meet changing consumer trends, and enhancing its Connected Commerce capabilities. Signet observed increased demand for higher-priced jewelry, self-purchasing, and engagement rings, driven by positive consumer confidence and a rise in the number of planned engagements. The company's Connected Commerce initiatives, such as online ordering with in-store pickup and virtual consulting, are gaining traction, particularly in the bridal category. Signet remains cautious about potential headwinds, including inflationary pressures and concerns over COVID-19 variants. Despite these concerns, the company raised its fiscal 2022 guidance, reflecting strong Q2 performance and expectations of continued momentum in Q3. Signet plans to open up to 100 new locations and close over 100 stores, primarily through the expansion of its Piercing Pagoda concept. The company also announced an expanded share repurchase authorization of $225 million."
SIG_q3_2022.txt,"On the call are Signet's CEO, Gina Drosos; and chief financial and strategy officer, Joan Hilson.
Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.
During the call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
For further discussion on those non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of them to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the news release we posted on our website at www.
Our performance in Q3 reflects the continuing progress of our inspiring brilliance transformation and the innovation, agility, and passion of our entire organization.
I continue to be inspired by our team quarter after quarter, and I am proud to work at their side every day.
As we look back at this past quarter and our year to date, I want to leave you with one core message, our inspiring brilliance transformation is working, making Signet a much healthier and more agile company today than we were a few years ago.
We believe our top and bottom line growth is sustainable, and we're growing share while also investing in important new capabilities and customer experiences at a rate that is currently unrivaled in our category.
We still have important work to do to complete this phase of Signet's transformation, but we have the strategic clarity, structural advantages, operating discipline, and high-performing team to continue driving growth ahead of the jewelry sector.
We saw this in Q3.
Our team delivered the strongest, most profitable third quarter in Signet's history, a quarter that has often been challenging because there's no broad scale gift-giving occasion.
We've been taking steps to mitigate our dependence on big holiday cycles and move to a more always-on approach.
This is evidenced in our investments in consistent marketing and customer engagement throughout the year, our year-round bridal cycle, and our efforts to increasingly support early holiday shopping in October.
This approach is paying off.
We delivered a same-store sales increase of almost 19% to the third quarter last year, with notable growth acceleration in October.
The overall jewelry category was strong this quarter, but we believe we're gaining market share.
We're achieving this growth by leveraging five structural advantages that we've built throughout our transformation: No.
1, our distinctive portfolio of banners; two, our connected commerce presence; three, data analytics capability; four, financial flexibility; and five, scale.
We've built these strategic advantages through a series of investments and innovation that we continue to build upon.
For example, we've made significant progress differentiating our banner value propositions with distinctive marketing campaigns and unique product assortments, delivering 14% sales growth in bridal and over 30% growth in fashion.
We've invested in connected commerce capabilities that now exist in virtually every part of our business.
This is reflected in capabilities such as seamless virtual and in-store consulting, asynchronous chat, product visualization, buy online pick up in store, ship from store, curbside delivery, same-day delivery, and more.
We've streamlined our fleet, enabling us to serve customers across channels, while also leveraging fixed costs as we drive the top line.
We've eliminated consumer credit risk from our balance sheet, enabling us to focus entirely on jewelry retail leadership, while offering a broader array of payment options that continue to gain traction.
By leveraging third-party expertise and focusing on what we do best, our financial services transformation is increasingly an enabler of customer acquisition and satisfaction.
We've also eliminated costs the customer doesn't see or care about.
Our expected cumulative four-year savings is now over $400 million through the end of fiscal '22.
One example of how we're doing this is our data-driven labor model that enables us to dynamically plan staffing needs; store-by-store, hour-by-hour, delivering a 75% improvement in productivity compared to this time two years ago.
And we've improved inventory turns 50% by defining our product assortment more precisely by banner and by providing a much broader range of fulfillment options.
We are becoming the consumer-inspired data-driven jewelry leader and innovator that we aim to be.
Given the very uncertain environment today, we are mindful of the challenges still ahead of us.
That said, Joan and I would like to use our review of Q3 and our look ahead at Q4 to show how the advantages we've created are driving our performance and growth and positioning us for a strong holiday this year and beyond within all the factors we can control.
Let's look first at how we're leaning into holiday earlier than ever.
Our research indicates that roughly 25% of shoppers finished their holiday shopping before Black Friday this year, up from 17% a year ago.
This trend is being driven by concerns about out of stocks, which we anticipated and planned for.
We took action months ago to ensure that our holiday assortment would be stronger and available earlier than ever before.
We pulled forward our premarket qualification of new merchandise, strengthened our core assortments, leaned into trends, identified in our research, and placed orders a month or more earlier than we typically do.
We also prepared for continuing increases in digital sales and connected commerce this holiday.
At this time last year, our jewelry consultants were providing new experiences like curbside pickup and virtual consultations to provide our customers a safe and convenient shopping experience.
This year, we've improved the customer experience, allowing customers to select curbside service online during checkout and stay connected to the store throughout the process from purchase to receipt to pick up.
And we've expanded curbside delivery to more than 800 stores.
We're offering ship from store at 1,850 stores, five times more than last year.
And we're offering buy online pick up in store at 2,100 locations.
In addition, we've enhanced our distribution capabilities particularly by building in a layer of surge capacity to fulfill customer e-commerce orders on our busiest days.
This is a good demonstration of the ongoing transformation at scale we're striving for.
Last year, we increased our e-commerce supply chain capability fivefold.
This year, we're building on that foundation, increasing the capacity of our distribution centers again, nearly 25% more than last year, and adding a nationwide fleet of local distribution centers with our ship-from-store capability.
We're working to extend these distribution advantages even further in the coming year.
We're building an AI-driven digital simulation of our entire supply chain.
This digital twin will enhance our planning with scenarios that identify potential issues before they occur, giving us insights that enable us to provide faster delivery while driving cost efficiency.
We're also improving our employee experience to maximize our advantages in talent and staffing.
We increased our hourly wage this year, significantly expanded benefits to respond to the changing needs of our team members, and have continued to invest in training, development, and career growth.
In addition, we continue to leverage the power of our purpose, inspiring love and our innovative agile culture to strengthen our team's pride, motivation, and performance.
These and other efforts are making a difference.
We've seen a 60% decrease in new employee turnover during their first two months at a time when turnover continues to top the headlines across retail.
This is important because tenure matters in the jewelry category, where expertise and personal relationships lead to lifetime value.
In fact, a jewelry consultant with at least one year of tenure achieves on average, 60% more sales than a new team member.
All of these readiness efforts are driven by the structural advantages I mentioned a moment ago and will help us deliver a strong holiday.
I'd now like to highlight the meaningful progress we made this quarter within each of our four where-to-play strategies: winning in our biggest businesses; expanding accessible luxury and value; accelerating services; and leading digital commerce.
Winning in our big businesses is our foundational strategy.
The story here is that the clearer our banner value propositions become the faster we grow.
We've gained real traction with this strategy over three consecutive quarters now.
For example, Kay and Zales are appealing to increasingly differentiated consumer segments.
While both appeal to bridal customers, almost 30% of New Zales customers are on a self-purchase journey, up 400 basis points compared to two years ago, and 64% of new Kay customers are on a milestone or gifting journey to celebrate special moments in the lives of those they love, which is 700 points higher than two years ago.
We plan our assortments with these journeys as our compass.
We were able to introduce newness with much better success rates because our customers are more precisely defined and because our assortments are more relevant to the journey our customers are on.
The success of the Monique Lhuillier launch at Kay is a clear example.
Monique is an acclaimed fashion designer known for her captivating bridal gowns.
Her brand is all about celebrating life's most special moments.
She's partnering with Kay because she considers Kay to be an authority in both the bridal experience and the celebration of milestone moments.
We just launched this line at the end of September, and it has already delivered more than $2 million in merchandise sales ahead of expectations.
Our second strategy, expanding the accessible luxury and value tiers of the mid-market is also an important driver of growth because it's bringing new customers into our banners.
Accessible luxury is appealing because it's a growing higher price point mezzanine segment that sits between luxury and the mid-market.
We've built a portfolio that is attracting a diverse mix of highly valuable customers.
Jared offers exclusive designer lines, concierge-level service, custom design studios, and a rich assortment of diamonds and fine jewelry for bridal, fashion, and gifting.
James Allen is our digital bridal mega store, the company that continues to pioneer the way that customers shop for engagement rings online, setting new standards for custom design and selection with over 300,000 natural and lab-created diamonds.
And Diamonds Direct, our newest banner, is our highly personalized bridal destination.
They offer customers high-touch bridal experiences with a highly productive operating model, unlike any other in the jewelry category.
This portfolio is designed not only to give accessible luxury customers a wide range of options but also to compete even more effectively with independent jewelers who make up more than 65% of the specialty jewelry category, and it's beginning to work as the integrated mix we've envisioned.
Jared's average transaction value this quarter was up 35% versus the third quarter two years ago through increased custom design and higher quality merchandise that includes larger stones and precious metals like platinum.
James Allen had 50% more customer transactions this quarter than two years ago, again, demonstrating our ability to attract and close highly discriminating bridal customers online.
And Diamonds Direct offers customers a differentiated accessible luxury experience, which is currently generating a median annualized revenue of approximately $18.5 million per store over the last 12 months.
We're confident we can learn from their model while also bringing Signet's best practices and our scale to their approach.
We see similar opportunity on the value end of the mid-tier.
Banter by Piercing Pagoda, is generating higher sales and resonating with customers we want to attract to our portfolio, young social media savvy and highly expressive Gen Z consumers and confident creative consumers of all ages.
We're also growing banter.com, which has relatively low digital penetration with significant upside remaining.
We're continuing to accelerate the expansion of the banter concept based on these early positive results.
Accelerating services is our third growth strategy.
Providing services is the glue that build lifetime relationships across every banner while also supporting our margin goals.
We remain confident that our services strategy is a $1 billion opportunity on Signet's path to $9 billion in total revenue.
Extended service agreements are a good example of the progress we're making with this strategy.
One of the largest factors driving ESA growth is interaction with a salesperson.
This happens naturally in store, but we are focused on enabling this kind of interaction for purchases made online.
We've empowered our virtual consultants to sell ESAs and have launched a series of educational videos that engage customers and discuss the benefits of our programs.
In addition, we've simplified our ESA offerings, which, along with these other improvements, has helped us nearly triple our attachment rate online compared to this time two years ago and has lifted our overall attachment rate across channels by 60 basis points.
Another example is our launch of a new loyalty program.
Our loyalty world is currently being piloted at a number of Jared stores.
And after making refinements based on what we're learning, we expect to extend it across all our banners.
This is a program that customers have expressed a desire for.
It currently includes exclusive discounts, a Rocksbox trial membership and unlimited jewelry cleaning.
These programs are a great way to reward customer loyalty, stay connected and provide additional data on how to better customize our assortment and services.
Leading digital commerce is our fourth strategy.
Digital is our accelerator, especially for our biggest businesses.
The story in digital is data.
This is becoming a real structural advantage for us, one of the biggest interventions we've made since we began our transformation.
Our data analytics capabilities enable us to operate with increasing precision.
For example, building on the insights of our initial real estate greenfield analysis, we are now taking a connected commerce approach to the next phase of this work.
We didn't have capabilities like ship-from-store during our original analysis and no real way to capture each store's e-commerce halo.
But now we do.
We're analyzing customer needs down to an even more precise level to determine where connected commerce opportunity exists and how we can drive market share growth on a more localized basis.
For example, we're now analyzing opportunities beyond just trade areas.
We're micro-targeting customers using populations of 3,000 or fewer people.
This focused level of data at scale is a significant advantage in the jewelry category and will serve us for years to come.
We're also leveraging our analytics capability to optimize the way we introduce product assortments, a good example being our expansion of lab-created diamonds.
Our merchandise teams have used our data to build and tier our LCD assortment in a way that doesn't compete with natural stones.
For example, customers who come into our stores this holiday with a certain piece in mind, will in some cases, be able to choose a lab-created piece in a similar style that offers higher clarity or even higher carat weight.
We're also offering an exclusive LCD cut through Zales called the Vera Wang true line, and we're offering an LCD option of Kay's Leo cut through the Leo legacy line.
Our database approach is ensuring that LCD is additive.
It is increasing selection, appealing to different customers and driving incremental sales.
In these and so many other ways, we're building and leveraging a culture of agility and innovation that is driving growth in every part of our business.
What I hope you can sense is that the momentum we've been building is intentional and disciplined and reinforces our conviction that Signet is a healthy and agile company.
The strategic clarity and structural advantages we've created, combined with the disciplined execution that our team is providing quarter after quarter, is building momentum and driving top line growth, margin expansion, and liquidity that we believe is sustainable over the long term.
We continue to work hard at our transformation efforts and we know there are many uncertainties in today's environment, but we're energized by the impact we're having in our customers' lives, and we're proud of what we're achieving and delivering together.
We also take pride in what our company stands for, and I want to close on this point.
Just as we're building momentum in our business, so are we building momentum in our leadership as a purpose-inspired company, and we're doing this from the inside out with our highly engaged team.
A year ago, we announced on our Q3 earnings call that Signet was, for the first time, named a certified Great Place To Work company.
Today, we're pleased to announce that not only was Signet recertified as a great place to work this year based on our strong employee trust index survey results but that all of our scores improved year over year.
For us, our partnership with the Great Place to Work Institute gives us the ability to continuously advance our employee experience by listening to our team, taking action to improve and benchmarking ourselves against other great companies.
Significantly, this year, 90% of our team share that they feel a sense of pride in what we are accomplishing and 82% believe wholeheartedly that Signet is a great place to work.
We can confidently assure you that our Signet team is fully engaged and passionate about delivering for our customers this holiday.
Additionally, this quarter, we paid close attention to the UN conference on climate change that concluded just a few weeks ago.
As a member of the UN Global Compact, we are fully committed to enhancing our business practices to meet evolving expectations from our investors, employees and customers.
We have established our own Signet Climate Action and Sustainability Committee, a cross-functional team tasked with preparing Signet for the future with our own net zero strategy as we articulated in our corporate sustainability goals released earlier this year.
These quarterly milestones advancing Signet's commitment to corporate citizenship and sustainability matter because consumers are increasingly seeking out companies that share their values.
On that note, I'll turn this over to Joan, who will provide deeper insight into what's driving our growth and where we're headed this fiscal year.
There are three important messages that I'd like to leave you with today.
First, we delivered cost leverage on top line growth again this quarter as a result of our strengthened operating structure.
Second, we achieved a trailing 12-month leverage ratio of 2.1 times.
We returned value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and continue to invest in long-term growth.
Third, we are raising fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect enhanced connected commerce capabilities and business momentum, which continued through Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend.
Also concluded in today's update is higher expected cost savings.
In Q3, we achieved total sales of $1.5 billion, growth of approximately $237 million over last year.
Compared to two years ago, sales are up $350 million with few -- with 423 fewer stores.
While retail foot traffic remains down to pre-pandemic levels, our team effectively used enhanced connected commerce capabilities to drive increased conversion and higher average transaction value.
So substantially, all merchandise categories and banners demonstrated growth supported by a roughly 50% increase in advertising to strategically drive earlier shopping and reduce reliance on traditional fourth quarter profitability.
We delivered approximately $576 million this quarter in gross margin or 37.4% of sales.
This is a 380 basis point improvement to last year, and a 630 basis point improvement to two years ago.
Leveraging of fixed costs contributed roughly two-thirds of the improvement in both years, driven by fleet optimization efforts.
Additionally, the remainder of gross margin improvement relates to merchandise margin and was driven by fundamental changes in our operating model.
These significant changes include enhanced discount controls and reduced promotions as well as strategic inventory initiatives that I'll discuss in a moment.
Moving on, SG&A was approximately $471 million or 30.6% of sales.
This rate is 70 basis points higher versus a year ago from investments in both advertising and labor as we anniversary the reopening of stores after the COVID shutdown.
Compared to two years ago, we leveraged 380 basis points.
We leveraged 300 basis points, reflecting changes in our cost structure.
These changes include cost savings from new credit agreements, a more efficient labor model and continued cost discipline across the organization.
These improvements help to fund increased advertising as well as investments in our connected commerce capabilities.
Non-GAAP operating profit was $105 million compared to $46.8 million last year and a loss of $29.3 million two years ago.
Third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43 compares to the prior year of $0.11 and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.76 two years ago.
Looking deeper into our financial health, overall liquidity of $2.7 billion includes $1.5 billion of cash at quarter end.
Working capital efficiency improved approximately 40% to last year, net of cash through strategic reduction of inventory, collaboration with vendors on payment terms, and the sale of our in-house receivables.
We ended the quarter at $2.1 billion.
Even with a 15% increase in holiday receipts compared to last year, inventory was down $26 million and sell-down and clearance inventory was lower by roughly 14 points.
These improvements were driven by strategic inventory initiatives, including new flexible fulfillment capabilities, life cycle disciplines that includes SKU rationalization and data-driven allocation of product.
The cumulative result of these actions was a 50% improvement in inventory turn to last year.
Alongside the fundamental improvement in owned inventory, we've been partnering with our vendors to eliminate slower turning consignment inventory and strategically shift focus to just-in-time core products and data-driven testing of newer collections.
As a result, consignment inventory was lower by $315 million, which has effectively doubled its productivity over the last two years.
Moving on to capital.
The $2.7 billion of liquidity at quarter end supports our capital priorities.
Our first priority remains investing in growth opportunities, including our connected commerce and technology advancements, continued differentiation of our banners, as well as the recent acquisition of Diamonds Direct.
We continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $190 million to $200 million for fiscal '22.
Our second priority is ensuring liquidity through a strong cash position to provide financial flexibility.
Recall, we extended our ABL facility through calendar 2026, providing enhanced flexibility to address calendar 2024 maturities of senior notes and preferred share obligations.
As mentioned earlier, the trailing 12-month adjusted leverage ratio of 2.1 times is nearly half that of pre-pandemic levels.
Our third priority is returning capital to shareholders.
We reinstated our common dividend earlier this year and this quarter, we repurchased for approximately $41 million.
We have roughly $185 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to discuss our fiscal '22 financial guidance.
We are raising our full year guidance to reflect business momentum as well as the acquisition of Diamonds Direct.
We expect fourth quarter total sales in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.48 billion and same-store sales in the range of 6% to 9%.
While we've managed the factors within our control, our guidance also considers headwinds outside of our control as we move closer to peak holiday selling.
These headwinds include disruptions emerging from COVID variants, government mandates and consumer behavior changes toward experience-related spending.
That said, it remains difficult to predict the magnitude and timing of these expected changes in consumer behavior.
We expect non-GAAP EBIT of $280 million to $317 million.
Compared to Q4 of last year, guidance includes higher marketing, incremental store labor costs, which include additional holiday incentives, higher domestic transportation costs and provides for promotional flexibility.
Lastly, we have raised cost savings expectations for fiscal '22 to $100 million to $115 million.
Now turning to real estate.
For fiscal '22, we expect approximately 75 closures across the fleet and 85 openings, primarily in highly productive Banter by piercing Pagoda format.
This update to our guidance is a result of stronger than expected performance in select locations, favorable lease economics on short-term extensions and a shift in project timing.
Looking deeper at our store footprint, we remain focused on optimizing our fleet through data-driven analytics.
This includes the transition of traditional mall formats to highly productive off-mall locations.
Over the past two years, we've increased the off-mall penetration within the Kay banner by four points.
Now with nearly half of Kay locations and off-mall formats, we're seeing growth at these locations outpace traditional mall formats and carry more favorable economics.
Additionally, this strategy to off-mall has reduced our exposure to declining malls by approximately eight points in our biggest banners.
Now I'd like to address operating margin.
We're often asked, given current jewelry category strength about the sustainability of our operating margin performance.
We believe our margin performance is sustainable in a normal environment because of fundamental changes that have created a healthier and more agile operating model.
I'd like to reiterate the following fundamental changes in our business.
Data analytics inform critical decisions, and we will continue to mature and build on these competencies.
Banner portfolio differentiation is driving growth and includes an increased focus on higher-margin services.
Inventory management improved significantly through the implementation of capabilities such as flexible fulfillment, life cycle and price management, SKU rationalization, as well as strategic use of consignment inventory.
Fleet optimization remains a critical part of our margin expansion and we will continue to refine our trade area analysis.
Cost savings will continue to help fund long-term growth initiatives, including always on marketing and investments in digital capabilities, technology harmonization, and talent.
Fully outsourced financial services, transitioned expertise to third-parties removed consumer credit risk from our balance sheet and provides customers with a broader and more modern range of payment options.
Liquidity and working capital management improved our financial strength and flexibility to continue investing in strategic initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders.
We still have important work to do to continue Signet's transformation.
That said, we've made fundamental changes that have built structural advantages and created strong operating discipline, and we have a high-performing team to continue growth within the jewelry category.
I'd like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season.
","Signet delivered a record-breaking third quarter, with total sales of $1.5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.43. The company's strong performance was driven by increased connected commerce capabilities, improved advertising, and a more efficient operating model. Notably, the company saw a 19% increase in same-store sales compared to the previous year and anticipates continued growth in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales estimates ranging from 6% to 9%. Signet's financial strength has led to improved liquidity and working capital management, enabling it to invest in strategic initiatives and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company remains confident in the sustainability of its growth, citing fundamental changes in its operating model, including data analytics, banner portfolio differentiation, improved inventory management, and cost savings. Despite ongoing challenges, Signet believes it is well-positioned for a strong holiday season."
AVA_q4_2020.txt,"President and CEO, Dennis Vermillion; Executive Vice President, Treasurer and CFO, Mark Thies; Senior Vice President, External Affairs and Chief Customer Officer, Kevin Christie; and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, Ryan Krasselt.
Our consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the full year, consolidated earnings were $1.90 per diluted share for 2020 compared to $2.97 last year.
Now, I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.
As we begin 2021 continuing to work through the COVID pandemic, we hope you're staying safe and healthy.
Looking back on the last year, I'm just so proud of our employees for navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic, continuing to provide energy like they always do to our customers and progressing our business plans forward.
We continue to help those who are struggling and most in need in our communities.
In 2020, Avista and the Avista Foundation provided more than $4 million in charitable giving to support the increased need for services that community agencies are still experiencing throughout the areas we serve.
Financially, our earnings for 2020 were better than expectations, and Mark will provide further details here in just a few minutes.
Operationally, we finished installing nearly all of our smart meters, electric smart meters and natural gas modules across Washington in one of the largest projects in our history.
The deployment of this infrastructure will provide customers with more real-time data, so they can better manage their energy use.
The technology enables us to proactively push high energy alerts to notify customers, if they could exceed their preset energy budgets, which of course, helps eliminate surprises when their bill arrives at the end of the month.
Beyond generating bills, we're using the data from smart meters to run a more reliable and efficient power grid and to deliver a higher level of service for our customers.
For example, we now have more visibility into our system, which allows us to detect and restore power outages more quickly.
We also made strides to meeting our clean energy goals, as the Rattlesnake Flat Wind Farm went online last December.
During its construction the project created clean energy jobs for our local communities and now that it's completed the project's 20 -- project's 57 wind turbines excuse me will provide 50 average megawatts of clean renewable energy for our customers at an affordable price.
That's enough energy to power 38,000 homes for years to come.
As wildfires continue to have an impact on our region we implemented a new comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that aims to improve defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system.
We expect to invest about $330 million implementing the components of this plan over the life of the plan, which as I said was 10 years.
We were proud to announce yesterday that Avista has been recognized again as one of the 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices.
This marks the second year in a row that Avista has achieved this distinction.
We are only one of nine honorees recognized in the energy and utilities industry based on their assessment.
In 2021, 135 honorees in total were recognized spanning 22 countries and 47 industries.
In January, we published Avista's 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report on our avistacorp.com website and I urge you to check it out when you have some time.
This content provides a broad look at our operations and how we're fulfilling our commitments to our people, our customers, our communities and our shareholders.
The website also provides links to Avista's reporting on a series of industry and financial ESG disclosures.
The updated content supports Avista's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility and sharing this information with our stakeholders.
Switching gears with respect to regulatory filings, in January we filed two-year general rate cases in Idaho.
And as you know in 2020 we filed general rate cases in Washington.
And we continue to work through the regulatory processes in both of these jurisdictions.
We take our responsibility to provide safe, reliable energy at an affordable price very seriously.
And we work hard to make prudent financial investments in our infrastructure, manage our costs and identify ways to best serve our customers that contribute to keeping energy prices low.
For example, our proposed tax customer credit would completely offset an immediate increase in electric and natural gas bills for our Washington customers.
In Oregon new rates went into effect on January 16 of this year and we expect to file another rate case in the second half of 2021 in Oregon.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on running a great utility and continue to invest prudent capital to maintain and update our infrastructure and provide reliable energy service to our customers.
We are initiating our 2021, 2022 and 2023 earnings guidance with consolidated ranges of a $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2021, $2.18 to $2.38 in 2022 and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share for 2023.
This puts us on track to earning our allowed return by 2023.
Lastly, earlier this month the board increased our dividend by 4.3% to an annual dividend of $1.69 per share and a dividend increase approved by the board marks the 19 consecutive year the board has raised the dividend for our shareholders, and I believe it demonstrates the board's commitment to maximizing shareholder value.
We had low expectations coming into this year.
No, not the company, the Blackhawks and the Blackhawks have really started off pretty good after a slow first four games.
We've had five rookies score their first goals ever in the NHL, so pretty exciting times for all you hockey fans out there.
For the company in the fourth quarter, Avista Utilities contributed $0.81 per diluted share compared to $0.67 last year.
Our earnings increased primarily due to higher utility margin and customer growth.
Also in the fourth quarter, the Oregon and Washington Commissions joined the Idaho Commission to allow for the deferral of certain COVID-19 related expenses for future -- possible future recovery.
Additionally, Avista Utilities earnings were better than expectations due to higher utility margin and lower income taxes, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.
With respect to COVID-19, as I mentioned earlier, we have now received accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions to defer the costs and benefits associated with COVID-19.
And those will be addressed in future proceedings with each of those commissions.
We expect a gradual economic recovery that will still have some depressed load and customer growth in '21.
We expect that to start improving in the second half of '21, our economy.
We do have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which mitigate the impacts of changes in load for our residential and certain commercial customers.
Over 90% of our revenue, as you recall, is covered by regulatory mechanisms.
As Dennis mentioned, we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure.
We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be about $415 million and at AEL&P we expect about $7 million and about $15 million in our other businesses.
With respect to our liquidity, as of December 31, we have $270 million of available liquidity under our committed credit line at Avista Utilities and in 2020 we issued about $72 million in stock in 2020.
In '21 we expect to issue about $75 million of equity or stock and up to $120 million of long-term debt.
As Dennis mentioned, we are initiating guidance not only for 2021 but also for 2022 and 2023.
And as we mentioned those ranges, this is to get us back to earning our allowed return by 2023 and our guidance does assume timely and appropriate rate relief in each of our jurisdictions relative to the capital expenses that we have going forward.
We experienced regulatory lag during '20 and expect this to continue through the end of '22 due to our continued investment in infrastructure and our delayed filings.
We again delayed last year as we talked about with the pandemic in Washington and Idaho.
Dennis mentioned those earlier.
We expect our cases in Washington and Idaho along with new rates to provide some relief in 2021 and begin reducing that regulatory lag.
Going forward we'll strive to continue to reduce debt and closely align our returns to those authorized by '23.
After '23 we expect to grow at 4% to 6% our earnings.
Our '21 guidance reflects unrecovered structural cost estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 70 basis points and in addition our timing lag, which is what we're trying to reduce with rate cases has reduced it by about 100 basis points.
This results in expected return on equity for Avista Utilities of approximately 7.7% in 2021.
We are forecasting operating cost growth of about 3% and customer growth of about 1% annually, which has slightly improved from prior numbers on the customer growth side.
For 2021 we expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of a $1.93 to $2.07 per diluted share and the midpoint of our guidance does not include any expense or benefit under the ERM.
Our current expectation for the ERM is in the benefit position within the 75% customer, 25% company sharing band which is expected to add $0.05 per diluted share.
For 2021 we expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 per diluted share and our outlook for both Avista Utilities and AEL&P assumes among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year.
We expect a loss between $0.05 and $0.02 per diluted share for our other businesses as we continue to develop opportunities for the future.
We'll spend a little bit of money in the next couple of years to continue to get those earnings up over the course of the next five years and we look forward to those opportunities.
They're both in our service territory and in funds.
Our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual or non-recurring items until the effects are known and certain.
","Avista's earnings, which exceeded expectations, amounted to $0.85 per diluted share in Q4 2020, an improvement over the $0.76 reported in Q4 2019. Notably, for 2020, earnings reached $1.90 per diluted share, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's smart meter deployment project has nearly reached completion in Washington, providing customers with real-time energy data and enabling proactive alerts to avoid bill surprises. Avista's Rattlesnake Flat Wind Farm, with its 57 turbines, commenced operations in December 2020, generating 50 megawatts of renewable energy. The company has implemented a comprehensive wildfire resiliency plan with an investment of $330 million over its 10-year span. Recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies in 2021, Avista has raised its dividend for the 19th consecutive year. The company anticipates investing $415 million in capital expenditures in 2021, with a focus on maintaining and modernizing its infrastructure. Earnings guidance for 2021-2023 has been initiated, with ranges set at $1.96 to $2.16, $2.18 to $2.38, and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share, respectively."
FCN_q4_2021.txt,"A copy of which is available on our Investor Relations website at www.
During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow.
Lastly, there are two items that have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website for your reference.
To ensure our disclosures are consistent, these slides provide the same details as they have historically, and as I have said, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
With these formalities out of the way, I'm joined by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer.
Mollie, can you hear me OK?
Let me start with a couple of preliminary remarks before we get into it.
So I apologize for the inconvenience and want to express our appreciation for you all, juggling your calendars to be here.
Second, my second point was going to be, I thought a positive point.
I was going to, maybe for the first time ever, begin to talk a little positively on the COVID situation.
And I was going to express my hope that we are finally, in many places around the world and I hope where you are, starting to see some movement toward the normality.
I still hope that, but I think the events in the Ukraine in the last little while, remind us that the hope to normality, unfortunately, is not just limited to COVID.
So I wish many good wishes to you and any colleagues, family, friends who are affected by that situation.
Let me turn to what I think is a much more positive set of messages.
As I'm sure many of you have by now have already seen, 2021 was another terrific year in the face of the global pandemic, and as we'll talk about, the worst restructuring market in probably the last 15 years, we delivered another record year.
And let me stress that word another.
We've now had 7 years in a row of adjusted earnings per share growth.
7 years in a row in the face of COVID, fluctuating restructuring markets, turning around core strategies, expanding geographies, entering new adjacencies, lumpiness from big jobs coming or going, heightened competition, and attracting talent among lots of other challenges.
7 years in a row of growth in adjusted EPS, which is the easiest thing to measure, but also, to me, far more important in the underlying drivers of those financial results.
The talent level of our organization, the ambition of it, the energy, the commitment of our people, the leadership, the number of great assignments we are working on, the client relationships we forged, and the enhancement of our reputation that all those factors have driven.
We don't have a single business that has guaranteed automatic growth every quarter.
In fact, if you look back over these several years, many of our teams in sub businesses during this period were down multiple quarters in a row, as they face difficult markets or made big investments, or had big jobs end.
What I believe our results have shown is that over any extended period of time, those short-term factors don't matter.
Rather over any extended period of time when our teams do the right things, they control our destiny.
We create our own future.
Over time, we have shown ourselves able to attract great talent to support the growth of that talent in our organization, to double down and reinforce core positions in core markets, to expand into new adjacencies, and as a consequence of all that, make ourselves ever better able to serve our clients, to build our businesses, to build our brand.
It is that commitment, those efforts by our leaders and our teams that have allowed us to grow seven years in a row.
And over those last four years -- in the last four years of that, in the face of good markets and bad markets, to average double-digit organic top-line growth.
To me, that demonstrates something important.
It demonstrates that FTI is not the cork on the restructuring wave that some described us as when I joined.
Rather, I think our teams have shown that when we do the right things, we have multiple, multiple businesses that are each powerful growth engines, engines that, of course, can get buffeted by markets or other short-term factors over any extended period of time, engines that could plow through markets, plow through them and find their way toward success in attracting and developing talent, success in brand building assignments and success in financial results.
Over the past several years, I believe we've seen examples of that in every business.
This year, in the resilience of CF, the comeback of FLC in some parts of Econ business, in the last several years, the extraordinary performance of our tech business following the strategic changes they made five years ago or the performance of our stratcom business over now seven years.
And I think the story is similar, if you think about it instead of by segment but by geography.
Just think about the challenges our teams had of taking on difficult positions in, say, Australia or LATAM.
They were not small, nor is the challenge of conquering new markets in Europe.
But that's why I think our teams very much deserve the sense of excitement and pride that they have when they turned those platforms positions into platforms for growth.
For the second point, let me pick up on that word platform.
What I'd like to underscore is that to me, the successes we have been having are not the end, but rather the beginning.
The success we've had has left us with powerful platforms that we can leverage going forward to extend that growth, to build upon it.
The success we've had in stability now to bet boldly in Germany and France, in The Netherlands, in China, in the Middle East, and in other places in a way that we could never have done a few years ago.
It gives us the ability to invest behind that successful tech business and that successful Stratcom business to drive our investigations business, to grow all those non-restructuring services in CorpFin, and in the face of a slow restructuring market to commit to continue to grow that business, to extend that global leadership, confident that it will eventually pay off in a big way and brand assignments in leadership positions in attracting great talent.
To me, to my knowledge, this company has never had such a rich set of opportunities before it as we do today.
And that brings me to the third point to preview something Ajay will discuss, which is there's always near-term risk in these sorts of investments.
Let me spend a minute on that.
As you know, our investments are typically in hiring.
If one instead buys a company, the investment shows up in its capital.
If on the other hand, you hire a lot of people, it shows up in EBITDA.
This year, our ambition is to have the highest organic growth rate during my tenure and I guess is during the company's entire history, the highest organic growth rate.
There is no way to make those sorts of bold bets without facing some short-term financial risk.
And if you want to underscore some of the negatives, we're making those bets at a time when our most profitable business, our restructuring business, is facing market demand that is lower than it's been in 15 years according to one measure and 20 years according to another measure.
And we no longer have the rollover of the large restructuring jobs from the early parts of the 2020.
And we're facing compensation pressure due to wage inflation in a tight talent market.
And at the same time, we're expecting rising SG&A expenses due to a rebound in travel expenses post COVID, as well as investments in infrastructure, to support the growth.
So one can get worried about the number of bets we're making.
One could wonder in the face of that, could we cut back on our bets.
Of course, we could.
But let me underscore something else.
I don't believe that's how one makes a company like this soar.
It's not how we've built this company over the last seven years.
It's not how we've achieved the growth we have.
My experience is when you have great people and great bets to make, you commit to those people, you commit to those opportunities and you make those bets.
And you live with any potential short-term dislocations in the P&L.
Because if you do, even if there are short-term dislocations in the P&L in a couple of quarters or a year in the medium term, the company soars, it delivers for your clients.
It delivers for the people whose energy and sweat makes that success happen.
And ultimately, thereby it delivers for the shareholders, as you have seen now over the last seven years.
So we are making those bets this year.
And there is some risk in the near-term P&L.
But I will say those bets, those opportunities have left me never more excited about where we can take this company over the next while.
I so look forward to sharing that journey with each of you.
I will begin with some highlights from our full year 2021 performance.
Revenues of $2.78 billion increased $314.9 million from $2.46 billion in 2020.
GAAP earnings per share of $6.65 increased $0.98 from $5.67 in 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share of $6.76 increased $0.77 from $5.99 in 2020 and adjusted EBITDA of $354 million was up $21.7 million from $332.3 million in 2020.
Our record performance this year is primarily because of 12.8% revenue growth, once again demonstrating how beneficial it is to have the breadth of our service offerings.
In 2021, demand continued to decline for restructuring, often our highest margin service offering as access to capital remained abundant and many pandemic-related moratoriums and insolvency proceedings were extended.
Conversely, the continued high level of liquidity in the market spurred record levels of M&A activity, which drove strong demand for our economic consulting and technology segments, as well as our transactions practice within our corporate finance and restructuring segment.
Our forensic and litigation consulting, or FLC segment, which was heavily impacted by pandemic-related travel restrictions and core closures in 2020, saw activity levels rebound across almost all practice areas in 2021.
So FLC has not yet reached pre-COVID-19 levels of business activity across the entire segment.
Lastly, our strategic communications segment recovered well from COVID-related impacts in 2020 and delivered a record year.
We also continue to invest in people.
Our total headcount increased 7.3% year over year on top of the 13.5% increase in total headcount in 2020.
Revenue growth more than offset the increase in direct costs, primarily from headcount growth and higher variable compensation, and an increase in SG&A expenses.
Now I will turn to fourth quarter results.
For the quarter, revenue of $676.2 million increased $49.7 million or 7.9%, with revenues increasing across all business segments compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.07, compared to $1.57 in the prior-year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, which excludes $0.06 of noncash interest expense related to our 2023 convertible notes, compared to adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 in the prior-year quarter.
Of note, the fourth quarter of 2020 included a significant tax benefit resulting from the use of foreign tax credits in the U.S. and a deferred tax benefit arising from an intellectual property license agreement between our U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries, which boosted both fourth quarter of 2020 GAAP and adjusted earnings per share by $0.32.
Net income of $38.2 million, compared to $55.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA of $62 million, compared to $82.3 million in the prior-year quarter.
Now turning to our performance at the segment level for the fourth quarter.
In corporate finance and restructuring, revenues of $231.5 million increased 5.3% compared to Q4 of 2020.
The increase was due to higher demand for business transformation and transaction services, as well as an increase in pass-through revenues and success fees, which was partially offset by lower demand for restructuring services compared to the prior-year quarter.
Business transformation and transactions represented 62%, while restructuring represented 38% of segment revenues this quarter.
This compares to business transformation and transactions representing 44% and restructuring representing 56% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
As business transformation and transactions grew 50%, while restructuring revenues declined 27%.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $22.2 million or 9.6% of segment revenues, compared to $35.4 million or 16.1% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
This decrease was primarily due to higher compensation, which was largely related to an increase in variable compensation and higher SG&A expenses.
In FLC, revenues of $138 million increased 8.5% compared to the prior-year quarter.
The increase was primarily due to higher demand for health solutions and investigation services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $8.5 million or 6.2% of segment revenues, compared to $7.6 million or 6% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
This increase was due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses and compensation.
Economic consulting's revenues of $172.3 million increased 7.4% compared to Q4 of 2020.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand for non-M&A-related antitrust and financial economic services, which was partially offset by lower demand for M&A-related antitrust services compared to the prior-year quarter.
Non-M&A-related antitrust services represented 33% and M&A-related antitrust services represented 20% of total segment revenues for the fourth quarter.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $30 million or 17.4% of segment revenues, compared to $31.3 million or 19.5% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.
This decrease was primarily due to higher compensation.
In technology, revenues of $64.6 million increased 10.2% compared to Q4 of 2020.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand for investigations and litigation services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $7.8 million or 12.1% of segment revenues, compared to $10.2 million or 17.3% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
This decrease was primarily due to higher compensation, which includes an increase in variable compensation and the impact of a 14.7% increase in billable headcount, as well as higher SG&A expenses.
Lastly, in strategic communications, revenues of $69.9 million increased 15.5% compared to Q4 of 2020.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand for corporate reputation and public affairs services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $14.9 million or 21.4% of segment revenues, compared to $11.7 million or 19.4% of segment revenues in the prior-year quarter.
This increase was due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in compensation and SG&A expenses.
I will now discuss certain cash flow and balance sheet items.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $355.5 million, compared to $327.1 million in the prior year.
Free cash flow of $286.9 million in 2021, compared to $292.2 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in net cash used for purchases of property and equipment, which includes capital expenditures related to our new office in New York City.
There were no share repurchases in Q4 of 2021.
For the full year 2021, we repurchased 422,000 shares at an average price of $109.37, for a total cost of $46.1 million.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $494 million -- $494.5 million.
Total debt net of cash of negative $178.2 million on December 31, 2021, decreased $199.5 million compared to December 31, 2020.
Turning to our 2022 guidance.
We are, as usual, providing guidance for revenues and EPS.
We estimate that revenues for 2022 will be between $2.92 billion and $3.045 billion.
We expect our earnings per share to range between $6.40 and $7.20.
Of note, due to our adoption of a new accounting standard change that went into effect on January 1, 2022, we will not record noncash interest expense related to our 2023 convertible notes.
As such, assuming no other future special charges or adjustments, we currently expect earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share to be the same in 2022.
Additionally, pursuant to the first supplemental indenture for our 2023 convertible notes that was effective on January 1, 2022, the company is now required to settle the principal amount of our 2023 convertible notes that is due upon conversion in cash only versus at our option in cash or stock or a combination.
We retained the option of settling the premium, if any, due upon conversion of our 2023 convertible notes in cash or stock or a combination.
Importantly, none of these changes affect the calculation of adjusted earnings per share in the prior periods.
Turning to our guidance.
Our 2022 guidance range incorporates several assumptions.
First, as we have the wherewithal, intent, and opportunity to invest for growth, our plans include aggressive hiring globally.
Though there is no certainty that we will be successful in such hiring, aggressive headcount additions typically result in reduced profitability in the short term.
Coupled with investment in headcount, there is also increasing pressure on wages, and not all of this expense may be recoverable in price increases.
Second, though we believe we are the leader in restructuring globally, and we intend to maintain that position, we currently expect restructuring activity to improve only moderately over the course of 2022.
Additionally, many of the large restructuring engagements we supported in 2020 and 2021 has now concluded.
Moody's trailing 12-month global default rate for speculative-grade corporate issuers was 1.7% as of the end of 2021, down from 6.9% in December of 2020.
Moody's is currently forecasting that this rate will fall to a bottom of 1.5% in Q2 of 2022 and will gradually rise to 2.4% by the end of 2022.
Some analysts don't expect a rebound in restructuring activity until 2023.
Third, global M&A activity, which drives demand in our economic consulting and technology segments, as well as our transactions business and corporate finance and restructuring was at record levels in 2021.
Though we currently expect that this elevated level of activity will continue, regulatory scrutiny, crystal policy, and other events globally may dampen such demand.
Fourth, demand in our FLC segment improved significantly in 2021 compared to pandemic-related lows in performance in 2020.
However, over the course of 2021, demand for these services weakened.
Our current expectation is for a rebound in such demand in 2022.
Fifth, certain aspects of SG&A such as travel and entertainment, have remained depressed due to the pandemic.
Our expectation is that in 2022, SG&A may revert back closer to the per-person levels we saw in 2019.
Sixth, we expect a higher effective tax rate in 2022.
We currently expect our full year 2022 tax rate to range between 22% and 25%, which compares to 21.1% in 2021.
Overall, based on our expectation for a gradual improvement in demand for restructuring and FLC services, our guidance assumes that the second half of 2022 will be stronger than the first half.
I must point out that our assumptions define a midpoint and a range of guidance around such midpoint, which I characterize as our current best judgment.
Often, we find actual results are beyond such range, because ours is largely a fixed cost business in the short term and small variations in revenue may have an outsized impact on income.
And now, I will close my remarks today by emphasizing a few key themes.
First, we believe FTI is unique in having such a diverse mix of services and that helps us thrive regardless of business cycle.
Second, our investment to build expertise in areas like information governments, privacy and cybersecurity, public affairs, and in industry verticals like energy, power and renewables and financial services and in geographies, including Continental Europe, the Middle East, and Australia are paying off, and we intend to double down on these and other investments.
Non-U.S. revenues have more than doubled in the last five years, while U.S. revenues have grown by a third over that time frame.
Third, our leadership remains focused on growth with strong staff utilization and realization.
And finally, our business generates excellent free cash flow, and our balance sheet is exceptionally strong.
We have the capacity to continue to boost shareholder value through organic growth, share buybacks, and acquisitions when we see the right ones.
","FTI Consulting delivered another record year in 2021 with $2.78 billion in revenue, showcasing the strength of its diversified service offerings amidst fluctuating restructuring markets. While the restructuring business faced lower demand, strong performance in the economic consulting, technology, and corporate finance and restructuring segments offset this decline. Notably, the company achieved double-digit organic top-line growth over the past four years, demonstrating the resilience of multiple growth engines. The future looks bright, with ambitious plans to invest heavily in talent, particularly in areas such as information governance, cybersecurity, and industry verticals. Despite short-term financial risks associated with these investments, the company believes these bets will drive long-term growth. FTI's guidance for 2022 includes potential volatility but projects adjusted EPS and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $7.20, with revenue estimated between $2.92 billion and $3.045 billion."
OMC_q2_2021.txt,"We have posted to www.
I hope you're staying safe and healthy.
We are pleased to kick off today's call by reporting that we've rounded the corner into positive growth.
We had extremely strong results top and bottom line and continue to make very good progress on several of our strategic initiatives.
Organic growth for the second quarter was a positive 24.4%.
This growth was broad based across our agencies, geographies, disciplines, and client sectors.
We experienced a significant increase in spend from existing clients as the effects of the pandemic subsided and we benefited from strong new business wins.
EBIT was $568 million in the quarter, an increase of 67% versus the second quarter of 2020.
Q2 2021 included a gain of $50.5 million from the sale of ICON International in early June.
In Q2 2020, EBIT included $278 million of charges related to the repositioning actions.
Excluding gains and charges, EBIT margin was 14.5% in the quarter compared to 12.2% in Q2 2020.
Phil will provide further details on expected impact of the sale of ICON on our results for the balance of the year.
As we stated on our last call, we view 2019 as a reasonable proxy for our ongoing margin expectations.
Excluding the sale of ICON, our six months 2021 EBIT margin was 14% which is in line with our EBIT margin of 13.9% for the first six months of 2019.
Net income was $348 million in the second quarter, an increase of 75% from the second quarter of 2020 and earnings per share was $1.60 per share, an increase of 74%.
The net impact on the gain on the sale of ICON, which was offset by an interest expense charge related to the early retirement of debt increased earnings per share in Q2 2021 by $0.14 per share.
Our leaders took difficult and effective actions over the past year and a half.
At the same time, they remained laser-focused on the health of their teams, servicing our clients, winning new business, and managing their cost structures.
Our ability to navigate in this environment and come out the other side with such strong results is a testament to their commitment as well as the dedication and tireless effort of our people around the world.
Turning now to our performance by geography.
Every region had double-digit growth in the quarter.
The U.S. was up just shy of 20% in the quarter.
All U.S. disciplines had double-digit growth except for healthcare, which was up in the low-single digits.
It was the one discipline that grew in Q2 of 2020.
Other North America was up 37.1%, the U.K. was up 23.8% with all disciplines in double-digits.
Overall growth in the Euro and non-Euro region was 34.5%.
In Asia Pacific, we had 27.9% increase with all major countries experiencing double-digit growth.
Our events business in China had another quarter of strong performance.
Latin America was up 20.8% and the Middle East and Africa increased 42.8%.
By discipline, all areas were up year-over-year as follows: Advertising and media 29.8%; CRM Precision Marketing, 25%; CRM Commerce and Brand Consultancy 15.2%; CRM Experiential 53%; CRM Execution and Support 22.7%; PR 15.1% and Healthcare 4.5%.
Looking forward, we expect to continue to see positive organic growth as client spend increases albeit at a slower pace than we experienced in Q2.
Our management teams are continuing to align costs with our revenues as markets reopen around the world.
Many of our companies are hiring staff to service an increasing client spend and the new business wins and we are seeing some pressure on our staff costs, particularly in the U.S. as the labor markets remain tight.
We are also beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend as government restrictions have eased.
Based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we are developing practices, particularly with respect to travel that should allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in addressable spend.
We expect that the increase in addressable spend in the second half of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce.
Turning to our cash flow, we again performed very strongly.
For the first half of the year, we generated approximately $800 million in free cash flow.
As we indicated last quarter, in addition to our dividend increase, in May, our Board approved the reinstatement of our share repurchase program.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $102 million in shares.
We took further actions to reduce our debt during the quarter.
In late April, we issued $800 million of senior notes due in 2031.
The proceeds from this issuance together with cash on hand were used to repay $1.25 billion of senior notes due in 2022.
As a result of these actions, our balance sheet and credit ratings remain very strong.
While we are very optimistic about our future prospects, we remain vigilant and are maintaining flexibility in our planning as conditions can quickly change.
As we recently experienced in markets like Brazil, India, and Japan, the pandemic remains a significant health risk.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and proud of how we've navigated through the pandemic.
Our results reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to changes in the market and deliver through down economic cycles.
Let me now turn to the progress on our strategic and operational initiatives.
As I mentioned in early June, we completed the sale of ICON International, our specialty media business.
The divestiture was part of our continuing realignment of portfolio of businesses and is consistent with our plan to dispose of companies that are no longer aligned with our long-term strategies and investment priorities.
With the closing of this transaction, we are substantially complete with disposals.
We expect our primary focus moving forward will be on pursuing accretive acquisitions in the areas of precision marketing, market [Phonetic] and digital transformation, commerce, media and healthcare.
We have ramped up our M&A efforts in these areas and are pleased with the opportunities we are seeing.
We remain disciplined with respect to our strategic approach and valuation parameters.
Operationally, Omnicom continues to successfully deliver to our clients a comprehensive suite of marketing and communication services supported by technology and analytic capabilities around the world.
The leaders of our practice area agencies and global clients have used this formula to strengthen our relationships and grow with existing clients as well as pursue new business.
Importantly, our organization allows our leadership teams to quickly mobilize our assets to deliver strategic solutions for our clients from across the group.
Whether their need is for integrated services across regions or more bespoke individualized solutions in specific countries, we can simplify and organize our services in a manner that meets our clients' needs.
For example, we have a long history of providing integrated services to some of the world's largest brands such as Apple, AT&T, Nissan, and State Farm and we continue to be successful in winning new business.
A good example of this is our win with Philips who named Omnicom as their global integrated service partner for creative, media and communications.
Over months long and highly competitive pitch, we were able to demonstrate the strength of our agencies and the delivery model that connects creativity, culture, and technology to position Philips as a leader in the changing health industry.
Another example of our integrated creative, media and communications offerings is our recent win of the baby wipes brand WaterWipes.
We also serve clients and consistently win new business across dedicated service areas and geographies.
For example, some of the wins this quarter in addition to the ones mentioned above were BBDO being named global lead strategic and creative agency partner for the Facebook App; Discover naming team TBWA its brand creative agency of record; JetBlue hiring Adam & Eve as its new global creative partner; Red Bull awarding PHD in its media business in North America; BBDO being awarded Audi creative duties and social media communications in Singapore; and PHD winning Audi media business in China; and Virgin Atlantic selecting Lucky Generals as its lead creative agency.
Our comprehensive suite of services and our ability to simplify how we bring them to our clients will continue to drive our success.
In the second half, we expect to see an increase in new business activity across industry sectors including CPG, luxury, healthcare, retail and automotive.
I'm confident that our exceptional talent, range of services, and our ability to organize our ability to organize our offerings to meet the needs of potential clients will allow us to capture more than our fair share of new business.
Our constant innovation and service delivery has also resulted in highly regarded industry awards.
At Cannes Lions Live 2021, our agencies were recognized for their excellence in both the creative and media disciplines.
Omnicom's global creative networks BBDO, DDB, and TBWA placed in the Top 10 of the network over the festival competition taking the highly coveted title, AMV BBDO was named Agency of the Festival.
Omnicom media agencies, PHD and OMD earned first and second place respectively in the Media Network of the Festivals competition and overall, more than 160 Omnicom agencies from 45 countries won more than 180 Lions.
This impressive showing at Cannes Lions is just one example of how our agencies excel.
They received a number of other industry awards, which include FleishmanHillard being named Campaign Global PR Agency of the Year and TBWA APAC winning Digital Network of the Year.
Goodby Silverstein & Partners making Ad Age's A-List and TBWA being named as an Agency Standout.
DDB Worldwide winning 2021 Network of the Year at the 100th anniversary of the ADC Awards hosted by The One Club and DDB Germany being named Agency of the Year.
These awards are a direct reflection of our relentless pursuit of creative excellence.
Our best-in-class talent is what defines Omnicom and makes us an award-winning company.
With this in mind, we are constantly looking to invest in our people and create opportunities across the enterprise including at the C-Suite level and throughout our senior leadership.
A recent addition to our practice area leadership is Chris Foster, who was appointed CEO of Omnicom's Public Relations Group.
Chris will oversee our entire PR portfolio focusing on talent, innovation, and cross-agency collaboration to drive growth.
I'm confident that his track record of leading global growth initiatives, counseling executive level clients, and driving business development will lead to continued success of OPRG.
John Doolittle has been elevated as new Chairman of OPRG.
Another key leadership position we recently created is focused on our environmental sustainability initiatives.
Last week, we appointed Karen van Bergen as Chief Environmental Sustainability Officer.
Karen will be responsible for overseeing our climate change initiatives and processes which includes setting measurable goals, policies, and partnerships that will reduce our carbon footprint.
This new position will be in addition to Karen's current role as EVP and Dean of Omnicom University.
Environmental sustainability is an area where we are doubling down on our efforts.
We established goals five years ago to lessen the impact of our operations on the environment and we are now looking to drive even more progress.
We are currently establishing new goals and commitments to reduce the carbon emissions produced by our operations and increase the amount of electricity we derive from renewable sources.
In addition to these internal goals, Omnicom has joined numerous industry initiatives that will serve as catalysts for change.
For example, several of our U.K. agencies have joined Ad Net Zero, the industry's initiative to achieve real net zero carbon emissions from the development, production, and media placement of advertising by the end of 2030 and we are a founding member of Change the Brief Alliance, which calls for the agencies and marketers to harness the power of their advertising to promote sustainable consumer choices and behaviors.
Karen is just the right leader for driving our initiatives in this critical area given her long tenure with Omnicom and excellent previous experience working on environmental initiatives at multinational corporations.
I have no doubt we will continue to raise the bar on our global operations in our work with organizations and clients to reduce our impact on the environment.
Another critical area we have intensified our efforts over the past 12 months is DE&I.
We have doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom over this time and we have established specific KPIs to measure our progress.
The KPIs are focused on hiring, advancement, promotion, retention, training, and employee resource groups.
This is a key step to ensuring DE&I is embedded across the leadership agenda with a full commitment and accountability of our network and practice area CEOs.
For Omnicom, DE&I starts at the top with our Board of Directors.
Currently, our Board is the most diverse in the S&P 500 with six women and four African American members including our Lead Independent Director.
We're also pleased that three of our 12 network and practice area CEOs are people of color or female.
While it is still too early to measure our progress, I'm pleased to report that a preliminary review of our employee diversity in the United States shows a meaningful increase in the number of diverse employees as of June 30th, 2021 compared to the end of 2020.
I look forward to a lot more progress being made in the months ahead.
Continuing to focus on our people, we are pleased many of them have returned to the office as government restrictions are reduced or eliminated.
We are encouraging our people to begin to make plans to return to offices as conditions improve in their local markets.
Overall, we believe a return to an office-centric culture will enable us to invent, collaborate, and learn together most effectively.
In turn, it will allow us to best serve our clients.
The return to office will be grounded in safety and flexibility and local leaders will determine what combination of office and remote work is most effective for their teams.
I personally look forward to reengaging in-person with our people and our clients over the coming weeks and months.
As John discussed in his remarks, while the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has moderated significantly as evidenced by our return to growth in Q2.
We expect our return to growth will continue in the second half.
However, as long as COVID-19 remains a public health threat, some uncertainty regarding economic conditions will continue, which could impact our clients' spending plans and the performance of our businesses may vary by geography and discipline.
Organic growth for the quarter was 24.4% or $682 million, which represents a significant increase compared to Q2 of 2020 which reflected the onset of the pandemic when revenue declined by 23% or $855 million.
In addition, in early June, we completed the disposition of ICON, our specialty media business, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $50.5 million.
The sale of ICON was consistent with our strategic plan and investment priorities and the disposition is not expected to have a material impact on our ongoing operating income for 2021.
Flipping to Slide 4 for a summary of our revenue performance for the second quarter.
In addition to our organic revenue growth of 24.4% for the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 5.4% in the quarter, higher than we anticipated entering the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year.
The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions decreased revenue by 2.2% primarily related to the sale of ICON.
As a result, our reported revenue in the second quarter increased 27.5% to $3.57 billion from the $2.8 billion we reported for Q2 of 2020.
I'll return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minute.
Turning back to Slide 1, our reported operating profit for the quarter increased to $568 million including the $50.5 million gain on the sale of ICON.
As you remember, our Q2 2020 results included a $278 million COVID-19 repositioning charge, which included severance actions, real estate lease impairments and terminations and related fixed asset charges as well as a loss on the disposition of several small non-core underperforming agencies.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.9%, up significantly from Q2 2020 even after excluding the gain on the sale of ICON in the current period and adding back the repositioning charge recorded in Q2 of 2020.
We also continued to see operating margin improvement year-over-year resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories including a reduction in travel and related costs as well as reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020.
Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $590 million and EBITDA margin was 16.5%.
Excluding the $50.5 million gain on the ICON disposition, EBITDA margin for Q2 2021 was 15.1%.
EBITDA margin in Q2 of 2020 after adding back the $278 million repositioning charge, was 12.9%.
We've also included a supplemental slide on Page 15 that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars to exclude the effects of the year-on-year FX changes.
As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our current revenues.
We also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization focusing on real estate portfolio management, back office services, procurement, and IT services.
As for the details, our salary and service costs are variable and fluctuate with revenue.
They increased by about $300 million versus Q2 of 2020 or $220 million on a constant dollar basis driven by the increase in our overall business activity.
We would also note that the Q2 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $49.2 million.
Third-party service costs increased by $275 million or $242 million on a constant dollar basis.
These costs include expenses incurred with third-party vendors when we act as a principal when performing services for our clients.
Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, increased by $4 million.
Excluding the impact of FX, these costs declined by $10 million in the quarter as we continued our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and we benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q2.
SG&A expenses increased by $21 million or $18 million on a constant dollar basis, again related to the return to more normal activities in the quarter.
And finally, depreciation and amortization declined by $3.6 million.
Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 increased $26.3 million period-over-period to $73.5 million.
Because of our solid working capital and cash flow performance during the pandemic period, in Q2 we determined we no longer needed the liquidity insurance we added in early April 2020 when we issued $600 million in debt and added a $400 million 364-day revolving credit facility.
In April 2021, the credit facility expired unused.
In May, we issued $800 million of 2.6% senior notes due 2031.
In June, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2.6% notes plus cash on hand were used to redeem early all of our outstanding $1.25 billion 3.625% notes that were due in May of 2022.
Gross interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 increased $26.6 million resulting from the loss we recognized on the early redemption of all the outstanding $1.2 billion of 3.625% 2022 senior notes.
Additionally, the impact of this refinancing activity reduced our leverage ratio to 2.2 times at June 30th, 2021 and is expected to result in lower interest expense on our debt in the second half of approximately $6 million as compared to the prior year.
Interest income in the second quarter of 2021 was relatively flat.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24.9%, down a bit from the effective tax rate we estimated for 2021 of between 26.5% to 27% primarily due to nominal taxes recorded on the book gain on sale.
Earnings from our affiliates was marginally negative for the quarter while the allocation of earnings to minority shareholders of certain of our agencies increased to $23.4 million.
As a result, we reported net income for the second quarter was $348.2 million.
While we restarted our share repurchase program during the second quarter, our diluted share count for the quarter increased slightly versus Q2 of last year to 217.1 million shares resulting from the year-over-year increase in our share price and the increase in common stock equivalents included in our diluted share count.
As a result, our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.60 versus the loss of $0.11 per share we reported in Q2 of 2020.
The gain on the sale of ICON and the loss on the early redemption of the 2022 senior notes resulted in a net increase of $31 million to net income or $0.14 to EPS.
As we previously discussed, the prior year period included the net impact of the repositioning charges which reduced last year's second quarter net income and earnings per share by $223.1 million and a $1.03 respectively.
On Slide 2 for your reference, we provide the summary P&L, EPS, and other information for the year-to-date period.
Now returning to the details of the changes in our revenue performance on Slide 4, our reported revenue for the second quarter was $3.57 billion, up $771 million or 27.5% from Q2 of 2020.
Turning to the FX impact, on a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our reported U.S. dollar revenue by 5.4% or $150.8 million, which was above the 3.5% to 4% increase that we estimated entering the quarter.
The strengthening of foreign currencies against the dollar was widespread.
It included most of our largest major foreign currencies.
In the quarter, the largest FX increases were driven by the strengthening of the euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan, and the Australian dollar.
In the quarter, the U.S. dollar only strengthened against the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble.
In light of the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to 2020, assuming FX rates continue where they currently stand, our estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by approximately 1.5% for the third quarter and 1% for the fourth quarter resulting in a full year projected increase of approximately 2.5%.
The impacts of our acquisition and disposition activities over the past 12 months primarily reflecting the ICON disposition as well as the recent acquisitions of Archbow and Areteans, during the second quarter of 2021 resulted in a net decrease in revenue of $62 million in the quarter or 2.2%.
Based on transactions that have been completed through June 30th of 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease revenue by between 6% to 7% for the third and fourth quarters resulting in a full year reduction of approximately 4%.
While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said with regard to dispositions, we are substantially complete.
Our organic growth of $682 million or 24.4% in the second quarter reflects strong performance across all of our major geographic markets and across all of our service disciplines.
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 5, for the second quarter, the split was 56% for advertising and 44% for marketing services.
As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was up nearly 30% primarily on the growth of our media businesses reflecting a strong recovery of activity within the media space.
Our global and national advertising agencies achieved strong growth this quarter although the pace of growth by agency remains somewhat mixed.
CRM Precision Marketing increased 25%.
Through the strength of their service offerings, the agencies within the discipline have delivered solid revenue performance throughout the pandemic and they continue to perform well.
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 15.2% but the performance within this discipline was mixed as our shopper marketing agencies cycled through the effects of recent client losses.
While organic revenue for CRM Experiential was up over 50%, it should be noted that events were virtually shut down as lockdowns took effect in March and April of 2020.
While government restrictions on events have been eased recently in certain markets, these businesses still face challenges regarding when they will return to pre-pandemic levels.
CRM Execution & Support was up 22.7% reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to Q2 of 2020 in our field marketing and merchandising and point-of-sale businesses while our non-for-profit businesses continue to lag.
PR was up 15.1% coming off pandemic lows in 2020.
And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 4.5% organically.
Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth in Q2 of 2020.
The performance of these agencies remained solid across the Group.
Now turning to the details of our regional mix of businesses on Page 6.
You can see the quarterly split was 51.5% in the U.S.; 3.3% for the rest of North America; 10.6% in the U.K.; 18.6% for the rest of Europe; 12.5% for Asia Pacific; 2% for Latin America; and 1% [Phonetic] for the Middle East and Africa.
In reviewing the details of our performance by region on Page 7, organic revenue in the second quarter in the U.S. was up nearly 20% or $316 million.
Our advertising discipline was positive for the quarter.
Our media agencies excelled in the quarter as did our CRM Precision Marketing agencies and our PR agencies and our Commerce and Brand Consulting category rebounded to growth in the quarter while our Healthcare agencies are flat versus last year when organic growth was 3.7% in the quarter.
Our other CRM domestic disciplines, Experiential and Execution & Support also performed well organically versus Q2 of 2020.
We expect it will take a bit longer for them to return to 2019 revenue levels as social distancing restrictions and pandemic concerns subside.
Outside the U.S., our other North American agencies are up 37% driven by the strength of our media and precision marketing agencies in Canada.
Our U.K. agencies were up 23.8% organically led by the performance of our CRM Precision Marketing, Advertising, and Healthcare agencies.
The rest of Europe was up 34.5% organically.
In the Eurozone, among our major markets, France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands were up greater than 30% organically while Spain was up in the mid-single digits.
Outside the Eurozone, organic growth was up around 35% during the quarter.
Organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was up 27.9% with our performance from our agencies in Australia, Greater China, India, and New Zealand leading the way.
Latin America was up 20.8% organically in the quarter with our agencies in Mexico and Colombia growing more than 20% and Brazil was up almost 17%.
And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was up over 40% for the quarter.
On Slide 8, we present our revenue by industry information on a year-to-date basis.
We've seen an improvement in performance across most industries with the overall mix of revenue by industry remaining relatively stable.
The travel and entertainment sector was boosted in Q2 of 2021 by increased activity related spend by clients in the entertainment category, which mitigated continued reduced spend levels for many of our travel and lodging clients.
Turning to our cash flow performance.
On Slide 9, you can see that the first six months of the year, we generated nearly $800 million of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, up over $70 million versus the first half of last year.
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 10, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $292 million, up about $10 million when compared to last year due to the $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly payments effective with the dividend payment we made in April.
Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $39 million.
Capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 were $23 million.
Acquisitions, which include our recently completed transactions as well as earnout payments, totaled $36 million and stock repurchases were $95 million, net of the proceeds from our stock plans reflecting the resumption of our share repurchases during the second quarter of this year.
As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $311 million of free cash flow during the first half of the year.
Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter as detailed on Slide 11, our total debt is $5.31 billion, down about $410 million since this time last year and down just over $500 million compared to year-end 2020.
Both changes reflecting the early retirement in Q2 of 2021 of $1.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes which were due in 2022 partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031.
In addition to the net reduction in debt of $450 million from the refinancing, the only other meaningful change was the net balance for the LTM period, was an increase of approximately $65 million resulting from the FX impact of converting our EUR1 billion denominated borrowings into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date.
Our net debt position as of June 30th was $922 million, up about $710 million from last year-end, but down $1.5 billion when compared to where we stood 12 months ago.
The increase in net debt since year-end was a result of the typical uses of working capital that occur over the first half of the year totaling just under $1.1 billion which was partially offset by the $311 million we generated in free cash flow in the first half of the year.
Over the past 12 months, the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $790 million, positive changes in operating capital of $525 million, and the impact of FX on our cash and debt balances which decreased our net debt position by $154 million.
As for our debt ratios, as a result of our overall operating improvement versus Q2 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.2 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times.
And finally, moving to our historical returns on Page 12, the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio was 25.9% while our return on equity was 46.8%, both significantly better than our returns from 12 months ago.
","Omnicom reported positive growth and strong results in the second quarter of 2021, with revenue increasing by 27.5% to $3.57 billion. Organic growth was 24.4%, driven by increased spend from existing clients and strong new business wins. Operating margin also improved to 15.9% from 2.2% in Q2 2020, highlighting cost management efforts. All disciplines experienced year-over-year growth, led by Advertising and Media, CRM Precision Marketing, and CRM Experiential. Geographically, every region showed double-digit growth, with Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific standing out. The company expects positive organic growth for the second half of 2021, with a gradual return to normal in addressable spend. Despite the pandemic, Omnicom remains optimistic about the future and is actively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships in high-growth areas."
B_q2_2021.txt,"Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to our investors.
These measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.
Please consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.
Continuing with a clear focus on our business recovery, Barnes Group produced another solid quarter of year-over-year and sequential improvement in orders, organic sales, operating margins and earnings.
With total backlog at its highest point since the end of 2019, expanding revenue outlook, strengthening industrial end markets and the progressing aerospace environment, we feel confident about the prospects for the second half of the year.
More importantly, our improving financial results continue to be supported by significant investments in growth initiatives, that position us to sustain performance over the long-term.
In the second quarter, organic sales were up 31% with sizable gains in both our operating segments.
Industrial was particularly strong, while Aerospace continues to build momentum after the significant effects of the pandemic on that industry.
Similarly, orders were very good as we generated a book-to-bill of 1.3 times, with Aerospace driving that result.
Our total backlog stands at $984 million at quarter-end, reflecting a 12% increase from the end of the first quarter.
Adjusted operating income and margins were up 41% and 40 bps respectively.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.45, up 67% from last year.
Again, really great results by the team.
Moving now to a discussion of end-market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.
Our Industrial segment generated another strong quarter with each of our businesses generating excellent year-over-year organic orders and revenue growth.
For the segment, orders were up 37% organically with a book-to-bill of approximately 1 times.
Industrial sales grew 42% with organic sales growth of 35%.
Of note, second quarter total industrial sales were ahead of pre-COVID second quarter of 2019.
As a macro level backdrop like last quarter manufacturing PMIs in the U.S. and Euro zone remains strong, with China in the expansion territory, though not as robust as the other regions.
Now with expanding the ongoing semiconductor issue that's dampening automotive bills, IHS predicts -- still predicts 2021 global production to be up 10% over the last year and up an additional 11% in 2022.
With respect to new platform launches and major refresh programs of light vehicles, 2021, 2022 and 2023 are forecast to be sustained at a healthy level.
Within our Molding Solutions business, we saw a good orders quarter up 17% organically.
Automotive, Packaging and Personal Care, each saw double-digit orders growth, with Automotive being particularly strong.
Medical mold orders took a dip in the quarter, not an unusual dynamic as these large ticket products can be somewhat lumpy.
Organic sales were up 22% year-over-year, while sequential sales were up 13%.
On many occasions, you've heard me talk about investments in growth that we're making across the businesses to drive our sales and marketing efforts, innovation, and new product development.
Recently I discussed the launch of our new vacuum gripper technology in our Automation business.
At Molding Solutions, we are also working hard to expand our leading technology-based solutions across multiple end markets.
A prime example relative to the public health crisis we've all experienced over the last year or so, is our mold technology serving the global medical market and our investment and development of a new product offering known as Pipette Tips.
Pipette tips are a high volume critical item used in the world of laboratory diagnostics for collecting a precise amount of liquid and transferring it to a test apparatus.
This market has expanded recently in order to meet the enormous demand brought on by the pandemic.
Our customers require a technology-based solution that consistently delivers high output rates with extremely tight tolerances.
The pipette tip's geometry must be precise to ensure the test results are both accurate and reliable.
Our Molding Solutions business has developed a mold concept, specifically for production of pipette tips, which not only meets strict technical requirements, but also focuses on superior reliability, and ease of maintenance.
To maximize up time in an operation that runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the configuration of the mold allows for required maintenance of worn parts to occur right on the machine to replaceable modular units or clusters allowing for minimum disruption and production to come quickly back online.
Delivering leading technology-based solutions such as the pipette tip mold system, and focusing on customer success allows our Molding Solutions business to demonstrate extraordinary value.
To close my Molding Solutions comments, our sales outlook has improved once again, as we now forecast organic sales growth in the mid-teens, a bit better than our prior view.
At Force and Motion control organic orders were up over 50% with organic sales up double digits.
FMC's two major end markets, sheet metal forming and general industrial, both saw robust orders and sales growth.
On a sequential basis, sales increased 6%.
We continue to see full-year 2021 organic sales growth to be up mid-teens.
Engineered Components once again generated high double-digit organic orders and revenue growth on a year-over-year basis.
Sequentially, we saw a modest step in orders and sales as automotive semiconductor issues weigh on automotive end markets.
As a result of this issue, we saw our second quarter revenue impact of approximately $5 million, very much aligned with the exposure we disclosed in April.
We expect the third quarter semiconductor revenue impact of $3 million and another $1 million in the fourth quarter.
Our general industrial markets remained very healthy and are helping to mitigate some of the impact.
Our outlook for organic sales growth is now forecast to be up in high-teens, a step up from our prior view of mid-teens growth.
At Automation, as economies rebound, the migration toward industrial robotics, a more complex end-of-arm tooling solutions continues to be favorable.
On a year-over-year basis, organic orders and sales growth were well into the double digits.
Sequential growth in orders and sales also continues along a healthy trend.
We now expect 2021 to deliver organic growth of approximately 20%, better than our April expectation of mid-teens growth.
To wrap up on Industrial, clearly our year-over-year growth rates across the segment compared favorably to last year's second quarter, which was the trough quarter relative to the impact of the pandemic.
Comparables gets more difficult over the next few quarters, though we expect to perform well.
At Industrial, we see 2021 organic growth in the mid-teens with operating margins of 12% to 13%.
Our margin expectation is down slightly as we continue to make strategic investments in our people, products and systems.
However, we view these investments as critical to setting us up for long-term growth and profitability.
Additionally, in the near-term, we are managing supply chain challenges, which Julie will address in a moment.
It's fair to say that the environment continues to improve.
Airbus and Boeing narrow-body production levels are anticipated to increase meaningfully, although wide-body recovery is still a way off.
Global traffic and capacity trends are improving and that all bodes well for a strengthening aftermarket.
At the segment level we've been seeing good sequential sales growth and expect that trend to continue.
And beginning this quarter, we'll see favorable year-over-year comparisons as we move through the year.
Aerospace sales improved 23% over last year and 6% sequentially from the first quarter.
OEM led the growth while aftermarket was down modestly, which we believe is simply timing.
A highlight of the quarter was our strong OEM orders which generated a book-to-bill of 2.5 times.
That's three quarters in a row with a strong order to book.
This reflects our customer's confidence in a narrow body ramp, as most of the order volume relates to the LEAP engine platform.
Our 2021 outlook for Aerospace is unchanged from our prior view.
Total Aerospace sales are expected to be up low-single digits.
Within the segment, OEM sales are forecast to be up mid-single digits, MRO down low-single digits, and spare parts down in the mid-teens.
Segment operating margin is anticipated to be 13% to 14%, slightly higher than our April outlook.
In closing, the second quarter finished with excellent results, positive momentum and a healthy outlook for the remainder of the year.
Several growth initiatives are been driven across the organization to help advance our recovery, and position us to execute on our profitable growth strategy.
While supply chain and inflation risks are present, our teams are doing a good job mitigating the impacts, and implementing pricing actions as appropriate.
We remain confident in the strength of our end markets and our team's ability to convert that into new business opportunities.
Now, let me pass the call over to Julie Streich, our new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for details on our quarterly performance.
Julie brings to us a highly qualified business background and proven leadership in corporate finance.
We're very happy to have you as part of our team.
I'm happy to be here and look forward to working with you and the leadership team as we accelerate the ongoing transformation of our portfolio.
It's an exciting time for Barnes and its likewise exciting to be part of cresting the go-forward story.
Let me begin with highlights of our second quarter results on Slide 6 of our supplement.
Second quarter sales were $321 million, up 36% from the prior year period, with organic sales increasing 31% and foreign exchange generating a positive impact of 5%.
As the impacts of the pandemic lessen, our well-positioned businesses are seeing recovery in almost all our end markets.
Operating income was $38.5 million versus $10.1 million a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes restructuring charges of $700,000 this year and $17.7 million last year, operating income of $39.2 million was up 41% and adjusted operating margin of 12.2% was up 40 basis points from a year ago.
Interest expense was $4.5 million, an increase of $600,000 as a result of a higher average interest rate, offset in part by lower average borrowings.
We'll see a sequentially lower average interest rate beginning in the third quarter as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved, driven by the recovery in our business and active cash management.
For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 25.3%, compared with 89% in the second quarter of 2020, and 37.6% for full year 2020.
As compared to the full year 2020 rate, our second quarter tax rate is benefiting from the absence of tax expense related to the sale of the Seeger business in 2020, a net benefit related to certain foreign tax matters in the current year quarter, and a favorable mix in earnings based on tax jurisdictions.
Net income was $24.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $600,000 or $0.01 per diluted share a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, net income per share of $0.45 was up 67% from $0.27 a year ago.
Adjusted net income per share in the current quarter excludes $0.01 of restructuring charges and a net foreign tax benefit of $0.04, while the prior-year period excludes $0.26 of restructuring charges.
Now I'll turn to our segment performance, beginning with Industrial.
Second quarter Industrial sales were $235 million, up 42% from a year ago, while organic sales increased 35%.
As Patrick noted, the strong growth reflects volume increases across all our SBUs.
Favorable foreign exchange increased sales by $12.4 million or 7%.
As has been the case since June of last year, we have delivered another sequential quarter of sales improvement with second quarter sales up 7% from the first quarter of 2021.
Industrial's operating profit was $27.3 million versus an operating loss of $300,000 last year.
Excluding restructuring costs of $200,000 this year and $15.8 million last year, adjusted operating profit was $27.5 million versus $15.5 million a year ago.
Adjusted operating profit benefited from the contribution of higher organic sales volumes and the continuing impact of cost actions taken last year.
Partially offsetting these items were higher personnel costs, primarily incentive compensation, and costs incurred in support of segment growth initiatives.
Adjusted operating margin was 11.7%, up 230 basis points from a year ago.
Supply chain concerns including raw material availability, inflation, and increased freight costs continue to be a watch item.
We do have raw material escalation clauses in certain long-term contracts, and are able to price newly quoted business to account for increasing costs.
We continue to work these issues and are taking steps to mitigate our risk exposures.
In the second quarter, we experienced approximately $1.5 million of combined freight and material inflation in the Industrial segment.
For the second half of 2021, our Industrial outlook includes $2 million of inflation impacts.
Moving now to Aerospace.
Sales were $86 million, up 23% from a year ago, driven by a 37% increase in our OEM business.
Our aftermarket business which continues to be impacted by lingering effects of the global pandemic, experienced a 2% sales decrease, with MRO down 8% and spare parts up 14%.
We expect the aftermarket to sequentially improve as we move through the second half of the year.
On a sequential basis, total Aerospace sales increased 6% from the first quarter of 2021.
Operating profit was $11.3 million, an increase of 8%.
Excluding $400,000 of restructuring cost this year and $1.9 million last year, adjusted operating profit was $11.7 million, down 5%, driven by higher incentive compensation and unfavorable mix.
Adjusted operating margin was 13.5%, down 400 basis points from a year ago.
Aerospace OEM backlog ended June at $694 million, up 16% from March 2021, and we expect to ship approximately 40% of this backlog over the next year.
Moving to cash flow performance.
Year-to-date cash provided by operating activities was $86 million versus $123 million last year, with free cash flow of $68 million, down from $103 million last year.
Capital expenditures were $18 million, down $2 million from a year ago.
Year-to-date operating cash flow in 2020 saw a $48 million benefit from working capital, as cash management with a significant focus during the pandemic.
While we have seen a modest working capital improvement in the first half, we won't see the same benefit in 2021 as we did last year as business rebounds.
Regarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as defined by our credit agreement was 2.9 times at quarter end, down from 3.1 times at the end of last quarter.
Our second quarter average diluted shares outstanding were $51.1 million.
During the second quarter under a pre-existing 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased 100,000 shares at an average price of $52.29, leaving approximately 3.6 million shares remaining available for repurchase under the Board's 2019 stock repurchase authorization.
Turning to Slide 7 of our supplement, let's discuss our updated financial outlook for 2021.
We now expect organic sales to be up 11% to 12% for the year, an increase from our prior view of up 10% to 12%, driven by strong Industrial growth.
FX is expected to have about a 2% favorable impact on sales, while divested Seeger revenues will have a small negative impact.
Adjusting op-- Adjusted operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 13%, consistent with our prior year.
We currently expect a small amount of residual restructuring charges to come through, which we will take as an adjustment to 2021 net income.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.98 per share, up 12% to 21% from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share.
Our current expectation reflects an increase at the lower end of our previous range of $1.78 to $1.98 and we expect second-half earnings per share to be weighted to the fourth quarter.
Rounding out a few other items.
Our interest expense forecast remains $16 million, while our other expense is forecast at $6.5 million, slightly less than our April outlook.
Estimated capex of $50 million, average diluted shares of $51 million and a full year tax rate of 30% are all consistent with our prior outlook.
Cash conversion is now anticipated to be greater than 110%, an increase over our prior expectation of 100%.
In closing, we continue to drive solid revenue gains across the organization and expect further improvement.
With many of our end markets demonstrating sustained recovery, our businesses are positioned to seize upon the opportunities presented by a stronger economy.
Improving financial performance, good cash generation, and a supportive balance sheet sets us up for a good second half of the year.
With a clear focus on executing our profitable growth plan, we'll continue to fund our strategic initiatives and pursue accretive acquisitions that will help us deliver superior performance over the long-term.
","Barnes Group's second quarter saw strong year-over-year and sequential improvement, with organic sales up 31% and adjusted earnings per share surging 67% to $0.45. Notably, total backlog reached $984 million, reflecting a 12% increase from Q1. The Industrial segment performed exceptionally well, with organic orders and revenue growth of 37% and 42%, respectively, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Aerospace also showed momentum, with OEM orders generating a strong book-to-bill of 2.5 times. For the full year, Barnes Group projects organic sales growth of 11% to 12%, driven by strong Industrial growth, and expects adjusted operating margin of 13%. Despite supply chain challenges and inflation, the company remains confident in its ability to execute its growth strategy and seize opportunities in recovering end markets."
KFY_q4_2021.txt,"Now, what a difference a year makes.
Last April was rather dark I think for all of us and May, with the George Floyd tragedy, was hopeless and, boy, I'll tell you this -- the Company has rebounded tremendously.
And in particular our colleagues have shown incredible resilience over the past year.
I'm proud of our colleagues, I'm proud of our Company, what we've accomplished and our performance amid the continuing echo of change in this post-pandemic world.
We are the world's premier organizational consultancy.
There is no question about that.
We're meeting the key objectives that we discussed last quarter, which included diversifying our offerings, capitalizing on our leadership and relevant solutions, driving an integrated go-to-market strategy, advancing our position as a premier career destination and pursuing transformational opportunities at the intersection of talent and strategy.
And all of this is translating to what I believe is outstanding performance.
During the quarter we generated about $555 million in fee revenue.
It was an all-time high that was up 26% year-over-year.
Our profitability was strong.
We had an adjusted EBITDA margin of a little over 20% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21.
We've clearly accelerated through the turn and it's a testament to the pivot we made and the agility of our colleagues over this past year.
The diversity and relevance of our offerings and our ability to deliver our consulting services in a virtual world have helped clients achieve organizational opportunities and our Company deliver strong financial results.
In this new world there is tangible opportunity for Korn Ferry.
The center of gravity for today's workforce is shifting from a place of work to a location for collaboration.
It's no longer about the where, it's all about the why and how work gets done differently.
Almost every company on the planet is reimagining and will have to continue to reimagine its business from its strategy to its people to its culture.
Quite simply, companies are rethinking their organizational structure, roles and responsibilities, how they compensate, how they motivate, how they engage, how they develop their workforce, let alone the type of agile talent they hire and how they hire that talent and they're going to need to lead differently.
Gone are the days of vertical leadership that focuses on driving results up the chain.
Today companies need more horizontal leadership.
That's all about leading across the enterprise.
And these changes align with Korn Ferry's businesses.
Whether it's M&A services, change management, virtual sales effectiveness or customer experience services, Korn Ferry is poised to seize this opportunity.
We've also used this time of change as an opportunity to reimagine our own business.
In a post-pandemic world and beyond, we're delivering an integrated value change, digitally enabled and delivered.
To deliver this at scale, we're bringing everything together in a digital framework.
All this makes our world-class IP even more relevant and unique.
To fulfill our vision and position our Company for long-term success, we remain relentlessly focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients.
Number one, we're driving an integrated solutions based go-to-market approach through our marquee and regional accounts.
That not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but it's also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
We have about 350 marquee and regional global accounts and they continue to demonstrate the power of this strategy.
The accounts, they generated about $640 million in fee revenue during the year and they sustainably utilize all of our global capabilities even during challenging economic periods.
Today the fight for talent is more profound than ever.
The pandemic shakeout is driving a robust market for our talent acquisition expertise, capabilities and approach and we're helping companies find the right talent, fitting the right need, from senior level executives, the board members to professional level talent.
And looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we've been actively marrying our capabilities with today's megatrends.
The result is larger projects with greater sustainability and more durable revenue.
Right now, we're seeing high areas of demand in D&I and organizational transformation as well as our core solutions such as assessment, pay and governance and leadership and professional development.
We indeed have a lot of opportunity in front of us.
We've become a much different company with a broader and deeper mix of business.
Importantly, we're translating the value we are creating for our clients and the returns for our shareholders.
As part of our balanced capital allocation framework, I'm pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share.
Looking to the fiscal year ahead, I truly feel we have the right strategy with the right people at the right time to help our clients drive performance in this new world.
Bob, it's over to you.
Our fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the relevance and importance of our human capital solutions in the rapidly evolving business environment that we find ourselves in.
It also validates our strategy and highlights the strength and durability of our business model.
By all measures, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter in our history with record revenue and profitability.
Our new business in the fourth quarter was also a record and it actually accelerated throughout the quarter, leaving us well positioned for growth in fiscal '22.
Now before I jump into the actual results for the quarter, I want to talk about a couple of proof points that we have shared with you in the past that really continue to demonstrate the success of our strategy.
First, our overall business has demonstrated more resilience than at any other time in our history and just by way of example, in just three quarters from our COVID recession trough, we've achieved new all-time highs in new business revenue and profitability.
In contrast, coming out of the great recession, approximately 10 years ago, it took over 12 quarters for fee revenue to rebound past the prior pre-recession high.
Our second marquee and regional account program that Gary talked about, really continues to add value, providing a steady, strong growing stream of fee revenue for our firm.
For all of fiscal year '21, 35.3% of our consolidated fee revenue was generated from these accounts.
Further, our year-over-year fee revenue on marquee and regional accounts was essentially flat, while the rest of the Company was down about 9%.
For new business, our marquee and regional accounts were actually up 11% year-over-year while the rest of the Company was flat.
And finally, our success driving cross line of business referrals continues to grow.
Just over three years ago cross line of business fee revenue referrals were approximately 15%.
Today, fee revenue from cross line of business referral stands at almost 27% for all of fiscal '21 and almost 29% for the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to some important highlights of our fourth quarter.
As Gary mentioned, fee revenue in the fourth quarter was up $115 million year-over-year and $80 million sequentially, reaching an all-time high of $555 million.
Growth continued to be broad-based with fee revenue improving sequentially for the third consecutive quarter in each of our lines of business.
Recent growth trends for our flagship talent acquisition businesses have been particularly strong.
Consolidated fee revenue growth in the fourth quarter measured year-over-year was up 26% with Executive Search being up 20%, RPO and Pro Search up 46% and Consulting up 27%, all reaching new all-time quarterly fee revenue highs.
New business growth in the fourth quarter was also very strong with all business lines generating new business at levels higher than before the pandemic.
Additionally, earnings and profitability were at record levels in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA grew $16 million or 17% sequentially to $113 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 20% for the second consecutive quarter.
Our earnings and profitability continued to benefit from both higher consultant and execution staff productivity and lower G&A spend driven in part by virtual delivery processes.
Our adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also reached a record level in the fourth quarter, improving to $1.21, which was up $0.26 or 27% sequentially and up $0.61, or 102% year-over-year.
Now, it's important to note that the fourth quarter expenses included $13.5 million of non-reoccurring expense accruals.
That's roughly 2.5 percentage points of margin related to our business recovery plan, as we decided to reimburse employees for the remaining portion of salaries that were foregone during the year.
Now, turning to new business, the month of March and April were the two best months of new business ever.
On a consolidated basis, new business awards, excluding RPO, were up 48% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially.
Measured on a sequential basis, new business growth in the fourth quarter also showed broad-based improvement led by our talent acquisition businesses with Executive Search up 29% and Professional Search up 18%.
In addition, our digital business was up 8% and consulting was up 5%.
RPO new business was also strong in the fourth quarter with an additional $115 million of new contracts.
Our cash balance also improved.
At the end of the fourth quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion.
Now excluding amounts reserved for deferred compensation arrangements and for accrued bonuses, our investable cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $642 million and that's up $108 million sequentially and up $110 million year-over-year.
Now it continues to be our priority to invest back into our business to maximize future growth.
Now, this includes the hiring of additional fee earners.
Over the last three quarters combined across all of our business lines, we have hired approximately 160 new consultant fee earners and that includes about 86 in the fourth quarter with the rest coming from quarters two and three.
Additionally, as Gary mentioned, consistent with our balanced capital allocation framework, our Board has approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share and that's going to be payable on July 30 to shareholders of record on July 6, 2021.
Starting with KF Digital.
Global fee revenue for KF Digital was $80.5 million in the fourth quarter, which was up 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially.
The subscription and licensing component of KF Digital fee revenue continues to improve.
In the fourth quarter subscription and license fee revenue was $24 million, which was up over 14% year-over-year.
Global new business for KF Digital in the fourth quarter reached $108 million, the second consecutive quarter of new business over $100 million.
Additionally, for all of fiscal '21, new business tied to subscription and license services improved approximately 72%.
Earnings and profitability also improved for KF Digital in the fourth quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $27.9 million and a 34.7% adjusted EBITDA margin.
Now turning to Consulting.
In the fourth quarter Consulting generated $153.6 million of fee revenue, which was up approximately $32.6 million or 27% year-over-year and up approximately $17.3 million or 13% sequentially.
Fee revenue growth was broad based across all solution areas and strongest regionally in North America.
Consulting new business also improved in the fourth quarter, growing approximately 53% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.
Additionally, new business tied to large engagements, those over $500,000 in value, was up approximately 56% in the fourth quarter and up approximately 31% for all of fiscal '21.
Regionally, new business growth was also broad based and remained strongest in North America.
Adjusted EBITDA for Consulting in the fourth quarter was up $16.1 million or 145% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.7%.
RPO and Professional Search global fee revenue improved to $120.3 million in the fourth quarter which was up 46% year-over-year and up 26% sequentially.
Both RPO and Professional Search benefited from the post-recession surge in demand for skilled professional labor.
RPO fee revenue grew approximately 58% year-over-year and 34% sequentially, while Professional Search fee revenue was up approximately 27% year-over-year and up 17% sequentially.
With regards to new business, in the fourth quarter, Professional Search was up 17% sequentially and RPO was awarded $115 million of new contracts, consisting of $23 million of renewals and extensions and $92 million of new logo work.
Adjusted EBITDA for RPO and Professional Search surged to approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, which is up approximately $17.2 million or 136% year-over-year and $10.3 million or 53% sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for RPO and Professional Search was 24.9% in the fourth quarter.
Finally, in the fourth quarter, global fee revenue for Executive Search exceeded $200 million for the first time in Company history.
Global Executive Search fee revenue was up approximately 20% year-over-year and up approximately 19% sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Growth was also broad based and led by North America, which grew 28% year-over-year and 23% sequentially.
Sequentially, fee revenue in EMEA and APAC was up approximately 15% and 9% respectively.
The total number of dedicated Executive Search consultants worldwide at the end of the fourth quarter was 524, which was down 32 year-over-year and up two sequentially.
Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the fourth quarter improved to a record $1.54 million and the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the fourth quarter was up 39% year-over-year and 32% sequentially to 1,712.
In the fourth quarter, global Executive Search adjusted EBITDA grew to approximately $49.8 million, which was up 5% year-over-year and up 19.5% sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 25%.
The acceleration of new business in the month exiting the fourth quarter and entering the first quarter of fiscal '22 has positioned us very well for further growth.
Our combined total new business in the months of March, April and May was easily the highest total for any three-month period in Company history.
Additionally, strong new business activity has been broad based with all of our lines of business taking advantage of both the market strengthening and the acceleration of demand for our unique combination of service offerings.
For the last couple of quarters demand across all of our lines of business has been strongest in North America, but I will say during the fourth quarter, we did begin to see signs of acceleration in international markets as well.
Now if recent new business activity continues and normal seasonal patterns hold, we expect that new business in the first quarter will remain strong.
We saw that in May and so far new business month-to-date in June is in line with our expectations.
Recognizing normal seasonal patterns and assuming no new major pandemic-related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets or foreign exchange rates, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '22 to range from $535 million to $555 million and our consolidated diluted earnings per share to range from $1.04 to $1.14.
As we close out the fiscal year, we are very encouraged by the momentum in our business.
This is the momentum that we believe is reflective not only of the macro conditions but of the intentional steps we have taken to build this business and extend our comprehensive offerings to our clients to enhance our financial profile and really to position Korn Ferry for long-term success.
Through the power of our offerings, we look forward to building on these results for quarters and years to come.
With that, we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have.
","Korn Ferry reported a strong fourth quarter with record revenue and profitability, demonstrating the relevance of its human capital solutions in the current business environment. Fee revenue reached an all-time high of $555 million, up 26% year-over-year, driven by growth in all business lines. New business also reached a record high for the quarter and accelerated throughout, positioning the company well for future growth. The company's marquee and regional account strategy continues to provide a steady stream of revenue, contributing 35.3% of total fee revenue in fiscal 2021. Cross-line of business referrals have also grown significantly, now accounting for nearly 29% of fee revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.21, up 102% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin remaining above 20% for the second consecutive quarter. The company has invested heavily in hiring additional fee earners and expects new business to remain strong in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with projected fee revenue between $535 million and $555 million and diluted earnings per share between $1.04 and $1.14."
RTX_q2_2021.txt,"I'm on the Slide 2 of the of the deck for those of you following along.
So, a couple of months ago, we held our first Investor Day as Raytheon Technologies and that day we laid out our 2025 goals to deliver strong top line growth, margin expansion and at least $10 billion in free cash flow by 2025, all while continuing to invest in our businesses and return significant cash to our shareowners.
We continue to be confident in the future because of our strong franchises, the resilient markets in which we operate, our innovative technologies, and our relentless focus on operational excellence and cost reduction, which will drive margin expansion and strong cash flows into the future.
And we continue to see encouraging trends across our market.
Our confidence in our ability to achieve these targets remain strong and as you saw at the end of May, the Department of Defense released the fiscal year '22 budget request, which was generally in line with our expectations with respect to our portfolio of products and the investments we're making in differentiated technologies, including missile defense, space-based systems, next-generation propulsion and hypersonics.
Major RTX programs fared well as -- overall as modernization funding remains at near historic highs.
Requested funding for these programs is favorable to the overall DoD modernization request when compared to last year's plan for fiscal year '22.
It's also worth noting that the overall classified funding request, which supports a significant part of our Intelligence & Space portfolio was also very well supported.
So I'd say we're well positioned with the administration's priorities, driven by our innovative technologies and capabilities to address the evolving threat environment.
This is demonstrated of course by the significant awards we received this quarter, which included over $1 billion in classified bookings at RIS and two important franchise wins in our Missiles & Defense business where we were awarded almost $2 billion for the Long-Range Standoff weapon or LRSO, and $1.3 billion for the Next-Generation Interceptor.
A thing also we should note that the Patriot franchise remains robust as evidenced by Switzerland becoming the 18th partner nation to select the Patriot air defense system.
At the same time, commercial air traffic demand continues to gain momentum across many of our domestic markets as global economies reopen and vaccinations increase.
In the U.S. daily travelers throughout the TSA checkpoints have averaged over $2 million per day in July, and that's more than doubled since January of this year.
That said, we are monitoring the COVID variants and the impact on travel and there's still work to do on global vaccinations and on international border reopenings.
Strong execution against an increasingly favorable backdrop enabled us to deliver top and bottom line growth on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis.
So given our performance year-to-date and the recent trends across our end markets, we're going to raise the low end of our full year sales outlook by $500 million to a new range of $64.4 billion to $65.4 billion.
And we're also going to raise and tighten our adjusted earnings per share outlook with a new range of $3.85 to $4 per share and we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to a range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion for the year.
I'm pleased with the strong orders we saw in the quarter, which grew our company backlog to a record $152 billion and that's a 3% increase since the first quarter.
Our defense book-to-bill was a strong 1.12 resulting in a defense backlog of over $66 billion and commercial backlog increased by $3.5 billion in the quarter.
On the capital allocation front, we repurchased $632 million on shares bringing us to over $1 billion in share repurchase year-to-date and we're on track to meet our commitment of buying back at least $2 billion of shares for the year.
We also continue to execute on the merger integration activities and given our substantial progress and the robust pipeline of opportunities, we're going to raise our gross cost synergy target by another $200 million to $1.5 billion and that $1.5 billion will be realized in the four -- first four years following the merger.
That's now 50% more than our original synergy commitment and there's great execution by the team but I would tell you, we're not done yet.
Like everything, there's always more to do.
In addition to making good progress in our synergy targets, we're also making significant progress on our structural cost reduction projects, which you've heard about back in our May meeting.
We have a pipeline with hundreds of opportunities including the previously announced actions that we're working across the business.
Let me just give you a couple of examples of what we are doing.
And our Collins Aerostructures business has scheduled over 125 lean events this year, and they're focused on specifically reducing the takt time, labor time for the A320neo nacelle.
We've invested in lean events such as these throughout the pandemic because they've allowed the Aerostructures business to reduce nacelle manufacturing time by over 75%.
Of course, though our normal goal here is about an 87% learning curve, these lean events allow us to exceed that in incredible ways.
At Pratt, we continue to build on the overhaul capability and drive turnaround time across the geared turbofan network.
The team has made good progress this year, demonstrated a 15% turnaround time, an improvement over the past year.
But importantly, they're on track to drive a 30% reduction by the end of this year.
These improvements are the direct result to repair infrastructure development and additional productivity improvements across the network, including the application of lean principles in their sharp design as well as automation.
Our strong culture of operational excellence is enabled of course, by the core operating system and significant investments in digital technology and other strategic projects.
Altogether, these initiatives will save over $5 billion in cost through 2025.
So you can see the market fundamentals are strong, we're laser focused on operational excellence and our key franchises are driving strong financial performance.
I'm on Slide 4.
As you could expect, I'm pleased with where we landed for the quarter.
We exceeded our expectations for both adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.
Sales were $15.9 billion, which was at the high end of our outlook range and up 10% organically versus prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis and up 4% sequentially.
Our strong performance was driven by the momentum in commercial aerospace and continued growth in defense.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 was ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by commercial aftermarket and contract-related settlements at Collins but also better than expected performance at Pratt, RIS and RMD.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.69 per share and included $0.34 of acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or nonrecurring items.
Free cash flow of $966 million exceeded our expectations primarily due to the continuation of better than expected collections and lower than expected capital expenditures.
Before I hand it over to Jennifer, let me give you a little color on our synergy progress.
We achieved $185 million of incremental gross cost synergies in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date savings to $390 million and given the pace that we realize these synergies on to-date, we're increasing our 2021 cost synergy target by $50 million, which brings our new target to the year -- for the year to $660 million.
Collins also achieved nearly $50 million of further acquisition synergies in the quarter, bringing total Rockwell Collins acquisition-related savings to nearly $560 million since the deal closed in November of 2018, and we now expect Collins to meet their $600 million acquisition synergy target in 2021, a year ahead of schedule.
So great work by the Collins team on that front.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the segment results, and I'll come back and talk a bit about the outlook.
Starting with Collins Aerospace on Slide 5.
Sales were $4.5 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an adjusted basis driven primarily by the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry, and up 11% on an organic basis.
By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 24% driven by a 30% increase in parts and repair, a 16% increase in modification and upgrades, and a 15% increase in provisioning.
Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 15% with growth in all three channels most notably provisioning, which grew at 40% and parts and repair, which grew 14%.
Commercial OE sales were up 8% from the prior year, driven principally by the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry.
Growth in narrow body, regional and business jets was particularly offset by expected declines in wide-body sales.
And military sales were down 7% on an adjusted basis to the prior year divestitures and down 1% organically on a tough compare.
Recall Collins military sales were up 10% in the same period last year.
Adjusted operating profit of $518 million was better than expected and was up $494 million from the prior year, driven primarily by higher commercial aftermarket and OE sales, the benefit of continued cost reduction actions as well as favorable contract settlements that were worth about $50 million.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect Collins full year sales to be down-mid to down-low-single digit with higher expected commercial aftermarket volumes offsetting slightly less than expected OE deliveries.
And given the favorable mix in the first half of the year, the commercial recovery and the benefit of cost containment measures, we are increasing Collins full-year operating profit outlook to a new range of up $100 million to $275 million versus prior year.
Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 6.
Sales of $4.3 billion were up 19% on an adjusted basis and up 21% on an organic basis, primarily driven by the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry.
Commercial aftermarket sales were up 41% in the quarter with legacy large commercial engine shop visits up 56% and Pratt Canada shop visits up 18%.
As expected, we also saw a continued ramp in GTF shop visits in the quarter.
Commercial OEM sales were up 30% driven by higher GTF deliveries within Pratt large commercial engine business and general aviation platforms at Pratt Canada.
Military sales were down 3% also on a tough compare given Pratt's military sales were up 11% in the same period last year.
A continued ramp in the F135 sustainment was more than offset by lower material inputs on production program.
Adjusted operating profit of $96 million was slightly better than expected and was up $247 million from the prior year, driven primarily by higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable shop visit mix.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pratt's full year sales to be up low to mid-single digit.
And we are increasing the low end of Pratt's full-year operating profit outlook by $25 million to a new range of down $50 million to up $25 million versus 2020.
Turning now to Slide 7.
RIS sales were $3.8 billion, up 12% versus the prior year on an adjusted basis and adjusted pro forma basis, including the pre-merger stub period, sales were up 6% driven by strength in Airborne ISR Program within sensing and effects as well as strength in the classified cyber programs within cyber training and services.
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $415 million was slightly better than expected and was up $86 million year-over-year on an adjusted pro forma basis, driven primarily by program efficiencies.
The quarter also benefited from a gain on a real estate transaction.
RAF had $4 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in strong book-to-bill of 1.13 and a backlog of $19.4 billion.
Significant bookings included approximately $1.1 billion on classified programs as well as several other notable awards, including the STARS follow-on award for the FAA to implement a terminal automation system in their airports, and our first production award for the U.S. Navy Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band system that utilizes RTX industry-leading gallium nitride technology.
It's worth noting that we continue to expect RIS full year book-to-bill to be about 1.
Turning to RIS full year outlook, we continue to expect sales to grow low to mid single digit, and we are increasing the low end of RIS' operating profit outlook by $25 million to a new range of up $150 million to $175 million versus adjusted pro forma 2020.
Turning now to Slide 8.
RMD sales were up $4 billion up 15% to prior year on an adjusted basis and adjusted pro forma basis, which again includes pre-merger stub period.
Sales were up 9% driven primarily by higher volume on the international Patriot program and on StormBreaker program, both which included liquidation of pre-contract costs.
Adjusted operating profit of $532 million was slightly better than expected and was up $121 million versus prior year on adjusted pro forma basis due to favorable mix and higher program efficiencies.
RMD had $6.1 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in an exceptionally strong book-to-bill of 1.55, and a backlog of $29.7 billion.
In addition to the franchise awards that Greg discussed, RMD also had a number of other notable awards in the quarter.
We also continue to expect RMD's full year book-to-bill to be about 1.
Turning to RMD's full-year outlook, we continue to expect sales to grow low to mid single digit, and we are increasing the low end of RMD's operating profit by $25 million to a new range of up $50 million to $75 million versus 2020 on an adjusted pro forma basis.
I'm on Slide 9.
Let me update you on how we see the current environment as we look to the second half of the year.
Starting with our commercial end markets, as I've discussed many times before, the shape of the commercial recovery remains critical to our outlook.
That said, we are encouraged by the pace of the vaccine distribution and continued signs of improving air travel demand in many domestic markets.
However, we continue to see international air traffic and border reopenings recover slower than we had expected around the world.
Keep in mind about 65% of 2019 air travel was international.
And while the first half of the year was a little stronger than expected and we're seeing signs of strong summer travel, we still need to see the reopening of international borders and the return of long-haul routes to drive continued sequential aftermarket growth in the second half of the year.
Looking longer term, we continue to expect commercial air traffic to return to 2019 levels by the end of 2023 with domestic and narrow-body fleets recovering before International and wide-body fleets.
Moving to our defense end markets.
We were pleased with what we saw in the fiscal year '22 defense budget request and we remain confident in our ability to grow our defense businesses as we look ahead.
Shifting to operational excellence.
As Greg mentioned, we're increasing our gross merger cost synergy target to $1.5 billion and that's driven by higher savings from the corporate and segment consolidations as well as additional procurement and supply chain savings.
At the same time, we're maintaining a focus on implementing our core operating system and driving structural cost reduction across the businesses.
And finally, our financial flexibility is underpinned by our strong balance sheet, which supports our investments in the business and our capital deployment commitments.
Following our strong first half, we're confident in our full year outlook.
As Greg discussed, we're bringing up the low end of our sales range by $500 million and we're raising our adjusted earnings per share range to $3.85 to $4 per share or up about $0.33 from the midpoint of our prior outlook.
About half of the increase comes from the segments, primarily Collins and the other half is from $0.13 of tax improvement and about $0.03 of lower corporate tax items.
The $0.13 tax benefit is driven by the ongoing optimization of the company's legal and financing structure that we expect to realize discretely in the third quarter.
On the cash side, given the improved earnings outlook, we now expect free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion for the year.
With that, I'll hand it back to Greg to wrap things up.
So we're on the final slide here, Slide 11.
I just want to reiterate our priorities for 2021 and again, no surprises here.
These priorities remain the same that is first and foremost to continue to support our employees, our customers and our suppliers and communities during the pandemic, and to keep our employees safe.
Our team is dedicated to solving our customers' most complex problems by investing in differentiated technologies to capitalize on our strong franchises.
At the same time we're going to continue to execute on the integration and deliver the cost synergies and we're committed to operational excellence to drive further structural cost reduction across all of our businesses.
","Raytheon Technologies reported strong financial results for Q2 2021, exceeding expectations for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. The company's sales reached $15.9 billion, up 10% organically, driven by the resurgence in commercial aerospace and continued growth in defense. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 benefited from commercial aftermarket surge, contract-related settlements, and better-than-expected performance in several segments. Raytheon raised its full-year sales outlook to $64.4-$65.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share range to $3.85-$4.00, reflecting improved commercial aftermarket volumes, cost reductions, and a favorable tax optimization. The company also increased its synergy target to $1.5 billion and reported strong bookings and backlogs across its defense segments. Despite strong demand in domestic markets, international air traffic recovery remains slower than anticipated, impacting commercial aftermarket growth expectations. However, Raytheon remains optimistic about its ability to grow its defense businesses, capitalize on its strong franchises, and achieve operational excellence through cost reduction initiatives."
WGO_q2_2021.txt,"I'm joined on the call today by Michael Happe, president and chief executive officer; and Bryan Hughes, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Additionally, we have posted our first-ever quarterly earnings supplement, a compilation of slides that should serve as an efficient way to understand our second-quarter results and provide context related to our company and industry trends.
These factors are identified in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to read.
As always, we genuinely appreciate your interest in Winnebago Industries and for taking the time to join us.
As we continue to navigate the pandemic, we very much wish great health for each of you.
Now we have stated it often, but these are interesting, dynamic and exciting times for our company.
Then I will offer some closing thoughts, and we will conclude with a Q&A session.
We are very pleased to share that Winnebago Industries delivered another quarter of outstanding financial and operational results.
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our top-line net sales by 34%, expanded gross margins 590 basis points, and increased operating income by 237%.
These outcomes are especially a reflection of the extraordinary Winnebago Industries team who continue to deliver time after time while leading with our values in all they do.
Our teammates are truly our greatest asset, and we are very focused together as one enterprise organization on creating tremendous value for our end customers, channel partners, communities, and shareholders.
In addition to our employees and their impressive agility, Winnebago Industries continued growth and successful execution is attributable to three other key drivers: number one, our leading portfolio of premium outdoor brands, Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar and Chris-Craft; second, Winnebago Industries' ongoing commitment to operate with excellence and deliver exceptional quality, innovation and service in everything we do; and lastly, a win-win partnership mentality with our valued dealer network to create and sustain strong consumer demand for our leading portfolio of outdoor products.
While we have undoubtedly been active via acquisitions in the last four-plus years, fiscal-year 2021 quarter 2 represents a truly organic year-over-year comparison in total performance.
The second quarter of fiscal-year 2020 was the first full quarter in which Newmar's luxury Motorhome line was included in our world-class portfolio.
One year later, we continue to nurture the tremendous appeal of Newmar's growing product lineup and its relentless focus on craftsmanship, quality, and customer care.
Our collective enterprise results in the second quarter of fiscal-year 2021 validate a strong, complete, full-line RV strategy is now in place here at our company, and premium organic portfolio of RV brands are positioned to compete vigorously in the years ahead.
Now, there is a distinct strategic cause-and-effect linkage between our premium brands, our golden threads of quality, innovation, and service, and the strong financial results that are being shared with all of you today.
Differentiation and strong value can drive sustained market and financial performance.
That is and will always be our goal.
Additionally, our team's ability to navigate constantly challenging environments related to component cost and availability is on display through our numbers as well.
We took and will take actions to ensure our pricing reflects both the surging demand for our premium brands, but also the input cost inflation that is expected in the coming quarters.
Our ability to sell products at attractive margins and continued low levels of discounting seen across the RV industry contributed to our profitability performance in the quarter and continues to reinforce our brand strength with dealers and end consumers.
And as importantly, our enterprisewide commitment to operational excellence, productivity, continuous improvement, strategic sourcing, etc.
, was also a significant driver of our performance and resulted in strong second-quarter profitability.
As a result, our consolidated second-quarter gross margin of 18.6% represents an increase of 590 basis points versus last year.
We are passionate about driving operational leverage within the business and maximizing the return from our current assets.
Our manufacturing processes are running daily at peak levels as the supply chain allows.
And executing against an increasingly robust order backlog to replenish, as quickly as possible, inventories for our dealer partners.
The shift we made in the back half of fiscal-year 2020 to fully build to confirm dealer order production in our Winnebago-branded RV businesses continues to serve us well in terms of profitability and working capital management.
While demand-driven supply chain challenges regularly impact our production, particularly in Class A Motorhomes, we will constantly work with our supply partners to manage any future disruptions as best we can.
Our Q2 results demonstrate that supply network is assisting an incredible year-over-year production volume increase.
And for that, we are appreciative, maintaining gratefulness in context.
But we also continue to be restrained from hitting full manufacturing potential given almost daily component availability challenges.
Quarter 2 lost net sales due to sourcing constraints was easily eight figures across the portfolio.
That revenue opportunity remains inherent in our potential as we transition into quarter 3.
The third major driver of our fiscal-year 2021 second-quarter performance was sustained strong consumer demand for our products, both as wholesale appetite from our dealers, but especially at retail with end consumers.
We are not seeing any significant decline in retail momentum and outdoor product demand as we turn into the spring 2021 selling season.
SSI results are often a lagging incomplete barometer of the retail health in the industry.
And our company's retail numbers in the first two to three weeks of March have actually shown sustained strength and even an uptick in certain categories.
The RV and marine industry have succeeded in comping effectively over a somewhat normal pre-pandemic period in early calendar 2020.
In the next three months of 2021, March through May, which is our quarter 3, we'll see strong retail and wholesale comparisons versus a period of intense marketplace disruption a year ago.
Throughout the pandemic, we have proven our resilience and ability to execute during difficult macroeconomic and large-scale health crisis conditions just as Winnebago Industries has continued to expand our reach during other challenging periods in our history.
Currently, we are experiencing a flattening of seasonality of wholesale and at retail.
Our calendar 2021 January and February retail sales were similar to our November and December performance, underscoring that even through the typically slower winter months, consumers are excited about our brands and intent on securing the product they need to have extraordinary experiences with family and friends this summer.
The strong demand undercurrent we are seeing presently has meaningful implications on our business now, as well as over the long term.
Welcoming new entrants to the outdoor lifestyle allows Winnebago Industries the opportunity to capture significant customer lifetime value that our portfolio provides.
First-time buyers of both Motorhomes and Towables tend to gravitate toward value models.
By delivering our golden threads of quality, innovation, and service, as well as the breadth of premium products for families to grow into over time, we are cultivating a broad growing pipeline of Winnebago Industries consumers as they upgrade, on average, every three- to five-year-olds when staying within the lifestyle.
As we continue to persevere and grow our business, we have also made it a priority to enhance and advance our corporate responsibility efforts and ensure that our company has the resources, infrastructure, and commitment to be a valued partner to the communities in which Winnebago Industries stakeholders live, work and play.
Second-quarter consolidated revenues were a record $839.9 million, which is an increase of 34% compared to $626.8 million for the fiscal 2020 period driven, as Mike noted, by strong consumer demand for Winnebago Industries' great brands.
As Newmar operations were fully included in our fiscal 2020 second quarter, we will no longer be speaking to reported versus organic sales as it relates to Newmar for our quarterly results.
As a reminder, 100% of Newmar is reported in the result of our Motorhome segment.
We achieved another period of very strong profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
Gross profit margin increased 590 basis points to 18.6%, while adjusted EBITDA margin increased 570 basis points to 12.9% compared to 7.2% for the fiscal 2020 period.
Similar to our fiscal 2021 Q1 performance, this significant margin expansion was driven by favorable pricing, including lower discounts and allowances; productivity initiatives; operating leverage approximating 200 to 250 basis points, and segment mix.
Reported earnings per diluted share were a record $2.04 compared to reported earnings per diluted share of $0.51 in the same period last year.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were likewise a record at $2.12 in the second quarter for an increase of 216% compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $108 million for the quarter, compared to $45.4 million last year, which is an increase of 138%.
The increases in both adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were driven by strong unit growth, pricing actions, and productivity initiatives, most notably in the Motorhome segment.
Now, I'll turn to our segment performance, starting with Towables.
Revenues for the Towable segment were $439.3 million for the second quarter, up 55% over the prior year, driven by elevated consumer demand across the Towables portfolio.
Winnebago Industries unit share of the North American towable market continues to grow as share on a trailing three-month basis through January 2021 was 12.4% or an increase of 80 basis points over the same period last year.
Segment adjusted EBITDA was $62.4 million, up 79.5% over the prior-year period.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% increased 190 basis points primarily due to favorable pricing and operating leverage.
Next, let's turn to our Motorhome segment.
In the second quarter, revenues for the Motorhome segment were $382.6 million, up 17.5% from the prior year, driven by increased unit sales in our Class B and Class C products.
Compared to the same period last year, second-quarter Class C unit sales were up 24.5%, while Class B products were up a very robust 81%.
Class B market share continues to be strong, as evidenced by our rolling three-month retail unit market share of 45.7% through January of 2021.
Similar to last quarter, our Newmar business continues to be challenged by supply issues that are more pronounced relative to our other RV businesses due to the more specialized supplier base that serves this high-end business unit.
We estimate the revenue impact to be in the tens of millions of dollars through Q2 year-to-date.
Segment adjusted EBITDA was $51 million, up 241% from the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 870 basis points over the prior year to 13.3%, driven by our ongoing focus on operational efficiency, including the transition to a build to dealer order business model in the Winnebago-branded Motorhome business, as well as several other operating improvements and lean initiatives that our business have pursued over the past several years, in addition to pricing actions to ensure our pricing is commensurate with market dynamics and also operating leverage.
While we continue to anticipate inflationary pressures and remain conscious of competition that may impact our net pricing equation, as well as continued supply chain challenges, we are encouraged by another quarter of sustained improvements to our margin in this segment.
As we have stated previously, we continue to expect to achieve a level of sustained profitability that is notably above the 4% to 5% EBITDA yield we've delivered in this segment for the past several years.
We are pleased to see this meaningful improvement and progress against our strategic focus on restoring leadership in our Motorhome segment.
Now, turning to the balance sheet.
Continuing the trend from Q1, our leverage ratio, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA continued to decline and is now 1.0 times, which is toward the lower end of our targeted range of 0.9 to 1.5 times, driven by both strong EBITDA generation and lower net debt due to the increasing cash balance of now $333 million.
Total liquidity, including our untapped ABL, is now in excess of $500 million.
Cash flow from operations was a healthy $66.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2021.
Working capital remained slightly elevated due to the inconsistent supply chain delivery but we continue to expect further improvements in this area in the coming quarters.
Our effective tax rate increased to 23.4% for the first six months ended February 27, 2021, from 20.1% for the same period last year primarily due to consistent year-over-year credits over higher current-year pre-tax income and favorable R&D discrete items in fiscal 2020.
For the full year, we currently expect our tax rate to approximate 23.5% to 24%, including all discrete -- or I'm sorry, excluding all discrete items from year-to-date results, and those that may occur in the remainder of the year.
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with those communicated in the past, investing in our businesses to drive organic growth, executing strategic expansion to our portfolio through M&A, maintaining a strong liquidity position, managing our leverage ratio within our targeted range, and returning cash to shareholders.
During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.12 per share on January 27, 2021, and our board of directors just approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share payable on April 27, 2021.
That concludes my review of our quarterly financials.
Before we open the call to questions, I want to touch efficiently on three topics: one, our estimates for RV industry retail and wholesale performance in fiscal-year 2021; two, our thoughts on the probable length of the RV field inventory replenishment cycle and steps we are taking to expand capacity; and three, recent progress at Winnebago Industries on important corporate responsibility priorities.
In our fiscal 2021, which is September of 2020 through August of 2021, we believe RV industry retail will grow in the mid- to upper single digits, while industry wholesale shipments in that same period will grow approximately 40% to 45%.
Quarter 3, March through May for our company, industry retail should be especially strong given the comparisons versus 2020.
But quarter 4 for our organization, June through August, industry retail will see a more challenging comparison environment due to record-breaking bounce-back RV retail last summer.
It is always our intention over the long-term for Winnebago Industries' retail pace to exceed that of the industry.
Please note that our fiscal industry wholesale shipment projection considers and aligns with the RV Industry Association calendar year 2021 industry midpoint forecast of approximately 533,000 units, or plus 24%, a forecast which we support.
Our most recent field inventory reports early here in quarter 3, continue to show low field inventory levels in Winnebago Industries' RV and marine businesses.
Depending on the brand or the product category, field inventory is anywhere between 20% lower than a year ago to 60% lower.
While many of the dealers we visit with regularly have a desire to run their operations at a higher turn level in the future than that of the pre-pandemic days, they are many, many, many months from reaching that targeted turn rate.
We anticipate that unless there is unexpected severe disruption to our own or the industry's retail performance due to macroeconomic or health developments, that it will take through our entire fiscal-year 2022 to have most of our businesses in a more normal retail to wholesale replenishment status.
To support this drive to replenish field inventory, we are actively pursuing and executing several capacity expansion projects within our company, which will position our organization well for future market share gain opportunities.
Some investments are organic and do not require the addition or expansion of square footage or overhead, while other projects will necessitate a physical increase in infrastructure.
Each RV and marine business unit here in Winnebago Industries has active capacity expansion efforts under way.
We will not share details for competitive reasons.
Physical assembly line extensions, standing up new lines in existing buildings, adding vertical manufacturing space and capacity, constructing new assembly buildings, shifting product lines and mix within our existing lines and facility, along with online productivity and lean initiatives that reduce waste and improve output rates, each of these are active today across our portfolio.
Multiple eight figures of capital is being invested currently and will likely continue well into fiscal-year 2022, and our financial results should gradually show the benefit of these investments each quarter.
Earlier this month, Winnebago Industries announced we are expanding our long-standing partnership with the National Park Foundation, funding a new initiative to create more equitable outdoor spaces by connecting women and outdoor enthusiasts of color with meaningful career opportunities in national parks.
Initiatives like these are not only demonstrative of our enterprise brand tag line, Be Great, Outdoors, but enable us to support our communities in meaningful ways that enhance the long-term sustainability of our business.
In addition to pursuing external social initiatives, we also are focused internally on responsible governance.
Just last week, we announced the appointment of two new members to our board of directors.
Jacqueline Woods and Kevin Bryant bring deep professional active experiences and differentiated valued skill sets that will help Winnebago Industries continue along its strong transformational path of growth and innovation.
Both Jacqueline and Kevin have extensive experience in building inclusive high-performing teams that are market-focused.
We look forward to their input and guidance as Winnebago Industries continues to strategically progress into a more competitive, diverse, and profitable outdoor lifestyle company.
Looking forward to the second half of fiscal 2021, Winnebago Industries remains committed to advancing our core values and our operations, and our communities, executing on our strategy, capitalizing on opportunities created by favorable market dynamics, and innovating to sustain the unique appeal of our products with consumers.
I will now turn the line back over to the operator to facilitate the taking of questions.
","Winnebago Industries reported strong financial performance in Q2, with record consolidated revenues of $839.9 million, a 34% increase over Q2 2020. Gross margin expanded by 590 basis points to 18.6%, driven by favorable pricing, productivity initiatives, and segment mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 570 basis points to 12.9%, resulting in record adjusted EPS of $2.12, a 216% increase year-over-year. The company's Towable segment saw revenue growth of 55%, while the Motorhome segment experienced a 17.5% increase. Winnebago Industries is investing in capacity expansion projects to meet strong consumer demand, which remains elevated despite the pandemic. The company also continues to prioritize corporate responsibility initiatives, including funding a program to create more equitable outdoor spaces for women and outdoor enthusiasts of color."

Time-sensitive information provided during today's call, which is occurring on July 27, 2021, may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay.
Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full-year guidance.
Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations.
In the second quarter, we achieved an operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion.
First and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model.
In addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work, and driving sustainability through our business model.
Our very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model, led us to increase our full-year guidance once again.
The size of our revisions in each of these first two quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings-producing potential of our strategy.
In the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses.
With all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms.
At the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy.
Our efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business' best ever financial performance by a considerable margin.
We've made substantial progress in derisking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model.
We've also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business.
At our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs.
These investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end-market demands.
For example, we're now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bales, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types.
The capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material.
Overall, our investment in recycling technology -- our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns, and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network.
Sustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years, so I want to take some time to highlight how we're advancing our sustainability journey.
At the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as senior vice president and chief sustainability officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under one umbrella.
We believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework.
Our supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations.
Next month, we're hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for one or more of the 45 companies participating in the event.
This three-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers.
And finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers' experience.
In the past, I've mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers' orders and reduces our cost to serve.
Through our advanced technology, we're eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer account, allowing the setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed.
This will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction.
This more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing.
We are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service.
Our customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers while, at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs.
We expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come.
In conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling, and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year.
Our focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen.
And we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook.
We're pleased with the excellent second-quarter results we achieved across our business.
We produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic's steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020.
Collection and disposal volume climbed 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations.
And our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second-quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%.
Turning more specifically to our volume results.
Robust recovery in our highest-margin businesses, commercial, industrial, and landfill, drove our very strong performance.
In the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels, and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic.
While we're very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume improvement in the second half of the year from key areas of our business, including industrial, special waste, and certain geographies such as Canada.
Additionally, pockets of our commercial business, such as education and offices, have yet to fully recover.
For the full year, we now expect organic volume in the collection and disposal business to grow 2.5% or more.
Pivoting to price, our second-quarter results further demonstrate the focus the entire team has on overcoming our cost headwinds as well as improvements following the intentional customer-focused steps we took in the second quarter of 2020.
This focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4%, landfill core price of 4.7% and transfer core price of 3.4%.
We continue to be committed to pricing programs that are aligned with our cost structure, which is even more important as we see pressure on labor, transportation, supplies, and capital costs.
Our new full-year outlook for collection and disposal yield is 3.7% or greater.
Our strong revenue growth was also supported by great results in our customer metrics.
Churn was 8.8% in the quarter, and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold.
Additionally, we increased our net customer growth rate, driven by the optimization of our sales force and investments in technology.
Looking at operating costs.
Second-quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures.
It's no surprise to anyone who follows economic indicators that most businesses are experiencing inflation in their costs throughout 2021, and our business is no exception, particularly with regard to labor.
We expect to overcome these pressures by increasing operating efficiencies and executing on our disciplined pricing programs.
There's no silver bullet when it comes to attracting and retaining talent, and we are using a multifaceted approach that includes addressing wages, offering flexible schedules, and broadening benefits.
Our long-term focus is on keeping our people first so that we are the employer of choice.
Overall, inflation trends are something we are watching very closely and managing very proactively with our area, supply chain, and revenue management teams.
We continue to make progress on the integration of the Advanced Disposal operations.
To date, we've combined around 45% of the ADS operations into our billing and operational systems, which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers.
We are on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year.
Year to date, we have achieved more than $30 million of annual run-rate synergies, and we expect cost synergies of between $80 million and $85 million in 2021.
This will bring the annual run-rate synergies to around $100 million at the end of 2021, and we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings.
And finally, as Jim mentioned, our recycling team set new highs in the second quarter with record contributions to earnings and margins.
We also achieved strong growth in our renewable energy business as we generated and sold more RINs and sold them at higher prices.
We've made significant investments in these businesses in recent years, and we're pleased with the strong returns they're generating.
Our people really are the foundation of our success.
And with that, I'll hand off to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.
Our team once again delivered a strong performance in the second quarter.
Robust volume growth since last year's peak pandemic impact, dynamic pricing efforts, record recycling results, disciplined integration of the ADS business, and our continued focus on cost management combined to deliver 28% operating EBITDA growth and 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion.
As Jim mentioned, these outstanding results and our confidence in the continued strength of our business model have led us to raise our 2021 financial guidance yet again.
Full-year revenue growth is now expected to be 15.5% to 16%, with organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 5.5% or greater.
For adjusted operating EBITDA, we expect to generate between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, an increase of $225 million at the midpoint from the original guidance we provided in February.
Our business is exceeding the strong outlook we established at the beginning of the year on a number of fronts.
Volume has recovered, particularly in the commercial collection business at a faster rate than we expected.
Market values for recycled commodities and RINs have increased.
Our integration of the ADS business has generated more synergy value.
And certain of our technology investments focused on reducing our cost to serve have delivered more savings than planned.
While the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes, the most significant drivers have accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $135 million; improved recycling profitability of another $135 million; renewable energy increases of about $55 million; and additional ADS synergies of around $25 million.
These increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $125 million.
The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow, and we now expect that we will generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year.
Turning to our second-quarter results.
SG&A was 9.6% of revenue in the second quarter, a 30-basis-point improvement over 2020.
This result demonstrates our success-making incremental technology investments that will benefit our customer engagement and cost to serve over the long term.
At the same time, we're realizing benefits from the integration of ADS and returns on certain of our new technology solutions.
We also continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending to optimize our costs.
Second-quarter net cash provided by operating activities grew more than 20%.
This increase was driven by our extremely strong operating EBITDA growth.
There was an unfavorable working capital comparison in the second quarter, but we attribute that to timing differences in tax payments and cash received from CNG credits.
We are encouraged to see continued progress on our DSO and DPO measures.
In the second quarter, capital spending was $396 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 to just over $665 million.
While capital spending in the first half of the year was expected to be less than the prior year due to timing differences in truck delivery schedules, our 2021 pace of capital expenditures has been slower than we planned.
The slower pace is due to supply chain and labor constraints impacting some of our vendors, and we've made deliberate decisions to defer spending in some categories as we observe what we expect to be temporary dislocation in certain markets.
To offset these delays, we're proactively pulling forward capital investments in areas we can and also where we know the returns will be strong.
As Jim mentioned, we're in the process of accelerating recycling investments as we have strong proof points of technology and equipment upgrades, reducing the cost structure of the business, and improving delivered quality of processed materials.
We continue to target full-year capital spending within our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range.
In the first half of 2021, our business generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a conversion from operating EBITDA of 61%.
This very strong result positions us well to achieve our new higher free cash flow outlook even as we target capital spending increases in the second half of the year.
Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business and strong and consistent shareholder returns.
In the second quarter, we paid $242 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases.
Our leverage ratio of 2.84 times has improved even more quickly than expected due to our strong operating EBITDA growth, and it's tracking well toward our target leverage of 2.75 times by the end of the year.
At the same time, our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $1.35 billion authorization.
With this increase, we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares.
The successes of the first half of 2021 position WM to deliver on our commitments to our people, our customers, the communities we serve, and our shareholders.
","Waste Management's second quarter performance was exceptional, driven by strong volume growth (9.6%), yield (3.7%), and pricing that offset inflationary pressures. The company's collection and disposal business led the way, with 24% EBITDA growth, while the recycling business set records. Integration of the Advanced Disposal acquisition is progressing well, with $30 million of annual synergies captured so far. WM raised its full-year guidance once again, projecting revenue growth of 15.5%-16%, adjusted operating EBITDA of $5 billion to $5.1 billion (an increase of $225 million), and free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Despite elevated cost inflation, the company expects to overcome these pressures through increased operating efficiencies and pricing programs. WM also remains committed to its sustainability journey, creating a centralized structure for sustainable solutions and ESG efforts. The company is investing heavily in technology to improve customer experience, reduce costs, and optimize operational efficiency, which will provide long-term benefits."
WFC_q3_2021.txt,"Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.
I'll make some brief comments about our third-quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities.
Let me start with some third-quarter highlights.
We earned $5.1 billion or $1.17 per common share in the third quarter.
These results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to improve.
Revenue declined on lower gains from equity securities, which were elevated in the second quarter, though still strong.
Expenses continue to decline, reflecting progress on our efficiency initiatives and included $250 million associated with the September OCC enforcement action.
And for the first time since first-quarter 2020, we grew both period-end loans and deposits in the third quarter.
We continue to see that our customers have significant liquidity and consumers are continuing to spend.
While lower than the peak in March, our consumer customers' median deposit balances continued to remain above pre-pandemic levels, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus and 40 -- I'm sorry, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus and 40% higher for those who did not receive federal aid.
Weekly debit card spend during the third quarter was up every week compared to 2019 and in the week ending October 1 was up 14% compared to 2020 and 26% compared to 2019.
Areas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered, including travel, up 2%; entertainment, up 39%; and restaurant spending, up 20% during the week ending October 1 compared with 2019.
Consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase, up 18% in the third quarter compared to 2019 and 24% compared to 2020.
During the week ended October 1, travel-related spending, which was hardest hit during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020 but remains the only category that is not yet fully rebounded to 2019 levels, still down 8% compared to 2019.
Commercial banking loans were up slightly at the end of the third quarter, while line utilization was stable at historic lows.
Supply chain difficulties and labor shortages continue to represent significant challenges for our client base.
And as I said earlier, overall credit performance continued to be strong.
Now let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities.
First, building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure has been and remains Wells Fargo's top priority.
We reached a significant milestone with the termination of the CFPB consent order issued in September 2016 regarding improper retail sales practices.
Its expiration reflects years of hard work by employees across Wells Fargo, intended to ensure that the conduct at the core of the CFPB order will not recur.
As a reminder, this is the second important regulatory milestone we achieved this year with the OCC terminating a consent order related to our BSA/AML compliance program in January.
But the recent OCC actions are a reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when I arrived must remain our top priority.
I believe we're making meaningful progress, and I remain confident in our ability to close the remaining gaps over the next several years.
Having said that, it continues to be the case that we are likely to have setbacks along the way.
We are a different bank today than we were several years ago.
We run the company with greater oversight, transparency, and operational disciplines.
We have a new leadership team.
15 of 18 operating committee members are now new to their roles.
I've spoken of our new leaders in many of our control functions, but we also have many new business leaders.
This includes new leaders in consumer banking, small business banking, auto lending, home lending, credit card, merchant services, retail services, and personal lending, digital, strategy, wealth and investment management, and commercial banking.
Our control infrastructure is different, and we continue to invest in it.
We take a different approach to the consumer today.
We created a sales practice oversight and management function and an Office of Consumer Practices.
Our approach to consumer remediation is dramatically different as we have meaningfully increased the amount paid to consumers and have accelerated payments to customers.
While we are committed to devoting the resources necessary to our risk and regulatory work, we are also focused on improving the products and services we offer.
We're making investments in digital capabilities and making it easier for customers to do business with us.
In the third quarter, we announced our new long-term digital infrastructure strategy that will move us to a multi-cloud environment.
This is a critical step in our multiyear journey to be digital-first and offer easier-to-use products and services.
We also joined AutoFi's North American network to provide car buyers and dealers with fast and easy online sales and financing.
And as I've spoken about previously, we're on track to roll out a new consumer mobile app at the beginning of next year.
We've also been making significant enhancements to our payments capabilities and are seeing that momentum pull through on our customers' Zelle usage, with Zelle users increasing 24%, transactions up 50%, and volumes are up 56% from a year ago.
We're executing on our work to simplify our products and build compelling offerings tailored to different customer segments.
Clear Access, our no-fee overdraft checking product now has over 1 million outstanding customer accounts.
As a reminder, this launched in September 2020.
And all of our retail accounts, which receive ACH direct deposit have our Overdraft Rewind feature, which automatically reevaluates transactions from the prior business day that have incurred an overdraft.
This feature has helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft-related fees on 2.5 million transactions in the third quarter.
For the emerging affluent and affluent segments, we're making substantial changes to more consistently and intentionally serve these customers, including products, service, marketing, and management routines.
You'll hear us talk more about how we're executing on this in the coming quarters.
After successfully launching Active Cash, our new cash-back credit card in July earlier this month, we launched the Reflect Card that rewards customers for making on-time payments.
Our new Head of Small Business, Derek Ellington, will start in just a couple of days, and we believe this is another attractive growth segment for us.
Next month, Paul Camp will be joining Wells Fargo as the Head of our Global Treasury Management businesses.
This new role brings together our treasury management and global payment solutions teams into one organization, which will enable us to be more efficient and leverage our capabilities more effectively to help clients manage their funds and process payments worldwide.
While we've been focused on improving the products and services we offer to our customers, we've continued to support our communities.
We voluntarily committed to donate all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in 2020 and created the Open for Business Fund to support small businesses impacted by the pandemic.
We've now donated $305 million in support of small business recovery, including 215 CDFIs, which, in turn, is expected to help nearly 150,000 small business owners maintain more than 250,000 jobs.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we launched Connect to More, a resource hub for women-owned businesses and a mentoring program partnering with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to empower 500 women-owned businesses.
We committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low- and moderate-income residents in Philadelphia with home down payment assistance.
And we published our updated ESG report and goals and performance data, which includes new disclosures on our workforce by race, gender, and job category.
As we look forward, while there certainly are risks that remain, including the latest wave of COVID infections, the recent U.S. fiscal policy stalemate, and inflation concerns, the outlook for the economy is promising.
Consumers' financial condition remains strong with leverage at its lowest level in 45 years and the debt burden below its long-term average.
Companies are also strong as well.
We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past on a run-rate basis at some point next year, and we'll then discuss our plan to continue to increase returns.
Charlie summarized how we're helping our customers and communities on Slide 2, so I'm going to start with our third-quarter financial results on Slide 3.
Net income for the quarter was $5.1 billion or $1.17 per common share.
Our results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses.
This is reflective of the continuing improvement in credit performance and the economic recovery.
Pretax pre-provision profit grew from a year ago as lower revenue, driven by a decline in net interest income, was more than offset by lower expenses.
We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has helped improve the expense run rate.
And as Charlie highlighted, the third quarter included $250 million in operating losses associated with the September OCC enforcement action.
Noninterest income was relatively stable from a year ago.
Within that, equity gains declined from the second quarter but increased $220 million from a year ago, predominantly due to our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses.
We also had an increase in investment advisory and other asset-based fees from a year ago, as well as in card, deposit related and investment banking fees.
These increases were more than offset by declines in other areas, including lower mortgage banking revenue and lower markets revenue in corporate and investment banking.
Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 22.9%.
Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.6% in the third quarter as we repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock.
As a reminder, our regulatory minimum will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower GSIB capital surcharge.
Additionally, under the stress capital buffer framework, we have flexibility to increase capital distributions and if possible, we will be able to repurchase more than the $18 billion included in our capital plan over the four-quarter period, depending on market conditions and other risk factors, including COVID-related risks.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 5.
Our net loan charge-off ratio was 12 basis points in the quarter.
Commercial credit performance continued to improve, and net loan charge-offs declined $42 million from the second quarter to 3 basis points.
The improvement was broad-based and included modest net recoveries in our energy portfolio and in commercial real estate.
The commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well.
The recovery in retail and hotel properties reflected increased liquidity and improved valuations.
While we have not seen any widespread stress in office, we continue to watch this sector closely and believe that any impact as a result of return to office or hybrid working plans will take time to play out.
Consumer credit performance also continued to improve with strong collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remaining above pre-pandemic levels.
Net loan charge-offs declined $80 million from the second quarter to 23 basis points.
We continue to have net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios, and losses in both credit card and auto declined.
Nonperforming assets declined $321 million or 4% from the second quarter, driven by lower commercial nonaccruals, with declines across all asset types.
Energy was the largest driver, given significant improvement in fundamentals on the back of higher commodity prices.
Our allowance level at the end of the third quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the continuing economic recovery, and the uncertainties that still remain.
If economic -- current economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases.
On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits.
Average loans were relatively stable from the second quarter with a decline in residential mortgage loans, largely offset by modest growth in our -- in most of our consumer and commercial portfolios.
Total period end of loans grew for the first time since the first quarter of 2020 and were up $10.5 billion from the second quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans, auto, other consumer, credit card, and commercial real estate.
Average deposits increased $51.9 billion or 4% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap.
Turning to net interest income on Slide 7.
Net interest income grew $109 million or 1% from the second quarter and was down $470 million or 5% from a year ago.
The decrease from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances and the impact of lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a decline in long-term debt and lower premium amortization on our mortgage-backed securities.
We had $20 billion of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities or EPBOs at the end of the third quarter, down $4 billion from the second quarter.
These loans do contribute to net interest income, and we expect these EPBO loan balances to decline substantially by the end of 2022.
At the end of the third quarter, we also had $4.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding, and we expect the balances to steadily decline over the next several quarters and to be under $1 billion by the end of next year.
We continue to expect net interest income to be near the bottom of our initial guidance range of flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth-quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion for the full year.
Turning to expenses on Slide 8.
Noninterest expense declined 13% from a year ago.
The decrease was driven by lower restructuring charges and operating losses and the progress we've made on our efficiency initiatives.
During the first nine months of this year, these initiatives have helped to drive a 16% decline in professional and outside services expense by reducing our spend on consultants and contractors, an 8% reduction in occupancy costs by reducing the number of locations, including branches and offices.
Occupancy costs have also declined from lower COVID-19 related costs and a 5% decline in salaries expense by eliminating management layers and increasing expansion controls across the organization and optimizing branch staffing.
Now let me provide some specific examples of progress we're making on some of the initiatives.
We are continuing to work on reducing the underlying costs to run our Consumer Banking business.
The pandemic accelerated customer migration to digital, which continue with mobile log-ons up 14% in the third quarter from a year ago.
While teller transactions were flat from a year ago, they were over 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels as transactions have migrated ATMs and mobile.
Over the past year, we've reduced our number of branches by 433 or 8% and lowered headcount and branch banking by 23%.
We continue to focus on generating efficiencies in our branches and have a number of initiatives designed to further reduce expenses, including reducing cash handling time and simplifying certain branch processes.
Wealth and investment management has had strong increases in revenue-related compensation.
However, by executing on efficiency initiatives, nonrevenue-related expenses in the third quarter declined 6% from a year ago, and non-advisor headcount was down 10% from a year ago.
We have aligned our wealth management business under eight divisional leaders, creating better coordination and efficiency.
We have also implemented a more efficient client service model across all distribution channels and have reduced total square footage by rationalizing our real estate footprint.
Corporate and investment banking has continued to make progress on various efficiency initiatives.
These efforts include reducing headcount supporting products, regions, or sectors with low levels of market activity and opportunity, optimizing operations and support teams, vendor optimization and insourcing, and reducing spend on contractors and consultants.
We're also working on initiatives in centralized functions, including operations, where we have realized savings from location optimization, lower third-party spending by eliminating consulting arrangements, and consolidating vendors.
The operations group has also reduced spend and layers with savings coming from eliminating manager roles.
Automation efforts and strategy enhancements have driven process improvements while reducing costs in many areas, including fraud management and card collections.
We've also been working on additional opportunities through technology enablement that have longer lead times, but should result in benefits that we expect will reduce operations-related expenses over time.
With three quarters of actual results already, our current outlook for 2021 expenses, excluding restructuring charges and the cost of business exits, is approximately $53.5 billion.
Note that we had $193 million of restructuring charges and cost of business exits during the first nine months of the year.
This outlook includes an expectation of higher operating losses and higher revenue-related expenses than we assumed earlier in the year.
Our expense outlook also assumes a full year of expenses related to Wells Fargo Asset Management and our Corporate Trust Services business, and we expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter.
We will update you on the expense impact of these initiatives after they close.
As mentioned, the outlook accounts for the fact that we expect full-year operating losses to be approximately $250 million higher than our assumptions at the beginning of the year.
This includes approximately $1 billion of operating losses incurred during the first nine months of the year, and our outlook assumes $250 million of operating losses in the fourth quarter.
Just a reminder that operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable, especially as we continue to address the significant work needed to satisfy our regulatory requirements.
Our current outlook also assumes revenue-related compensation will be approximately $1 billion this year, which is higher than the $500 million we assumed at the beginning of the year.
Strong equity markets have driven revenue-related expenses, which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in expenses.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 9.
Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago, primarily due to an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions and lower COVID-related fee waivers.
Home Lending revenue declined 20% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain-on-sale margins, origination volumes, and servicing fees.
Net interest income also declined, driven by lower loan balances.
These declines were partially offset by higher gains from the resecuritization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year.
Credit card revenue was up 4% from a year ago, driven by increased spending and lower customer accommodations and fee waivers in response to the pandemic.
Auto revenue increased 10% from a year ago on higher loan balances.
Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10.
Our mortgage originations declined 2% from the second quarter with correspondent originations growing 2%, which was more than offset by a 5% decline in retail.
We currently expect our fourth-quarter originations to decline modestly, given the recent increase in mortgage rates and the typical seasonal trends in the purchase market.
Despite strong consumer demand for autos, inventory shortages are putting downward pressure on industry sales and driving higher prices.
The competitive environment has remained relatively stable, and we've had our second consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 70% from a year ago.
Turning to debit card.
Transactions were relatively stable from the second quarter and up 11% from a year ago, with increases across nearly all categories.
We had strong growth in new credit card accounts up 63% from the second quarter, driven by the launch of our new Active Cash Card.
Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 24% from a year ago and 4% from the second quarter.
While payment rates remain high, average balances grew 3% from the second quarter, the first-time balances have grown since the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 11.
Middle-market banking revenue declined 3% from a year ago, primarily due to lower loan balances and lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit balances and deposit-related fees.
Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and lower lease income.
Noninterest expense declined 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense due to efficiency initiatives, as well as lower lease expense.
After declining for four consecutive quarters, average loans stabilized in the third quarter, line utilizations remained low and loan demand continued to be impacted by low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions.
However, there was some increase in demand late in the quarter and period-end balances increased $1.6 billion or 1% from the second quarter.
Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 12.
In banking, total revenue increased 12% from a year ago.
This growth was driven by higher advisory and equity origination fees and an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances predominantly due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap.
Commercial real estate revenue grew 10% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial servicing income, loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial gain-on-sale volumes and margins and higher underwriting fees.
Markets revenue declined 15% from a year ago, driven by lower trading activity across most asset classes, primarily due to market conditions.
Noninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced operations expense due to efficiency initiatives.
Wealth and investment management revenue on Slide 13 grew 10% from a year ago.
A decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates was more than offset by higher asset-based fees primarily due to higher market valuations.
Revenue-related compensation drove the increase in noninterest expense from a year ago.
I highlighted earlier the progress we've made on efficiency initiatives to reduce nonrevenue-related expenses, including salaries and occupancy expense.
Client assets increased 13% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations.
Average deposits were up 4% from a year ago, and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.
And Slide 14 highlights our corporate results.
Revenue declined from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and lower noninterest income due to lower gains on the sale of securities in our investment portfolio.
The decline in revenue from the second quarter was primarily driven by lower equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and expenses included the $250 million operating loss associated with the OCC enforcement action in September.
","Wells Fargo reported a solid third quarter with $5.1 billion in net income ($1.17 per share), driven by a $1.7 billion decrease in credit loss provisions due to improving credit quality. Although revenue declined year-over-year due to lower equity gains and interest income, expenses continued to decline, aided by efficiency initiatives and a one-time $250 million penalty related to a recent OCC enforcement action. Notably, the company saw growth in period-end loans and deposits for the first time since Q1 2020, with consumer spending remaining strong as indicated by increased debit card usage and credit card spending. Despite pandemic-related challenges, travel-related spending has significantly recovered, though it still trails 2019 levels. While commercial banking loans remained stable, line utilization continues to be historically low. Wells Fargo remains focused on risk management and regulatory compliance, with the recent termination of two consent orders signaling progress. The company is investing in digital capabilities, has launched new products and services, and is making enhancements to its payments capabilities and consumer protections. Despite challenges such as supply chain disruptions and inflation concerns, the economic outlook remains promising with strong consumer financial conditions and healthy corporate balance sheets. Wells Fargo remains on track to achieve a 10% sustainable ROTCE in the coming year and expects to continue increasing returns beyond that."
RSG_q2_2021.txt,"Jon Vander Ark, our CEO; and Brian DelGhiaccio, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance.
The material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.
If in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is July 29, 2021.
I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences.
We are very pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter.
Our results reflect strong execution and continued momentum on our strategic priorities which are building capabilities to further differentiate us from competitors.
These capabilities include: driving growth and building customer loyalty through a maniacal focus on the customer, which we call Customer Zeal; leveraging digital tools to the experience for our customers and employees, which we believe drives growth and generates operational efficiencies; and prioritizing sustainability by offering environmentally responsible solutions to our customers while protecting the planet.
During the second quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which represents a 36% increase over the prior year, expanded EBITDA margin of 110 basis points to 30.6%, and generated $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.
We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to our shareholders.
Year-to-date, we invested $567 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow.
Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust, with opportunities in both solid waste and the Environmental Solutions portion of our business.
We expect to invest well over $600 million in acquisitions for the full year.
Year-to-date, we returned $363 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and our Board recently approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend.
The strength of the underlying business is irrefutable, and we continue to see the proof points that our strategy is working.
Retention in our small and large container business remains at historically high levels at 94%.
If you further consider all permanent units of service, retention is even higher at 95%.
As anticipated, the pricing environment was strong in the second quarter.
Total core price was 5.2%, and average yield was 2.6%.
This level of core price matches the highest level in our company's history.
During the second quarter, we delivered outsized growth in our business as the economy improved.
Second quarter volume increased 8.1% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations.
The outlook for growth in the remainder of the year, both organically and through acquisitions, is strong.
We continue to see the benefits of our investments in technology and are well underway on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform.
Through the second quarter, we implemented tablets in approximately 40% -- 47% of our large and small container fleet.
We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year, with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2022.
The in-cab tablets enable automated customer notifications, which provides customers real-time information about their service.
Next, we believe sustainability is more than environmental stewardship but also a platform for growth.
We recently published our new sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making in our most significant opportunities to positively impact our stakeholders and the environment.
For example, we are proud to report a 5% reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to the prior year.
This year, we expanded and converted a landfill gas energy plant to high BTU and have 15 additional projects in the pipeline.
These projects reduce landfill emissions, generate more renewable and improve our economics.
We are also making the communities in which we operate better places to live.
So far this year, we've supported more than 25 charitable efforts and neighborhood revitalization projects through financial contributions and volunteer efforts.
This is in addition to the ongoing support of our local divisions provide to their communities.
In recognition of our ESG performance and transparency, we were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the second consecutive year.
Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year.
We expect continued strength in our business and to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter.
Accordingly, we are updating full year financial guidance as follows.
Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $4 to $4.05, and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.475 billion.
This represents an increase of over 6% from the midpoint of the prior guidance.
Second quarter core price was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 3%.
Core price in the open market was the highest level in company history.
The components of core price included small container of 7.9%, large container of 5.3% and residential of 5%.
Average yield was 2.6%, which increased 30 basis points from the first quarter.
This level of performance was in line with our expectations.
Second quarter volume increased 8.1%.
While we expected second quarter to be the highest reported volume for the year, the 8.1% growth exceeded our expectations.
The components of volume included an increase in small container of 8.6%, an increase in large container of 13.7% and an increase in landfill of 12.6%.
For reference, second quarter volumes in our small and large container businesses were down less than 1% from a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, and MSW and C&D landfill volumes were both above the pre-pandemic baseline.
Moving on to recycling.
Commodity prices increased to $170 per ton in the second quarter.
This compared to $101 per ton in the prior year.
Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 100 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter.
Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business.
Second quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was essentially flat with the prior year.
Approximately 30% of our Environmental Solutions business is in the upstream oil and gas sector, and 70% is in the downstream petrochemical and broader industrial manufacturing sectors.
The downstream petrochemical and industrial manufacturing portion of this business grew 8% compared to the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 30.6% and increased 110 basis points over the prior year.
This included 130 basis points, a 50 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel.
The margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation realizing operating leverage as volumes return, and continued effective cost management.
SG&A was 10.7% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year.
SG&A included higher levels of incentive compensation due to projected financial outperformance.
SG&A would have been approximately 10%, excluding the additional incentive compensation expenses.
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1 billion and increased $276 million or 38% compared to the prior year.
The drivers of growth included EBITDA growth in the business, a positive contribution from a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and the timing of capital expenditures.
We received approximately 40% of our projected full year capex during the first half of the year.
During the quarter, total debt was $9 billion, and total liquidity was $2.9 billion.
Interest expense decreased $13 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.9 times.
With respect to taxes, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6%.
We had an equivalent tax impact of 23.7% if you include noncash charges from solar investments.
We'll expect a full year equivalent tax impact of 26%, which includes the effective tax rate and noncash solar charges.
With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.
","Republic reported strong second-quarter performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, marking a 36% year-over-year increase. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 30.6%, and it generated $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow year-to-date. Republic continues to invest in growth and customer satisfaction through acquisitions and initiatives like the RISE platform. Retention remains high, with over 94% in the small and large container businesses. Strong pricing in the open market contributed to a core price of 5.2%, the highest in company history, with growth seen across small, large containers, and residential units. Volume increased 8.1% during the quarter, exceeding expectations. Environmental Solutions revenue remained steady, with the downstream portion growing 8%. The company has also made progress in sustainability, reducing operational greenhouse gas emissions by 5% in 2020. Given the continued strength in its business, Republic has revised its full-year guidance, increasing its adjusted earnings per share range to $4.00 to $4.05 and its adjusted free cash flow range to $1.45 billion to $1.475 billion."
THG_q3_2020.txt,"Today's discussion will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures such as operating income and accident year loss and combined ratios excluding catastrophes among others.
I will begin by discussing our third quarter financial highlights in the context of the current business and economic environment.
We are pleased with our third quarter financial performance, especially given it was a particularly active catastrophe quarter across the industry.
We reported earnings per share of $2.46 and an operating return on equity of 13.8% for the quarter.
Our results reflect strong execution on the strategic tenants that drive our business forward.
Our company and earnings stream are well-diversified and position us well to withstand environmental challenges, including weather volatility and the ups and downs of the economy and market.
We remain steadfastly focused on the hallmarks of our company.
Our unique distribution strategy and approach, broad-based profitability, disciplined underwriting, effective expense management and a thoughtful capital allocation strategy that includes returning excess capital to our shareholders.
Turning to our third quarter highlights, first, we are very pleased with the trajectory of our growth and the consistent signs of building momentum in our top-line.
We achieved 2.1% growth in the third quarter, which represents a significant and expected recovery from the 2.3% premium decline we reported in the second quarter normalized for one-time premium returns.
Our leading production indicators are quickly improving and we are encouraged by agency support and commitments, which once again validate the strength of our differentiated strategy and our broad and relevant product offering.
Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to drive growth across our portfolio and continue to build on the strong pre-pandemic momentum we had established.
Second, as noted in our pre-release on October 13th, our cat losses were slightly elevated in the quarter as a result of tropical storm systems, in particular, Hurricane Isaias and to a lesser extent, wildfires in California, and Oregon.
Our ability to mitigate the impact of weather events in the quarter is a reflection of the concerted, proactive efforts we have made over the past decade to prudently refine our mix of business.
To this end, we have expanded our specialty capabilities and struck the right balance between property and liability risks, while continuing to diligently manage our geographic concentrations and proactively adjusting our business mix.
We counted the increasing frequency of weather losses, we reduced our exposures in vulnerable regions of the Southeast, Gulf Coast and West Coast, while reducing micro-concentrations and enhancing our reinsurance protections.
These and other actions have enabled us to address potentially increasing weather-related property risks as we grow.
Going forward, we are confident these actions along with our increasing use of advanced tools and analytics will position us to continue to deliver consistently strong results across our business.
Third, we continue to benefit from lower claim frequency in the quarter, particularly in personal auto.
While frequency declined year-over-year, it is beginning to trend toward pre-pandemic levels as the economy reopens.
At the same time, we also experienced several large property losses in commercial multi-peril, which occurred in our book of business from time-to-time.
After carefully reviewing the causes of loss and related circumstances, we found no clear correlation between the losses themselves or the prevailing economic environment.
Given our strong underwriting guidelines and risk management practices, we have confidence in our ability to manage such risks while continuing to drive profitability through rate increases and prudent mix management.
Lastly, the third quarter was a very active one for us from a capital management perspective.
As announced last night, we entered into a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, reflecting the strong excess capital we have generated so far this year from earnings.
This decision further demonstrates our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and the confidence we have in our strong prospects moving forward.
Jeff will provide more details on these items shortly.
Moving on to review our business highlights, starting with Personal Lines.
We delivered net written premium growth of 2.3% in the third quarter compared to a decline of 5.5% in the second quarter or flat excluding premium return.
New business submissions in the third quarter were consistent with the third quarter of last year across most territories.
Contributions from renewal premiums continued to fuel growth, although retention was somewhat impacted from the backlog created by the lifting of cancellation and non-renewal moratoriums over the summer.
Our disciplined account strategy enabled us to effectively manage our business in a highly competitive environment and to drive profitability.
Our performance reflects a focus on striking the right balance between rate and retention, while achieving price increases where we need them the most.
Overall, Personal Lines rate increases of 4.7% in the quarter were fairly consistent with prior trends and we are satisfied with the underlying retention when adjusted for the temporary increase in cancellations and non-renewals, following the temporary second quarter increases.
Our Personal Lines year-to-date retention of 82% is a more indicative measure of our persistency, and should move back to the mid-80s over time.
Additionally, we are encouraged by the continued success of our Prestige offering, which is adding 600 new accounts each month.
Book consolidation activity also is continuing at an accelerated pace, with $71 million signed through the first nine months of the year, exceeding our expectations for the full year.
This level of activity further validates our unique approach to cultivating deep partnerships across the independent agency channel.
We continue to broaden and enhance those relationships by expanding our geographic reach and introducing product capabilities to address unmet customer needs across our footprint.
From a strategic and operational standpoint, we made significant progress during the quarter.
Earlier this week, we announced the expansion of our Personal Lines business in Maryland, further diversifying our book of business and expanding our Personal Lines presence to 20 states.
We also are expanding our product capabilities in Personal Lines.
We recently launched a new suite of products, home business solutions to cover home-based businesses.
Entrepreneurs throughout the country are starting home-based businesses in record numbers, yet, nearly 60% of these businesses lack adequate insurance.
To address that gap, our product provides ala carte options that could be bundled with the existing homeowner policies, including our Prestige offering.
As importantly, our Personal Lines team continues to execute exceptionally well in a new regulatory environment in Michigan, following personal auto reform, which went into effect in July.
As a top insurer and an industry thought leader in Michigan with 12% of our overall premiums in Michigan personal auto, we advocated for auto reform for more than a decade and it was essential that we excel in our implementation.
The reform provides Michigan consumers with the ability to save money on premiums in exchange for a reduced personal injury protection limit.
Cost control measures such as fee schedules and utilization controls should substantially reduce the severity of claims and increase the efficiency of the system once implemented mid-next year.
At the beginning of last year, we laid the foundation for the transition with a proactive plan that included operational, educational and self-service tools for agents and consumers.
Our third quarter Michigan auto premium grew approximately 4%, while average net premium per customer for us remain relatively consistent.
In summary, we remain confident that we will maintain our underwriting profitability in Michigan, while we gain share of the high-quality risks in the state outperforming the market over time.
Overall, we are very pleased with our Personal Lines performance and how we are navigating the market.
Our predominantly full account and more complex customer profile position us well in the competitive environment.
We are closely watching the competitiveness of our products and adjusting our rates to strike the right balance between growth and profit.
We are keeping an eye on frequency in anticipation of it returning to more normal levels.
Our unique agency inside tool coupled with comparative rate monitoring provides great transparency within our distribution and allows us to navigate the market successfully.
Turning to Commercial Lines.
We are very pleased with the growth momentum in our business.
We delivered net written premium growth of 1.9%, up from a decline of 4.6% in the second quarter.
We are encouraged by the accelerated pace in most production metrics, including renewal premiums, which are trending higher than historical averages and new business which has rebounded from a low point in the second quarter, but still remain subdued compared to pre-pandemic levels.
In Small Commercial, we are pleased with policy exposure levels, which turned positive for the quarter.
Although still slightly negative, middle-market exposures have come back significantly from the second quarter.
Notably, the growth momentum in our specialty businesses has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels.
We have rebounded to our 2020 direct written premium plan on a year-to-date basis with robust new business and renewals.
Our management liability, healthcare, E&S and specialty property businesses have posted growth in the double-digits in the quarter, while Specialty overall growth was 5%.
The success of our Specialty business goes back to our value proposition of providing a broad set of relevant and distinctive products and capabilities that are delivered to customers exclusively through high-quality independent agents.
Rate continues to accelerate in our core Commercial Lines book, now standing at 5.7% while Specialty rates are meaningfully higher led by management and professional liability, healthcare and specialty property.
In Core Commercial, we are seeing significant rate firming in Property Lines, while we continue to push double-digit rate in commercial auto.
Over the last several quarters, we and others have commented on the need for rate across the commercial insurance space.
The cumulative impact of rising social inflation, severe weather and continued lower interest rates should help continue to push commercial rates up in the near-term.
While our social inflation was less obvious during the height of the pandemic with the backlog of court dockets and overall economic distress, we fully expect it to reemerge and perhaps even exceed previous levels.
On the basis of focusing on these long-term loss trends, we believe that the rate we are achieving currently is meaningfully in excess of loss trend.
We are very optimistic that Commercial Lines upward rate trajectory will continue.
On the technology and innovation front, our newer product launches continue to expand with E&S growth accelerating and growing double digits with our best agents in our target markets.
We continue to broadly leverage our core commercial infrastructure and relationships to drive Specialty growth.
As a logical and important step in this evolution, we've recently expanded our TAP sales online quote and issuance capability to include management liability and miscellaneous professional liability products, enabling our agent partners to easily quote, rate, buy and issue stand-alone Small Business Specialty policies.
The investments we are making in technology and innovation leverage our broad account base focus and drive meaningful efficiency solutions.
Most importantly, with all of our businesses, we continue to execute on our differentiated agency centric strategy enabling our future growth.
We remain incredibly committed to staying connected with our distribution partners.
To that end, this quarter, for example, we conducted over 50 virtual CIAB executive meetings with many of the top 100 agents around the country, during which we discussed how we can enhance our capabilities to help all of us grow and better serve our customers.
In addition, we are in the process of holding virtual roadshows with our agents in our key markets across the country.
To-date, members of our senior management team have connected with over 500 of our agents, these engagements have been extremely fruitful.
In response to these distribution touchpoints, our efforts to enhance our digital marketing capabilities are front and center.
As is our next generation of our proprietary analytics tool, The Agency Insight.
We pride ourselves on having our finger on the pulse of the market and on bringing contemporary capabilities forward to meet the needs of our agents.
Our agents are responding very favorably and we expect these efforts will contribute to our accelerated growth trajectory going forward.
I am very proud of our team and our outstanding performance in the face of so much adversity this year.
I am excited about the opportunities we have as we build on the solid foundation we have established to drive our company forward.
Over the next several quarters, we will continue to invest heavily in digital capabilities, finalize new product launches and advance underwriting capabilities across the portfolio as we position our firm for long-term success.
We are better positioned today than ever to take our company to the next level, delivering for all of our stakeholders and achieving our goal to be the premier property and casualty franchise in the independent agency channel.
I want to reiterate Jack's comments about the strength of our book of business, which is reflected in our terrific bottom-line performance.
For the third quarter, we reported net income of $118.9 million, or $3.13 per fully diluted share compared with net income of $118.9 million or $2.96 per fully diluted share for the same period last year.
After-tax operating income was $93.5 million or $2.46 per diluted share compared with $93.0 million or $2.31 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
We recorded an all-in combined ratio of 94.2% compared with 94.4% a year earlier.
Our ex-cat combined ratio was 88.4%, an excellent result compared to the 91.3% in the prior-year quarter.
The improvement reflects the continued benefit of favorable frequency primarily in personal auto.
While frequency continues to be lower across several lines in our portfolio, we are seeing signs that it's returning to more normal levels as economic activity resumes.
At the same time, we continue to maintain a prudent reserving approach in longer-tail liability lines, given the continued uncertainty and the potential impact of increasing social inflation, as well as the potential for increased claim severity.
We believe our balance sheet has never been in better shape.
Catastrophe losses at $65.9 million, or 5.8% of net earned premiums came in slightly above our expectation for the quarter, but we were much more benign than the industry experience.
Our performance is a testament to proactive actions taken over the past decade to better manage our exposures by line of business and geography to maintain our disciplined approach to underwriting and to diversify our footprint.
In addition, in the quarter, we benefited from favorable prior year cat development of $9.6 million, which stems from a variety of events from recent accident years as well as to a much lesser extent, a small remaining favorable settlement from the 2018 wildfires.
Turning to our ex-cat prior-year development, we reported net favorable development of $2.6 million with strong favorability in workers' compensation in other Commercial Lines, partially offset by additions in home, commercial auto and CMP.
Commercial auto continues to be a focus area for us and a concern for the industry.
Over the past couple of years, we have consistently achieved rate increases around 10% and executed on a variety of underwriting actions to better position our portfolio.
We will continue to stay firm on rate to overcome the effects of continuing social inflation in this line.
Our CMP business experienced unusual adverse development related to three large losses from recent accident years.
Coincidently, this quarter, we incurred about $6.5 million of favorable development from a few large CMP property claims that stemmed from prior-year catastrophe events.
There is a certain level of randomness we expect from property losses in our portfolio and this quarter results are a good example of this.
I'm pleased to report that our loss activity related to the $19 million in COVID reserves we held at the end of the second quarter remains limited.
We continue to hold these reserves in the event they are needed to pay COVID-19 related claims, including those related to sub-limited business interruption endorsements and workers' comp resumption orders.
We continue to monitor the ongoing legislated and regulatory environment very closely.
We believe recent court activity and recent pronouncements in the U.S. have been favorable and supportive of the sanctity of contracts.
Turning now to expenses.
Our expenses ticked up 10 basis points in the quarter due to the timing of certain agent and employee incentive costs.
Year-to-date, our expense ratio is consistent with our original budget of 31.5% and we have a clear line of sight to the expected 10 basis point expense ratio improvement for full-year 2020.
In a year of subdued growth, our deliberate business investment planning and expense discipline is serving us extremely well.
We expect to continue delivering a 20 basis point improvement in the expense ratio going forward.
Additionally, we recorded a non-ratio bad debt expense of approximately $3.6 million, which continues to gradually decline from the highs, we recorded in the first and second quarters.
Consolidated net premiums written grew 2.1% in the third quarter, as we continue to see increasing momentum from the low point from the second quarter.
Our trajectory was fueled by strong renewals and increasingly robust new business and agency book consolidation activity, all of this with a backdrop of continued lower economic activity.
We have confidence that this momentum will continue over the coming quarters.
Moving to a review of underwriting performance by segment.
In Personal Lines, we delivered a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 83.5%, representing an improvement of 6.9 points from the prior-year quarter.
This improvement was almost entirely driven by the temporary frequency benefit in personal auto.
While such frequency continues to be lower, it is trending back toward historical averages.
We continue to be especially prudent in reserving for potential liability exposures from delayed reporting, legal costs or social inflation.
We are also monitoring our book carefully, remaining vigilant for increased severity from accidents at higher speeds.
Homeowners current accident year loss ratio, excluding cats was 48.2%, essentially flat from the prior-year period.
Turning to Commercial Lines, we reported a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 91.8%, relatively consistent with the prior-year quarter.
Commercial Lines ex-cat current accident year loss ratio was also in line with prior-year.
The temporary frequency benefit in certain property coverages was offset by elevated large property loss activity in CMP.
CMP, current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat was 59.1%, up 2.7 points from the prior-year quarter, driven by several large property losses.
We reviewed our underwriting and causes of loss and did not find any correlation to the current challenging environment or underwriting issues.
These types of losses occur from time-to-time, we feel comfortable with our overall pricing as we continue to achieve rate above long-term loss trends in this line, including an increase in rate in the quarter.
Commercial auto ex-cat loss ratio improved 3.2 points to 64.4%, reflecting temporary lower frequency in physical damage claims, although, not to the extent we reported in personal auto.
Given the trends we are seeing in prior accident years, we are particularly focused on ensuring that we have a more conservative approach for liability effects.
Workers' comp loss ratio was flat at 61.2% with some diminishing, but still favorable frequency of losses in the quarter.
While underlying trends continue to be favorable, we remain prudent in our reserve decisions.
Other commercial lines improved 1.4 percentage points to 54.1% due to slightly lower losses in short-tail property lines.
Overall, we are very pleased with our underwriting performance and improved growth dynamics in the third quarter.
Now moving on to investments.
Net investment income of $67.6 million was down slightly from the same period of last year as we continued to experience pressure from lower new money yields.
Our partnerships portfolio performed well, contributing $6 million to NII in the quarter.
Barring any unusual market volatility moving forward, we expect partnership income to be consistent with pre-pandemic levels.
With that said, we will continue to see some impact of the low-interest rate environment earn in increasingly over time.
Cash and invested assets were $9 billion at the end of the third quarter, with fixed income securities and cash representing 86% of the total.
Our fixed maturity investment portfolio has a duration of 4.7 years and is 96% investment grade.
The well-laddered and diversified portfolio remains high quality with a weighted average of A plus.
Turning now to our equity and capital position.
We delivered a strong operating return on equity of 13.8% in the quarter and 12.1% on a year-to-date basis, despite elevated cash, particularly in the second quarter.
Our book value per share of $84.32 increased 4% during the quarter, driven by operating income and both realized and unrealized gains in our investment portfolio, partially offset by the payment of our regular quarterly dividend.
From a capital management perspective, this was a very active period.
One of the strategic strengths Jack talked about earlier, is our capital allocation strategy.
This year has highlighted the quality of our earnings as well as our ability to consistently generate excess capital.
With this in mind and considering current market levels, we have entered into a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement.
We expect to receive 80% of the total shares on October 29th and anticipate receiving the final delivery of the remaining shares no later than early February 2021.
After the final delivery of all shares under the ASR agreement, we will have repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares or 6% of the outstanding shares from the beginning of 2020.
We will have approximately $122 million remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization.
In August, we issued a 10-year $300 million senior unsecured note at a very attractive annual coupon of 2.5%.
We used a portion of the proceeds to retire $175 million of subordinate debentures with a 6.35% coupon, improving our capital cost and overall capital structure.
The strong investor support we received for this issuance underscores the confidence they have in our strategy and future growth prospects.
As we move into 2021, this transaction further enhances our financial flexibility and will support organic growth opportunities across our business, as well as other capital uses.
We are confident in our earnings trajectory, growth prospects and earnings resilience going forward and we remain fully committed to our stated return on equity targets.
We generate ample capital to support future growth and believe that the best use of excess capital is often to return it to shareholders, especially at such valuations.
We take seriously our mandate to serve as stewards of our investors' capital and we're continuing to demonstrate that commitment, not only with words, but with actions that we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders.
Turning to guidance, we expect full-year 2020 net premiums written growth to be slightly positive compared to 2019.
We are increasing our full-year 2020 net investment income target to $260 million to reflect performance in the third quarter.
Our fourth quarter ex-cat combined ratio expectation has improved to around 91%.
As I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our expectation of a 10 basis point expense ratio improvement in 2020 from full-year 2019 and then returning to 20 basis points improvement in 2021 forward.
We have a fourth quarter cat load of 3.8% of net premiums earned and assume an effective tax rate to roughly equal the statutory rate of 21%.
Given where we are in our corporate wide financial planning process, it is still too early to comment on most guidance items related to 2021, but we are confident in the improving top-line trajectory and our profitability moving forward, despite the many challenges and headwinds we have faced this year.
In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter.
While the market always presents challenges, our team continues to successfully deliver on our strategic imperatives, remaining agile and opportunistic as we advance our goals and those of our agents and customers.
We enter the whole stretch of 2020 in a strong financial position with a unique and proven strategy, a strong and committed team more focused than ever on the opportunities that will enable us to continue growing profitability in the year ahead.
","Despite a challenging quarter for the industry due to catastrophic events, reported strong financial performance with an operating return on equity of 13.8% and diluted earnings per share of $2.46. The company's diversification strategy mitigated the impact of weather-related losses and contributed to a 2.1% growth in net written premiums, supported by strong renewal premiums and agency support. The Personal Lines segment experienced a favorable combined ratio due to lower claim frequency, particularly in personal auto, while the Commercial Lines segment maintained a stable combined ratio with growth in specialty businesses. The company's commitment to disciplined underwriting, effective expense management, and capital allocation was reflected in a 10 basis point expense ratio improvement and the initiation of a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue delivering strong results despite environmental challenges and is optimistic about growth prospects moving forward."
AAP_q2_2021.txt,"I am joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you're all healthy and safe amid the ongoing pandemic and recent surge of the delta variant.
It's because of you that we're reporting the positive growth in sales, profit and earnings per share we're reviewing today.
In Q2, we continued to deliver strong financial performance on both the one and two year stack, as we began lapping more difficult comparisons.
In the quarter, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 5.8% and adjusted operating income margin of 11.4%, an increase of 11 basis points versus 2020.
As a reminder, we lapped a highly unusual quarter from 2020 where we significantly reduced hours of operation and professional delivery expenses reflective of the channel shift from pro to DIY.
As we anticipated, the professional business accelerated in Q2 2021, and between our ongoing strategic initiatives and additional actions, we expanded margins.
Our actions offset known headwinds within SG&A and an extremely competitive environment for talent.
On a two-year stack, our comp sales improved 13.3% and margins expanded 227 basis points compared to Q2 2019.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.40 increased 15.3% compared to Q2 2020 and 56.7% compared to 2019.
Year-to-date, free cash flow more than doubled, which led to a higher than anticipated return of cash to shareholders in the first half of the year, returning $661.4 [Phonetic] million through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.
Our sales growth and margin expansion were driven by a combination of industry-related factors as well as internal operational improvements.
On the industry side, the macroeconomic backdrop remained positive in the quarter as consumers benefited from the impact of government stimulus.
Meanwhile, long-term industry drivers of demand continued to improve.
This includes a gradual recovery in miles driven along with an increase in used car sales, which contributes to an aging fleet.
While we delivered positive comp sales in all three periods of Q2 our year-over-year growth slowed late in the quarter as we lapped some of our highest growth weeks of 2020.
Our category growth was led by strength in brakes, motor oil and filters, with continued momentum in key hard part professional categories.
Regionally, the West led our growth benefiting from an unusually hot summer, followed by the Southwest, Northeast and Florida.
To summarize channel performance, we saw double-digit growth in our professional business and a slight decline in our DIY omnichannel business.
To understand the shift in our channel mix, it's important to look back at 2020 to provide context.
Beginning in Q2, we saw abrupt shifts in consumer behavior across our industry due to the pandemic, resulting from the implementation of stay-at-home orders.
This led to more consumers repairing their own vehicles, which drove DIY growth.
In addition, our DIY online business surged as many consumers chose to shop from home and leverage digital services.
Finally, as we discussed last year, our research indicated that large box retailers temporarily deprioritized long tail items, such as auto parts, in response to the pandemic.
These and other factors resulted in robust sales growth and market share gains for our DIY business in 2020.
Contrary to historical trends, the confluence of these factors also led to a slight decline in our professional business in Q2 2020.
As we began to lap this highly unusual time, we leveraged our extensive research on customer decision journeys.
This enabled us move quickly as customer shifted how they repaired and maintained their vehicles.
Our sales growth and margin expansion in Q2 demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified asset base as we adapted to a very different environment in 2021.
Specific to our professional business, we began to see improving demand late in Q1 2021, which continued into Q2, resulting in double-digit comp sales growth.
This is directly related to the factors just discussed, along with improved mobility trends as more people returned to work and miles driven increased versus the previous year.
Strategic investments are strengthening our professional customer value proposition.
It starts with improved availability and getting parts closer to the customer as we leverage our dynamic assortment machine learning platform.
Within our Advance Pro catalog, we saw improved key performance indicators across the board including, more online traffic, increased assortment and conversion rates and ultimately growth in transaction counts and average ticket.
We also continued to invest in our technical training programs to help installers better serve their customers.
Our TechNet program is also performing well as we continue to expand our North American TechNet members, providing them with a broad range of services.
Each of these pro-focused initiatives have been a differentiator for Advance, enabling us to increase first call status with both national strategic accounts and local independent shops.
Finally, we're pleased that through the first half of the year, we added 28 net new independent Carquest stores.
We also announced the planned conversion of an additional 29 locations in the West as Baxter Auto Parts joins the Carquest family.
We're excited to combine our differentiated pro customer value proposition with an extremely strong family business, highlighted by Baxter's excellent relationships with their customers in this growing market.
In summary, all of our professional banners performed at or above our expectations in Q2, including our Canadian business, despite stringent lockdowns.
Moving to DIY omnichannel, our business performed in line with expectations, considering our strong double-digit increases in 2020.
While Q2 DIY comp sales were down slightly, DIY omnichannel was still the larger contributor to our two-year growth.
DIY growth versus a year ago gradually moderated throughout the quarter as some consumers returned to professional garages.
Within DIY omnichannel, we saw a shift in consumer behavior back to in-store purchases, consistent with broader retail.
We've also been working to optimize and reduce inefficient online discounts.
These factors along with highly effective advertising contributed to an increase in our DIY in-store mix and a significant increase in gross margins versus prior year.
We remain focused on improving the DIY experience to increase share of wallet through our Speed Perks loyalty platform.
We made several upgrades to our mobile app to make it easier for Speed Perks members to see their status and access rewards.
We continue to see positive graduation rates among our existing Speed Perks members.
In Q2, our VIP membership grew by 8% and our Elite members representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.
Shifting to operating income, we expanded margin in the quarter on top of significant margin expansion in Q2 2020.
This was led by our category management initiatives, which drove strong gross margin expansion in the quarter.
First, our work on strategic sourcing remains a key focus as consistent sales growth over several quarters resulted in an increase in supplier incentives.
Secondly, we've talked about growing own brands as a percent of our total sales.
This has been a thoughtful and gradual conversion and we began to see the benefits of several quarters of hard work in Q2.
This was highlighted by our first major category conversion with steering and suspension, where we saw extremely strong unit growth for our high margin Carquest premium products.
In addition, the CQ product is highly regarded by our professional installers.
With consistent high level of quality standards, they are now delivering lower defect rates and improved customer satisfaction.
We also recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the DieHard battery launch.
Following strong year one share gains in DIY omnichannel, we've now extended DieHard distribution into the professional sales channel, where we're off to a terrific start.
Further expansion of the DieHard and Carquest brands is planned for other relevant categories.
In terms of strategic pricing, we significantly improved our capabilities, leveraging our new enterprise pricing platform.
This platform enabled us to respond quickly as inflation escalated beyond our initial expectations for the year.
Moving to supply chain, while we're continuing to execute our initiatives, we faced several unplanned, offsetting headwinds in Q2.
Like most retailers, we experienced disruption within the global supply chain, wage inflation in our distribution centers and an overall shortage of workers to process the continued high level of demand.
In addition, our suppliers experienced labor challenges and raw material shortages.
Despite a challenging external environment, we continue to execute our internal supply chain initiatives.
This includes the implementation of our new Warehouse Management System or WMS, which we're on track to complete in 2022.
In the DCs that we've converted, we're delivering improvements in fill rates, on-hand accuracy, and productivity.
The implementation of WMS is a critical component of our new Labor Management System or LMS. Once completed, LMS will standardize operating procedures and enable performance-based compensation.
We also continue to execute our Cross Banner Replenishment or CBR initiative, transitioning stores to the most freight logical servicing DC.
In Q2, we converted nearly 150 additional stores and remain on track with the completion of the originally planned stores by the end of Q3 2021.
In addition to CBR, we're on track with the integration of Worldpac and Autopart International, which is expected to be completed early next year.
Shifting to SG&A, we lapped several cost reduction actions in Q2 2020, which we knew we would not replicate in 2021.
We discussed these actions on our Q2 call last year, primarily a reduction in delivery costs as a result of a substantial channel mix shift along with the reduction in store labor costs at the beginning of the pandemic.
Jeff will discuss these in more detail in a few minutes.
In terms of our initiatives, we continue to make progress on sales and profit per store.
Our team delivered sales per store improvement and we remain on track to reach our goal of $1.8 million average sales per store within our timeline.
Our profit per store is also growing faster than sales per store, enabling four wall margin expansion.
In addition to the positive impacts of operational improvements we've implemented to drive sales and profit per store, we've also done a lot of work pruning underperforming stores and we're back to store growth.
In the first half of the year, we opened six Worldpac branches, 12 Advance and Carquest stores and added 28 net new Carquest independents, as discussed earlier.
We also announced the planned conversion of 109 Pep Boys locations in California.
We're very excited about our California expansion with the opening of our first group of stores scheduled this fall.
The resurgence of the delta variant has resulted in some construction related delays in our store opening schedule.
We expect to complete the successful conversion of all stores to the Advance banner by the end of the first quarter 2022.
Finally, we are focused on reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs, including a continued focus on safety.
Our total recordable injury rate decreased 19% compared to Q2 2020 and 36% compared to Q2 2019.
We're also finishing up our finance ERP consolidation, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Separately, we are in the early stages of integrating our merchandising systems to a single platform.
Both of these large scale technology platforms are expected to drive SG&A savings over time.
The last component of our SG&A cost reduction was a review of our corporate structure.
In terms of the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, savings were limited in Q2 due to the timing of the actions.
We expect SG&A savings associated with the restructure beginning in Q3.
In summary, we're very pleased with our team's dedication to caring for our customers and delivering strong financial performance in Q2.
We're optimistic as the industry-related drivers of demand continue to indicate a favorable long-term outlook for the automotive aftermarket.
We remain focused on executing our long-term strategy to grow above the market, expand margins and return significant excess cash back to shareholders.
Now let me pass it to Jeff to discuss more details on our financial results.
In Q2, our net sales increased 5.9% to $2.6 billion.
Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 239 basis points to 46.4%, primarily as a result of the ongoing execution of our category management initiatives, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing and own brand expansion.
We also experienced favorable inventory-related costs versus the prior year.
These benefits were partially offset by inflationary costs in supply chain and unfavorable channel mix.
In the quarter, same SKU inflation was approximately 2% and we expect this will increase through the balance of the year.
We're working with our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible.
Year-to-date, gross margin improved 156 basis points compared to the first half of 2020.
As anticipated, Q2 adjusted SG&A expenses increased year-over-year and were up $109 million versus 2020.
This deleveraged 228 basis points and was a result of three primary factors.
First, our incentive compensation was much higher than the prior year, primarily in our professional business as we lapped a very challenging quarter in 2020 when pro sales were negative.
Second, we experienced wage inflations beyond our expectations in stores.
We remain focused on attracting, retaining and developing the very best part people in the business and we'll continue to be competitive.
We expect both headwinds to continue in the back half of the year.
Third, and as expected, we incurred incremental costs associated with professional delivery and normalized hours of operations when compared to Q2 2020.
These increases in Q2 were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 related expenses to approximately $4 million compared to $15 million in the prior year.
As a result of these factors, our SG&A expenses increased 13.3% to $926.4 million.
As a percent of net sales, our SG&A was 35% compared to 32.7% in the prior year quarter.
Year-to-date, SG&A as a percent of net sales improved 88 basis points compared to the first half of 2020.
While we've seen a decrease in COVID-19 related costs year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers will continue to be our top priority.
As the current environment remains volatile and the delta variant remains a concern, we may see increased COVID-19 expenses in the back half of the year.
Our adjusted operating income increased to $302 million compared to $282 million one year ago.
On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 11 basis points to 11.4%.
Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40 compared to $2.95 in Q2 of 2020.
Our free cash flow for the first half of the year was $646.6 million, an increase of $338.4 million compared to last year.
This increase was driven in part by our operating income growth along with continued momentum in our working capital initiatives.
Our capital spending was $58.7 million for the quarter and $129.6 million year to-date.
We expect our investments to ramp up in the back half of the year.
And in line with our guidance, we estimate we will spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2021.
Due to favorable market conditions along with our improved free cash flow in Q2, we returned nearly $458 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2 million shares at an average price of $197.52 and our recently increased quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share.
We're pleased with our performance during the first half of the year and moving into the first four weeks of Q3 on a two-year stack, our comparable store sales are in line with Q2.
We're continuing to monitor the COVID-19 situation as well as other macro factors, which may put pressure on our results, including, inflationary cost in commodities, wages and transportation.
Based on all these factors, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance ranges, including net sales in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, comparable store sales of 6% to 8% and adjusted operating income margin of 9.2% to 9.4%.
As you heard from Tom on our new store openings, we've encountered some delays in the construction process of converting Pep Boys stores, primarily permitting and obtaining building materials related to the ongoing pandemic.
As a result, we're lowering our guidance range and now expect to open 80 to 120 new stores this year.
Additionally, given the improvement of our free cash flow and our accelerated share repurchases in the first half of the year, we are also increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a minimum of $700 million and an expected range for share repurchases of $700 million to $900 million.
We remain committed to delivering against our long-term strategy as we execute against our plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return.
","Advance Auto Parts reported strong financial performance in Q2, driven by industry factors and operational improvements. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40, surpassing analyst expectations. Sales grew 5.9% to $2.6 billion, with comparable store sales increasing 5.8%. The professional business outperformed the DIY omnichannel business, contributing to double-digit growth. Strategic initiatives in category management, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing, and own-brand expansion, led to gross margin expansion of 239 basis points. SG&A expenses increased due to higher incentive compensation, wage inflation, and normalized delivery expenses. However, these were partially offset by decreased COVID-19 expenses. Adjusted operating income grew to $302 million, resulting in an 11 basis point increase in operating income margin to 11.4%. Advance Auto Parts remains optimistic about the long-term outlook and has increased its guidance for full-year 2021, including net sales, comparable store sales, and free cash flow. The company plans to continue investing in strategic initiatives and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends."
AAP_q3_2021.txt,"I'm joined today by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As always, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe.
Their continued dedication to provide outstanding service to our customers allowed us to deliver another quarter of top line sales growth, adjusted margin expansion and a double-digit increase in earnings per share.
We've been investing in both our team and our business over multiple years to transform and better leverage Advance's assets.
In Q3, this helped enable us to comp the comp on top of our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth of 2020.
Specifically, we delivered comp store sales growth of 3.1%, while sustaining an identical two-year stack of 13.3% compared with Q2.
As expected, this was led by the continued recovery of our professional business and a gradual improvement in key urban markets.
By putting DIY consumers and Pro customers at the center of every decision we make, we've been able to respond quickly to evolving needs.
In Q3, this was highlighted by an overall channel shift back to Professional and a return to stores for DIYers.
Within Professional, we're seeing increasing strength in certain geographies, which, like the rest of the country last year as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban markets, catches up with the rest of the country.
Our diversified digital and physical asset base has enabled us to respond rapidly to these changing channel dynamics in the current environment.
In addition, we also delivered significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, led by our category management initiatives.
Our adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we lapped a unique quarter in Q3 2020.
As we've discussed over the past year, our SG&A costs were much lower than normal in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.
This was due to an unusually high DIY sales mix and actions we took last year during the initial stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated.
Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% versus Q3 2020.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.21 increased 21.6% compared with Q3 2020 and 31% compared with the same period of 2019.
Our year-to-date adjusted earnings per share are up approximately 50% compared with 2020.
Year-to-date, our balance sheet remains strong with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividend.
Consistent with the front half of the year, there were several industry-related factors, coupled with operational improvements, contributing to our sales growth and margin expansion in Q3.
The car park continues to grow slightly.
The fleet is aging and perhaps most importantly vehicle miles driven continue to improve versus both 2020 and 2019.
More broadly, the chip shortage continues to impact availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales.
This benefits our industry as consumers are repairing and maintaining their vehicles longer.
As we all know, over the last 18 months, the pandemic changed consumer behavior across our industry, which led to a surge in DIY omnichannel growth in 2020, while the Professional business declined.
However, as the economy continues to reopen, with miles driven steadily increasing, our Professional business is now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels as discussed last quarter.
Regional performance was led by the Southwest and West.
Category growth was led by brakes, motor oil and filters as miles driven reliant categories improved versus the softer 2020.
We also saw continued strength in DieHard batteries, which led the way on a two-year stack basis.
Each of these categories performed well as a result of the diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions.
At the same time, we experienced challenges in Q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management SKUs to own brand.
Importantly, these in-stock positions are now significantly improved and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion.
Overall, comp sales were positive in all three periods of Q3, led by Professional.
DIY omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in Q3, while lapping high double-digit growth than the prior year.
Within Professional, we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to allow us to say yes to our customers.
The investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning and in our dynamic assortment tool help put us in a favorable position competitively.
We've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned US stores as well as over 800 independent locations.
Our MyAdvance portal and embedded Advance Pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us, while driving online traffic.
Our online sales to Professional customers continues to grow as we strengthen the speed and functionality of Advance Pro.
We remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all Professional customers.
This will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market.
In addition, we expanded DieHard to our Professional customers.
Following a recent independent consumer survey, DieHard stake disclaims as America's most trusted auto battery.
During Q3, we announced a multi-year agreement with our national customer Bridgestone to sell DieHard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the United States.
With this systemwide rollout during Q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all Bridgestone locations.
In terms of our independent business, we added 16 net new independent Carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year.
We continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our Carquest partners, including our new Carquest by Advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month.
As we continue to build and strengthen the Advance brand and our DIY business, Carquest by Advance adds DIY relevance for our Carquest-branded independent partners, while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities.
We've recently enrolled this new initiative out to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing Carquest independents.
Transitioning to DIY omnichannel, comparable store sales were slightly positive in Q3.
As you'll recall, our DIY omnichannel business reported strong double-digit comp sales growth in Q3 2020.
We continue to enhance our offerings and execute our long-term strategy to differentiate our DIY business and increased market share.
In Q3, we continue to leverage our Speed Perks loyalty program as VIP membership grew by 13% and our number of ELITE members, representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.
Last year, the launch of our Advance Same Day suite of services helped enable a huge surge in e-commerce growth.
This year, as DIYers return to our stores, in-store sales growth led our DIY sales growth.
Part of this was expected due to a planned reduction in inefficient online discounts, which significantly increased gross margins.
Turning to margin expansion.
We again increased our adjusted operating income margin in the quarter.
Like Q2, this was driven by category management actions within gross margin, where our key initiatives played a role.
First, we are realizing benefits from our new strategic pricing tools and capabilities.
Like other companies, we're experiencing higher-than-expected inflation.
However, our team has been able to respond rapidly in this dynamic environment as industry pricing remains rational.
Behind strategic sourcing, vendor income was positive versus the previous year with continued strong sales growth.
Finally, double-digit revenue growth in own brand outpaced our overall growth in the quarter as we expanded the Carquest brand into new category.
Carquest products have a lower price per unit than comparable branded products, which reduced comp and net sales growth in the quarter as expected.
At the same time, the margin rate for own brands is much higher and contributed to the Q3 adjusted gross margin expansion.
Shifting to supply chain.
We continue to make progress on our productivity initiatives.
In Q3, the benefits from these initiatives were more than offset by widely documented disruptions and inflationary pressure within the global supply chain.
As a result, we did not leverage supply chain in the quarter.
We completed the rollout of cross-banner replenishment, or CBR, for the originally planned group of stores in the quarter.
The completion of this milestone is driving cost savings through a reduction in stem miles from our DCs to stores.
Over the course of our implementation, our team identified additional stores that will be added over time.
Secondly, we're continuing the implementation of our new Warehouse Management System, or WMS. This is helping to deliver further improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity.
We successfully transitioned to our new WMS in approximately 36% of our distribution center network as measured by unit volume.
As previously communicated, we follow WMS with a new Labor Management System, or LMS, which drive standardization and productivity.
We are on track to complete the WMS and LMS implementations by the end of 2023 as discussed in April.
Further, our consolidation efforts to integrate WORLDPAC and Autopart International, known as AI, are also on track to be completed by early next year.
This is enabling accelerated growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A savings.
Gross margin expansion here comes behind the expanded distribution of AI's high margin owned brand products, such as shocks and struts, to the larger WORLDPAC customer base.
Finally, as we expand our store footprint, we're also enhancing our supply chain capabilities on the West Coast with the addition of a much larger and more modern DC in San Bernardino.
This facility will serve as the consolidation point for supplier shipments for the Western US and enable rapid e-commerce delivery.
In addition, we began to work to consolidate our DC network in the Greater Toronto area.
Two separate distribution centers, one Carquest and one WORLDPAC will be transitioned into a single brand-new facility that will allow us to better serve growing demand in the Ontario market.
We continue to execute our initiatives, both sales and profit per store along with the reduction of corporate SG&A.
As previewed on our Q2 call, we also faced both planned and unplanned inflationary cost pressure versus the prior year in Q3.
SG&A headwinds include higher than planned store labor cost per hour, higher incentive compensation and increased delivery costs associated with the recovery of our Professional business.
Jeff will discuss these and other SG&A details in a few minutes.
We remain on track with our sales and profit per store initiative, including our average sales per store objective of $1.8 million per store by 2023.
In terms of new locations year-to-date, we've opened 19 stores, six new WORLDPAC branches and converted 44 net new locations to the Carquest independent family.
This puts our net new locations at 69, including stores, branches and independents during the first three quarters.
Separately, we're actively working to convert the 109 locations in California we announced in April.
However, we're experiencing construction-related delays, primarily due to a much slower-than-normal permitting process.
This is attributable to more stringent guidelines associated with COVID-19, which were exacerbated by the surge of the Delta variant.
We now expect the majority of the store openings planned for 2021 to shift into 2022.
As a result, we're incurring start-up costs within SG&A for the balance of the year, while realizing less than planned revenue and income.
The good news is, we remain confident that once converted, these stores will be accretive to our growth trajectory.
The final area of margin expansion is reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs.
We began to realize some of the cost benefits related to the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, in addition to savings from our continued focus on team member safety.
In Q3, we saw a 22% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared with the prior year.
Our lost time injury rate improved 14% compared with the same period in 2020.
Our focus on team member safety is only one component of our ESG agenda at Advance.
Our vision advancing a world in motion is demonstrated by the objective we outlined last April to deliver top quartile total shareholder return in the 2021 through 2023 timeframe.
While delivering this goal, we're also focused on ESG.
As part of this commitment, we launched our first materiality assessment earlier this year to help prioritize ESG initiatives.
During Q3, we completed this assessment and are working to finalize the findings.
The results will be incorporated in our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report, which we expect to publish in mid-2022.
Before turning the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize all team members and generous customers for their contribution to our recent American Heart Association campaign.
This year, we introduced a new technology solution in stores that allows customers to round up at the point of sale.
This made it even easier for customers to participate and helped us achieve a record-setting campaign of $1.7 million.
The mission of this organization is important to all of us across the Advance family.
In Q3, our net sales increased 3.1% to $2.6 billion.
Adjusted gross profit margin improved 246 basis points to 46.2%, primarily the result of our ongoing category management initiatives, including strategic pricing, strategic sourcing, own brand expansion and favorable product mix.
Consistent with last quarter, these were partially offset by inflationary product and supply chain costs as well as an unfavorable channel mix.
In the quarter, same SKU inflation was approximately 3.6%, which was part of [Phonetic] our plan entering the year and was by far the largest headwind we had to overcome within gross profit.
We're working with all our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible.
Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin improved 184 basis points compared with the same period of 2020.
As expected, our Q3 SG&A expenses increased due to several factors we discussed earlier in the year.
As a percent of net sales, our adjusted SG&A deleveraged by 209 basis points, driven primarily by labor costs, which included a meaningful cost per hour increase as well as higher incentive compensation compared to the prior year.
In addition, we incurred higher delivery expenses related to serving our Professional customers and approximately $10 million in start-up costs related to the conversion of our California locations in Q3.
Year-to-date, SG&A as a percent of net sales was relatively flat compared to the same period of 2020, increasing 9 basis points year-over-year.
While we've reduced our COVID-19-related costs by $13 million year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers continues to be our top priority.
Our adjusted operating income increased to $274 million in Q3 compared to $256 million one year ago.
On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 37 basis points to 10.4%.
Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $3.21 compared to $2.64 in Q3 of 2020.
Compared with 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 31% in the quarter.
Our free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $734 million, an increase of 19% versus last year.
This increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating income as well as our continued focus on working capital metrics, including our accounts payable ratio, which expanded 351 basis points versus Q3 2020.
Year-to-date through Q3, our capital investments were $191 million.
We continue to focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity, while returning excess cash to shareholders.
In Q3, we returned approximately $228 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares at an average price of $205.65.
Year-to-date, we've returned approximately $792 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $189.43.
Since restarting our share repurchase program in Q3 of 2018, we returned over $2 billion in share repurchases at an average share price of approximately $164.
Additionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1 per share in the quarter totaling $63 million.
We remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from our business and expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in a balanced approach between dividends and buybacks.
As you saw in the yesterday's 8-K filing with the SEC, we recently closed the refinancing of our new five-year revolving credit facility.
The prior facility was set to mature in January 2023.
And the bank markets have returned to pre-pandemic levels, we took the opportunity to secure our liquidity for another five years.
This included improved pricing and terms while also increasing the overall facility size to $1.2 billion.
We have strong relationships with our banks.
And this commitment allows us to secure future financial flexibility.
More details of this facility can be found in our 8-K filings.
Turning to our updated full year outlook.
We are increasing 2021 sales and profit guidance to reflect the positive results year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year.
Through the first four weeks of Q4, we're continuing to see sales strength in our two-year stack, remaining in line with what we delivered in the last two quarters.
This guidance incorporates continued top-line strength, ongoing inflationary headwinds and up to an additional $10 million in start-up costs in Q4 related to our West Coast expansion.
As discussed, the construction environment in California remains challenging, resulting in a reduction of our guidance from new store openings and capital expenditures.
As a result, we're updating our full year 2021 guidance to net sales of $10.9 billion to $10.95 billion, comparable store sales of 9.5% to 10%, adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.4% to 9.5%, a minimum of 30 new stores this year, a minimum of $275 million in capex and a minimum of $725 million in free cash flow.
In summary, we're very excited about our current momentum.
We remain focused on the execution of the long-term strategy, while delivering top quartile total shareholder return over the 2021 to 2023 time frame.
","Advance Auto Parts reported strong financial results in Q3, driven by ongoing sales growth, margin expansion, and increased earnings per share. The company's net sales grew 3.1% to $2.6 billion, while comparable store sales increased 3.1%. Adjusted gross margin improved 246 basis points to 46.2%, mainly due to strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives. Adjusted operating income increased to $274 million, resulting in a 37 basis point expansion in the operating income margin to 10.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21.6% to $3.21 compared to Q3 2020. The company continues to invest in its team and business, expanding its store footprint, implementing new distribution centers, and enhancing its supply chain capabilities. Advance Auto Parts also remained committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, repurchasing shares at an average price of $205.65 and paying a cash dividend of $1 per share."
AAN_q1_2021.txt,"For those of you that have not, it is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.
Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP EPS, which have been adjusted for certain items which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies.
I'm very pleased with the strong start to 2021 and the positive momentum in revenue and margins we delivered in the first quarter, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business.
Consolidated revenues increased 11.1% year-over-year in our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company.
The revenue increase included same-store revenue growth of 14.8% and we reported adjusted EBITDA margin that improved to 15.4% of revenues.
This is the first quarter in over a decade that the Company has delivered double-digit same-store revenue growth.
Our teams in the field and our store support centers and Woodhaven are performing at a very high level and are energized and engaged.
As I visit Aaron's stores around the country to support our operations team, I'm seeing a strong sense of pride and optimism about our brand and our competitive position.
Our team members and customers are embracing the innovation that we are delivering and the dynamic lease-to-own market.
Over the last five years, we've significantly transformed the company for the goal of continuing to provide an exceptional customer and team member experience while also driving greater efficiencies in our operating model.
I'm proud to say that as of today we have a centralized decisioning platform that provides greater control and predictability resulting in a higher quality lease portfolio.
We have enhanced digital payment platforms that are enabling over 75% of monthly customer payments to be made outside of our stores.
We have an industry-leading, fully transactional e-commerce platform that is attracting a new and younger customer, and we have a portfolio of 51 GenNext stores that is currently outperforming our expectations with many more store openings in the pipeline.
All of these initiatives are underpinned by the investments that we have made in enhanced analytics and when combined with our more efficient operations are enabling us to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.
These transformations to our business model are contributing to our outstanding performance in the first quarter of 2021.
We are encouraged by the continuing improvement and the quality and size of our same-store lease portfolio, which ended the quarter up 6.2% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.
This improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our products, few release merchandise returns, and lower inventory write-offs.
In addition, our customer continues to benefit from the ongoing government stimulus, one of the most meaningful contributors to our strong portfolio performance was centralized decisioning, which we implemented across all Company-operated stores in the U.S., in the spring of 2020.
Today, nearly 70% of our portfolio is made up of lease agreements that were originated using this technology.
Centralized decisioning delivers consistency and predictability in the performance of our lease portfolio.
It enables store managers the flexibility to focus their time on growth-oriented activities such as sales and lease servicing.
We believe our algorithms provide better outcomes for both the customer and Aaron's with the goal of having a greater number of customers achieve ownership while at the same time reducing our cost to serve.
We continue to refine this decisioning across our various channels, and we expect this will continue to drive greater productivity from our lease portfolio.
Another contributor to our strong performance in the quarter was our e-commerce channel, which represented more than 14% of lease revenues.
Our e-commerce team has really delivered, driving traffic growth to aarons.com by 12.8% and increasing revenues by 42% in the first quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter.
E-commerce lease originations increased as compared to the year-ago quarter despite the significant shift of customer activity through our online platform in March of 2020 as stores closed during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, e-commerce write-offs improved by more than 50% compared to last year's quarter, primarily as a result of ongoing decisioning optimization, operational enhancements, and strong customer payment activity.
Our e-commerce team continues to deliver ongoing improvements through our online customer acquisition, conversion, and servicing capabilities, which is leading to margin growth and continued positive momentum in this important channel.
Our e-commerce growth in the quarter is enabled by our stores, which are not just showrooms and service centers but are also last-mile logistics hubs delivering an expanded assortment of products with same or next day delivery.
Finally, our Real estate repositioning and reinvestment strategy is gaining momentum and we expect it will drive future growth.
Our new GenNext stores have larger and more modern showrooms, expanded product assortment, and improved brand imaging and digital technologies.
To date, we have opened 51 new GenNext stores and have generated results that are meeting or exceeding our targeted internal rate of return equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in the first quarter.
Our plan for 2021 is to plan to open in the second and third quarters.
While we're excited about both the early financial results and the infrastructure we're building to accelerate our progress, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of this strategy.
We remain focused on our key strategic initiatives of simplifying and digitizing the customer experience, aligning our store footprint to our customer opportunity and promoting the Aaron's value proposition of low payments high approval rates and best-in-class service.
For the first quarter of 2021, revenues were $481.1 million compared to $432.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 11.1%.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to the improving quality and increased size of our lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity during the quarter, aided in part by government stimulus and partially offset by the net reduction of 166 Company-operated and franchised stores compared to the prior year.
As Douglas called out earlier, e-commerce revenues were up 42% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and represented 14.2% of overall lease revenues compared to 11.3% in 2020.
On a same-store revenue basis, revenues increased 14.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, the first double-digit, same-store revenue growth since 2009, and our fourth consecutive positive quarter.
Same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity, including retail sales and early purchase option exercises.
We believe this growth is partially a result of the government stimulus programs passed in 2020 and 2021.
Additionally, the company ended the first quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company operated stores of $128.8 million, an increase of 3.6% compared to the lease portfolio size as of March 31, 2020.
Lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements.
Operating expenses excluding restructuring expenses, spin-related transaction costs and the impairment of goodwill and other expenses, which were both recorded in the first quarter of 2020 were down $1.5 million as compared to the first quarter of last year.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in write-offs, store closures and the impact of the COVID-related reserves recorded in 2020, partially offset by higher personnel costs related to variable performance compensation, higher marketing expenses and an increase in bank and credit card related fees.
Adjusted EBITDA was $73.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared with $34.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $39.2 million or 112.9%.
As a percentage of total revenues, adjusted EBITDA was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with 8% for the same period last year, an improvement of 740 basis points.
The improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the items that drove the total revenues increase and a 310 basis point reduction in overall write-offs to 3.1% of lease revenues, including both improvement in the e-commerce and store origination channels compared to the prior year.
The improvement in write-offs was due primarily to the implementation of new decisioning technology, improved operations, the benefit of government stimulus and the impact of COVID-related lease merchandise reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and not repeated in 2021.
On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.24 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the same quarter in 2020, an increase of $0.94 or 313.3%.
Cash generated from operating activities was $20.2 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decline of $36.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher inventory purchases, partially offset by higher customer payments and other changes in working capital.
During the quarter, the company purchased 252,200 shares of Aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million.
As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $143.7 million remaining under the company's share repurchase authorization that was approved by our Board on March 3rd of this year.
The Company's Board of Directors also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share last month and we paid the dividend on April 6.
As of March 31, 2021 the company had a cash balance of $61.1 million, less than $500,000 of debt and total available liquidity of $295.5 million.
Turning to our outlook, based on our performance in the first quarter of 2021 and the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act in March, we have revised our full-year 2021 outlook.
For the full year, we expect consolidated revenues of between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion representing an increase in our revenue outlook of $75 million.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA of between $190 and $205 million, representing an increase in our adjusted EBITDA outlook of $35 million.
For the full year 2021, our outlook for the effective tax rate, depreciation and amortization and diluted weighted average share count are unchanged.
We have also increased our full-year same-store revenue outlook from a range of 0% to 2% to a range of 4% to 6%.
Similar to our original outlook, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2021 are expected to be higher in the second half of 2021.
This outlook assumes no impact from the expansion and acceleration of the child tax credit payments expected to begin in July 2021.
Additionally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment or in the state of the U.S. economy, as compared to its current condition and a continued improvement in global supply chain conditions.
","Aaron's reported a strong start to 2021 with a revenue increase of 11.1% to $481.1 million. Same-store revenue growth reached 14.8%, the first double-digit increase since 2009. This performance was driven by improved lease portfolio quality, strong customer payments, and government stimulus. The company saw a 740 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin to 15.4%, primarily due to lower write-offs and higher same-store revenues. As a result, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 313.3% to $1.24. Aaron's also increased its full-year outlook, projecting revenues between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion, a $75 million increase. The company expects continued improvement in its same-store revenue forecast, now ranging from 4% to 6%."
CHE_q2_2020.txt,"Before we begin, let me remind you that the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter, and David and Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.
First, let's start with the obvious.
Operating two separate and distinct service business segments with 17,000 employees during a national pandemic brings unique, unpredictable and abrupt challenges.
Fortunately VITAS and Roto-Rooter have been classified as essential services allowing Chemed to operate during the pandemic.
Maintaining operations in this environment is far from business as usual.
First and foremost, our number one focus has been and will remain on the safety and well-being of our employees, patients and customers.
We will maintain this focus regardless of the cost to safely operate during the pandemic.
April 2020 was probably the most challenging month, we have ever seen significant operating issues emerge daily, triggered primarily from incredibly fast-moving and sometimes contradictory federal, state and local government regulations.
Logistical operating issues were identified, analyzed and solutions for put in practice immediately.
We were able to develop and continuously refine effective work arounds on supply chain issues, labor and scheduling issues, patient access restrictions, employee safety, healthcare protocols, technology solutions as well as information security protocols allowing our employees to continuously serve our local communities in a safe agile manner.
We closely followed the myriad of federal, state and local regulations in the development and implementation of infrastructure necessary to safely allow our field, support and corporate support staff to safely limit as much as practical, physical interaction among our 17,000 employees.
On the VITAS segment, the federal government and specifically HHS and CMS have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth capabilities where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 plus patient census.
As most of you are aware on March 27, 2020 the CARES Act was signed in the law.
The CARES Act includes financial support for healthcare providers to maintain operational capacity as well as assist providers with issues caused by the coronavirus panic.
On April 10, 2020, VITAS without application received $80.2 million of CARES Act funds, that was formulaically determined by the federal government based on our 2019 Medicare fee-for-service revenue.
These CARES Act funds are specified to be used to prevent, prepare for and respond to the coronavirus, and shall reimburse the recipient for healthcare-related expenses or loss revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.
The ability of VITAS to retain and utilize the full $80.2 million from the relief fund will depend on the magnitude, timing and nature of the economic impact of COVID-19 within VITAS, as well as the guidelines and rules of the relief fund program.
This financial support is material for VITAS in maintaining its operational capacity at the safely care for our 19,000 patients.
In our first quarter earnings conference call, I stated we anticipated disruption within our patient referral and addition patterns due to significant healthcare system service restrictions in the coming quarter.
This disruption did materialize in our second quarter 2020 admissions declined 3.8% over the prior year.
However, the admissions trend did materially improve throughout the quarter.
Our April 2020 admissions were challenging and had a decline of 6.6%, may improve slightly with admission decline of 5.8%.
June showed significant improvement generated in admissions growth of 1.1%.
Roto-Rooter operations were also severely impacted at the start of the pandemic.
In late March 2020, we observed significant disruption in our Roto-Rooter commercial business.
As a reminder, historically, commercial services represented approximately 28% of Roto-Rooters consolidated revenue.
We made the decision for Roto-Rooter to maintain full staffing and operating capacity with no employee layoffs, as we entered the second quarter.
This decision could maintain our full operating strength was potentially an expenses strategic move and we monitored our demand metrics daily.
The decision to operate at full capacity is a classic risk reward calculation weighing brand awareness, customer satisfaction and the financial needs of our employees.
We also wanted to positioned to capitalize on any potential snapback in commercial and residential demand, both to protect existing marketing share as well as maximize our opportunities to grow market share.
I believe this is proven to be the correct strategic course.
Roto-Rooter services demand began to show weekly improvement beginning in the later part of April, and had strengthened unabated throughout the remainder of the second quarter.
This is reflected in our monthly performance with Roto-Rooter and unit-for-unit commercial revenue declining 38.6% in April, improving slightly to 31.8% decline in May and declining 19.7% in June.
Our residential services have proven to be exceptionally resilient, with our unit-for-unit residential revenue declining a modest 1.6% in April, increasing 11.7% in May and 18.7% in June.
All this translated into Roto-Rooter -- I mean unit-for-unit basis, having the second quarter 2020 commercial revenue declining 29.1%, residential revenue increasing 10.4% and Roto-Rooter consolidated unit-for-unit revenue declining a modest 1.6% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Although, we did have a modest decline in unit-for-unit revenue in the second quarter.
Including acquisitions Roto-Rooter generated consolidate revenue -- consolidated revenue growth of 8.6%.
Overall Roto-Rooter solid revenue growth with excellent adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EBITDA growth.
Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2020 totaled $46.8 million, an increase of 20.7%.
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, which is a 269 basis point increase when compared to, I'm sorry, excuse me.
The have increase in Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin is a contributed to our residential services, having a higher margin than commercial services, as well as increased residential excavation and water restoration services, which have a significantly higher direct contribution margin compared to commercial plumbing and drain cleaning services.
I'm very appreciative of the hard work, creative solutions and willingness of our 7,000 employees to adjust our operational routines and embrace new procedures.
With that, I would like to turn the teleconference over to David.
VITAS' net revenue was $327 million in the second quarter of 2020, which is an increase of 4.7% when compared to our prior year period.
This revenue increase is comprised primarily by 2.8% increase in days of care, a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase, including the suspension of sequestration on May 1 of 2020 of approximately 5.4% and acuity mix shift, which reduced the blended average Medicare rate increase by approximately 310 basis points.
The combination of increased Medicare Cap and a decrease in Medicaid net room and board pass-throughs, as well as reductions in other contra revenue activity, reduced total revenue growth in additional 42 basis points in the quarter.
Our average revenue per patient per day in the second quarter of 2020 was $194.02, which including the impact from acuity mix shift is 2.3% above the prior year period.
Reimbursement for routine home care and high acuity care averaged $165.22 and $985.23, respectively.
During the quarter, high acuity days of care were 3.5% of our total days of care, 69 basis points less than the prior year quarter.
This 69 basis points mix shift and high acuity days of care reduce the increase in average revenue per patient per day from 5.4% to 2.3% in the quarter.
VITAS accrued $5.8 million in Medicare Cap billing limitations and then second quarter of 2020.
This $5.8 million of Medicare Cap, includes approximately $2.3 million of cap liability attributed to the pandemic.
The suspension of sequestration resulted in additional 2% increase in reimbursement effective May 1 of 2020.
In Medicare, provider numbers that we're in a Medicare cap liability situation, there is 2% reimbursement increase was effectively eliminated by a corresponding increase in Medicare cap liability in those markets.
In addition, disruption in Medicare admissions and these Medicare cap liability markets resulted in a further increase in the projected fiscal 2020 Medicare Cap billing limitation.
The second quarter 2020 gross margin excluding Medicare Cap increased cost for personal protection equipment or PPE disinfecting facilities and increased costs for additional paid off or PTO for our front-line employees was 27.2%, which is a 352 basis point margin improvement when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
This increase in gross margin for VITAS is attributed to increased reimbursement from the elimination of sequestration on May 1, 2020.
A level of care mix shift to higher margin routine home care as well as efficiencies from utilizing telehealth were appropriate.
And from cost from reduced admissions volume intake and reduced high acuity hospital referred admissions that have short length of stay and in some cases negative gross margins.
Now let's turn to the Roto-Rooter segment.
Roto-Rooter generated quarterly revenue of $175 million in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $13.9 million or 8.6% over the prior year quarter.
And a unit-for-unit basis, which excludes the Oakland and Hoffman Southwest acquisitions completed in July 2019 and September 2019 respectively.
Roto-Rooter generated revenue of $158 million for the second quarter of 2020 a modest decline of 1.6% over the prior year quarter.
Total Roto-Rooter commercial revenue, excluding acquisitions, decreased 29.1% in the quarter.
This aggregate commercial revenue decline consisted of drain cleaning revenue decreasing 31.2%, commercial plumbing and excavation declining 28%, and commercial water restoration declining 20.3%.
Total residential revenue, excluding acquisitions increased 10.4%.
This aggregate revenue growth for residential consisted of residential drain cleaning increasing 10.2%, plumbing and excavation expanding 14.4% and commercial water restoration increasing 4.3%.
Roto-Rooter's gross margin in the quarter was 51.2%, a 247 basis point increase when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Now let's look at consolidated Chemed.
As of June 30, 2020 Chemed had total cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million and no long-term debt.
On our guidance, historically Chemed earnings guidance has been developed using previous year's key operating metrics, which are then modeled and projected out for the calendar year.
Critical within these projections is the understanding of traditional pattern correlations among key operating metrics.
Once, we complete this phase of our projected operating results, we would then modify the projections for the timing of price increases, changing the commission structure, wages, marketing programs and a variety of continuous improvement initiatives that our business segments plan on executing over the coming year.
This modeling exercise also takes into consideration anticipated industry and macroeconomic issues outside of management's control but are somewhat predictable in terms of their timing and impact on our business segments operating results.
The 2020 pandemic has made accurate modeling and providing meaningful earnings guidance for Chemed exceptionally challenging.
Federal, state and local government authorities are forced to make swift decisions within our healthcare system, labor pools and general economy.
These governmental decisions have the potential for an immediate and material impact on VITAS and Roto-Rooter operating results.
However over the past four months, Chemed has been able to successfully navigate within this rapidly changing environment and produce operating results that we believe provide us with the ability to issue meaningful guidance for the remainder of the calendar year.
However, this guidance should be taken with the recognition the pandemic will continue to materially disrupt all aspects of our healthcare system and general economy to such an extent that future rules, regulations and government mandates could materially impact our ability to achieve this guidance.
With that said, revenue growth for VITAS in 2020, prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be in the range of 5% to 7%.
Our Average Daily Census in 2020 is estimated to expand approximately 2% to 4%.
And our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 19% to 20%.
We are currently estimating $17 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations for the calendar year 2020.
We also anticipate the $80.2 million of CARES Act funds that Chemed just -- Kevin described earlier that our formulaically calculated by the federal government based upon our 2019 Medicare fee-for-service revenue will be adequate to cover our increased costs specifically related to operating our healthcare unit during the pandemic, as well as any incremental Medicare Cap billing limitations that are triggered from declines in Medicare admissions.
I should also note that Chemed's full year adjusted earnings per share guidance eliminate any financial benefit from the CARES Act funds that relate to lost revenue.
We anticipate returning any unused CARES Act to the federal government at the end of the pandemic measurement period.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve the full year 2020 revenue growth of 9% to 10%.
Adjusted EBITDA for Roto-Rooter for 2020 is estimated to be in the range of 23% to 25%, Based upon this discussion, our full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock options, cost related to litigation, CARES Act funds used for lost revenue and other discrete items is estimated to be in the range of $16.20 to $16.40.
This 2020 full year, calendar year guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate of 25.2% and as a comparison Chemed's 2019 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share were $13.96.
The interdisciplinary team approach that is the foundation of the hospice benefit has never been more evident for our organization across the country, then through this entire pandemic.
Coordination of our entire team from our sales team providing pandemic relevant education to our disrupted healthcare partner through our admissions teams responding to referrals, enabling our clinical care teams to provide care around the clock with the support of our care coordination centers, home medical equipment division and back office support has been remarkable.
All of this enabled us to care for 19,185 patients each day within the quarter, while bringing on the service 16,822 patients who needed high quality hospice care during this pandemic.
We lived our internal model that we've been sharing during the pandemic, which is, yes, we can, and together we will.
Now let's discuss our second quarter 2020 operating metrics.
As I mentioned in the second quarter, our average daily census was 19,195 patients, an increase of 2.8% over the prior year.
Total admissions in the quarter were 16,822.
This is a 3.8% decline in admissions when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Admissions performance in the quarter was primarily impacted by the level of disruption, which occurred at each of our referring partners across the healthcare continuum.
For example, admissions from hospitals were pressured due to the reduction in available bed capacity and elective procedures, resulting in fewer patients accessing and subsequently being discharged from hospitals.
Admissions from physician offices, whom were disrupted but were able to remain operational through telehealth interactions saw an increase due to the number of patients choosing to access the disrupted healthcare system through their primary or specialty physician practice along with medical offices.
Lastly, placement of admissions in the nursing homes and assisted-living facilities were significantly impacted due to the barriers and the restriction of access toward new residents.
These types of admission difficulties are reflected in our actual admission results based upon our patient's pre-admit location.
In the second quarter, our admissions increased 7.1% in our home-based preadmit locations.
However, this admission group -- admission growth was more than offset by the combination of hospital admissions declining 4%, nursing home management's decreasing 22.8% and assisted living facility admissions declining 10.2% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Our average length of stay in the quarter was 90.9 days.
This compares to 91.1 days in the second quarter of 2019, in 90.7 days in the first quarter of 2020.
Our median length of stay was 14 days in the quarter, which is two days less than the 16 day median in the second quarter of 2019 and equal to the first quarter of 2020.
Median length of stay is a key indicator of our penetration into the high acuity sector of the market.
First, we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees, patients and their families as we have successfully done since March.
We have and will continue to source PPE and we are comfortable with the inventory levels to sustain employee need based upon patient and local circumstances.
Additionally, we will continue to utilize the infrastructure we lifted up to manage testing requirements for certain facilities across the country to allow us to safely access our partners' facilities to care for existing patients and placement of new patients when appropriate.
Our entire team will continue to collaborate safely with our local healthcare partners to successfully navigate patients and their families on to the hospice benefit during this unique time.
Lastly, and most importantly, our team will stay committed to persevere and provide care to all the patients and families in need in the communities we serve.
I will now open this teleconference to questions.
","Despite operating as essential services during the pandemic, VITAS and Roto-Rooter experienced significant challenges. However, April saw the most difficulties, and operations gradually improved throughout Q2. VITAS' net revenue increased by 4.7%, with admissions declining by 3.8%. Roto-Rooter's revenue increased by 8.6%, with a decline in commercial services offset by growth in residential services. Both segments maintained profitability, with Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 26.8%. Chemed estimates 2020 revenue growth for VITAS of 5% to 7%, Average Daily Census expansion of 2% to 4%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% to 20%. Roto-Rooter's full-year revenue growth is projected to be 9% to 10%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23% to 25%. Chemed's full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share are estimated at $16.20 to $16.40, excluding non-cash expenses, tax benefits, litigation costs, and CARES Act funds used for lost revenue. The company prioritized employee safety, ensured supply chain stability, and continued to provide high-quality care and services, adhering to government regulations and adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic."

EOG is focused on improving returns.
Results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double-premium investment standard.
Once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter.
We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow, repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last quarter.
Our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per-unit operating costs were below expectations.
We are delivering exceptional well productivity that continues to improve.
In addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the company's unique ability to sustainably lower cost.
Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.
I'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow.
As double premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value.
The regular dividend, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks and small high-return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.
In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by $750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of $1.5 billion in regular and special dividends.
We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions in the Delaware Basin over the last 12 months.
Year-to-date, we have committed $2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion of free cash flow we've generated.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed.
As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way.
We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns.
Over the last four years, we've made huge progress reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations.
We are focused on continued progress toward reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.
This quarter, we announced a carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net-zero ambition.
Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments.
Driven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest costs, highest return and lowest emission producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.
Now, here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve.
While we announced our shift to the double-premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well.
In the three years that followed, our premium drilling program drove a 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment nearly 40% lower compared to the three-year period prior to premium.
In addition, premium enabled this remarkable step change in our financial performance, while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow.
The impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck is now positioning EOG for a similar step change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, capital efficiency, and cash flow.
Double premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs, resulting in well payouts of approximately six months at current strip prices.
The increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these high-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow.
This year, we are averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost.
Adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company, and when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions is driving higher full-cycle returns.
Looking back over the last four quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52.
We are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil, and it begins with disciplined reinvestment in high-return double-premium drilling.
While EOG has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double-premium wells located across each of our core assets.
We are confident we can continue to grow our double-premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well cost and well productivity and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last five years.
In the past 12 months, through eight deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2,500 per acre.
These are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which, in some cases, receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure.
Premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory.
Exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle.
EOG's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory predominantly through organic exploration is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals.
2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG.
Our exceptional well level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns and our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation.
Here's Billy with an update on our operational performance.
Our operating teams continue to deliver strong results.
Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results.
In addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions.
We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021.
We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year.
As a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020.
We continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector.
Average drilling days are down 11%, and the feet of lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%.
We are utilizing our recently discussed super-zipper completions on about one third our well packages this year and expect that percentage to increase next year.
In addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date.
We have line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.
Water reuse is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand reuse infrastructure throughout our development areas.
Finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-priced contracts for drilling rigs and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next.
We also use the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas.
As an example, last summer, we prepurchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when prices were at their lowest point.
EOG is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry.
As a reminder, 65% of our well costs are locked in for the year, and the remaining costs we are actively working down through operational efficiencies.
As usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity, with the goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022.
But as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year.
The same amount of air freight is being placed on reducing our per-unit operating cost, with the results showing up in reduced LOE, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense and lower maintenance expenses.
Savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift.
We have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate.
These optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well.
These and other continual improvements are a great testament to our pleased but not satisfied culture.
This quarter, we can also update you on our final ESG performance results from last year.
We reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity.
Operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future -- further improvements to our emissions performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for GHG and methane and our goal to eliminate routine flaring.
Achieving these targets is the first step on the path toward our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040.
Water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off.
Nearly all water used in our Powder River Basin operations last year was sourced from reuse.
For companywide operations in the U.S., water supplied by reuse sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than one-fifth of the total water used.
These achievements and other, along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in October.
We are starting to fill in the pieces on the road map to get to net-zero by 2040.
Here's Ken with the details.
Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040.
Our ambition is aggressive but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error.
This approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset.
We pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas.
Here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions.
We then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible.
Our net-zero strategy generally falls into three categories: reduce, capture or offset.
That is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage and offsetting any remaining emissions.
Reducing emissions intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint.
Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results.
We made excellent progress in the last four years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field, invest in pilots using existing and new technologies and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies.
As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80% and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%.
We recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop gas capture project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption.
We designed an automated system that redirects natural gas back into our infrastructure system and injects the gas temporarily back into existing wells.
The project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further -- for future production and beneficial use.
The result is a double-premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions.
Our wellhead gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and roll-out of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will help capture more of the remaining 0.4%.
Turning to our efforts to capture CO2.
We are launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage.
This project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of EOG's direct CO2 emissions.
We believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capture and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, well and facility design and field operations.
Our CCS efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business.
We will provide updates on our pilot CCS project as it progresses.
EOG is also exploring other innovative solutions for GHG emissions reductions.
Over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift.
Compressors are the largest source of EOG's stationary combustion emissions.
By replacing NGL-rich field gas with lean residue gas, EOG can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel which lowers CO2 emissions and improves engine efficiency.
Using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel.
Another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas.
While it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale.
We're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements or exploration success.
This is a bottom-up-driven initiative.
EOG employees thrive on this type of challenge.
We create innovative solutions and apply technology to solve problems, improve processes and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns.
The EOG culture has embraced our 2040 net zero ambition, and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible.
Now, here is Bill to wrap up.
In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways.
First, by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been.
Results from the first half of this year demonstrate the power of double premium and the beginning of another step change in performance.
Second, EOG is not satisfied.
We are committed to getting better.
Sustainable cost reduction and improving well performance are driving returns and free cash flow potential to another level.
At the same time, the same innovative culture that is driving higher returns is also improving our environmental performance.
Third, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders has not changed.
As we have already demonstrated, returning meaningful cash to shareholders remains a priority.
And finally, as Ezra transitions into the CEO role, I could not be more excited about the future of the company.
The quality of our assets and the quality of this leadership team are the best in company history, all supported by EOG's talented employees and unique culture that continues to fire on all cylinders.
The company is incredibly strong and our ability to get stronger has never been better.
The future of EOG is in great hands.
Now, we'll go to Q&A.
","EOG's strong performance in the first half of the year showcases the success of its double-premium investment standard, which requires a minimum 60% direct after-tax rate of return using conservative commodity prices. This shift has positioned EOG for a step change in productivity and cost reductions. The company delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, reflecting exceptional operational performance with oil production exceeding guidance and capital expenditures below expectations. EOG continues to demonstrate its ability to sustainably lower costs in an inflationary environment, with well costs expected to be more than 7% lower than last year. The company remains committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends, debt reduction, and bolt-on acquisitions while focusing on reducing GHG emissions and pursuing net-zero ambition by 2040 through a combination of emissions reduction, capture, and offset strategies."
TRI_q3_2021.txt,"I'm joined today by our CEO, Steve Hasker, and our CFO, Mike Eastwood.
We believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business.
Actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the COVID pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies.
You may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
I'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter.
Our revenue and sales performance was strong, exceeded our expectations and position us well for Q4 and 2022.
We expect to close out the year on a strong footing and appreciate the efforts of our sales and our go-to-market teams.
This strong performance demonstrates our markets remain healthy and growing.
And our products across legal, tax, corporates and risk, fraud, and compliance fit the needs of our customers.
Our products enable them to effectively equip their professionals to better serve their clients.
We're also seeing improving customer engagement, including 8,000 registrations for our annual Legal, Tax and Corporates SYNERGY conferences around the world.
These conferences are our premier events for professionals who want to understand the future of their professions, learn the latest trends, and experience how tools and data-driven technology can transform their firms, organizations, agencies, and roles.
Our leadership team, including the president of our Corporates business, Sunil Pandita; and the president of our Tax & Accounting Professionals business, Elizabeth Beastrom, will be joining nearly 2,000 of our customers for the upcoming SYNERGY conferences in November in Nashville.
And as I mentioned last quarter, our customers continue to exhibit confidence in both an improving economic environment and in their own prospects.
This potent ecosystem plays to our advantage, and we will continue to capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing to drive growth and expand our positions.
Now to the results.
Our third quarter results reflected a standout performance.
Four of our five business segments recorded organic revenue growth of 6%.
That performance resulted in total company organic revenue growth of 5%, putting us well above the 3.5% to 4% third quarter guidance provided in August.
Our healthy markets are providing us with a tailwind.
That tailwind, coupled with our nine-month results, give us confidence in our prospects for the fourth quarter.
As a result, we've once again raised our full year revenue and free cash flow guidance.
Full year total company organic revenue growth is now forecast to be between 4.5% and 5% and approximately 6% for the Big 3 businesses.
Free cash flow for the year is now forecast to be approximately $1.2 billion.
Turning to our Change Program.
We're making consistent progress as we work through -- as we work toward becoming an integrated operating company.
As of September 30, we recorded run rate savings of about $130 million, putting us on a path to achieve $200 million by year end.
I'll remind you, our aggregate savings target is $600 million by the end of 2023, $200 million of which we plan to reinvest in the business.
Finally, we were active during the quarter executing on the $1.2 billion share buyback program we announced in August.
We've already bought back $1.1 billion of stock, and we expect to complete the program before year end.
So given the progress we're making, we also reaffirmed our guidance for 2022 and 2023.
Now to the results for the quarter.
Contributing to this performance was strong organic growth of more than 20% from our Latin American businesses and nearly 10% growth from our Asia and emerging markets businesses.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 7% to $458 million due to costs related to the Change Program, resulting in a margin of 30%.
Excluding Change Program costs, adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.5%.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, compared to $0.39 per share in the prior-year period.
Turning to the results by segment.
The Big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 6% for the quarter.
Legal's third quarter performance was again strong with organic revenue growth of 6%.
This was Legal's second consecutive quarter of 6% growth, its highest quarterly growth rate in over a decade.
The U.S. legal market continues to be very healthy across the board for small, mid, and large-sized firms, as well as for government and across geographies.
For example, Westlaw Edge continues to achieve strong sales growth and ended the quarter with an annual contract value or ACV penetration of 60%, achieving our full year ACV penetration guidance.
Second, Practical Law, as reported in the Legal segment, continues its strong performance, again growing double digits.
We forecast similar growth in 2022 and continue to invest in this key legal workflow initiative.
Third, our Government business, which is managed within our Legal segment, continues to perform and grew 10% organically.
And fourth, FindLaw grew over 10%, and our Legal businesses in Canada, Europe and Asia all grew mid-single-digit in the quarter.
Legal again achieved strong sales for both the quarter and nine-month periods, recording double-digit recurring sales growth, reflecting customers' willingness and ability to invest in productivity-enhancing products.
Turning to the Corporates business.
Organic revenue growth increased to 6% from 4% in the first half of the year.
This improvement came from increasing demand from customers for our legal, tax, and risk products.
Reuters News organic revenues also increased 6%, the second consecutive quarter of 6% growth.
This was driven by the Professional business, which includes Reuters Events, which grew over 60% and continues to recover from the negative impact of COVID-19 in 2020.
Finally, Global Print organic revenues declined 5%, less than expected, due to a continued gradual return to office by our customers and higher third-party print revenues.
In summary, it was another strong quarter, but we're taking nothing for granted.
We continue to invest in the businesses to enable us to further support our customers and properly position us for 2022 and beyond.
We still have much work to do in executing our Change Program, and we've assembled a talented team over the past 18 months who are working well together and clearly understand our goals and our timelines.
I'm very pleased with our progress to date.
One additional comment regarding growth.
As you can see on this slide, momentum has been building for our Big 3 businesses over the past 11 quarters, which we believe will continue in the fourth quarter and into next year.
I know many investors have historically viewed our markets as slower growing and have perceived our Legal and Tax businesses in particular as low single-digit growers.
We firmly believe that's not the case and, in fact, think that with successful execution of the Change Program, combined with appropriate investments, we can improve growth on a sustainable basis.
Our markets are broad and dynamic and we have strong positions in the right subsegments.
Also, we have numerous levers to pull across our businesses.
And we're investing in our strategic seven initiatives, which are performing well, and we expect they will continue to do so.
This confluence of factors places us in a position where we believe we can grow mid-single digit on a consistent basis over the cycle.
These factors position us well to achieve the upper end of the range of our 2022 revenue guidance of 4% to 5%.
We'll discuss our 2022 guidance further when we report our fourth quarter and full year results in February.
Let me share an example of products that we believe will contribute to sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth that I just referred to.
First, you'll recall at our investor day, I discussed our goal of becoming a content-driven technology company, which includes excelling at product innovation and successfully integrating our products to provide customers with a seamless offering while delivering an excellent customer experience.
We expect this will further improve the customer loyalty and increase retention as we continually enhance our products, adding to organic growth.
And at investor day, I highlighted seven strategic priorities reflected on this slide.
Those include several of our legal workflow solutions: HighQ, Practical Law and Contract Express.
Last month, we released the latest version of HighQ.
This release features key integrations with Practical Law, Contract Express, Elite 3E and Microsoft Teams and includes more than 50 enhancements and upgrades.
It's an example of an integrated workflow solution that customers are asking for.
It helps legal professionals and other corporate professionals working with the legal team to identify their work and improve client satisfaction.
This leverages Contract Express to automate and improve documents.
It enables lawyers to structure matters with Practical Law.
And it integrates Elite 3E data with HighQ visualization tools to provide greater transparency around client spend and work in progress.
This is truly an integrated legal workflow solution and an example of content-driven technology.
Today, these four legal products are growing double digit, comprising over 10% of total company revenue and are contributing to the improving growth in both our Legal and Corporates segments.
HighQ is just one example of how we're building holistic solutions for our customers through greater product innovation and integration.
I expect to share more such examples of product innovation with you in the coming quarters.
Two weeks ago, we announced the establishment of a $100 million corporate venture capital fund focused on the future of professionals.
Thomson Reuters Ventures will continue -- will concentrate on investments and portfolio support for companies building breakthrough innovations that will allow professionals to operate more productively and with greater insights.
It will focus across the legal, tax and accounting, risk, fraud, and compliance, and news and media markets to identify and support innovative companies to help our customers deliver more to their clients.
The fund will be overseen by our chief strategy officer, Pat Wilburn.
It's an example of how we're thinking about driving more innovation across the company and seeking new opportunities to further strengthen our businesses.
As a reminder, I will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis.
Let me start by discussing the third quarter revenue performance of our Big 3 segments.
Organic revenues and revenues at constant currency were both up 6% for the quarter.
This marks the fifth consecutive quarter our Big 3 segments have grown at least 5%.
Legal Professionals total and organic revenues increased 6% in the third quarter.
Recurring organic revenue grew 6%.
And transaction revenues increased 10% related to our Elite, FindLaw and Government businesses.
Westlaw Edge added about 100 basis points to Legal's organic growth rate, is maintaining a healthy premium and is expected to continue to contribute at a similar level going forward.
Our Government business, which is reported within Legal and includes much of our risk, fraud, and compliance businesses, had a strong quarter, with total revenue growth of 11% and organic growth of 10%.
In our Corporates segment, total and organic revenues increased 6% due to recurring organic revenue growth of 7% and transactions organic revenue growth of 2%.
Recurring revenue was driven by Practical Law, Indirect Tax and CLEAR, as well as our businesses in Latin America and Asia and emerging markets.
And finally, Tax & Accounting's total and organic revenues grew 6%, driven by 10% recurring organic revenue growth.
Growth was driven by the Latin America businesses and audit solutions, which includes Confirmation.
Transactions organic revenue declined 9%, resulting from the year-over-year timing of individual tax filing deadlines.
I will remind you, last year, paper return revenue shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter.
Normalizing for this timing, organic revenues for Tax & Accounting were up 11% in Q3.
Moving to Reuters News.
Third quarter performance was strong, achieving total and organic revenue growth of 6%, primarily due to the Agency business and Professional business, which includes Reuters Events.
In Global Print, total and organic revenues declined 5%, at the lower end of the range we had forecast of minus 5% to minus 8%.
We expect full year Global Print revenue to decline between 4% and 6%.
On a consolidated basis, third quarter total and organic revenues each increased 5%.
Before turning to profitability, let's look closer at recurring and transaction revenue results for the third quarter.
Starting on the left side, total company organic revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was up 5% compared to 2% in the third quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID.
If we look at Q3 2021 performance for the Big 3, you will see organic revenues increased 6% compared to 5% in the same period last year.
Total company recurring organic revenues grew 6% in Q3, 230 basis points above Q3 2020.
And the Big 3 recurring organic revenues grew 7%, which was above last year's third quarter growth of 5%.
Turning to the graph in the bottom right of the slide.
Transaction revenues were up 8%, as the third quarter of 2020 was impacted by COVID, which affected our implementation services and the Reuters Events business.
We continue to remain encouraged by our momentum in 2021, especially for recurring revenues.
This gives us confidence in the trajectory of the business and sustainability beyond 2021.
As previously stated by Steve, we have increased our full year revenue guidance.
Starting with the total TR chart on the top left, we now estimate full year total and organic revenues will grow between 4.5% and 5%.
This is an increase from the previous guidance of 4% to 4.5%.
The Big 3 total and organic revenues are now forecast to grow approximately 6% for the full year, up from the previous guidance of 5.5% to 6%.
Moving to Reuters News.
We forecast full year total and organic revenues to grow between 3% and 5%, driven mainly by our Reuters Professional business.
This is an increase from the previous guidance of 2% to 3%.
Finally, Global Print full year revenues are expected to decline between 4% and 6%, an improvement from our previous guidance of a 4% to 7% decline.
Turning to our profitability performance in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Big 3 segments was $468 million, up 7% from the prior-year period.
The strong EBITDA growth for each of the three businesses was driven by higher revenue growth and a benefit from 2020 cost-savings initiatives, offset by incremental business-as-usual investments in advance of 2022.
As discussed in the second quarter, we are investing more in go-to-market initiatives, enterprise technology, and data and analytics capabilities in the second half of 2021, with a greater concentration of spend in Q4.
I will remind you, the Change Program operating costs are recorded at the corporate level.
Moving to Reuters News.
Adjusted EBITDA was $25 million, $2 million more than the prior-year period, driven by revenue growth.
Global Print adjusted EBITDA was $52 million with a margin of 35%, a decline of about 600 basis points due to the decrease in revenues and the dilutive impact of lower margin third-party print revenue.
So in aggregate, total company adjusted EBITDA was $458 million, a 7% decrease versus Q3 2020.
Excluding costs related to the Change Program, adjusted EBITDA increased 4%.
The third quarter's adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% and was 33.5% on an underlying basis, excluding costs related to the Change Program.
Now let me turn to our earnings per share, free cash flow performance, and Change Program cost.
Starting with earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.46 per share versus $0.39 per share in the prior-year period, an 18% increase.
The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation and amortization and lower income taxes, partially offset by lower adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year, we have decreased our tax rate guidance to between 14% and 16% due to favorable results from the settlement of prior tax years in various jurisdictions.
Currency had a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter.
Let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the first nine months.
Our reported free cash flow was $1 billion versus $881 million in the prior-year period, an improvement of $120 million.
Consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting free cash flow performance.
Working from the bottom of the slide upwards, the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $59 million more than the prior-year period.
tax authority related to our former Refinitiv business.
In the first nine months, we made $94 million of Change Program payments as compared to Refinitiv-related separation cost of $87 million in the prior-year period.
So if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was just shy of $1.2 billion, $327 million better than the prior-year period.
This increase was primarily due to higher EBITDA, favorable working capital movements, and dividends from our interest in LSEG.
Now an update on our Change Program run rate savings.
In the third quarter, we achieved $42 million of annual run rate operating expense savings.
This brings the cumulative annual run rate operating expense savings up to $132 million for the Change Program.
We are forecasting to achieve $200 million of cumulative annual run rate operating expense savings by the end of this year.
As a reminder, we anticipate operating expense savings of $600 million by 2023 while reinvesting $200 million back into the business or net savings of $400 million.
Achieving $200 million of operating expense savings by the end of 2021 would put us a third of the way toward our goal of $600 million of gross savings by 2023.
We will continue to provide quarterly updates on run rate Change Program savings.
Now an update on our Change Program cost for the third quarter and the rest of 2021.
Spend during the third quarter was $79 million, which included $53 million of opex and $26 million of capex.
Total spend in the first nine months of the year was $170 million.
We now anticipate opex and capex spending between $120 million and $150 million in the fourth quarter.
Spend is forecast to step up related to cloud migration, streamlining internal systems, third-party contractors to support the Change Program and higher capital expenditures.
For the full year, we now expect Change Program opex and capex spend to be between $290 million and $320 million.
This is slightly lower than the previous guidance range of $300 million to $350 million.
We expect the lower spend in 2021 to carry over into 2022 as we are still expecting to incur approximately $600 million over the course of the program.
We will provide formal guidance on Change Program spend for 2022 when we report our fourth quarter results in February.
There is no change in the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex.
We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our Change Program spend.
And as Steve outlined, today, we increased our full year outlook for total TR and Big 3 revenue growth.
We also increased our full year free cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion.
Additionally, we have slightly lowered our guidance on Change Program spend for both opex and capex for 2021 and carry that underspend over to 2022.
We have also decreased our effective tax rate outlook, both of which are reflected on this slide.
Lastly, we reaffirm the balance of our full year 2021 guidance as well as our 2022 and 2023 guidance previously provided.
And we remain confident in achieving the targets for all metrics.
That concludes our formal remarks on our third quarter results.
So if we could have the first question, operator, please?
","Thompson Reuters reported strong third-quarter results with 5% organic revenue growth across all segments, primarily driven by Legal, Tax & Accounting, and Corporates. The company's Legal division recorded six consecutive quarters of growth, with Legal's organic revenue increasing 6%, while Tax & Accounting grew 6% and Corporates improved to 6%. Reuters News also saw strong performance, with organic revenue increasing 6%. Despite a 7% decline in adjusted EBITDA to $458 million due to Change Program costs, adjusted EPS increased 18% to $0.46. The company increased its full-year guidance for total company organic revenue growth to 4.5% - 5.0%, with free cash flow now expected around $1.2 billion. The Change Program continues to make progress, with $130 million in annual run rate savings achieved, and reaffirmed its guidance for 2022 and 2023, including $600 million in savings by 2023."
SFE_q4_2019.txt,"During today's call, Brian will provide a corporate and strategic update and review recent highlights and Mark will discuss our results.
Many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to predict or control.
As a result of these and other factors, the Company's past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
During the course of today's call, words such as expect, anticipate, believe and intend will be used in our discussions of goals or events in the future.
We encourage you to read Safeguard's filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K which describes in detail the risks and uncertainties associated with managing our business.
With that, here is Brian.
We continued to do in 2019 what we started to pursue early in 2018.
We continue to diligently pursue our goals to prudently manage and support our portfolio of private company ownership interests, to maximize the value of our interests and to monetize and return the value of the portfolio to you in the most efficient manner possible.
Today, we want to reiterate our focus and convey to you the strong belief we have regarding the current and the anticipated exit values of our remaining portfolio of companies.
We believe 2019 was a year full of important milestones that we would like to revisit as we look forward to the opportunities in front of us.
The most significant milestone in 2019 was the return of capital dividend that we paid in December.
That dividend was made possible by the successful completion of the first stage of our return of capital strategy, accomplishing a series of successful exits, including Propeller and Transactis earlier in 2019 and the repayment of our $85 million in debt.
The six major exit transactions that we have executed since the beginning of 2018 have allowed us to not only repay our debt but also to continue to support our portfolio as and where appropriate as it has grown and matured.
In aggregate, to date, we have returned over $187 million to our balance sheet, including over $104 million in 2019 via exit transactions since we began our new strategic direction in 2018.
The disciplined approach to managing our portfolio and realizing exit proceeds has not only resulted in Safeguard being debt free and initiating our return of value transactions, but also provided us with $25 million of cash today that is sufficient to fund our scaled down operations and expected deployments.
Most importantly, Safeguard continues to hold a valuable portfolio of ownership interests, representing approximately $230 million of deployed capital in 15 tech-enabled companies and our other ownership interests.
Our companies as a whole are growing and are being positioned for exits.
Six of our companies have run rates of between $5 million and $10 million of annual revenue.
Another six have run rates of over $10 million.
And the average growth rate of the non-digital media companies is 54%.
As with all growth stage portfolios, there remain challenges and obstacles that we will need to overcome before exits occur, but we are encouraged by our group of entrepreneurial companies and the progress they are each making toward their strategic goals.
Safeguard's return of value to shareholders plan going forward continues to be straightforward.
Whenever we have cash and cash equivalents exceeding our minimum required capital, currently $25 million, we will evaluate a return of value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner in the form of either share repurchases and/or dividends.
We are also continually evaluating different opportunities to exit partner companies either through the sale of entire companies, the sale of SFE stakes, recapitalization and other methods.
To preserve cash and in a continuing effort to downsize all facets of our cost structure and to further align interest with our shareholders, our Board will be reduced from six to four directors as of our 2020 Annual Meeting, and director compensation is now being paid entirely in Safeguard equity.
While we are pleased with what we've accomplished over the last two years, we realize that there is much work left to be done and significant value yet to be realized for our shareholders.
We remain committed to being good stewards of Safeguard's assets and continuing our pursuit of additional exit transactions that will monetize our ownership interests and return value to shareholders.
We continue the pursuit of individual company exits while considering all alternatives as circumstances dictate, including the sale of individual partner company interests in secondary market transactions, the sale of entire companies or a combination thereof.
We will also continue to consider financing transactions which could expedite the return of value to our shareholders.
We are constantly dialoging with our partner companies, other investors and board members of those companies concerning exit opportunities.
A significant number of our companies have active bank relationships in place to assist in those discussions.
We remain bullish regarding our portfolio of companies, and we continue to believe that the current value of our ownership interests and our cash and cash equivalents significantly exceed our current share price.
We've accomplished a lot under our new strategy, including streamlining our internal operations to reduce costs, repaying our debt and moving forward with strategic transactions involving our companies that have returned significant capital back to Safeguard, which has also allowed us to retire our debt and implement our return of capital program.
We are pleased with what we have accomplished, but much work is left to be done.
We continue to work with our other companies on potential exits, and we hope to have more news to share in the coming months.
We believe that our companies will continue to mature and attract strategic and financial buyer attention as we continue to explore the exit alternatives we referenced above.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, Safeguard's net income was $54.6 million or $2.64 per share.
That's compared with a net loss of $15.6 million or $0.76 per share for the same period in 2018.
Our fourth quarter resulted in a net loss of $0.7 million or $0.03 per share as compared with a net loss of $16.6 million or $0.81 per share for the same quarter in 2018.
Two large elements impacting the financial results and our financial position for the fourth quarter included the continued downward trajectory of our general and administrative costs as compared to prior periods and of course the $1 per share return of capital dividend.
We'll speak to those further later in the call, but let me first comment on our liquidity position.
Safeguard's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and securities at December 31, 2019 totaled $25 million, and we have no debt obligations.
As we've discussed on prior calls, this is the initial targeted level of minimum capital we have determined necessary in order to fund follow-on deployments to support our existing ownership interests and to fund our scaled down corporate structure for multiple years.
We are eager to continue our process of returning value to shareholders as soon as we have additional cash to do so.
As we've also previously discussed, the Board declared a $1 per share special dividend that was paid on December 30.
Our year-end results have confirmed our previous analysis that our cumulative and year-to-date earnings and profits allow this dividend to be characterized as a return of capital for federal tax purposes.
Now I'll move back to our results of operations for the 2019 year, which includes the previously disclosed successes such as a $35.1 million gain from the exit of Propeller and a $50.7 million gain related to the exit from Transactis.
In addition, we have recorded aggregate gains of $4.3 million for additional amounts received for holdbacks and escrows related to the other prior transactions, including $2.6 million of which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our 2019 results also included the impairment we disclosed in the second quarter of $3 million with respect to our interest in NovaSom.
Our general and administrative expenses were $2.1 million and $10 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 respectively.
Both of these compared favorably to the comparable prior year period and were the result of our scaled-down level of staffing.
The decrease relative to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation from a lower overall level of staffing, the absence of $3.8 million in severance charges and lower professional fees.
For the fourth quarter, corporate expenses, which represent general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, severance and retirement costs and other nonrecurring or other items, were $1.4 million compared with $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
For the ended December 31, 2019, those same expenses were $7.1 million as compared to $9.9 million in 2018.
The quarter-to-quarter reduction is a result of lower office costs resulting from the relocation to a smaller office space, lower compensation costs, lower professional fees and the reflection of director fees as a stock-based compensation item.
The annual reductions similarly reflect the net benefit from our office move to lower cost facilities, lower overall compensation costs, lower professional fees and lower cash director fees during 2019 as well as the shift to equity-based compensation that impacted the fourth quarter's results.
Note that we have also begun to include the quarterly and year-to-date impact of accruals related to our LTIP program as an Other item within the reconciliation to general administrative costs.
We view that program as transactional cash costs rather than a measure of regular quarterly spending.
Overall, we believe these results reflect the ongoing benefit from the significant cost reduction activities throughout 2018 and 2019 for our shareholders.
We will continue to look for ways to continue cost reductions where possible.
Our quarterly results also included $2.2 million of other income that was primarily the result of the removal of the estimates of our liabilities under the previous commitments to our former CEO, Mr. Musser who passed away in late 2019.
Other income for the 2019 annual period also included previously disclosed non-cash gain from the credit derivative of $5.1 million and $4.5 million of observable price changes from a variety of our ownership interests.
I should also note that our annual results included interest expense of $14 million related to the credit facility that was repaid in July of 2019.
We do not expect to incur any interest expense during 2020.
We also benefited during 2019 from the recognition of $2 million of interest income from our cash, marketable securities and convertible loans.
This income was primarily the result of short-term securities held during the first half of 2019 and earnings from a money market account.
We expect this income to decline in 2020 due to our lower overall level of investable assets and due to the low interest rate environment.
As a reminder, our priority related to our cash and marketable securities assets is focused on capital preservation and liquidity.
With respect to our ownership interests at December 31, 2019, we have a carrying value of $77.1 million, which is a reduction from 2018 primarily from exits, impairments and the application of equity method accounting.
During the fourth quarter, we limited deployments to $2.2 million to three existing companies, bringing 2019 follow-on funding to $16.7 million.
We expect that we will make additional deployments in 2020 so that we can continue to support our ownership interests, but in the aggregate, we expect those deployments to be between $5 million and $10 million.
Our share of the losses of our equity method ownership interest for the three months ended December 31, 2019, was $4.2 million as compared to $8.9 million for the comparable period in 2018.
The decrease is the result of less companies being accounted for under the equity method due to exits, impairments or changes in the basis of accounting as well as lower losses net from our equity method ownership interests.
Similarly, for the annual 2019 period, we experienced a reduction of $20.6 million related to our losses from our share of the losses of our equity method companies.
We are also pleased that a number of our companies have reduced their operating losses, which contributes to these improvements in our results.
We believe this is an illustration of the health of our overall group of ownership interests.
Aggregate annual revenue for 2019 of Safeguard's 15 remaining ownership interests, which we have previously referred to as partner companies, was $357 million.
Aggregate revenue for the same companies was $330 million for 2018, representing a growth 8% for the group.
We have continued to see slower growth in the digital media category.
Excluding those digital media companies, the aggregate year-over-year revenue of Safeguard's portfolio of partner companies grew at 41%.
Note that the revenue from other ownership interests that you may see in the summary table, including our release, are excluded from this total.
So we remain optimistic about the portfolio, as Brian indicated earlier in the call.
Also with respect to our aggregated revenue disclosures, we will no longer provide estimates of the projected revenue amounts.
We believe that by highlighting our ownership interests that are progressing through each of the revenue stages that we have defined provides investors with better indications of the relative size and growth across our ownership interests.
Also, this allows us to retain an appropriate level of confidentiality with respect to individual companies as the portfolio continues to get smaller.
Now here's Brian to lead us through the Q&A segment of the call.
Operator, let's open the phone for a few questions, please.
","Safeguard Scientifics reported a strong 2019, with a net income of $54.6 million ($2.64 per share) despite a Q4 net loss of $0.7 million ($0.03 per share). The company attributed these results to successful exits, such as Propeller and Transactis, and a reduction in general and administrative expenses. Safeguard continues to monitor its portfolio, which has an aggregate value of approximately $230 million across 15 tech-enabled companies. The portfolio is performing well, with six companies having annual revenue run rates between $5 million and $10 million and another six with run rates over $10 million. The average growth rate of non-digital media companies is 54%. To enhance shareholder value, Safeguard plans to return excess cash via share repurchases or dividends and is exploring various exit opportunities for its portfolio companies. Despite a $25 million cash reserve, Safeguard expects additional deployments between $5 million and $10 million in 2020 to support existing ownership interests. The company remains optimistic about its portfolio and believes its current value significantly exceeds its share price."
SPB_q2_2021.txt,"I'm Kevin Kim, Divisional VP of Investor Relations and moderator for today's call.
This document will remain there following our call.
Our call will be led by David Maura, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeremy Smeltser, Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Lewis, Chief Operating Officer.
Turning to slides three and four.
Actual results may differ materially.
Before I get started, I want to take a moment and speak directly to our employees and our partners around the world.
While our work is far from complete, our financial results reflect another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth and further confirm that we are structuring for growth and efficiency to serve our consumers, customers and stakeholders.
I'm also very proud of the progress we've made these past three years.
Our teams have embraced both our new global operating model and the spirit of our servant leadership culture.
They've also persevered through a global pandemic to deliver excellent and consistent financial performance for our stakeholders.
Because of you, our employees, the new Spectrum Brands has emerged a more efficient, focused, productive and consistent operating company.
We will continue to be driven by our values of trust, accountability and collaboration to serve our mission as we make living better at home.
Our latest financial results for the second quarter reflect another excellent quarter of top line growth and operating leverage.
Our investments in marketing and advertising for our trusted brands were higher in each of our business units, and this continued to drive strong demand this quarter.
Our second quarter revenue grew 22.6% as we achieved double-digit growth across all of our business units.
And our e-commerce sales grew nearly 43%.
Turning to the bottom line.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 28.8% driven by higher volumes and improved efficiencies from our Global Productivity Improvement Program.
Our operating leverage also improved despite higher inflation and incremental investments that we're making in marketing and advertising.
As we outlined during our prior earnings calls, our reinvestments continue to reignite the flywheel of new product launches, improving our top line growth, expanding our margins and driving greater profitability and cash flow generation.
If I could have everyone turn now to slide seven.
As has been well-documented, transportation and commodity-related inflation continue to negatively impact our industry.
Consistent with our highlights last quarter, we expect these headwinds to more heavily impact the second half of the year.
But despite these headwinds, our stellar first half performance and our continued organic growth give us confidence in again raising our earnings framework to reflect mid-teens net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth, adjusted free cash flow of $260 million to $280 million.
We are well positioned going into the third quarter.
And while we recognize tough comparisons as we lap last year's fourth quarter performance, we will continue to focus on disciplined execution of our winning playbook, leveraging our stable manufacturing and distribution footprint and investing behind our strong brands.
We remain laser-focused on capturing gross GPIP savings.
And in fact, our teams are targeting incremental savings for 2022.
Randy will highlight that in more detail later on.
Our new operating model and deliberate investments behind our business units over the last few years have built a stronger and much more resilient company, and we continue to expect long-term growth.
Now moving to slide eight.
Our balance sheet this quarter improved sequentially, ending the quarter with net leverage of 3.2 times and over -- and maintaining over $860 million in total liquidity.
Our actions earlier this quarter to refinance our debt are expected to reduce our annual interest expense by $18 million a year.
As a reminder, we issued $900 million of total debt with a mix of Term Loan B and a new 10-year three 7/8 senior notes, which will lower our cost of capital.
As announced in April, we are very excited to add the recent acquisition of Rejuvenate to our portfolio.
Rejuvenate is a leading developer and marketer of household cleaning products, maintenance and restoration products with an incredible loyal following.
We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter.
And this fits perfectly with our company's strategy to make living better at home, and it adds a fourth category to our Home & Garden business unit.
I'm confident in our ability to create tremendous value together.
Turning to slide nine.
Going forward, our capital allocation priorities continue to focus on: One, allocating capital internally to our highest-return opportunities, and this includes strengthening our brands through consumer insights, research and development, innovation and advertising and marketing to drive vitality and profitable organic growth; two, we plan to return cash to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases; third, disciplined M&A with tuck-in strategic acquisitions that are synergistic and help drive value creation.
We will continue to target a net leverage ratio in the three to 4 times range.
Now you'll hear more from Jeremy on the financials, and Randy will give you an update and additional business insights.
Over to you, Jeremy.
Turning to slide 11 and a review of Q2 results from continuing operations.
I'll begin with net sales.
Net sales increased 22.6%.
Excluding the impact of $18 million of favorable foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $26.8 million, organic net sales increased 18% with double-digit growth across all four business units.
Gross profit increased $75.1 million, and gross margin of 35.1% was in line with the year ago driven by higher volumes in all business units, improved efficiencies from our Global Productivity Improvement Program and favorable mix, offset by higher freight and input cost inflation and last year's retrospective tariff excluding benefits.
SG&A expense of $262.2 million increased 13.1% at 22.8% of net sales, with the dollar increase driven by improved volumes, higher advertising and marketing investments and incentive and distribution costs.
Operating income of $116.8 million was driven by improved volumes, improved productivity and lower restructuring costs partially offset by input cost inflation, marketing and advertising investments and incentive costs.
Net income and diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by the operating income growth and favorability from Energizer investments, offset by higher debt refinance costs.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share improved to $1.76 driven by operating income growth along with lower shares outstanding.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 28.8% from the prior year primarily driven by growth across all business units.
Turning to slide 12.
Q2 interest expense from continuing operations of $65.5 million increased $30 million due to the debt refinancing costs.
Cash taxes during the quarter of $11.9 million were $4.4 million lower than last year.
Depreciation and amortization from continuing operations of $38.7 million was $2.3 million higher than the prior year.
Separately, share- and incentive-based compensation decreased from $14.6 million last year to $8.5 million this year driven by the change to incentive compensation payout methodology we talked about last year.
Cash payments for transactions were $3.1 million, down from $6 million last year.
And restructuring and related payments were $7.6 million versus $12.8 million last year.
Moving to the balance sheet.
The company had a cash balance of $290 million and approximately $577 million available on its $600 million cash flow revolver.
At the end of the quarter, total debt outstanding was approximately $2.6 billion, consisting of approximately $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $400 million of term loans and approximately $159 million of finance leases and other obligations.
Additionally, net leverage improved sequentially and was approximately 3.2 times.
During the quarter, we sold off our remaining Energizer shares for proceeds of $12.6 million.
Capital expenditures were $16.2 million in Q2 versus $13 million last year.
Turning to slide 13 and our updated earnings framework for 2021.
We now expect mid-teens reported net sales growth in 2021, with foreign exchange expected to have a positive impact based on current rates.
Adjusted EBITDA is also expected to grow mid-teens.
This includes benefits from higher volumes; our GPIP program; approximately 11 months of results from the recent Armitage transaction in Global Pet Care, offset by net tariff headwind of about $30 million to $35 million driven by the expiration of previously disclosed retrospective tariff exclusions in 2020.
In addition, as David mentioned, we have also now factored in $120 million to $130 million of input cost inflation compared to a year ago.
Fiscal 2021 adjusted free cash flow for continuing operations is now expected to be between $260 million and $280 million, up from the previous range of $250 million to $270 million.
This includes plans for incremental investments and inventory levels as well as the expected input cost inflation.
Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $180 million and $190 million, including stock-based compensation of approximately $30 million to $35 million.
Full year interest expense is now expected to be between $130 million and $135 million.
This meaningful step-down compared to our prior range of last year is driven by our successful $900 million refinancing in February of our senior notes due 2024 and partial refinancing of our senior notes due 2025.
On a full run rate basis, as David mentioned, we expect annualized savings of approximately $18 million.
Restructuring and transaction-related cash spending is now expected to be between $70 million and $80 million.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $85 million and $95 million.
And cash taxes are expected to be between $35 million and $40 million, and we do not anticipate being a significant U.S. federal cash taxpayer during fiscal 2021 as we continue to use net operating loss carryforwards.
We ended fiscal 2020 with approximately $800 million of usable federal NOLs.
For adjusted EPS, we use a tax rate of 25%, including state taxes.
Regarding our capital allocation strategy, we continue to target a net leverage range of 3 times to 4 times adjusted EBITDA.
As it relates to our 2021 earnings framework, please keep in mind just a few factors.
First, we continue to plan for incremental advertising investments of over $20 million in fiscal 2021 as we continue to raise awareness, consideration and purchase intent with consumers.
Second, recall the Q4 results this fiscal year will have six fewer selling days compared to the prior year.
It's important to recognize this modeling nuance.
Third, we continue to manage through inflationary pressures, which are currently expected to be $120 million to $130 million higher than the prior year.
And fourth, adjusted EBITDA is also expected to be negatively impacted by the absence of Energizer dividend income.
Now to Randy for a more detailed look at our operations.
My comments today will focus on reviewing each business unit to provide detail on the underlying performance drivers of our operating results.
And I will also update you on the current overall cost environment, progress on our GPIP program and results from our commercial operations team in e-commerce and marketing.
Overall, we continue to see significant benefits from our operating model transformation as well as the addition of new talent in many key strategic roles.
Q2 reflected another quarter of exceptional financial results with strong improvements across all four businesses.
With the backdrop of elevated demands, this quarter reflected generally improved supply chain performance and consistent service levels despite continued industry challenges.
These efforts, in addition to our continued commercial investments, helped drive another quarter of double-digit sales and adjusted EBITDA growth.
Now let's dive into the specifics of each business.
Starting with Hardware & Home Improvement on slide 15.
Second quarter reported net sales increased 18.4%, and organic net sales increased 17.4%.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.6% primarily driven by positive volumes and productivity improvements that were materially offset by last year's significant benefit from retrospective tariff exclusions as well as higher freight and input cost inflation, distribution costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher marketing investments.
Excluding last year's tariff exclusions, adjusted EBITDA improved 20.1%.
This represents another quarter of strong double-digit growth within HHI.
While inventory levels are improved and have normalized over the last few quarters, demand continues to outpace supply with continued strong consumer demand for our products.
This bodes well for our third quarter, especially as we are lapping last year's government-mandated shutdowns in three of our manufacturing facilities throughout Mexico and the Philippines.
We expect continued demand increases throughout the balance of 2021 driven by our new product introductions and incremental advertising investments.
Fundamentals across both the repair and remodel segment as well as the new build channels continue to be strong.
In our Kwikset business, we are focused on driving demand for Microban, which incorporates antimicrobial technology on the surface of our hardware; also SmartKey technology, which allows users to rekey their own locks to any Kwikset key in about 15 seconds; and finally, our exciting Halo Touch Smart Lock product, which includes biometric- and WiFi-enabled technology along with voice-assist capability through Alexa and Google Assistant.
As an example, the Kwikset team recently partnered with long-standing customer, Shea Homes, to begin installing Halo Touch locks on every new build as a standard home feature.
This and other similar wins with Halo platform are encouraging as we believe home automation trends will continue to drive sales for our electronics and smart connected locks.
Additionally, our Baldwin brand, which is a leader in luxury security products, launched a new quick-ship program this quarter with a wide array of SKUs shipping within five business days, dramatically improved the customer experience.
Finally, I'm also pleased to announce that Tim Goff accepted the role of President of HHI in March.
Tim is one of our top strategic leaders and most recently served as the Head of our Commercial Operations Group.
He captained the transformational benefits that, that team has had on the new SPB operating model and business results.
Tim knows the HHI business very well, having previously served as the Chief Marketing Officer and holding other supply chain, operational and sales leadership roles over the years.
We look forward to sharing more details over the coming quarters as Tim and the HHI team work to build on our leading market positions in Spectrum Brands' largest business unit.
Now to Home & Personal Care, which is slide 16.
Reported and organic net sales increased 28% and 24.3%, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $25.4 million.
Net sales were driven by continued strength in small kitchen appliances and personal care categories as well as growth across all regions.
e-commerce sales both in pure-play and retailer dotcom channels continued to grow at a high rate.
EBITDA was driven by higher volumes and productivity improvements partially offset by increased freight and input cost inflation and continued marketing investments.
Q2 represented the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year top line growth as momentum for our home appliances and personal care products continued well past the successful holiday season.
We've seen incremental demand in the U.S. for recent stimulus spending, and our fill rates continue to improve.
This bodes well for our plans to continue to grow sharing and shelf space with our key retailers.
However, when modeling this business, please keep in mind the inflationary headwinds within Home & Personal Care.
We expect our pricing and supplier partner initiatives will only partially offset the second half headwind.
As a result of these factors, we currently expect margin pressure in the second half, and we'll continue working to mitigate the inflation throughout the year and into fiscal 2022.
Our focus on 2021 and beyond will remain on consumer-led, insights-driven new products.
We will continue to drive those investments in our brands across more markets than ever before.
Moving to Global Pet Care, which is slide 17.
Q2 represented another strong quarter of financial performance with reported net and organic sales growth of 23.9% and 10%, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 39%.
Top line growth was driven by both our aquatics and companion animal categories with broad-based demand across subcategories and channel partners.
Higher EBITDA was driven by volume growth and productivity improvements partially offset by higher inflation and distribution expenses as well as advertising and marketing investments.
Q2 was also the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year top line growth and eighth consecutive quarter of bottom line growth as our existing legacy brands and recently acquired brands all performed well in their categories.
Our global pet team continues to build its worldwide market leadership position in the core categories of Aquatics, Dog Chews, Pet Grooming and Pet Stain & Odor.
You'll recall that we added Omega Sea as an acquisition last year to advance our premium aquatics offerings, and our addition of the Armitage Pet Care came earlier this year.
This is an excellent platform for international expansion, not only our dog chews business but also cat chews, treats and toys.
As we've said before, our Global Pet Care team remains confident that 2021 and beyond will benefit from the continued execution of our global strategies coupled with the very strong category growth fundamentals.
In particular, we anticipate sustained demand for our high-margin consumables given all of the new pet parents in companion animal and all the new hobbyists who have recently entered the aquatics and reptile categories.
These are long-term commitments and bode well for the future demand of our products.
And finally, Home & Garden, which is slide 18.
Second quarter reported net sales increased 21.4%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 22.7%.
The top line again grew across controls, household insecticides and repellants with strong early season orders across all channels.
EBITDA increase was driven by volume growth, favorable mix, productivity improvements partially offset by advertisement and marketing investments and higher distribution expenses.
We believe both Spectrum Brands and our key retailers are very well positioned as we enter Q3, which is historically our largest quarter for sales and profitability.
Q2 reflected another quarter of improved production capabilities to meet continued high levels of demand, which results in heavier inventory positions at retail compared to prior year.
Spring is just starting in much of the U.S., which kicks off our selling season for controls and repellants.
We are seeing good early quarter POS performance.
The weather, and thus the resulting POS performance in our peak season, remains an unknown variable.
We are very well positioned to maximize our results this year despite ongoing challenges from input and freight markets.
We're also very excited about the anticipated acquisition of Rejuvenate, a leading household cleaning, maintenance and restoration product company.
Rejuvenate has a loyal customer following and has generated impressive top and bottom line growth.
Product categories centered around floor care as well as disinfectants and kitchen and bath.
Last year's net sales were over $60 million with growing sales and margins over the past three years.
We are confident in our ability to capture operational and revenue synergies with a business that has strong EBITDA margins and customer alignment with our existing channels.
The transaction is planned to close during the third quarter, but we look forward to applying our strengths in manufacturing, marketing and sales to further strengthen the Rejuvenate brand, particularly within underpenetrated retailers.
Our continued A&P investments this quarter are consistent with our strategy to invest more resources to tell our story around brands such as Spectracide, Cutter, Hot Shot and EcoLogic, along with incremental research dollars to deliver even more new and innovative products.
We believe these actions will further enhance our mission to be a recognized market leader in providing consumers the best solutions to conquer nature's challenges and enjoy life.
This is possible with our distinctive combination of brands, formulations, registrations, supported by efficient manufacturing and strong customer relationships.
The fundamentals in this business remain very strong.
With solid profitability and high barriers to entry, we're confident that our strong brand equities and increased investments in product development and marketing will accelerate long-term growth rates.
Now let's turn to our internal growth and efficiency efforts with our Global Productivity Improvement Program, which is on slide 19.
As David mentioned, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our key initiatives in this program as Q2 delivered productivity enhancements across all business units.
We remain resolute on using the savings to reinvest back into the business to deliver long-term sustainable organic growth.
This program continues to be our most important strategic initiative as we transform to our new global operating model.
Our F '21 savings are running ahead of previous projections, and we are now raising our total gross savings target of $150 million to at least $200 million by the end of fiscal 2022.
Our confidence in raising this target is driven by strong performance from our teams and expanded scope of our existing program initiatives.
As Dave and Jeremy noted earlier, inflationary headwinds, while second-half-weighted, did begin to impact our business in this quarter.
During our call last quarter, we indicated these headwinds were $70 million to $80 million higher than we had originally planned for the year or in other words, $100 million to $110 million higher than fiscal 2020 levels.
Based on current rates as well as our improved expectations for top line growth for the year, these inflationary headwinds are now expected to be $120 million to $130 million higher in fiscal 2020 levels.
During the quarter, we actively addressed these headwinds with a coordinated and consistent strategy utilizing many of the tools developed through our GPIP program.
We are working in concert with our supplier partners to offset this inflation and have additional mitigation actions in many areas such as ocean freight and supplier management.
The agreed-upon price increases with our retail partners are going into effect now during Q3 and are expected to continue to step up during Q4.
And additionally, we anticipate further pricing discussions being necessary in the back half of the calendar year.
We believe at this point that some of these inflationary pressures are likely temporary in nature and may begin to moderate in fiscal 2022.
As Jeremy alluded to earlier, these headwinds are currently included in our earnings framework for the year, and we will remain vigilant with our operating discipline to maximize the long-term performance of our brands as a result of this.
And finally, our commercial operations team continues to drive impressive results.
This quarter, e-commerce grew by nearly 43% and represented more than 16% of our total net sales.
Additionally, our digital teams continue to leverage data for the early identification of consumer trends to seed new product and sales opportunities and create promotional content that appeals to those consumers.
Now back to David.
Earlier this year at CAGNY, at the investor conference, we shared our Spectrum Brands mission, which is we make living better at home.
And as I shared earlier, we are a more efficient, focused, productive and consistent operating company.
Given that we've covered a lot on the call, let's conclude with a few takeaways on slide 21.
First of all, our second quarter financials reflect another excellent quarter of top line growth.
Investments in marketing and advertising for our trusted brands were higher in each division, which helped drive double-digit top line growth across all of our business units.
Second, our second quarter financials reflect another quarter of operating leverage, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 28.8% from the prior year with growth across all businesses.
Thirdly, our balance sheet improved sequentially, ending the quarter with net leverage of 3.2 times with over $860 million in total liquidity.
Additionally, our successful debt refinancing actions this quarter are expected to drive a material step-down in our interest expense.
I'm extremely grateful for all the sacrifices you have made to navigate our company successfully through these challenging times.
Francis, let's just dive right into Q&A.
","**Spectrum Brands** reports strong financial performance in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 22.6% and an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 28.8%. This growth was driven by higher volumes, improved efficiencies, and continued investments in marketing and advertising. Despite inflationary headwinds that are expected to impact the second half of the year, the company expects mid-teens growth in net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow is now projected to be between $260 million and $280 million. The company continues to focus on operational efficiency and has increased its Global Productivity Improvement Program savings target to $200 million by the end of fiscal 2022. E-commerce sales grew by nearly 43% during the quarter, and the company plans to acquire Rejuvenate, a leading household cleaning product manufacturer, in the third quarter."
SNX_q2_2021.txt,"Before getting into the details of the quarter's performance, I would like to remind everyone that the year-ago quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the significant negative impact that this had on our fiscal Q2 2020 results, the year-over-year comparisons that we discuss today are greater than normal in magnitude.
Our fiscal Q2 results came in well ahead of our expectations, fueled by continued strong demand environment.
Total revenue for Q2 was up 31% year-over-year to $5.9 billion.
Gross profit increased 20% or $55 million compared to the prior year to $329 million.
Gross margin was 5.6%, down from 6.1% in the prior year, primarily due to product mix.
Total adjusted SG&A expense was $159 million or 2.7% of revenue, down $14 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to COVID-related expenses in the prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $170 million, improved by $68 million or 67% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating margin was 2.9%, up 62 basis points year-over-year.
Q2 interest expense and finance charges were approximately $23 million and the effective tax rate was 25%, both in line with our expectation.
Total non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $109 million, up $44 million and improved by 68% over the prior year.
And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.09, up from $1.26 in the prior year.
Now turning to the balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion and debt of $1.6 billion.
Accounts receivable totaled $2.5 billion, down 12% year-over-year and inventories totaled $2.7 billion, flat from the prior year.
Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was 26 days, 17 days improved from last year.
The decrease was driven by DSO improvements and better inventory turns.
Cash generated from operations was approximately $280 million in the quarter.
And including our cash and credit facilities, we had approximately $3.1 billion of available liquidity.
We are pleased to report that our Board of Directors have approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share for the current quarter.
The dividend is expected to be paid on July 30, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 16, 2021.
Before moving to our Q3 outlook, let me provide a brief update regarding our proposed merger with Tech Data.
Since our announcement in March, we have established the capital structure for the planned merger through a new $5 billion credit facility and are on track with the debt financing for the merger.
Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q3.
Revenue is expected to be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5.45 billion.
This estimate does not contemplate any impact related to the customer consignment change that we have previously spoken about.
At this time, we no longer expect the change to occur within our fiscal 2021.
Non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $99.9 million to $110.4 million.
And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10 per diluted share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 51.9 million.
Our Q3 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance exclude the after-tax cost of $7 million or $0.13 per share related to the amortization of intangibles and $5.3 million or $0.10 per share related to share-based compensation.
With our quarter starting off with the Tech Data merger announcement, there was a potential of this news being a distraction to our daily efforts.
As expected though, our team executed very well, provided exceptional service to our customers and continued to expertly manage through the ongoing dynamics of our industry and the pandemic.
For Q2, our results came in above our internal expectations due to continued demand for remote capability, digital transformation, the ongoing recovery of office and data center IT purchasing and overall above-market growth.
Essentially, every product category we participate in saw strength in the quarter, most notably notebooks, Chromebooks, cloud, security, services, networking and collaboration.
Our manufacturing business also performed very well with results above the high end of our internal forecast.
The demand came from across most all our customer segments with SMB and public sector leading the way.
From a geographical perspective, all regions were at expectations or better.
Regarding our proposed merger with Tech Data, everything is going well.
As Marshall mentioned, we are set up for an effective financing of the transaction.
Our proxy has been filed and our shareholder meeting will be held next week.
And from a regulatory standpoint, we have received clearance from a number of governmental authorities and expect the rest to process through normal course.
As would be expected, the COVID pandemic has led to review delays in some countries.
We still believe our transaction will close in the second half of 2021, reflective of the typical six to eight months announced to close time frame for a deal of this size and complexity.
Since the announcement of the transaction, we have continued to receive internal and external support for the merger.
The integration work we have performed since the announcement, albeit limited due to regulatory rules, further supports the strategic benefits of this deal that we discussed in March.
We look forward to sharing more when the transaction closes later this year.
Moving to our outlook.
Our priority remains on the health and safety of our associates.
Overall, we are optimistic about the IT spending environment, given the current strong demand, the expectation of more geographies reopening and the resumption of on-premise enterprise IT projects.
We believe these factors represent potential tailwinds for our business.
Specific to our Q3 guidance.
We are planning for continued growth in our distribution business but have added a bit of conservatism in the forecast this quarter given the widely reported supply chain component challenges.
Considering our current backlog, still very strong, we know the business is there.
It just remains to be seen when it will transact.
For our manufacturing business, we use the low end of our internal range for forecasting purposes.
This low end for manufacturing will reflect the decline over Q3 last year.
This is a result of the very strong prior-year quarter, the over-forecast achievement in Q2 of this year and the overall unpredictable nature of this business.
Taking all these factors into account, we believe our Q3 view reflects a balanced outlook, which incorporates all the various puts and takes of the current environment.
Hopefully a conservative view, and as always, we'll strive to do better.
I am confident with ongoing execution we will continue to progress on our stated strategy of improving our core business, driving organic growth, increasing our value-added services and products and successfully closing our proposed merger with Tech Data.
","Synnex Corporation reported strong Q2 results, exceeding expectations with a 31% year-over-year revenue increase to $5.9 billion. Despite a lower gross margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 68% to $2.09. The company's improved cash flow and available liquidity of $3.1 billion demonstrate financial strength. Regarding the proposed merger with Tech Data, regulatory approvals are progressing, and the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021. For Q3, Synnex forecasts revenue between $4.95 billion and $5.45 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share projected in the range of $1.90 to $2.10. While aware of supply chain challenges, the company remains optimistic about IT spending and expects tailwinds from market demand and enterprise project resumption."
WAT_q1_2021.txt,"I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment, especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic.
We have not yet seen a uniform recovery as there are still many regions around the world that have been ravaged by the pandemic.
As many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment.
Our colleagues and customers that are very much on our minds and we are working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families, and we're doing all we can to support our customers.
During today's call, I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our three phase transformation plan focused on; Number 1, beginning our commercial momentum; Number 2, further strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and Number 3, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.
Next, I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth.
Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter and full-year financial outlook.
Briefly reviewing our operating results, for the first quarter revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year.
This strong start for the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier-than-expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and strong commercial execution by our team.
Looking more closely at our top-line results.
First, from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double-digits during the first quarter.
Our largest market category pharma grew 28% in constant currency, industrial grew 24%, and academic and government grew 29%.
Moving now to our sales performance by geography.
On a constant currency basis; sales in Asia grew 41%, with China up 109%; sales in Americas grew 14%, with US growing 13%; and sales in Europe grew 25%.
From an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26%, while TA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis.
Customer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way driving better-than-expected trends in recurring revenues and a significant growth in instrument revenue.
Recurring revenues grew 15%, with services growing 14% and chemistry consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand.
LC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth.
It's encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units grow double-digits, driven by pent-up demand, integration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative.
The success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated and the ACQUITY PREMIER has been received very well by customers since its February launch.
Mass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the pharma market remains robust.
In addition to rebound, we saw in other markets, including clinical, food and environmental and biomedical research.
Demand was solid for our tandem quads in Europe and China, particularly in pharma and in food.
Revenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma medical devices and semiconductors.
Growth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electrophoresis.
Looking deeper at our sales performance by geography.
All major regions grew double-digits.
China built further on last quarter's strength, more than doubling sales year-over-year, results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions.
Pharma was particularly strong in China, driven by triple-digit growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine.
Our food business in China also saw meaningful growth, driven by a significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that were above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019.
This is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved.
India sales grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country.
Europe experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets, including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and academic and government markets.
In the US, both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter, while demand in our academic and government market remained soft as it lags behind other markets in reopening.
In summary, we had a great start for the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broadly based than last quarter.
With impressive performance across all our regions, end markets and product categories.
Pharma demand has not subsided and many of our non-pharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year.
Now I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the Company, the effectiveness of the markets that we serve, and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term.
Our three-phase transformation plan is; Number 1, beginning our commercial momentum; Number 2, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and Number 3, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.
Looking at our first priority of beginning our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously.
First, our instrument replacement initiative.
We delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%.
In February, we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER system augmenting the already solid placement of Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020, creating new opportunities for instrument replacements.
Additionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging tandem quad mass spec instruments with newer instruments.
Second, as part of our CROs CDMO expansion initiative, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double digits in both these customer segments.
Customers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor.
Third, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results, search engine optimization and paid search had lead to search impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year.
While not every click translates to immediate revenue increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts.
Fourth, driving launch excellence.
Let me start with liquid chromatography.
While the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY PREMIER.
Last year we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER Columns and follow that up with the ACQUITY PREMIER System last quarter.
Though, we are still in the early stages of the revenue ramp up for both the Columns and the System sales of ACQUITY PREMIER Columns are significantly outpacing prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY Columns.
Turning to mass spec.
In 2019, we launched the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos and a next generation version of our TQ-S micro.
Pairing our tandem quad with ACQUITY PREMIER creates industry-leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays.
With expanding applications of the BioAccord, we've maintained our focus on bringing a versatile, easy to use and robust LCMs system to the QA-QC space.
During Q1, we launched a full workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new Waters Connect platform to enable the monitoring of quality attributes at the peptide level.
This adds to already existing simple use applications of peptide mapping impacts of unit mass analysis, released glycan profiling and oligonucleotide mass confirmation.
Over the last year, we established the BioAccord into the workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines.
In fact, BioNTech recognized Waters for our support of its COVID-19 vaccine development and relief efforts.
Lastly, Cyclic was launched in September of 2019 and is targeted at the most advanced high resolution mass spec users.
Augmenting traditional LCMs with high-resolution ion mobility allows us to separate molecules with additional -- with identical molecular weight based on their different shapes.
This is now especially relevant from one of the structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
We do recognize that we still have a bit of work to do on our mass spec informatics applications and we are addressing this through the development and rollout of our Waters Connect software platform across our full mass spec portfolio.
Today, Waters Connect support biopharma characterization and monitoring workflows with a range of capabilities on the BioAccord, Xevo QTof and [Indecipherable].
And with the launch of our RDa Benchtop -- Benchtop Tof in Q1, Waters Connect also enables small molecule workflows.
We're grateful that we've earned the trust and partnership with our customers as we develop further applications and beta test upcoming products and software.
Next from our TA Instrument division.
Last year we launched the X3 DSC, which offers unique advantages for routimg high throughput labs and R&D, especially in pharma, electronics and advanced materials.
The ability of the X3 DSC to deliver high sensitivity measurements of physical properties more quickly than comparable products is enabling these measurements to be more broadly deployed in manufacturing processes, where scientists can evaluate multiple combinations in parallel, reducing time to market.
The more time I spend with my R&D colleagues together with our customers the more impressed I am with the strength of our deeply, deeply technical culture.
Moving on to our second priority.
You've already seen the plan leadership transitions we announced last month.
Amol Chaubal will join as the CFO on May 12th, Amol has deep experience in pharma and diagnostics and has led many transformations in his prior roles through both organic and inorganic growth.
Mike will continue to serve as our Corporate Controller and I'm pleased to add that Mike will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer.
Secondly, we have established a dedicated Innovation Board, which I will share that includes leaders from R&D, Business Development and Marketing.
The Innovation Board will review unmet needs in markets we serve, assess technology proof of concepts and monitor the execution of top R&D programs.
Though their retirements are effective July 2, they've graciously which we offer to service consultants for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition.
Both Jon and Jianqing have deep commercial and transformation experience in global leadership roles in fast growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing.
I'm really pleased with our new team and I look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months.
That brings us to our third priority aligning our portfolio with high growth areas.
While we won't take our eye off commercial execution, which remains our top priority, we have recently started our strategic planning process.
And I'd like to share you -- share with you some high-level thoughts on where we are today.
Our number one priority is to continue strengthening the core meaning LCMs, and materials characterization instruments, informatics, service and consumables.
Second, is staffing into faster growing adjacencies where we can bring our strength of managing compliant data without competing directly with our customers.
These adjacencies include opportunities to increase our exposure to biologics, be it in reagents, other instrument technologies or bioprocessing, all in accelerating LCMs into diagnostics or other high-growth markets.
Lastly, we will maintain our long-standing disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure and capital deployment as we are focused on maintaining a top-tier ROIC.
Over the coming year, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategy, as well as the data points that give us confidence that we have the foundation in place to sustainably grow in this attractive market.
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021.
In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency.
Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported.
Looking at product line growth.
Our revenue -- our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%.
Chemistry revenues were up 18% for the quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand.
On the service side of our business, revenues were up 14% as customers continue to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair visits.
As we noted on our last earnings call, reoccurring sales were impacted by five additional calendar days in the quarter, which primarily impacted service revenues.
Looking ahead, compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter.
However, there are six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year.
Breaking first quarter operating segment sales down further, sales related to Waters Division sales grew 26%, while TA Instrument sales grew 28%.
Combined LC and LCMs instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%.
Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable effects.
Moving down to first quarter P&L.
Operating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis.
The increase was primarily attributed to higher labor incentive compensation costs and higher depreciation from IT investments we made over the last few years.
In the first quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14% an increase from last year, as compared to the comparable period included some favorable discrete items in the prior year.
Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year.
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our first quarter results and activities.
We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and excluding certain special items.
In the first quarter of 2021, free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to $193 million, after funding $40 million of capital expenditures.
Excluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.
In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Our increased free cash flow was primarily a result of sales growth and better operating margins compared to the prior year.
In the quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year.
Inventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes.
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile.
In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter.
These capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million in debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter.
This resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1 times at the end of the first quarter.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders.
We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities and as Udit commented earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process.
As we continue to execute against our priorities, we will evaluate deploying capital to open up attractive and adjacent markets.
As we look forward to the remainder of the year ahead, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2021.
One, while the business environment remains subject to volatility, we are seeing good momentum in our market segments, which will help us exceed the 2019 levels.
Two, we believe this momentum will continue into the second quarter, but that the strong double-digit growth will mostly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half of the year and the six fewer calendar days that we will have in the fourth quarter.
Three, we continue to expect that all major geographies will perform better this year than they did in 2020 led by growth in China.
Four, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to contribute increasingly to our performance.
These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth up 8% to 11%.
At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage points to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%.
Every year we look to balance growth, investment and profitability.
Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% and 29% based on a combination of investments, the normalization of COVID-related cost, and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line, other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows; net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%; the net impact of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62.0 million shares outstanding.
Over the course of the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly update as appropriate.
Rolling all this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the second quarter of 2021.
We expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%.
At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize.
At current rates, the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings-per-share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point.
Like in summary, there is much to be pleased about -- with our first quarter results, driven by strong growth across each of the major end markets with pharma leading the way.
Our transformation plan is well under way with commercial momentum and a strong leadership team in place.
We now turn toward developing a new strategy as we work more closely to align our portfolio with higher growth areas of the market.
","In Q1, the company reported strong financial results, with a 31% increase in sales to $609 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share surged 99% to $2.29. This growth was driven by strength across end markets, particularly pharma. The company's transformation plan is making progress, with initiatives such as instrument replacement and e-commerce driving commercial momentum. Additionally, changes in leadership and the establishment of an Innovation Board will further strengthen the organization. Moving forward, the company expects continued growth in 2021, with full-year constant-currency sales growth projected in the range of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $9.85 to $10.05. However, growth is expected to be stronger in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons and fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter."
UNF_q4_2021.txt,"I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst President and Chief Executive Officer.
Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors.
As we look back over our fiscal year 2021, we are pleased with what we have accomplished as a team in the face of what continues to be a unique and challenging operating environment.
During the year, our Company and the communities that we operate and then serve continue to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Progress was certainly made at the introduction of vaccines has allowed for improvements in the overall public health situation as well as the reopening of many businesses.
As you are all keenly aware however, the challenges related to COVID-19 continue to evolve and are not fully behind us just yet.
I also want to continue to highlight that for over a year now, our team partners have continued to put forth tremendous efforts in the face of the many obstacles created by the pandemic.
They've worked extremely hard to take care of each other and our customers during these extraordinarily challenging times.
For our full year fiscal 2021, the Company reported revenues of $1.826 billion exceeding fiscal 2020's total of $1.804 billion.
When we provided guidance at the beginning of the fiscal year, we had articulated that showing any growth during fiscal 2021 would be a challenge.
Therefore, overall, we were pleased with this outcome.
Our Core Laundry Operations revenue over the second half of the year were positively impacted by a modest level of customer reopenings as well as increases in the sale of PPE.
In addition, our Specialty Garments segment was also a strong contributor to our overall results, producing a record year from a top and bottom line perspective.
From a profit perspective, full year diluted earnings per share was $7.94 compared to $7.13 in fiscal 2020.
The improved earnings comparison for the full year was primarily due to our depressed results in the second half of fiscal 2020 when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was greatest on our business, primarily in the form of customer closures.
Shane will provide the details of our fourth quarter results shortly.
As we've talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructure and our technologies.
All of our investments designed to deliver solid long-term returns to our UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components to our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in the industry.
As we look ahead to fiscal 2022, there are number of key initiatives, we are excited about progressing as we continue to transform the Company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning.
The first being the rollout of our new CRM system which we have spoken quite a bit about previously.
We continue to make solid progress on this key initiative, which we will continue -- which will continue through fiscal 2022 and well into fiscal 2023.
The second is an investment in the UniFirst brand.
Our brand is an area that has not been significantly invested in over the years and we are excited for this revitalization which will not only evolve the look and feel of who UniFirst is, but will solidify our message internally and externally around what we stand for as a company and why we are a great choice for existing and prospective customers and employees.
Finally, during fiscal 2022, we will be embarking on a multi-year project to implement a corporate wide ERP system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology.
This phase initiative will become the core of UniFirst technology footprint and will integrate and complement the capabilities of the CRM system, we are currently deploying.
From an operating standpoint, heading into fiscal 2022, we carry solid momentum from a top line perspective into the year.
Despite the external challenges that the team has hindered, our sales performance has been very solid selling both new business as well as internally to our existing customers.
In addition, our customer retention for fiscal 2021 was much improved compared to recent years.
We also will clearly be looking to work with our customers to sharing the cost increases that we are experiencing in various aspects of the business.
As a result of these top line drivers, we expect organic growth for fiscal 2022 to exceed what we've been experiencing in recent years.
Shane will provide the details of our outlook shortly.
From a bottom line perspective, there are two categories of costs.
We expect to present challenges from a margin perspective in fiscal 2022.
The first group consists of costs that are bouncing back from depressed levels during the pandemic, and costs that are being impacted by the increasingly inflationary environment.
Last quarter, I highlighted some of these items including merchandise amortization, costs related to raw materials and the overall supply chain disruption, the cost to hire and retain labor, energy and travel.
The second group consists of investments we are making in the future of our company.
A subset of these costs relate to building stronger overall capabilities as a company that we feel are necessary to enhance our competitors -- competitiveness, accelerate growth and ultimately improve efficiency and profitability.
These investments are being made in several areas including human resources, supply chain, central services and marketing among others.
In addition, significant costs are expected to be invested in fiscal 2022 and upcoming years related to the three discrete initiatives I discussed earlier.
Going forward we'll be carving out the portion of costs related to these initiatives that we view are transitionary, and excluding them from a measure of adjusted profitability and we will continue to report until these key initiatives are completed.
You can expect we'll be providing regular communication during our quarterly earnings calls regarding cost that we are expanding during these large initiatives, so investors can have a better sense of what our results look like excluding some of these costs.
Even excluding these transitory costs related to these large initiatives, our margins will be pressured in fiscal '22 by investments we continue to make in our overall capabilities.
However, we feel strongly about the need to invest in these areas and believe in the future benefits they will provide.
We also firmly believe, on the other side of these initiatives, there will be opportunities not only to rationalize the direct costs related to these initiatives, but to improve the overall efficiency of our cost structure that currently is working to support multiple systems through this technology transformation.
Our solid balance sheet positions us well to meet our ongoing challenges while continuing to make these investments in growth and strengthen our business.
We also continue to routinely evaluate our strategy around capital allocation.
As part of that review, we announced earlier today, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share of the Company's common stock and $0.24 per share on the Company's Class B common stock.
At this time, we believe that a continued annual increase to our dividend was over time expands, commensurate with our free cash flow generation will be a foundational piece to our capital allocation strategy.
In addition, we have reloaded our share purchase authorization program to allow for the Company to purchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares.
And finally, as always we continue to focus on providing our valuable products and services to existing customers and selling new customers on the value UniFirst can bring to their business.
As we have discussed, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and services.
We believe the need and demand for hygienically clean garments and work environments positions our Company well to support the evolving economic landscape.
Consolidated revenues in our fourth quarter of 2021 were $465.3 million, an increase of 8.5% from $428.6 million a year ago.
Consolidated operating income increased to $44.9 million from $40.8 million or 10.1%.
Net income for the quarter increased to $34.6 million or $1.82 per diluted share from $31.6 million or $1.66 per diluted share.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 22% compared to 26.6% in the prior year.
As a reminder, our tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events including excess tax benefits and efficiencies associated with employee share based payments.
Our Core Laundry operations revenues for the quarter were $415.1 million and increased 7.9% from the fourth quarter of 2020.
Core Laundry organic growth which adjusts for the estimated effective acquisitions as well as fluctuations in the Canadian dollar was 7.2%.
This increase was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly impacting our customer operations and wearer [Phonetic] levels in prior year as well as solid sales performance and improved customer retention in 2021.
Core Laundry operating income was $41.8 million for the quarter, up from $38.1 million in prior year.
And the segment's operating margin increased to 10.1% compared to 9.9% in 2020.
The increase in 2021's operating margin was primarily due to lower merchandise amortization as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by higher energy, healthcare claims cost and travel.
In addition, production payroll cost increased as a percentage of revenues, but were offset by costs we incurred responding to the pandemic in prior year providing a favorable comparison.
Company's G&A costs also trended higher during the quarter as we prepared for and advanced the key initiatives that Steve discussed earlier.
Energy costs increased to 4.2% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from 3.5% a year ago.
Revenues from our Specialty Garments segment which deliver specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services were $33.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 22.5% over 2020.
The segment's strong top line growth was driven by improved performance in both its cleanroom as well as its US and European nuclear operations.
The segment's operating income increased to $4.1 million or 12.1% of revenues from $2 million or 7.1% of revenues in the year-ago period.
This increase was primarily due to the improved revenue performance resulting in strong operating leverage as well as lower casualty claims expense as a percentage of revenues.
These benefits were partially offset by higher merchandise cost as a percentage of revenues.
As we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality as well as the timing and profitability of nuclear reactor outages and projects.
Our First Aid segment's revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased to $16.3 million from $16.4 million primarily due to elevated PPE sales in the prior year, partially offset by growth in the First Aid van business.
In addition, the segment had an operating loss in the quarter of $1 million compared to operating income of $0.7 million in 2020.
The current quarter's operating results reflect continued investment in the Company's initiative to expand its First Aid van business into new geographies.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $512.9 million at the end of fiscal 2021.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $212.3 million, a decrease of $74.4 million from the prior year.
This decrease was primarily due to sizable working capital needs of the business as some of our asset positions which were abnormally depressed during the pandemic have returned to pre-pandemic balances.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 totaled $133.6 million as we continue to invest in our future with new facility additions, expansions, updates and automation systems that will help us meet our long-term strategic objectives.
During the quarter, we capitalized $2.3 million related to our ongoing CRM project which consisted of both third-party consulting costs and capitalized internal labor costs.
As of August 28, 2021, we had capitalized $34.2 million related to the CRM project.
As a reminder, we started deploying this system to our locations earlier in the fiscal year and anticipate, this will continue through fiscal 2022 and well into 2023.
We are depreciating this system over a 10 year life, including the additional hardware we installed to support our new capabilities like mobile handheld devices for our route drivers, we incurred approximately $2 million in depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2021 [Phonetic].
In 2022, we expect that the amortization of the system and depreciation of the related hardware will approximate $5 million in total and eventually ramp to an estimated $6 million to $7 million per year.
Although, our acquisition activity in fiscal 2021 was relatively nominal, we continue to look for and aggressively pursue additional targets as acquisitions remain an integral part of our overall growth strategy.
I'd like to take this opportunity to provide our outlook for fiscal 2022.
At this time, we anticipate our full year revenues for fiscal 2022 will be between $1.92 billion and $1.945 billion.
This top line guidance assumes a Core Laundry organic growth rate of approximately 6.1% at the midpoint of the range.
As Steve mentioned, this strong expected organic growth rate is primarily a result of customer reopenings, solid sales performance and improved customer retention in fiscal 2021 as well as anticipated efforts to share with our customers, the cost increases that we are seeing in our business.
For fiscal 2022, we further expect that our fully diluted earnings per share will be between $5.70 and $6.10.
This guidance includes $38 million of costs that we expect to incur in the fiscal year directly attributable to the three key initiatives that Steve discussed, our CRM and ERP system initiatives and our branding efforts.
Excluding these transitionary investment costs, our Core Laundry operations adjusted operating margin assumption at the midpoint of the range is 9.5%.
This adjusted operating margin reflects certain costs that are normalizing from depressed levels during the pandemic like merchandise amortization and travel costs, costs we are incurring to hire and retain labor in this challenging employment environment, elevated input costs related to the current inflationary environment and global supply chain challenges as well as additional investments we are making in strengthening our overall capabilities.
Based on the current energy prices, we are modeling the energy costs in our Core Laundry operations will increase to 4.6% of revenues in fiscal 2022, up from the previously discussed 4.2% in 2021.
Next year's effective tax rate is assumed to be 24% compared to 22% in fiscal 2021.
Our Specialty Garments' segment revenues are forecast to be relatively flat compared to 2021.
However, the segment's operating income is expected to be down approximately 11%.
As a reminder, fiscal 2021 was a record year for this segment from both a top and bottom line perspective and the anticipated decline in operating margin is due to the timing and relative profitability of its planned outages and project work.
Our First Aid segment's revenues are expected to be up approximately 10% compared to 2021.
However, this segment's profitability will be relatively marginal in 2022 as a result of the investments, we continue to make in building out the geographic footprint of our van operation.
We expect that our capital expenditures in 2022 will approximate $125 million.
Our guidance for fiscal '22 also assumes our current level of outstanding common shares.
No impact related to potential tax reform and no deterioration in the current economic environment.
In addition, as I'm sure that you are aware, last month President Biden issued broad sweeping vaccine and or testing requirements for all companies with more than 100 employees.
These rules have not yet been finalized nor has an effective date been communicated.
As such, we have not included any costs in our forecast that we do expect would be incurred to comply with these requirements.
","Despite pandemic challenges, UniFirst reported revenue of $1.826 billion for fiscal 2021, exceeding its previous year's total. Contributing to this growth were modest customer reopenings and increased PPE sales. The Specialty Garments segment also performed strongly, achieving record results in both revenue and profitability. Earnings per share improved to $7.94, driven by lower pandemic-related impacts in the second half of the year. However, the company anticipates margin pressure in fiscal 2022 due to rising costs and investments in technology and infrastructure. Organic growth is projected to exceed recent trends, while diluted earnings per share are estimated to range between $5.70 and $6.10, excluding transitionary costs related to major initiatives. To mitigate margin pressures, UniFirst is implementing cost-sharing measures with customers. Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic due to the essential nature of its services and ongoing capital allocation initiatives, including a 20% dividend increase and a new $100 million share repurchase authorization."
PEG_q4_2020.txt,"pseg.com, and our 10-K will be filed shortly.
We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which differ from net income as reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States.
At the conclusion of their remarks, there will be time for your question.
PSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.65 per share.
Non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year rose by 4.6% to $3.43 per share, and mark the 16th year in a row that PSE&G delivered results within our original earnings guidance.
PSE&G GAAP results were $0.85 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $0.86 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition for the full year PSE&G reported 2020 net income of $3.76 per share compared with $3.33 per share in 2019.
Details on the results for the quarter and the full year can be found on slides 12 and 14.
I am pleased to report that the PSE&G's fourth quarter and full year results reflected solid contributions from both PSE&G and PSEG Power.
And I'm particularly proud of the achievements of our employees during this past year as it was one of the most challenging in recent memory.
Their efforts have kept our customers connected to essential energy services to power their homes, businesses, and vitally important institutions.
We have also made steady progress in several key business priorities, the most important of which is our transition to becoming primarily a regulated utility, with contract and generation comprise about zero carbon nuclear fleet and future investments in regional offshore wind.
In the past six months, we've announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's 7,200 plus megawatts of non Nuclear Generating assets, and received initial indications of interest for both the fossil and solar source assets.
PSE&G successfully initiated its landmark clean energy future program, securing approval to spend nearly $2 billion in energy efficiency, smart meter installations and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all of which will enhance New Jersey's environmental profile for years to come.
In addition, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, I'll refer to them as the BPU recently concluded public hearings regarding PSE&G nuclear application to extend the zero-emission certificate.
I think I'll shorten that to ZEC from now on through May 2025.
Our service area experience milder than the normal weather during the fourth quarter, book ending the week heating season of the first quarter in 2020.
Regarding whether normalized sales for the year, while total electric sales volume declined by 2%.
Gas sales rose by 1%.
In both the electric and gas businesses higher residential usage of approximately 5% largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales resulting in stable margins overall.
Working with COVID-19 health and safety protocols since last March, PSE&G was able to execute on its plan $2.7 billion capital spending program in 2020.
These capital programs provide a critical investment to support the New Jersey economy, particularly in the early months of the pandemic, and preserve essential jobs while replacing vitally important energy infrastructure, and generating customer benefits of improved reliability and resiliency, as well as methane reduction.
In January of 2021, the BPU approved two settlements with PSE&G and other parties in the clean energy future energy, cloud and electric vehicle proceedings.
The energy cloud investment program is estimated to be approximately $707 million over the next four years, and will result in the replacement of over 2 million electric meters with smart meters.
The electric vehicle program will direct $166 million into EV charging infrastructure over the next six years.
With these recent settlements, the BPU has constructively addressed the vast majority of the clean energy future filings and has approved nearly $2 billion of investment to help realize New Jersey's energy goals.
The Energy Efficiency Program will also be established clean energy job training for over 3,200 direct jobs, while enabling the avoidance of 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions through the year 2015.
Investing in energy efficiency programs is the most cost-effective solution to reducing carbon emissions.
Importantly, the conservation incentive of the settlement encourages the broad adoption of energy efficiency, with certain programs focusing on low- and moderate-income customers that will lower bills for participating customers.
We expect the balance of the clean energy future filing, which includes our request to spend under $200 million on energy storage, and a few remaining EV programs will be addressed following future stakeholder proceeding.
PSE&G continues to engage with the BPU staff and re counsel to advance confidential discussions toward a settlement of the return on equity related to PSE&G formula rate for transmission overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The annual update under PSE&G existing formula rate filed last October was implemented this past January and together with cost reallocations of our revenue requirements for certain transmission projects, candidly to customers outside of our zone.
This resulted in a net reduction in PSE&G customer costs.
For 2020, PSE&G, once again achieved top quartile OSHA scores.
We also achieve the top quarter of JD Power ranking in the eastern large company category for both residential electric and gas companies.
And PSE&G posted its best ever JD Power scores for electric and gas customer satisfaction outpacing the average industry results on metrics that consider total monthly cost, bill clarity, fairness of pricing and options and ability to manage monthly usage among residential customers.
Also for the 19th year in a row PA consulting recognized PSE&G with its reliability one award as the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic region and for the first time with our 2020 outstanding customer engagement award.
New Jersey has recently made solid progress in lowering its COVID-19 positivity rates, and continues to face the reopening of businesses, schools and other activities.
We have a long history of partnering with the state to support the economy.
And we continue to work with them on investment programs that can spur economic development and employment recovery, all while being quite thoughtful about managing customer rate impacts.
Regarding collection activities, the moratorium on shut offs residential electric and gas services currently scheduled to conclude in March, recognizing the economic hardship that many of our customers continue to face PSE&G in partnership with the BPU and community groups is working hard to enroll customers and customer payments support programs, such as light heap and deferred payment rate.
When the moratorium is lifted, we will work closely with the BPU other stakeholders and our customers to ensure a collections process that supports our customer's individual situations.
Turning now PSEG Power, we're continuing all activities related to the exploration of strategic alternatives we announced last July.
In the fourth quarter of last year, we launched the formal sales processes of the 1,467 megawatt solar source, and over 6,750 megawatt thoughtful portfolios.
We are currently evaluating indications of interest, and believe we are on track to announce an outcome in the second half of 2021.
As we launched the strategic alternatives initiative last year, and throughout the process thus far, PSEG Power has continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA.
Last year PSEG fossil posted one of its best operational performance records ever, and completed its entire maintenance outage schedule without any OSHA safety violations.
In addition, PSE&G nuclear completed to complex refueling outages in 2020, with new COVID-19 safety protocols, and continue its overall outstanding operating performance.
These achievements speak volumes about the professionalism of our dedicated workforce that exemplifies our focus on safety and operational excellence.
PSE&G nuclear Zero Mission certificate application and the extension of the current ZEC is currently under consideration at the BPU.
Last month, the BPU staff consultant released their preliminary findings.
The consultants found that all three of our New Jersey units were eligible, recognizing that each unit had a financial need for next.
There were other aspects of the preliminary findings that we view as inconsistent with the ZEC law.
And we look forward to upcoming hearings where we will have the opportunity to address those items.
It is clear that New Jersey recognizes the need for nuclear power in order to achieve its short and long-term clean energy goals, as laid out in states on an energy master plan and DEP'S 80 by 60 report.
The recent weather-related power and market values in Texas and California further underscore the importance of maintaining New Jersey's reliable resource mix.
Over the next few weeks, you will hear as mentioned that our confidential filings show that these units are actually in need of more than $10 per megawatt hour, partly due to the fact that PGM forward market prices are lower versus 2018, which was the year that first ZEC application.
As stated in the 2018 ZEC law, nuclear operating risk and market risk must be recognized as a cost in any economic determination and ZEC eligibility.
We have responded to all information requests and share confidential financial information with rate council and PJM independent market monitor.
In order to support transparency around this important proceeding.
And the actions and expansion of the current ZEC, we would not continue to operate the plant.
While the direction of public policy both in New Jersey, Jersey and in the nation is the increased recognition of carbon free energy to mitigate climate change.
That realization in the form of a future price on carbon is highly uncertain at best.
With the final decision on the ZEC application expected on April 27, we are hopeful that the BPU will act to extend the $10 per megawatt hour attribute payment to preserve nuclear units and their 3,400 megawatts of zero carbon base load generation through May of 2025.
The BPU is also moving forward with its investigation of resource adequacy, and the potential for the creation of fixed resource requirements service area within New Jersey, I'm just going to call that FRR in future.
We've maintained a neutral stance on the potential of an alternative capacity procurement paradigm, but remain supportive of accommodations that enable state supported resources to qualify as capacity that can satisfy both the state's capacity obligations, and its clean energy goals.
As we've previously stated, the current minimum offer floor prices are not expected to prevent either our nuclear or gas part of units from clearing in the upcoming PJM capacity auction scheduled for this May.
Now let me turn my attention to 2021 guidance.
We are introducing non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.55 per share with the utility expected to contribute between one $1,410 million and $1,470 million.
PSEG Power between $280 million and $370 million and parent others expected to post a loss of $15 million.
This year we expect PSE&G to contribute just over 80% of consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings at the midpoint of guidance.
Going forward, we expect that the utility earnings will represent 80% to 90% of PSE&G non-GAAP results, with the remaining balance expected to be comprised of long-term agreements for zero carbon offshore wind generation, and as ZEC supported New Jersey nuclear units.
For PSEG Power, over 70% of its 2021 gross margin has been secured by the way of energy hedges, capacity revenues established prior auctions, zero emission certificates, and ancillary service payments.
However, for 2021, recontracting at lower market prices, higher costs tied to a hope Creek refueling outage, and the absence of tax benefits realized in 2020 results in the lower non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for 2021.
Our PSE&G five-year capital spending forecast has been updated to $14 billion to $16 billion for 2021 through 2025 and includes approximately $2 billion of clean energy future investments, as well as the expected extension of the gas system modernization program and Energy Efficiency Program at their average annual run rates for the last two years of the period that being 2024 and 2025.
Consistent with test years approximately 90% or $13 billion to $15 billion this capital program will be directed to grow regulated operations at PSE&G.
This ongoing investment in essential energy infrastructure and clean energy programs is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth and rate base over the five-year period starting from $22 billion at year-end 2020.
On slide 10, we've provided you with an alternate view of our updated capital program for 2021 through 2025.
We've classified it by investments in decarbonization, energy transition, climate adaptation for resilience and reliability and methane reduction.
As a sidebar, any spend for offshore wind will be incremental to these totals and is not included in the $14 billion to $16 billion capital plan.
We also expect that our strong cash flow will enable us to fund our entire five-year capital spending program, as well as our planned offshore wind investments during the 2021 and 2025 period, without the need to issue new equity.
As we continue to plan for the responsible reentry to our offices and facilities currently targeted for this July.
Whether responding to a myriad of COVID-19 challenges, or their excellent injury free response to the nor'easter that we just experienced this past month, employees across our organization has embodied operational excellence, as they provide our New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Mid-Atlantic customers with reliable essential energy services.
Before moving to Dan's financial review, I will summarize the new initiatives in place of future growth and areas of our continued strategic focus.
These range from the new clean energy future investments behind the meter to infrastructure opportunities supporting electrification of transportation, and a growing mix of renewables in the distribution system to expanding the existing aging infrastructure replacement programs to assist the New Jersey economic recovery.
In addition, we are advancing the strategic alternatives of exploration through a robust bidding process, pursuing near term opportunities to expand offshore wind investments in the Mid-Atlantic and are engaged in ongoing efforts to preserve the New Jersey nuclear fleet, the most cost effective and most reliable source of base load supply to reduce emissions.
Each of these actions serves to further PSE&G's already strong ESG leadership position, which we continuously strive to improve.
In 2020, we move to decarbonize our generating fleet, announced an investment in New Jersey offshore wind, and initiated a landmark energy efficiency investment to bring universal access to a broad range of clean energy opportunities.
In 2021, we joined the company network of the series organization at CERS to advance our climate advocacy.
We will achieve a coal free generating fleet in June.
And we recently published our first ESG Performance Report.
PSEG is getting recognized for our ESG initiatives by Standard and Poor's was included us in their 2021 sustainability yearbook.
And by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index was named PSE&G to the North American index for 13 years in a row.
We're also gratified to be named to the 2021 listing of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek magazine, and the Forbes list of best employees for diversity in 2020.
And best employers and veterans in 2020.
The Board of Directors recent decision to increase the company's common dividend to the indicative annual level of $2.04 per share is the 17th increase in the last 18 years, and reflects our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders to enhance our total return profile as we also pursue growth.
There is no lack of opportunity for PSE&G.
As we continue the transformation to a primarily regulated electric and gas utility, focused on clean energy infrastructure, complemented with contracted zero carbon generation, we are working toward a sustainable future where customers universally use less energy, the energy they use is cleaner, and its delivery is more reliable and more resilient.
We are confident that pursuing this strategy will enhance our ability to provide our customers with essential energy services, which has been our core mission for the last 118 years.
As Ralph said, PSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.65 per share.
And we provided you with information on slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution of non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the fourth quarter, and for the full year of 2020.
Slide 13 and 15 contained waterfall charts that take you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating earnings by major business.
I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.
PSE&G's net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by $0.04 to $0.58 per share, compared with net income of $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 as shown on slide 17.
For the full year PSE&G's net income increased by $0.16 per share, or 6.5% compared to 2019 results.
This improvement reflects an 8% increase in rate base at year end 2020 to just over $22 billion, which as we note on slide 22 does not include approximately $1.8 billion of construction work in progress or see what that's mostly a transmission.
The continued growth in utility earnings resulting from investments in transmission added $0.2 per share versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
Gas margin was $0.02 favorable, reflecting GS&NT roll in and higher weather normalized volume.
Electric margin was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
As higher were the normalized volumes will offset by lower demand?
Mild temperatures during the quarter had a negative $0.03 per share impact, mostly reflecting recovery limitations under the earnings test of the gas weather normalization clause.
O&M expense was flat versus the fourth quarter 2019.
Higher distribution depreciation expense of a $0.01 per share offset lower pension expense of a $0.01 per share in the quarter.
Taxes and other were $0.03 per share favorable, partly reversing the negative $0.07 per share impact that the timing of taxes had on third quarter of 2020.
Recall in the third quarter flow through taxes and other items lower net income by $0.07 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019.
And we indicated at that time that about half of the $0.07 would reverse in the fourth quarter.
The balance is related to bad debts which we anticipate reversing in the future based upon the timing of actual write-offs.
Early winter weather in the fourth quarter as measured by the heating degree days was 9% milder than normal and 14% milder than in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The full year PSE&G weather-normalized residential electric sales increased by 5.6% due to the COVID-19 work from home impact, but a larger decline in commercial sales resulted in total electric sales declining by 2%.
Total weather-normalized gas sales were up 1.2% for 2020 by a 4.9% increase in residential use partially offset by a smaller decline in the commercial and industrial segment.
For both electric and gas sales, higher residential uses largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales, resulting in stable margins overall.
PSE&G invested $700 million in the fourth quarter as part of its 2020 Capital Investment Program of approximately $2.7 billion directed to infrastructure upgrades of transmission and distribution facilities to maintain reliability, increase resiliency, make lifecycle replacements and clean energy investments.
PSE&G updated five-year capital spending plan includes investing $2.7 billion in 2021.
And as detailed on slide 21, approximately $960 million is allocated to transmission; $700 million to electric distribution, which includes approximately $200 million for Energy Strong Two, $875 million to gas distribution, which includes over $400 million for GSMP2 and $200 million for new clean energy future EV programs and the beginning of the AMI rollout.
The clean energy future EV investment will ramp up to approximately $125 million in 2021 before reaching a full annual run rate of about $350 million in 2023.
As Ralph mentioned the BPU approved two CF settlements in January, totaling approximately $875 million covering energy cloud and electric vehicle investments.
The capital and operating costs of these programs will begin to be recovered in PSE&G next rate proceeding, expected to be filed in the second half of 2023.
From the start of the programs until the commencement of new base rates estimated in late 2024, the return on other non-capital will be included for recovery in these rates as well as operating costs and stranded costs associated with retirement of the existing leaders.
Of these amounts, the vast majority about 90% received contemporaneous or near contemporaneous regulatory treatment either through the first formula rate, or clause recovery mechanisms or recovered and rates as replacement spend or new business.
As Ralph also mentioned, we continue settlement discussions with the BPU staff and recounsel regarding our FERC transmission return on equity.
Although our forecast for 2021 as soon as the resolution effective in the near term, those discussions remain confidential and ongoing.
PSE&G net income for 2021 is forecasted at $1,410 million to $1,470 million which reflects an assumed reduction of our transmission formula rate, as well as incremental investment in EV infrastructure and energy efficiency.
So moving to power, PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter unchanged from the non-GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Results for the quarter brought Power's full year non-GAAP operating earnings to $430 million or $0.84 per share.
Compared with 2019 non-GAAP results of $09 million or $0.81per share.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA total to $182 million for the quarter and $990 million for the full year of 2020.
And this compares to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $198 million, and $1,035 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 respectively.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure, as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense.
We've also provided you with added detail on generation for the fourth quarter and full year on slide 26.
PSEG Power's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were aided by the scheduled increase in PSEG Power's average capacity prices in PJM, covering the second half of 2020 and higher gas operations, which resulted in improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons of $0.04 and $0.01 per share respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
However, lower generation output and recontracting at lower market prices reduced non-GAAP operating earnings by a total of $0.08 per share versus the year ago quarter.
The decline in O&M expenses in the quarter improve results by a $0.01 per share and reflects the absence of the Hope Creek refueling outage that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The extension of the Peach Bottom Nuclear operating licenses contributed to lower depreciation expense of a $0.01 per share and lower taxes improve non-GAAP operating earnings by a $0.01 over the year ago quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was $32 a megawatt hour, a $1 per megawatt hour improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019, mainly reflecting the scheduled increase in capacity prices that began June 1, 2020 and remain in place through May of 2021.
For the full year 2020 gross margin was flat at $32 per megawatt hour compared to full year 2019.
Mild fall temperatures and holiday related spikes and COVID-19 positivity rates dampen market demand in New Jersey and kept our prices and natural gas prices lower than the quarter and year ago comparisons.
So let's turn to Power's operations.
Total output from Power's generating facilities declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Unplanned outages at fossil and an extended outage at the sale of one nuclear unit reduced fourth quarter generation levels compared to the fourth quarter in 2019.
However, full year 2020 output of 53 terawatt hours came in above our 50 to 52 terawatt hour forecast.
The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 78.9% in the quarter, and 90.3% for the full year, producing nearly 31 terawatt hours of zero carbon base load power.
The combined cycle fleet operated an average capacity factor of 46.2% in the quarter, and 48.3% for the full year, generating approximately 22 terawatt hours in 2020.
The three new combined cycle generating units, Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor five posted an average capacity factor of over 75% for the full year 2020.
And this coming June PSEG Power will complete the planned early retirement of the 383 megawatt coal fired Bridgeport Harbor three generating station, eliminating the last coal unit in power's fleet.
For 2021, Power has hedged approximately 90% to 95% of its expected output of 48 to 50 terawatt hours, at an average price of $32 per megawatt hour, which represents an approximately $2 per megawatt hour decline from 2012.
In addition 2021 average hedge prices no longer include cost-based transmission charges for New Jersey's basic generation service contracts due to a change in how they are billed and collected.
This change further reduces revenues by approximately $3 per megawatt hour starting on February 1 of 2021.
And is often on the cost side so there's no P&L impact as a result.
We're forecasting 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA PSEG Power to be $280 million to $370 million and $850 million to $950 million, respectively.
Power segment guidance reflects a full year of fossil and solar operations, lower expected generation volume and lower market prices, as well as the absence of a one-time tax benefit realized in 2020.
Now, let me briefly address operating results from enterprise and other which reported a net loss that increased by $0.03 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
And reflects lower tax benefits compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and lower results from KCG Long Island.
Regarding PSEG Long Island, following several challenges related to our response to tropical storm Isaias.
We've made significant improvements in our outage management to lessening business continuity and other systems and processes.
The Long Island Power Authority filed a complaint against PSE&G Long Island in New York State court last December, alleging multiple breaches of the operating services agreement or OSA in connection with PSE&G Long Island's preparation and response to tropical storm Isaias.
We are in discussions with LIPA to address their concerns, which could include potential amendments to our OSA with LIPA and to resolve all claims.
As a reminder, our 12-year contract is scheduled to run through 2025.
We are committed to addressing the identified performance issues and to continue our strong track record of performance for Long Island customers since taking over operations.
For 2021, PSEG Enterprise and other are forecasted to have a net loss of $15 million as parent financing and other costs exceed earnings from PSEG volume.
PSEG ended 2020 with approximately $3.8 billion of available liquidity, including cash on hand of $543 million, and debt representing 52% of our consolidated capital.
In December PSEG issued $96 million of 8.63% senior notes due April 2031, in exchange for like amount of 8.63% senior notes due April 2031, originally issued at Power, which were cancelled following the completion of the exchange.
PSEG also retired a $700 million term loan at maturity.
Power's debt as a percentage of capital declined to 27% on December 31 from 28%, at September 30.
To summarize non-GAAP results for the quarter was $0.65 per share; full year non-GAAP operating earnings were $3.43 per share.
And as we move into 2021, our guidance for the year is $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with regulated operations expected to contribute over 80% of consolidated results, arranged for 2021 reflects incremental investment in our T&D infrastructure, and a ramp up of a new clean energy future programs, as well as an assumed reduction return on equity of our transmission formula rate during the year at PSE&G.
And a full year of fossil and solar operations at PSEG family.
PSE&G also raised its common dividend by $0.08 per share for the indicative annual level of $2.04, a 4% increase over 2020.
The 2021 indicative rate continues to represent a conservative 59% payout of consolidated earnings at the midpoint of 2021 guidance and utility earnings alone are expected to cover 140% of the dividend at the midpoint of 2021 guidance.
We still expect our strong cash flow will enable us to fully fund PSE&G's five year $14 million to $16 billion capital investment program, as well as our plan to offer when investment during the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity.
That concludes my comments.
And Shelby we're now ready to take questions.
","PSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, marking a 4.6% increase year-over-year. This increase was primarily attributed to higher transmission revenues, a strong performance by PSEG Power, and stable margins in both electric and gas businesses. Total electric sales declined by 2% while gas sales rose by 1%, with residential usage offsetting declines in commercial and industrial sales. Despite milder weather, solid contributions from PSE&G and PSEG Power drove the company's overall performance. PSE&G invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, while PSEG Power continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA. PSE&G Nuclear's application for the extension of zero-emission certificates was under consideration by the BPU, with the final decision expected on April 27th. The company expects an influx of investments in decarbonization, energy transition, and methane reduction projects in the coming years. For 2021, PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance is $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with regulated operations expected to contribute over 80% of consolidated results."
BRO_q4_2020.txt,"I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year.
We came into 2020 with great momentum and this continued into the first quarter, delivering 5.6% organic growth, then COVID-19 hit the US economy and things changed dramatically.
While there was significant uncertainty, we knew we had a great team and resilient responses and innovative with a focus on providing solutions to our customers.
In addition, we were able to move -- we were able to quickly transition over 10,000 teammates to a no working environment in less than a week.
So they could pivot and effectively serve our customers.
As you may remember, we didn't grow as quickly in the second quarter due to the impact of the pandemic on our new business and the recording of revenue adjustments for general liability policies, but we still expanded our margins.
And in the third quarter, we delivered outstanding results with strong organic growth and margin expansion.
The results of the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter as we finished the year strong and with good momentum going into '21.
Based on what we were seeing, if you ask me, if it was likely that we would deliver full-year results with good organic growth and meaningful margin expansion, I would have said it was possible but unlikely that if you would ask me that in, let's say, April.
We are very pleased with our results for 2020.
We were able to deliver these results through the hard work of our teammates and their dedication to our customers.
2020 was a testament to our laser focus on delivering innovative risk solutions.
We also thought the M&A landscape would cool off for several quarters until there was some sort of economic stability.
The slowdown only occurred for about one quarter and the industrywide activity is now rebounded a pre-COVID-19 levels.
Even with the uncertainty this year, we're very pleased that completed 25 acquisitions and $197 million of acquired annual revenue.
I'd like to highlight two strategic acquisitions, CoverHound that we completed in the fourth quarter, and O'Leary Insurances that we announced in the fourth quarter and closed on the 14th of January.
Regarding CoverHound, this acquisition will help us in many ways.
First, it will help us further our investment in technology, drive our innovation agenda and improve our carrier connectivity.
Second, it enables us to more effectively and efficiently provide quotes and bond coverage for our National Programs segment.
Third, it enables us to better serve smaller customers within our retail segment.
Ultimately, these items are focused on enhancing the customer buying experience by delivering curated quotes that best meet the needs of our customers.
We believe these new capabilities are unique in the marketplace.
We started 2020 with the acquisition Special Risk in British Columbia and finished the year with our acquisition of O'Leary Insurances in Ireland.
O'Leary was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace.
This acquisition strengthens our European operations, which we look forward to further developing in the years ahead.
Our new teammates and capability to deliver many opportunities over the coming years.
We're extremely proud of our results in 2020 in the delivery of total shareholder returns in excess of 20%.
And Steve Boyd will become our President of Wholesale.
Steve's background in National Programs as an operator and in technology brings critical skills to the leadership team in Wholesale as we continue to grow this important business through innovative solutions.
I'm excited that Tony and Steve will be working together to further drive this growth in the future.
Now, let's transition to the results of the quarter and the full-year.
I'm on Slide number 3.
We delivered strong results again this quarter, total revenue of $642 million, growing 10.9% in total and 4.7% organically.
Again into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.
Our EBITDAC margin was 27.1%, which is up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019.
Please remember that the fourth quarter of '19 included a gain on sale of business that benefited the prior year margin by approximately 100 basis points.
Our net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34, increasing 25% on an as-reported basis.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3% over the prior year.
Our team did an outstanding job of continuing to profitably grow our revenue, as well as manage our expenses in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19.
During the quarter, we completed another nine acquisitions with annual revenues of approximately $80 million.
For the year, we grew total revenues of 9.2% and delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%.
This is an outstanding performance given the economic headwinds experienced for most of the year.
We improved our EBITDAC margin for -- by 110 basis points to 31.1%, compared to 2019 as we leverage the growth in organic revenue and managed our expenses in response to the pandemic.
Our net income per share for the full-year of '20 increased 20.7% to $1.69 from $1.40 in 2019.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-outs, net income per share increased 19.3%.
Lastly, we had another strong year of M&A activity, as I said earlier, closing 25 acquisitions with approximately $197 million of annual revenue, adding many excellent businesses and teammates.
Now, on Slide 5.
In prior calls, we talked about factors that would impact the economic recovery, which included the elections, the approval of the vaccine and the timing of the rollout, as well as how much additional stimulus will be approved.
The timing of the vaccine rollout and the approval of additional stimulus will have the largest impact upon the recovery of the economy will influence business leaders confidence about rehiring and investing in their businesses.
During the fourth quarter, we continue to see companies doing well and other struggling mightily.
We've seen improving new business and our retention remains good.
However, we continue to believe it will be choppy -- a choppy recovery through at least the end of 2021 and maybe into early 2022.
From a rate standpoint, the fourth quarter was very similar to the third quarter, most standard rates were up 3% to 7% with E&S rates up 10% to 25% as compared to the prior year.
As we've talked about before, the main driver of rate increases continues to be loss experience.
Commercial auto rates remain up 10% or more and workers' compensation rates are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters, but they are still negative.
There has been a lot of talk over the past few quarters that workers' compensation rates are turning positive.
However, we're still not seeing it across the board yet.
For an E&S perspective, coastal property, both wind and quake are up 15% to 25%.
Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry.
We continue to see outliers to be wanted to coverage.
Personal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast states remain under intense pressure as carriers are seeking to reduce their exposure due to fires and tropical activity during 2020.
We expect the reduction in personal lines capacity continue throughout '21.
Placing coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with significant losses continues to be challenging.
This includes excess or umbrella coverage, where a carrier or carriers will seek a combination of lower limit and higher premium rates.
We don't expect this trend to materially change in '21.
Now, on Slide number 6.
Let's discuss the performance of our four segments.
Our Retail segment, organic revenue growth grew by 1.5% for the fourth quarter.
As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we had about a 100 basis points of timing items that benefited the growth in the third quarter and negatively impacted the growth in the fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter performance was driven by new business, better customer retention and premium rate increases, but was impacted by lower exposure units resulting from the pandemic.
We view the performance for the fourth quarter as good, considering we delivered 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year and taking into consideration the timing headwind mentioned earlier.
Organic revenue growth for the full-year was 2.4%, which we consider a good performance in light of the tough economic environment.
Our National Programs segment grew 14.1% organically, delivering another stellar quarter.
Our growth was driven by strong new business, retention and rate increases.
Some of the top performing programs were our lender place, commercial and residential earthquake, wind and personal property, just to name a few.
For the full-year, our National Programs segment grew organically, an impressive 12.3%.
Our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.8% organically for the quarter.
We realized strong new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage.
Brokerage was the fastest-growing again this quarter, while we continue to experience headwinds in our binding authority and personal lines businesses due to the economy and carrier appetite we mentioned previously.
For the full-year, our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.5% organically, delivering another good year.
The organic revenue for our Services segment decreased 50 basis points for the fourth quarter, representing good improvement from the last few quarters.
The main drivers depressing growth continue to be lower claims volume for our Social Security and Medicare Set-aside advocacy businesses.
The decline was substantially offset by revenue generated by processing claims for weather-related events that occurred in the third and fourth quarters.
For the full-year, organic revenue decreased by 10.9%, driven by lower claims for our Social Security Advocacy business, certain terminated customer contracts and the impact of the pandemic.
While not back in positive territory, we believe the fourth quarter was a turning point, and we anticipate delivering modest organic growth for 2021.
I'm moving on to Slide number 7.
Like previous quarters, I'm going to discuss our GAAP results, certain non-GAAP financial highlights, as well as our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables.
For the fourth quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of 61 -- $63.1 million, or 10.9% and organic revenue growth of 4.7%.
Our EBITDAC increased by 11.3%, growing slightly faster than revenues as we are able to leverage our expense base and further manage our expenses in response to COVID-19.
These both offset the headwinds associated with the gain on disposal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation.
Our income before income taxes increased by 28.3%, outpacing EBITDAC growth.
This is primarily driven by the $15 million year-over-year decrease in the change of estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
On the next slide, we'll discuss our results excluding this adjustment.
Our net income increased by $20.8 million or 27.2% and our diluted net income per share increased by 25.9% to $0.34.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.7%, substantially in line with the 25% we realized in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 or 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Over on to Slide number 8.
This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $9.5 million as compared to a $5.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The credit was primarily driven by the reduction in estimated earn-out payables for an acquisition within the National Programs segment.
Excluding the change in acquisition earn-outs in the fourth quarter of both years, our income before income tax grew $13.9 million or 12.9%.
Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $9.7 million or 12% and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3%.
Overall, it was a great quarter.
We're moving over to Slide number 9.
This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance.
For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 10.9% and our contingent commissions and GSCs was slightly down for the quarter.
Our organic revenues was exclude the net impact of M&A activity, increased by 4.7% for the fourth quarter.
Over to Slide number 10.
Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 7.2%, driven by acquisition activity and organic revenue growth of 1.5%.
The timing discussed above negatively impacted organic revenue by 100 basis points for the quarter.
EBITDAC grew 5.3% due to leveraging organic revenue and cost savings achieved in response to the pandemic.
This growth was slower than the growth in total revenues, primarily due to a prior year gain on disposal that represented a negative year-over-year impact of approximately 150 basis points.
Our income before income tax margin increased 130 basis points and grew faster than EBITDAC, due primarily to the change in estimated acquisition earn-outs.
Moving on to Slide number 11.
Our National Programs segment increased total revenues by $25.3 million or 18.9% and organic revenue by 14.1%.
The increase in total revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and strong organic growth across many programs.
Due to that growth of 19% was in line with total revenue growth.
The leveraging of strong organic revenue in the management of variable cost was offset by higher intercompany IT charges and lower contingent commissions.
Income before income taxes increased by $20.3 million or 54% growing faster than EBITDAC due to decreased acquisition earn-out payables that was partially offset by higher intercompany interest expense.
Over to Slide number 12.
Our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 19.2% and organic revenue growth of 5.8%.
Total revenues grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions with contingent commissions substantially flat year-over-year.
EBITDAC grew by 17.1% with a margin decline of 40 basis points as compared to the prior year, while we delivered good organic growth and reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19.
These were more than offset due to changes in foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent higher intercompany IT charges.
Our income before income taxes, grew by 6.2%, which was lower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense.
Over to Slide number 13.
Total revenues and organic revenues for the Services segment both declined by about 50 basis points, driven by the items Powell mentioned earlier.
For the quarter, EBITDAC increased by 9.7% due to increased weather-related claims and was partially offset by higher intercompany IT expenses.
Income before income taxes decreased 23.6% due to a credit of $2.5 million in the quarters in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that did not recur or occurred in 2020.
Over to Slide number 14.
This slide presents our GAAP results for the full-year of 2020 and 2019.
For 2020, we delivered revenues of $2.6 billion, growing 9.2% and earnings per share of $1.69, growing 20.7%.
Our EBITDAC increased by 13.5% and our EBITDAC margin grew by 110 basis points.
For the year, our share count increased slightly as compared to the prior year and our dividends paid during 2020 as compared to 2019 increased by 7.1%.
Over to Slide number 15.
This slide presents our results excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years.
For the full-year of 2020, on an adjusted basis, our income before income taxes grew 18.1%, which outpaced EBITDAC growth due to lower interest expense and our adjusted net income per share grew by 19.3%.
In addition to the strong income performance metrics, we also had another strong year for cash conversion due to the strength of our operating model and diversity of our businesses.
We delivered $721.6 million of cash flow from operations, representing a continued strong conversion rate of 27.6% as a percentage of revenue.
We also finished the year in a strong liquidity position, with $817 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $800 million of accessible capital on our revolver.
With this capital and the cash we will generate in 2021, we are in a good position to fund continued investment in our Company.
We got a few other comments regarding outlook for 2021.
During the third quarter, we were asked the question about our potential margins for 2021 in relation to the COVID-19 savings we had in 2020.
Now, with the year completed and a bit more visibility in 2021, we expect EBITDAC margins could be flat to up slightly considering our variable cost will more than likely increase as we're able to travel and see customers face-to-face.
As we've done in the past, our leaders will be focused on growing profitability.
Regarding contingents, we are anticipating them to be relatively flat or maybe down slightly in 2021.
As it pertains to taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for 2021 to be in the range of 23% to 24%.
This does not take into consideration any potential changes in the federal tax rates that are being discussed by the new administration.
For interest expense, we're anticipating a $7 million to $9 million increase as compared to 2020 driven by the new bonds we issued in September of 2020.
From a capital perspective, we are expecting our capex to decrease in 2021 to approximately $40 million to $45 million as we have substantially completed the development of our new Daytona Beach campus.
In my opening comments, I mentioned there are still a few items that need to be resolved over the coming quarters.
We will watch closely the successful rollout of the vaccine and additional stimulus to help those in need.
Both of these items will influence the pace of economic recovery over the coming quarters.
From a rate perspective, we expect increases for the first six months of '21 to be similar to those seen in '20.
Ultimately, the rating -- the rate of increases will be driven by losses sustained in 2020 from the record setting number of tropical storms in the millions of acres that were burned.
The question remains for how much longer and at what pace the rates need to achieve the targeted returns.
We think the market is getting near an inflection point over the coming year for certain lines and will drive some rate moderation.
The acquisition pace seems to be active as ever and competition between private equity and long-term strategics remains.
We continue to believe the aggressive pricing for deals by PE will not abate any time soon.
However, we're well positioned with our low leverage and the capital on our balance sheet, as well as access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity.
Our pipeline remains good and we will keep our disciplined approach to M&A as it's proven to be very successful.
But as you know, we don't count anything until it's closed.
Finally, technology innovation continue to be at the forefront regarding creation of new products and enhancing the experience of our customers.
We will continue to digitize our data, automate and prioritize technology investments around the following: optimizing and enhancing our data and analytics program; expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services; and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.
As we deliver on these goals, we will see new opportunities for growth that will serve our customers even better.
We had a great 2020 on many fronts and have good momentum heading into '21.
I am extremely proud of how our team has served our customers through extremely challenging times.
We have a great team and a highly diversified business, both that performed very well in the past and we expect they will in the future.
Ultimately, our financial performance is only possible through the combined efforts of our nearly 11,000 teammates and our commitment to serve our customers.
","In 2020, despite early headwinds from COVID-19, compname delivered strong financial results, posting 9.2% organic revenue growth and 110 basis point EBITDAC margin expansion. For the fourth quarter, the company achieved 10.9% total revenue growth and 4.7% organic growth. EBITDAC margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year, excluding a prior year gain on disposal. Diluted net income per share increased 25.9% to $0.34, and adjusted diluted net income per share climbed 14.3% to $0.32. The company also completed 25 acquisitions with $197 million of annual acquired revenue, including strategic purchases like CoverHound and O'Leary Insurances. Notably, the company expects EBITDAC margins to remain flat to slightly up in 2021, with contingent commissions expected to decline slightly."
KBH_q4_2021.txt,"On the call are Jeff Mezger, chairman, president, and chief executive officer; Matt Mandino and Rob McGibney, executive vice presidents and co-chief operating officers; Jeff Kaminski, executive vice president and chief financial officer; Bill Hollinger, senior vice president and chief accounting officer; and Thad Johnson, senior vice president and treasurer.
And with that, here is Jeff Mezger.
We had a remarkable year in 2021, producing revenue growth in excess of 35% and an increase in our earnings per share of more than 90%.
We achieved our objectives of expanding our scale and profitability, driving our return on equity up by over 800 basis points to 20%.
Our results are even more notable considering they were accomplished despite the supply chain challenges and municipal delays that were pervasive throughout the year as our teams have been successfully navigating these issues.
As we begin 2022, we are poised to continue delivering returns-focused growth.
Our backlog value of $5 billion, which grew 67% year over year provides a strong base to support our roughly $7.4 billion in expected revenues in 2022.
This represents substantial top-line expansion, which combined with our expectation of a dramatic increase in our gross margin to nearly 26% will drive our return on equity meaningfully higher.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.91, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 70% on the bottom line.
We achieved an operating income margin approaching 12%, resulting in a 28% expansion in our operating profit per unit to over $56,000.
In addition to this significant profit growth, our business is generating a healthy level of cash flow, and we remain consistent in our balanced approach toward allocating this capital.
Disciplined investment in community count growth is our top priority.
And in 2021, we put over $2.5 billion to work in land acquisition and development.
We expanded our lot position to nearly 87,000 lots under control, which is almost 30% higher from year-end 2020.
Our lot position is diversified both across and within our regions, and we own all of the lots that we need for our anticipated 2022 delivery goals.
We also now own or control the lots that we need for sustained growth in 2023.
In addition to reinvesting in our business, we returned over $240 million in cash to stockholders through the share repurchases that we completed in our third quarter, along with our quarterly dividend, and we reduced our debt during the year by over $60 million.
Throughout 2021, we implemented price increases across nearly all of our communities, along with managing lot releases to balance pace, price, and production in order to optimize each asset.
Although costs rose as we move through the year, our pricing strength outpaced the rate of cost inflation, driving our backlog margins higher.
This dynamic continued in our fourth quarter contributing to a rise in our net order value of 12% year over year despite net orders decreasing 10%, a level similar to the decline in our community count.
This increase in net order value contributed to a backlog value that is more than 65% higher.
With the extension of our cycle times, most of the pricing power we experienced in 2021 will be reflected in our gross margin beginning in our 2022 second quarter.
In addition, our results will continue to benefit from structural tailwinds, including the performance of our more recently opened communities, where margins are running in excess of the company average.
The ongoing rotation into a higher quality mix of assets as the impact from reactivated communities continues to diminish, a reduction in amortized interest, and the impact that higher monthly deliveries per community has on field overhead.
All of these factors combined are driving our expectation of a gross margin of nearly 26% for this year.
We successfully opened 130 new communities in 2021, our largest number in many years, including 33 in the fourth quarter.
The higher lot count that I mentioned will enable us to accelerate our new community openings in 2022.
As a result, we now expect to end 2022 with about 265 communities, up over 20% year over year and ahead of our initial projection that we shared in September.
In addition of supporting our roughly 30% increase in revenue planned for 2022, our community count expansion will also contribute to our growth in 2023.
Our monthly absorption per community of 5.5 net orders during the fourth quarter, reflected a typical seasonal pattern sequentially.
For the year, our absorption pace averaged 6.3 net orders per community per month, the best annual rate we have seen in more than a decade.
Homebuyers value the choice and personalization inherent in our built-to-order model, which we believe is the primary reason that we have long generated among the highest absorption rates and the rates will rise this year.
And with the strong home price appreciation the market has experienced, it is appropriate to spend a moment addressing affordability.
Our strategy is to target the median household income of a submarket, positioning our homes to be attainable by the largest segment of buyers.
We strive to be below the median new home price and had a reasonable medium -- had a reasonable premium to the median resale price when we open a community and then be opportunistic in raising price based on demand at that location once opened.
Our average selling price on deliveries rose about 9% year over year in 2021, well below the reported increase for overall pricing levels nationally, highlighting the affordability of our locations and products.
As we have discussed on previous calls, we track a number of internal key indicators to gauge changes in consumer behavior that could signal affordability challenges, which we are not seeing at this time.
One of the most telling of these is the square footage of homes that buyers are selecting as they will typically rotate down to a smaller home if they need to in order to achieve homeownership.
Although we offer floor plans below 1,600 square feet in about 80% of our communities, buyers continue to choose larger footage homes.
Over the past year, our deliveries have averaged between 2,000 and 2,100 feet, consistent with our historical trend.
And our homes in backlog are slightly above that range.
We also look at our studio revenues and lot premiums, which we view as discretionary spending for our buyers.
We would expect to see a decline if buyers are stretched, but our studio revenues and lot premiums have increased even as base prices have risen.
On a combined basis, buyers spent about $48,000 per home in these two categories in the fourth quarter, a solid enhancement to our revenues.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the credit profile of our buyers.
Their average FICO score in the quarter was 732, an all-time high.
In addition, about two-thirds of our buyers qualified for a conventional mortgage, and our buyers overall are averaging a down payment of over $67,000.
Taken together, these metrics illustrate our buyers' strong credit.
I'll also note that the recent increases in loan limits, both conventional and FHA should help with mortgage financing, provided an incremental benefit to the industry.
We started over 3,800 homes during the quarter as we worked to position our production for growth in 2022 deliveries.
At year-end, we had over 9,100 homes in production with 90% of these homes already sold.
Generally, our cancellation rate once we start the home is extremely low, and at 5% in the fourth quarter, it remains so.
We're reflecting our customers' strong desire to purchase their personalized homes.
As to build times, while they expanded about two weeks sequentially in the quarter, we are encouraged to see some signs of stabilization.
Construction times in November and December were consistent with September and October, pointing to a leveling out over the last four months.
Our projections for this year, assume that we hold at these levels, and depending on timing, any improvement in build times could increase our expected closings in the latter part of this year.
Our backlog is comprised of over 10,500 homes with a value of $5 billion, representing the bulk of our revenues expected for 2022.
One aspect of our built-to-order business model that tends to get overlooked is the dynamic between our revenue growth and community count.
In our count, we do not include communities that we consider to be sold out, meaning that they have less than five homes left to sell.
That doesn't mean the community has closed out and that those communities will continue to contribute to our revenues and profits.
In fact, our backlog includes almost 1,900 homes from 150 sold-out communities that will deliver approximately $1 billion in 2022 revenues.
While we have not seen a slowdown in demand across our geographic footprint in the past couple of months, and we foresee a strong spring selling season ahead, a combination of factors has resulted in a negative year-over-year net order comparison for the first six weeks of this quarter at 17%.
In the prior year, net orders throughout December and into 2021 were particularly strong creating a difficult comparison.
As the first quarter progresses, and we benefit from the additional community openings we have scheduled, along with easier weekly comparisons, we expect to end the quarter with net orders down about a mid-single-digit percentage year over year, similar to our anticipated decline in average community count for the quarter.
Market conditions remain very healthy as favorable demographics, low mortgage interest rates, and an extremely limited supply of homes, particularly for first-time buyers continue to drive demand.
Specific to KB Home, we believe the location of our communities, price point of our products, and the ability to choose and personalize homes in our built-to-order approach are compelling for buyers.
Shifting gears for a moment.
2021 was also marked by solid progress in our environmental, social, and governance initiatives.
KB Home was once again recognized with multiple honors from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, leading our industry with the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award, a record number of ENERGY STAR Market Leader Awards and once again being the only homebuilder to receive the WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award.
Our environmental program is robust, and we are proud that our homes have the lowest national average HERS score among production builders with a long track record of annual improvement in this key metric, which we expect to continue in 2022.
Our ESG leadership is being recognized as KB Home is the only national builder named to Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies for the second year in a row.
We've significantly increased our volume in 2021 amid the most challenging and fluid operating conditions that I have seen in my homebuilding career.
These results came about from the determined and relentless efforts of our entire team.
In closing, 2021 was a rewarding year for KB Home.
In addition to generating significant revenue and earnings growth, we also produced substantial increases in our book value per share and our return on equity.
Alongside these meaningful financial results, we maintain our leadership in providing the highest customer satisfaction levels among large production homebuilders and continue to drive innovation through the introduction of energy-efficient and healthier home features.
As a result of these and many other factors, KB Home was named to the list of the 250 most effectively managed companies in the U.S., a ranking that was developed by the Drucker Institute in conjunction with The Wall Street Journal.
As we look to the year ahead, during which we will celebrate our 65th anniversary, we anticipate another year of remarkable growth, which we expect will ultimately drive a return on equity of more than 26%.
We look forward to sharing our progress with you as 2022 unfolds.
I will now cover highlights of our financial performance for the 2021 fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide our outlook for the 2022 first quarter and full year.
We finished 2021 with strong fourth-quarter results, including significant year-over-year growth in revenues and a 310-basis-point expansion in our operating margin that drove a 71% increase in our diluted earnings per share.
While we faced supply chain issues that extended our cycle times, as well as construction cost inflation challenges during 2021, our exceptional portfolio of communities and solid operational execution, along with the strong housing market generated impressive full-year results that I will summarize in a few minutes.
With a robust 2021 ending backlog value of nearly $5 billion and 29% year-over-year expansion in the number of lots owned or controlled, we are well-positioned for continued meaningful growth in revenues, community count, earnings per share, and returns in 2022.
In the fourth quarter, our housing revenues of $1.66 billion were up 39% from a year ago, reflecting a 28% increase in homes delivered and a 9% increase in their overall average selling price.
Housing revenues were up significantly in all four of our regions, ranging from a 28% increase in the Central region to 114% in the Southeast.
Looking ahead to the 2022 first quarter, we anticipate housing market conditions will continue to be favorable with strong homebuyer demand while we navigate expected continued supply chain challenges.
For the 2022 first quarter, we expect to generate housing revenues in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.53 billion.
For the 2022 full year, assuming no change in supply chain dynamics, we are forecasting housing revenues in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, up over $1.7 billion or 30% at the midpoint as compared to 2021.
Having ended our 2021 fiscal year with our highest year-end backlog level since 2005, along with our expectations for a higher community count and continued strong housing market conditions, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve this top-line performance for 2022.
In the fourth quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered increased to approximately $451,000.
Reflecting our higher average selling price per net order in recent quarters, we are projecting an average selling price of approximately $472,000 for the 2022 first quarter.
For the 2022 full year, we believe our overall average selling price will be in the range of $480,000 to $490,000.
Homebuilding operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $214.4 million, up 85% as compared to $115.7 million for the year-earlier quarter.
The current quarter included inventory-related charges of approximately $700,000 versus $11.7 million a year ago.
Our operating margin was 12.8%, up 310 basis points from the 2020 fourth quarter.
Excluding inventory-related charges, our operating margin was 12.9% as compared to 10.7% a year ago, reflecting improvements in both our gross margin and SG&A expense ratio.
We anticipate our 2022 first quarter homebuilding operating income margin, excluding the impact of any inventory-related charges, will be approximately 12%, compared to 10.4% for the year-earlier quarter.
For the 2022 full year, we expect this metric to be in the range of 15.7% to 16.5%, which represents a significant year-over-year improvement of 450 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting continued positive momentum in both our gross margin and SG&A expense ratio.
Our 2021 fourth-quarter housing gross profit margin improved 230 basis points from the year-earlier quarter to 22.3%.
Excluding inventory-related charges, our gross margin for the quarter reflected a year-over-year increase of 140 basis points to 22.4%.
The year-over-year improvement primarily reflected the impact of higher selling prices and lower amortization of previously capitalized interest, partly offset by higher costs for lumber and other construction materials and labor.
We are forecasting a housing gross profit margin for the first quarter in the range of 22% to 22.6%, representing the low point for the year.
We anticipate significant sequential expansion in quarterly gross margin during 2022, mainly driven by price increases that have outpaced cost pressures in our established communities, strong selling margins in our recently opened communities, and an expected reduction in amortization of previously capitalized interest.
For the full year, we expect this metric will be in the range of 25.4% to 26.2%, an increase of 400 basis points at the midpoint as compared to 2021.
Our selling, general, and administrative expense ratio of 9.8% for the fourth quarter improved 50 basis points from a year ago, mainly reflecting enhanced operating leverage due to higher revenues, partly offset by increased performance-based compensation expenses and costs to support our expanding scale.
We are forecasting our 2022 first quarter SG&A ratio to be approximately 10.4%, an improvement of 30 basis points versus the prior year as expected favorable leverage impact from an anticipated year-over-year increase in housing revenues are partially offset by increased investments in personnel and other resources to support a projected meaningful expansion in community count.
We expect that our 2022 full-year SG&A expense ratio will be in the range of 9.4% to 9.9%.
Our income tax expense of $49.7 million for the fourth quarter, which represented an effective tax rate of approximately 22%, was favorably impacted by $7 million of federal energy tax credits, reflecting another benefit of our industry-leading sustainability initiatives.
We currently expect our effective tax rate for the 2022 first quarter and full year to be approximately 25%, both excluding any favorable impacts from energy tax credits.
Federal legislation extending the availability of tax credits for building energy-efficient homes in 2022 has not yet been enacted.
If the Section 45L tax credit is extended at its current level, our 2022 effective tax rate would be favorably impacted by approximately 200 basis points.
Overall, we reported net income of $174.2 million or $1.91 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, a notable improvement from $106.1 million or $1.12 per diluted share for the prior-year period.
Reflecting on the full year, we are very pleased with our strong 2021 financial results.
We increased our housing revenues by 37% to nearly $5.7 billion, expanded our operating margin by 400 basis points to 11.6% with measurable improvements in both our gross margin and SG&A expense ratio, and reported $6.01 of diluted earnings per share, an increase of 92%.
We also completed $188 million of share repurchases, refinanced $390 million of our senior notes, resulting in annualized savings of $16 million of incurred interest, and improved our year-end leverage ratio by 380 basis points.
Turning now to community count.
Our fourth quarter average of 214 was down 9% from 234 in the corresponding 2020 quarter and up 4% sequentially.
We ended the year with 217 communities down 8% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially.
We expect our 2022 first-quarter ending community count to remain relatively flat sequentially and represents a low point for 2022.
On a year-over-year basis, we anticipate our 2022 first-quarter average community count will be down by a low single-digit percentage.
We expect our quarter-end community count to increase sequentially through the remainder of the year starting in the second quarter as openings each quarter are expected to outpace sell-outs.
We anticipate ending the year with a 20% to 25% increase in our community count, supporting additional top-line growth in 2023 and beyond.
During the fourth quarter, to drive future community openings, we invested $622 million in land and land development with $258 million or 41% of the total representing land acquisitions.
In 2021, we invested over $2.5 billion in land acquisition development, compared to $1.7 billion in the previous year.
At year-end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 billion including $791 million of available capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
Our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 35.8% at year-end 2021, compared to 39.6% the previous year.
We expect to generate significant cash flow in the current year to fund land investments supporting our targeted 2022 and future years' growth in community count and housing revenues.
Our 2021 year-end stockholders' equity was $3.02 billion as compared to $2.67 billion a year ago, and our book value per share increased by 18% to $34.23.
Finally, one of the most notable 2021 achievements was our significant improvement in return on equity to 19.9% for the full year, a year-over-year expansion of over 800 basis points.
Given our current backlog and community opening plans and the expected continued strength in the housing market, we are confident that we will generate significant year-over-year improvements in our key 2022 financial metrics.
We plan to continue to execute on the principles of our returns-focused growth strategy with an emphasis on meaningfully improving our returns by increasing our community count and top line while producing further expansion in our operating margin.
In summary, using the midpoints of our guidance ranges, we expect a 30% year-over-year increase in housing revenues and significant expansion of our operating margin to 16.1% driven by improvements in both gross margin and our SG&A expense ratio.
These in turn should drive our return on equity of over 26% up and excess of 600 basis points from 19.9% in 2021.
This outlook reflects our view that with our returns-focused growth strategy, attractive business model, seasoned leadership team, and continued favorable housing conditions, we will be able to further and meaningfully enhance long-term stockholder value in 2022.
Alex, please open the lines.
","KB Home had a remarkable 2021, reporting revenue growth of over 35% and an earnings per share increase of more than 90%. The company's robust backlog of $5 billion, representing expected 2022 revenues of $7.4 billion, positions it for continued growth. In the fourth quarter, KB Home generated $1.7 billion in revenues, with diluted earnings per share of $1.91, driven by a 12% increase in net order value. Despite supply chain challenges, KB Home's pricing strength outpaced inflation, resulting in higher gross margins of nearly 26% and a substantial increase in its return on equity to over 26%. The company's focus on community expansion has led to a 20% increase in its community count by year-end 2022, supporting revenue growth in 2023. KB Home is well-positioned for growth in the coming years, with favorable market conditions, a strong pipeline, and a focus on returns-focused growth."
LII_q1_2021.txt,"I'm here today with Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn; and CFO, Joe Reitmeier.
Todd will review key points for the quarter and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and outlook for 2021.
To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and requeue for any additional questions.
All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period.
For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC.
In the first quarter, we continued to see strong momentum in our Residential business, combined with strong improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration, as the overall company set new first quarter highs for revenue, profit and earnings per share.
Overall, for the company, revenue was up 29% to a new first quarter record of $931 million.
At constant currency, revenue was up 28%.
GAAP operating income was a first quarter record $114 million, up 213%.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was a first quarter record $2.20, up 588%.
Total segment profit rose 208% to a first quarter record of $116 million.
Total segment margin expanded 720 basis points to 12.4%, and adjusted points to 12.4%, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 305% to a first quarter record $2.27.
Looking at our business segments for the first quarter, we've realized double digit revenue growth and margin expansion in all three businesses.
In Residential, we set new first quarter highs for revenue and profit.
Residential revenue was up 37%.
Segment profit rose 197% and segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%.
Replacement business was up more than 40% and new construction was up more than 25%.
Breaking it down between our Lennox business and our Allied business, Lennox revenue was up about 25%, and Allied was up about 70%.
Let me take a moment to unpack the strength we saw in Residential in the quarter.
First, with strong operational execution, our Residential team is capitalizing on its ability to deliver to meet contractor and distributor demand and gain share.
Post the 2018 tornado and the initial 2020 pandemic impact, we are back on offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for market share gains.
Second, Residential benefited from the colder winter weather with heating degree days up 13% from the first quarter last year.
You may recall, we had a soft first quarter in 2020.
Third, I'd like to note that we had -- I would like to note that we had a 6% benefit to revenue for more days in the quarter this year than last year.
That happens every four years as we reset the calendar.
Conversely, the fourth quarter will have a 6% headwind from fewer days in the quarter this year.
This applies to Residential as well as all our other businesses.
Adjusting for the days, Residential grew 31% with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.
In addition, for Allied, we had approximately $25 million of pull-forward in the first quarter from different distributor loading patterns this year than last year.
Adjusted for both days and this pull-forward, Allied was up approximately 35% in the quarter.
Working through all this math I gave, adjusting for days and the pull-forward in our Allied business which sells to independent distribution, overall Residential segment revenue was up about 25%.
We believe this compares to mid-teen sell-through for the industry, driven in part by the favorable cold weather that I talked about.
Our performance that is above that is due to market share gains.
As I mentioned earlier, we are back on the offensive with production, distribution and executing our playbook for gaining share.
The team has had strong operational execution to drive this outperformance, and we are well positioned for the summer season and our largest season of quarters.
In Commercial, revenue, segment profit and margin were all first quarter records.
Revenue is up 12%.
At constant currency, revenue was up 11%.
Segment profit was up 47% and segment margin expanded 330 basis points to 13.8%.
In the first quarter, we saw broad strength in Commercial as year-over-year growth turned positive across all of our businesses.
At constant currency, Commercial equipment revenue was up mid-teens in the quarter.
Within this, replacement revenue was up mid-teens with planned replacement up mid-teens and emergency replacement up high teens.
New construction revenue was up high single digits.
Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue is up mid-teens, national account equipment revenue is also up mid-teens.
Our team won three new national account equipment customers in the quarter.
On the service side, the next National Accounts Services revenue was up mid-single digits.
VRF revenue was up mid-30s percentage.
Some highlights to mention for Commercial.
Schools continue to be an area of focus for us.
We have a dedicated sales force and product line that will drive a multiyear growth opportunity for us in this market.
Today, K-12 schools are just a little under 10% of revenue for this -- equipment revenue for this segment.
This business is up more than 20% for us in the first quarter.
And given the recent stimulus package that benefits HVAC, indoor air quality spending for schools, we expect K3 schools to be a growth vertical for us moving forward.
Indoor air quality continues to be an important focus for us with our building better air initiatives.
Most interest and activity we are seeing are in this K-12 school segment but conversations are taking place with many customers across many industry verticals.
We have launched our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field and energy efficiency.
The Model L features variable speed technology and an all-new advanced control system.
We're seeing high customer interest in this industry-leading product for 2021 and beyond.
Overall, for Commercial, entering the second quarter, momentum continues with backlog up double digits and strong order rates.
In Refrigeration for the first quarter, revenue was up 21%.
At constant currency, revenue is up 17%.
In North America, revenue was up more than 25%.
Europe Refrigeration revenue was up low single digits at constant currency, and Europe HVAC revenue was up mid-single digits at constant currency.
Refrigeration segment margin expanded 560 basis points to 6.3%.
The segment profit rose to $8 million from $1 million in the prior year quarter.
Like in Commercial, momentum continues for Refrigeration entering the second quarter with backlog up double digits and strong order flow led by North America.
The strong performance for the company overall in the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter and year, we are raising 2021 guidance.
We now expect 7% to 11% revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.40 to $12.
We are also raising free cash flow guidance to $375 million for the full year.
We now assume about 55% of earnings in the first half of the year compared to the prior guidance of about 50%.
This reflects the strong first quarter performance and second quarter outlook.
We repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter and plan on another $200 million for a total of $400 million in our guidance for the year.
I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling.
In the quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was a first quarter record $606 million, up 37%.
Volume was up 32%.
Price was up 1% and mix was up 4%.
Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue.
Residential profit was a first quarter record $96 million, up 197%.
Segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%.
Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, higher factory productivity, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, distribution and freight savings and favorable foreign exchange.
Partial offsets included higher commodity, warranty and other product costs and higher SG&A.
Now turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business.
In the first quarter, Commercial revenue was a first quarter record $199 million, up 12%.
Volume was up 15%.
Price was flat and mix was down 4%.
Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue growth.
Commercial segment profit was a first quarter record $27 million, up 47%.
Segment margin was a first quarter record 13.8%, which was up 330 basis points.
Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, lower material costs and lower SG&A.
Partial offsets included unfavorable mix.
In Refrigeration, revenue was $125 million, up 21%.
Volume was up 15%.
Price was up 1% and mix was up 1%.
Foreign exchange had a positive 4% impact to revenue growth.
Refrigeration segment profit was $8 million in the first quarter compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter.
Segment margin was 6.3%, up 560 basis points.
Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, lower material costs and higher factory productivity.
Higher SG&A was a partial offset.
Regarding special items in the first quarter, the company had net after-tax charges of $2.7 million that included a $2 million net charge for other tax items, a $1.9 million net charge in total for various other items and a $1.2 million benefit for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
Corporate expenses were $16 million in the first quarter compared to $14 million in the prior year quarter.
Overall, SG&A was $145 million compared to $131 million in the prior year quarter.
SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 15.6% from 18.1% in the prior quarter.
In the first quarter, the company used $18 million in cash from operations compared to a usage of $99 million in the prior year quarter.
Capital expenditures were approximately 25 -- $24 million in the first quarter and in the prior year quarter.
Free cash flow was a negative $42 million in the first quarter compared to a negative $123 million in the prior quarter.
The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock.
Total debt was $1.17 billion at the end of the first quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the first quarter.
We now expect the industry to see high single-digit shipment growth in Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration markets in full year, up from our prior assumption of mid-single-digit growth in these end markets.
For the company, we are raising guidance for 2021 revenue growth from a 48% range to a new range of 7% to 11%, and we still expect foreign exchange to be neutral to revenue for the full year.
We are raising guidance for 2021 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations from a range of $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.33 to $11.93, and we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations from $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.40 to $12.
Now let me run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021.
First, for the items that are changing.
We have announced a second round of price increases and now expect a benefit of $90 million in price for the year, up from our prior guidance of $50 million.
We now expect residential mix of $10 million, up from our prior guidance for neutral mix.
We expect a benefit of $15 million from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction actions, down from our prior guidance of $25 million.
And this change reflects inflationary pressures from suppliers.
For commodities, we now expect a $55 million headwind, up from our prior guidance of $30 million.
Corporate expenses are now expected to be approximately $95 million, up from prior guidance of $90 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.
And now for the guidance items that remain the same.
We still expect a $20 million benefit from factory productivity.
With 30 new Lennox Stores planned for this year, we will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments compared to last year.
Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are also expected to be a $5 million headwind.
We are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or a headwind of about $45 million.
Now within SG&A, we are making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, eCommerce and factory automation and productivity.
A few other guidance points.
We still expect neutral foreign exchange.
We still expect interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million.
We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year.
We are still planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico.
We expect construction to be completed at the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, and we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant.
Free cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $375 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $325 million on the strong earnings performance in the first quarter and our current outlook.
And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million to 38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.
And with that, let's go to Q&A.
","Lennox International reported strong Q1 results, setting new revenue, profit, and earnings per share records across all its segments. Overall, revenue surged 29% to $931 million, driven by double-digit growth in Residential, Commercial, and Refrigeration businesses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew an impressive 305% to $2.27. Adjusted earnings per share for 2021 are now forecast to be between $11.40 and $12.00, and revenue growth is expected to range from 7% to 11%. This favorable performance was attributed to operational execution, increased demand from colder winter weather, and market share gains. The company also benefited from a strong backlog and positive order rates in Commercial and Refrigeration segments. Management highlighted continued investments in innovation, expansion of the new third plant in Mexico, and plans to repurchase $400 million in stock this year."

Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial measures.
Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
Chipotle's third quarter results highlight strong momentum in our business, fueled by a multi-pronged growth strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants.
We continue to retain about 80% of digital sales but have now recovered nearly 80% of in-restaurant sales.
While COVID impacts will likely persist for a few more quarters, we are hopeful that the worst is behind us and society can shortly return to a more normal environment.
For the quarter, we reported record quarterly sales of $2 billion, representing 21.9% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales.
Restaurant level margin of 23.5% was 400 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year.
Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.02, representing an increase of 86.7% year-over-year.
Digital sales growth of 8.6% year-over-year, representing 42.8% of sales and we opened 41 new restaurants, including 36 with a Chipotlane.
And I'm pleased to report that Q4 is off to a great start.
These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and allow us to win today, while we create the future.
While we regularly get asked, what's next, I believe our current growth drivers have plenty of runway and will be critical to us reaching our longer-term goal of 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs above $3 million and improving returns on invested capital.
To remind everyone, we're focusing on five key areas.
Number one, opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences.
Number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation.
Number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience, and engagement.
Number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions in frequency.
And last but certainly not least, number five, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved.
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with operations.
Well-trained and supported employees consistently preparing delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success.
We're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability, and excellent culinary, despite the dynamic and challenging environment.
We are extremely proud of Chipotle's world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education, and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities.
We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees, which is more important than ever given the challenging labor environment we're all experiencing today.
Over the past 18 months, we've made operational adjustments to adapt to our constantly changing environment in support of our in-restaurant business as well as our record-breaking digital business.
As a result, we've had to allocate labor as needed among the different roles, including the DML and the frontline, depending on available staff to accommodate the needs of our customers and our restaurant teams.
This flexibility has allowed us to keep our frontline open, given our ability to divert orders on the digital line as needed to overcome periodic staffing challenges.
This is part of the normal business balancing that occurs at the discretion of on-site managers and has not had a material impact on our business in the past.
This was through pre-pandemic and is more relevant now as dining room volumes recover.
The good news is that I believe we're finally getting back to pre-pandemic operations and I couldn't be more excited.
We're fortunate to have a dedicated digital make line and a dedicated dining room serving line.
Our frontline represented nearly 60% of our business or $1.1 billion of sales for the quarter.
It is big and it is growing.
We are committed to ensuring guests on the frontline get the customized meal they want, made with real ingredients, excellent culinary, and faster than anywhere else.
We still have some work to do, but our goal is to provide exceptional throughput as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value.
Therefore, we are committed to teaching, training, and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience.
While taking good care of guest is always a top priority, utilizing our stage gate process to continue innovating is critical to our growth.
The great news is that Chipotle's delicious food that you feel good about eating, which creates an emotional connection with our customers and they love to see ongoing innovation from us.
As a result, we introduced new menu items on a regular cadence as it helps bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users, and gives us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand.
Recently, we launched Smoked Brisket for limited time across all our U.S. and Canadian restaurants.
Our culinary team spent the last two years developing the perfect Smoked Brisket recipe that is unique to our brand and pairs flawlessly with our fresh, real ingredients.
This is our third new menu item this year, following on the success of our Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice and handcrafted Quesadilla.
Early customer feedback on this entree, which is expected to last through November, has been very positive and we're delighted to see an increase in both check size and transactions.
Quesadillas, which we launched as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, continues to perform well and is also helping attract new customers to Chipotle.
By the way, if you haven't had a chance to try the brisket quesadilla, you really are missing out.
And we're far from being done.
Plant-Based Chorizo is currently being tested in a couple of markets and our talented culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items.
All that being said, our stage gate process is not limited to new menu innovations.
We use it for many parts of the business, including development.
As you know, we validated a new restaurant expansion in Canada earlier this year, impressive unit economics with AUVs and margins, equal to or above those in the U.S. led us to accelerate development in this market.
We've opened one new restaurant in Canada year-to-date and have several more planned before year-end, including our first ever Chipotlane that's scheduled to open next week.
Similarly, we are now in the early stages of using this process to learn, iterate, and eventually validate expansion in Western Europe.
COVID slowed our ability to execute several critical initiatives, however, with restrictions easing, we're making nice progress and have implemented some of our digital assets as well as begun to test alternative formats and explore new trade areas.
The recent openings have exceeded expectations.
So while we continue to view international expansion as a medium to longer-term opportunity, I remain quite optimistic about its future contributions to the Chipotle story.
A more near-term pillar of growth has been our ongoing digital transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand.
During the third quarter, digital sales grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $840 million and represented 43% of sales.
We're not surprised to see the mix moderate as the world continues to reopen.
However, we're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continue to grow despite lapping tough comparisons.
In fact, our year-to-date digital sales of nearly $2.7 billion are just slightly below the $2.8 billion we achieved during all of last year.
Digital is proving to be sticky as it's a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution, innovation, and the customer value proposition.
As a result of the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative occasions.
The thing I love about having two separate businesses is that they serve different needs that will likely prove to be incremental and complementary over the long run.
This is reinforced by the fact that different guests are accessing Chipotle through different channels.
Currently, about 65% of our guest use in-restaurant as their main access point, nearly 20% use digital as their primary channel, and the remaining 15% to 20% use both channels.
We're encouraged by this dynamic as it gives us several future opportunities, including the ability to convert more of our in-restaurant guests into higher frequency digital users.
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, but we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders, is gaining traction.
This channel represented slightly more than half of digital sales in Q3.
As always, we're not being complacent and continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings, and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program.
Speaking of the loyalty program, we're excited to have more than 24.5 million members, many of whom are new to the brand.
This gives us a large captive audience to engage with and distribute content that promotes our values, as well as motivates our super fans.
We continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing a lot more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys, primarily for new and lapsed customers.
These personalized messages are more brand-related as opposed to offers or discounts, which is allowing us to optimize program foundation and economics.
All these efforts, along with the use of enhanced analytics, are allowing us to consistently attract more visits from loyalty members than non-members.
No doubt the loyalty program has moved from a crawl to the walk stage, and we still have a lot of room to grow.
Offering new ways to engage with Chipotle is essential to the ongoing evolution of our digital business.
Our first enhancement was Rewards Exchange, which provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster.
More recently, we announced Extras, an exclusive feature that gamifies Chipotle rewards with personalized challenges to earn extra points and/or collect achievement badges in order to drive engagement.
As the program grows, so does our ability to provide sophisticated and relevant communications to our guests, which will ultimately deepen the relationship between members and the brand.
We are pleased with our progress to-date, but believe with ongoing investments and further leveraging of data-driven insights, we can get even better.
Amplifying all the growth initiatives I've mentioned thus far are the collective efforts of the marketing team, which are designed to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant, and more loved.
We believe that real food has the power to change the world and using custom creative across a wide variety of media channels that allow us to drive culture, drive difference, and ultimately, drive a purchase.
For example, we use numerous campaigns to stay relevant via important sporting events such as the basketball championships, where we hit $1 million worth of free burritos in our TV advertising.
We also utilize social media, including our website, to authentically highlight real food for real athletes during the broadcast from Tokyo.
And, of course, to celebrate the launch of Smoked Brisket, we offered an exclusive peek to our loyalty members prior to a full launch, supported by a media plan across online video, digital, and social media platforms as well as traditional TV spots.
All of these helped attract new guests into the Chipotle family as well as increase frequency of existing users.
We're fortunate to have an innovative marketing team that wants to be a leader, not a follower, and our marketing organization is built on a culture of accountability that encourages new ideas, that's committed to experimentation, and is ruthless on measuring returns, and isn't afraid to pivot to different opportunities if they don't perform to our high standards.
Every day this team is focused on driving sales today, while enhancing our brand for tomorrow.
Chipotle is committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand, and cultivate a better world.
Our team has proven their ability to be resilient and successfully execute against macro complexities.
As a result, I believe, we are better positioned to drive sustainable, long-term growth than we were before the pandemic, which makes me even more excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials.
We're pleased to report solid third quarter results with sales growing 21.9% year-over-year to $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.1%.
Restaurant level margin of 23.5% expanded 400 basis points over last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.02, representing 86.7% year-over-year growth.
The third quarter had a GAAP tax benefit that I'll discuss shortly, which is partially offset by expenses related to a previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance share and transformation expenses, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $0.16 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $7.18.
As we look ahead to Q4, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID-related impacts as well as inflationary and staffing pressures.
But given our strong underlying business momentum, we expect our comp to be in the low-to-mid double digits, which is encouraging considering that will be about 200 basis points less than pricing contribution during Q4 versus Q3 as we've lap some of our delivery menu price increases.
And our brisket LTO will be for a partial quarter as compared to the full quarter of carne asada last year.
Let me now go through the P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales.
Our supply chain team has done an outstanding job, navigating the numerous industrywide disruption, which led to food costs being 30.3% in Q3, a decrease of 200 basis points from last year.
This is due primarily to leverage from menu price increases, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with beef and freight that unfortunately are continuing to worsen.
It's hard to predict how much of these headwinds will ultimately be temporary versus permanent but they are likely to persist for the foreseeable future.
In addition, Q4 will also include the higher cost brisket LTO, which collectively will result in our food costs being in the low-31% range for the quarter.
Labor costs for the third quarter were 25.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year.
This increase was driven by our strategy to increase average nationwide wages to $15 per hour, which is partially offset by menu price increases, sales leverage, and a one-time employee retention credit.
Given ongoing elevated wage inflation and greater new unit openings, we expect labor costs to be in the mid-26% range in Q4.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.1%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year due primarily to price and sales leverage.
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, about 20 basis points lower than we spent last year.
While Q3 tends to be a seasonally lower advertising quarter, the timing of some initiatives also shifted into Q4 this year.
As a result, we anticipate marketing expense to be around 4% in Q4 to support Smoked Brisket and for the latest brand messaging under our Behind The Foil campaign.
For the full year 2021, marketing expense is expected to remain right about 3% of sales.
Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16% range for the fourth quarter.
Looking at overall restaurant margins, we expect Q4 to be in the 20% to 21% range.
Our Q4 underlying margin would be around 22% when you normalize marketing spend and remove the temporary headwind from the brisket LTO.
And the remaining cost pressure will continue to evaluate and take appropriate actions on menu prices to offset any lasting impacts.
Our value proposition remains strong, which we believe gives us a lot of pricing power.
Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to drive restaurant level margins higher as our average unit volumes increase.
G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis or $137 million on a non-GAAP basis, including $7.6 million for the previously mentioned modification for 2018 performance shares, and $1.6 million related to transformation and other expenses.
G&A also includes about $100 million in underlying G&A, about $28 million related to non-cash stock compensation, about $8.5 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting, and stock option exercises, and roughly, $600,000 related to our upcoming all-manager conference.
Looking to Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be right around $101 million as we continue to make investments primarily intact to support ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance.
We also expect to recognize around $5.5 million related to performance-based bonus expense and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter as well as about $1.5 million related to our all-manager conference.
Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 14.7% on a GAAP basis and 19.7% on a non-GAAP basis.
Both rates benefited from our option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices.
In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a return to provision benefit for additional NOL generated on our 2020 federal income tax return and carried back to prior years.
For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended Q3 with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a $500 million untapped revolver.
During the quarter, we repurchased $99 million of our stock at average price of $1,813 and we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
However, opening more Chipotles continues to be the best return we can generate.
During Q3, despite a few delays in opening timeline, we opened 41 new restaurants with 36 of these including a Chipotlane.
While we're experiencing construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor labor shortages, critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays, our development team is doing an excellent job opening these new restaurants.
In fact, we currently have more than 110 restaurants under construction, and while timing is somewhat unpredictable, this gives us confidence in ending the year at or slightly above the 200 new restaurants with now more than 75% including a Chipotlane versus our prior expectation of 70%.
Also, the team has done a nice job building a robust new unit pipeline, which we believe will allow us to accelerate openings in 2022.
But because of the challenges I just mentioned and how they could impact the timeline, we will provide 2022 opening guidance during our Q4 call.
As of September 30th, we had a total of 284 Chipotlanes, including 12 conversions and 8 relocations.
They continue to enhance access and convenience for our guests, while demonstrating stellar performance.
And while it's early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations are yielding encouraging results.
We will leverage our stage gate process to learn and refine our strategic approach to accelerating our Chipotlane portfolio.
You can see why we remain optimistic about our future.
","Chipotle's third-quarter results reflect strong growth, with record quarterly sales of $2 billion, a 21.9% increase year-over-year, driven by a 15.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales. The company's digital sales also grew, representing 42.8% of total sales. Chipotle's restaurant level margin was 23.5%, an increase of 400 basis points compared to last year, leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.02, an 86.7% growth. Despite challenges like COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and staffing shortages, Chipotle remains optimistic about the future. The company plans to accelerate growth by focusing on key strategies, including opening successful restaurants, promoting innovation, leveraging digital capabilities, engaging customers through its loyalty program, and enhancing brand visibility. Chipotle anticipates continued growth, with a target of 6,000 restaurants and increased average unit volumes in the future. The company's strong third-quarter performance and strategic plans indicate a positive outlook for its long-term growth trajectory."
GCO_q3_2022.txt,"These statements reflect the participants' expectations as of today, but actual results could be different.
Participants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call.
With me on the call today is Mimi Vaughn, board chair, president, and chief executive officer.
And Tom George, chief financial officer, will review Q3 results in more detail and provide guidance for Q4.
As we announced last month, and you just heard, I'm very pleased we've removed interim from Tom's title.
Tom brings almost 30 years of CFO experience and deep roots in brands and retail, most recently at Deckers Brands.
He has been a tremendous asset to the organization since joining us a year ago, helping guide the business through a period of significant recovery and growth.
We're excited he's part of our leadership team and will continue to benefit from his knowledge and expertise as we grow Genesco going forward.
Now onto recent performance.
Building off an extremely strong first half of the year, we delivered another record earnings per share that well exceeded our expectations, fueled by a very successful back-to-school selling season.
As expected, sales were up considerably from last year, but what's most exciting is the double-digit increase over pre-pandemic level.
We entered the pandemic in a position of strength, are navigating the pandemic well and will enter the post-pandemic phase even stronger.
While the current market conditions have presented a number of external challenges, including supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and wage increases, elevated freight expense, and other cost pressures, we are managing through them adeptly.
This quarter's performance highlights the differentiated competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, strong consumer engagement, and the strategic advantages delivered through our footwear-focused strategy as we work to transform our business.
In particular, our results spotlight Journeys and Schuh as the leading destinations for teen and youth fashion footwear.
Customers view them as unparalleled fashion authorities, validating whatever brands they're currently selling and are increasingly turning to our concept for their branded footwear needs.
and the U.K. as students largely return to in-person classes in the U.S. for the first time.
Sales at Journeys and Schuh exceeded pre-pandemic level.
And while sales volumes typically moderate after the back-to-school rush, we were very encouraged that demand accelerated throughout the quarter and remained strong into October.
I'll call out for Q3 overall was the robust consumer appetite for in-person shopping even as the number of COVID cases spiked, which allowed us to drive a 30% increase in store sales over last year.
Although traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, it improved across the board to the best levels we've seen.
Our ability to capitalize on the increased demand would not have been possible without the commitment and drive of our store teams who worked tirelessly to prepare and execute a successful back-to-school.
Congratulations to our entire field organization on a job well done.
These results reinforce our view that kids like to shop in person even if they begin their shopping journey online, making our stores a strategic asset working in tandem with our digital capabilities.
I'll now provide some key highlights from this important back-to-school quarter.
Third quarter revenue of $601 million increased 25% versus last year and 12% versus two years ago.
And revenue growth, better-than-expected gross margins, and expense leverage resulted in an operating income increase of almost 70% over pre-pandemic levels and record earnings per share of $2.36 compared with $0.85 last year and $1.33 two years ago, all on an adjusted basis.
Additional highlights include: the robust store sales I've already talked about plus another quarter of strong digital growth; digital sales, which come with double-digit operating margins, increased 11% year-over-year and 79% compared to fiscal '20.
With this, our e-commerce business now represents 18% of total retail sales and is approaching $0.5 billion; next, increasing gross margin by 210 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher full-price selling and price increases while being flat with fiscal '20 in spite of the changing mix of our business and some freight expense pressure; leveraging adjusted SG&A by 260 basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels, as we make progress on efforts to reshape our cost structure; and finally, restarting our share repurchase activity by buying back $31 million of Genesco stock, demonstrating our strong financial position, confidence in our future, and commitment to a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders.
As excited as we are about this quarter, we are even more excited about driving our strategy forward to deliver additional growth, profits, and shareholder value.
So, turning now to discuss each business in more detail.
Strong consumer demand for a variety of brands and styles drove continued momentum as Journeys achieved record third quarter revenue and operating profit, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of record profitability even while operating with inventory almost 30% below pre-pandemic levels.
Leveraging its industry-leading vendor partnerships and deep talent and experience, Journeys merchants selected and secured a compelling assortment of footwear most desired by its team customer.
The current fashion cycle, which I've been describing as shifting more into casual, plays into Journeys strength with a nicely diversified assortment.
However, for this back-to-school, performance was strong in several categories across both casual and fashion athletic.
Nine of the top 10 brands experienced year-over-year growth in the quarter.
In addition, the in-person back-to-school also drove a big pickup in non-footwear sales, like backpacks, with non-footwear up over 50%.
With consumers willing to spend more for full-priced items, coupled with higher footwear ASPs, Journeys also experienced a nice lift in gross margins.
Direct sales held on to most of last year's very strong gains as Journeys increased social media and digital advertising, driving an almost 30% increase in online conversion versus two-year-ago results.
Recent market research validated that our strategies are further building the strength of the Journeys brand as Journeys share of teen footwear purchases and likelihood to be considered as a go-to place for shoes have both increased nicely since the last time the research was conducted.
We were also very pleased with Schuh's back-to-school performance as Q3 constant currency sales increased almost 20% above pre-pandemic sales.
Although students attended school in person last year, this year, shoppers increasingly return to physical retail, and our store teams drove higher conversion and more multi-sales on the best traffic of the year.
The return to stores did not impede the growth of online with direct sales notching large gains on top of last year's meaningful growth as the e-commerce channel more than doubled on a two-year basis.
Fueling this growth were several back-to-school key marketing campaigns and increased spending.
The fashion trends driving Schuh's business are largely the same ones driving Journeys, and several of Schuh's top 10 brands experienced growth in the quarter as well.
Additionally, Schuh's success managing through COVID strengthened its key vendor partnerships, boding well for the future with even better access to products.
Turning now to our branded side.
Our plan to reimagine Johnston & Murphy for a more casual, more comfortable post-pandemic environment is delivering tangible results.
Hardest hit by COVID, J&M is tracking well ahead of its turnaround goals.
Sales improved further in Q3, both online and in stores but are still below two-year-ago levels due to the extended delays of return to the office and lower inventories from supply chain disruption.
Delayed deliveries and much stronger-than-expected demand put J&M's inventory almost 50% below two-year-ago levels.
We are especially pleased with the performance of J&M's new athletically inspired casual product.
Casual footwear now makes up more than 70% of DTC footwear product sales with casual athletic increasing 120% versus last year.
J&M's marketing strategy in which we highlight innovation and technology features new products such as the bags, which was presented in the September advertising campaign and resulted in an 80% sell-through by the end of the month.
In addition, J&M's apparel business, highlighted by printed woven shirts and knits, increased by over 30% versus two years ago, endorsing efforts to position J&M as a modern lifestyle brand with broader consumer reach.
Rounding out the discussion, Licensed Brands, unfortunately, saw the biggest challenges from supply chain disruption, which led, among other things, to much higher-than-expected freight costs.
On a positive note, there was strong demand for both Levi's and Dockers footwear in value and full-price channels, which positions the business for improved profitability and supply challenges subside.
Turning now to the current quarter.
We have trend-right assortments and are well-prepared for the holiday season, which many will celebrate together for the first time in two years.
We were very pleased with our results in November, as sales tracked nicely ahead of pre-pandemic levels, and the boot season is off to a good start with boots as a key part of our fourth quarter mix.
For the Black Friday weekend itself, we were also pleased with the results.
While supply chain issues will continue to require close management, we have taken many actions to best prepare our businesses to meet our holiday sales expectations.
Given the recovery and confidence we have, we are returning to giving guidance.
We expect adjusted earnings for fiscal '22 to be between $6.40 and $6.90 per share.
We regard this guidance as a range, but somewhere close to the middle reflects our best current belief of where we would come out, representing an increase of about 45% over fiscal '20.
Tom will give more guidance details later in the call.
Our footwear-focused strategy is delivering results.
COVID has provided the real opportunity to transform our business at a more rapid rate and we are on a very good pace delivering growth and improved operating margins and EPS.
This new direction leverages our strong direct-to-consumer capabilities across footwear retail and brands and the synergies between platforms.
Driving this strategy are six strategic pillars that emphasize continued investment in digital and omnichannel, deepening consumer insights, driving product innovation, reshaping our cost base, and pursuing synergistic acquisitions, all to transform our businesses and exceed the expectations of today's consumer whose needs have advanced.
I'd like to give a brief update about some of the work underway.
We have rolled out at Johnston & Murphy in the U.S., new point-of-sale hardware and software, along with new tablets advancing efforts to further digitize our stores and enhance the omnichannel shopping experience.
For consumers, tablets allow easier access to the full merchandise assortment anywhere in our network.
Mobile checkout allows consumers to skip the checkout line.
The new software enables new payment methods like Venmo, and we are able to upgrade our clienteling efforts.
For employees, the new technology creates efficiencies across in-store tasks, such as visual merchandising and new hire onboarding.
After the holidays, we will roll out this technology at Journeys and will benefit from these capabilities in our next fiscal year.
Journeys research shows that while our digitally native Gen Z customer interacts with us across several digital touchpoints, up to 75% intend to make their purchases in-store, requiring investment to provide a compelling store experience.
Journeys also brought online a bespoke e-commerce packing module with carton on-demand capabilities, which is helping speed fulfillment of online orders during this peak holiday period and keep up with a much higher digital demand.
An added benefit is we are able to keep our stores well stocked for in-person shopping.
Finally, Journeys piloted on its website and pleased with the conversion results plans to roll out augmented reality software, which enables customers to virtually try on and visualize what a pair of shoes would look like on their feet.
Building deeper consumer insights is another pillar where Journeys is dedicating substantial effort starting with first-party data.
Our methods for capturing first-party data and being able to identify Journeys' customers continue to improve.
Because of the trusted relationships we have with our team, consumer, and their parents, the efforts of our people to collect customer information in stores, combined with our notable online growth, has improved visibility.
And we're currently able to identify 80% of Journeys' customers.
Identified customers enter the Journeys' marketing ecosystem and depending on their preferred method of communication receive a combination of digital, email, SMS, social, and direct mail marketing.
In parallel, we're in the process of moving our customer database in-house, cleansing our existing data, and populating a data lake.
Along with the customer segmentation from our primary research, this will enable us to invest in differentiated marketing content that drives consumer engagement, whether we're speaking with the consumer who love shoes and wants to stand out or the consumer who cares a lot about fitting in and wearing shoes their friends were.
In a fragmented industry and knowing our teams enjoy wearing a variety of footwear brands, our aim is to drive loyalty, further consolidate their purchases and take a larger share of our customers' closets.
Touching now on ongoing initiatives of giving back to our communities.
In the fall, Journeys ramped up efforts across North America in partnership with a nonprofit candidate, Journeys employees in 73 cities came together to build and donate 1,500 skateboards to underserved use.
It was the largest employee-driven giveback campaign in our history, with more high-impact events to come.
We're advancing our ESG program on this and on other fronts, with the key milestone being the start of an enterprisewide carbon footprint assessment as we work toward publishing a comprehensive ESG report next year.
I'm continually inspired by the drive and the dedication of our people and saw so many examples over Black Friday weekend, as you're all going the extra mile to serve our customers so well.
We continue to execute well on our strategy.
Third quarter results exceeded our expectations in pre-pandemic fiscal year '20 levels.
We achieved better-than-expected sales, margins, and SG&A leverage, all on significantly lower inventory levels.
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to remind you, we believe that comparing to our pre-pandemic fiscal '20, two years ago provides the more difficult and often most meaningful assessment of our business.
However, when comparing to fiscal year '20, keep in mind how our strategy has changed our business.
E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales along with wholesale sales for licensed brands.
These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expenses and the expansion of our wholesale volume.
However, this should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses.
While these changes are reshaping the P&L, they have a net positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital-intensive business model.
In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was $601 million, up 12% compared to fiscal '20.
Journeys grew 7% while Schuh grew 17% on a constant currency basis, and we doubled our licensed brands business.
Regarding J&M, we are pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing.
We were 8% below fiscal year '20 levels, and we continue to narrow the gap.
From a channel perspective, we experienced increases in all channels.
E-commerce was up 79% to fiscal year '20 and accounted for 18% of total retail sales, up from 11% in fiscal year '20.
With stores opened 99% of the possible days during the quarter, we are going back to providing comparable sales information versus last year for the stores open in both periods.
On a year-over-year basis, Journeys and Schuh drove positive overall comps of 15% and 23%, respectively, while J&M comps were positive 77%.
We were very pleased with gross margins, which were up 210 basis points to last year and flat at 49.2% versus two years ago.
Strong full-price selling and price increases offset the channel mix impact of increased e-commerce and wholesale and increased logistics costs.
Increased logistics costs put approximately 70 basis points of pressure on Q3 gross margin were the greatest drag in our branded businesses.
Journeys gross margin was up 140 basis points to fiscal year '20, driven by more full-price selling and higher footwear ASPs.
While Schuh's gross margin was down 180 basis points to fiscal year '20 due to a higher e-com mix and higher shipping expenses.
J&M's gross margin was up 230 basis points to fiscal year '20, benefiting from strong full-price selling, which also drove the release of slow-moving inventory reserves.
For J&M, additional logistics costs put 240 basis points of pressure on J&M's Q3 margins.
Finally, licensed brands gross margin was down 150 basis points to fiscal year '20, as we experienced 740 basis points of pressure on Q3 margins from additional logistics costs, which more than offset margin improvements in the business.
Adjusted SG&A expense was 41.6%, a 260 basis point improvement compared to fiscal '20 as we leverage from higher revenue and ongoing actions to manage expenses.
In addition, we experienced leverage in selling salaries and depreciation, partially offset by deleverage in marketing expenses.
As part of the SG&A discussion, I would like to provide a brief update on our $25 million to $30 million cost savings initiative.
I'm pleased to report we have identified the full amount of the target for this fiscal year.
A significant portion of the savings is from rent reductions with the remainder in several areas, including travel, conventions, inter-store freight, compensation, and other overheads.
The full effect of these savings will be realized by the end of fiscal year '23.
These savings are part of the ongoing multiyear effort of reshaping our cost structure by improving store channel profitability.
Regarding rent reductions, year to date through Q3, we have negotiated 129 renewals and achieved a 19% reduction in rent expense in North America on a straight-line basis.
This was on top of a 22% reduction or 123 renewals last year.
These renewals are for an even shorter term, averaging approximately two years compared to the three-year average we have seen in recent years.
With 40% of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this remains a key priority.
In summary, third quarter adjusted operating income was $45.2 million, a 7.5% operating margin compared to $26.7 million or 5% for fiscal year '20.
This quarter's profitability provides strong evidence of the operating margin expansion opportunity achievable with our footwear-focused strategy.
Our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 23%.
Turning now to the balance sheet.
Q3 total inventory was down 28% compared to fiscal '20 on sales that were up 12%.
As we remain vigilant in keeping pace with consumer demand in the face of delivery delays.
Our strong net cash position of $267 million and our confidence in the business enabled us to repurchase 522,000 shares of stock for $30.6 million at an average price of $58.71 per share.
We currently have $59 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Regarding capital allocation, our first priority is to invest in the business then continued to return cash to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases.
Capital expenditures were $15 million, and depreciation and amortization was $10 million.
We closed five stores during the third quarter to end the quarter with 1,434 total stores.
Now, turning to our outlook.
Given the recovery and confidence we have, we are returning to providing annual guidance.
Based on the strength of our performance this year to date, current Q4 visibility, and expectations for a more normal holiday selling season, we expect fiscal year '22 sales to grow 9% to 11% compared to the pre-pandemic fiscal year '20.
For adjusted earnings, we expect a range of $6.40 to $6.90 per share.
Our best current expectation is that earnings will be near the midpoint of this range, an increase of 45% over fiscal year '20 pre-pandemic levels.
Note that our full year guidance does not anticipate any further significant supply chain disruptions nor increased negative consumer or economic impact from COVID, including new COVID variants.
Although our plan going forward is not to provide quarterly guidance, given the current timing of restarting formal guidance, we would like to provide insights into Q4.
Note that all the comparisons we make are to pre-pandemic fiscal '20 Q4.
Implicit in the annual guidance is an expectation for Q4 sales growth versus fiscal '20 at the midpoint to be in the mid-single digits.
Q4 adjusted earnings per share would range from $2.22 to $2.72 per share.
And again, our best current expectation is for earnings to be near the midpoint of this range.
We expect gross margin rates for Q4 to be relatively flat versus fiscal year '20 levels with a possible 30 basis point swing in either direction.
We believe the promotional environment will remain favorable, and this range represents the degree of full-price selling we could achieve.
Similar to Q3, we expect channel mix as well as increased logistics costs to pressure gross margins.
Increased logistics costs are expected to pressure gross margins by 130 basis points and will offset to some extent these improvements in full-price selling.
We expect Q4 adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the range of 180 to 200 basis points compared to fiscal year '20.
This is driven primarily by increased advertising and marketing costs, particularly in brand advertising and digital marketing related to cost per click and higher performance-based compensation associated with the expected improvement in annual results, partially offset by leverage in occupancy cost.
As a reminder, fiscal year '20 Q4 performance-based compensation was relatively low, and this year's level reflects the improved performance that we have experienced on a year-over-year basis.
One more factor worth mentioning on the Q4 SG&A rate is we are not expecting the same amount of onetime government relief or rent abatements we experienced in Q3 this year or last year in Q4.
Our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the remainder of the fiscal year, which results in Q4 weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 14.3 million.
Furthermore, for Q4, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 28%.
In summary, this all results in an expected Q4 operating margin below FY '20 levels in large part driven by cost pressures unique to the fourth quarter this year.
We have the right team and the right strategy to continue to drive shareholder value.
","Genesco reported strong third-quarter performance, exceeding expectations and pre-pandemic levels. Total revenue grew 25% to $601 million, driven by store sales, which rose 30% year-over-year despite traffic still being below pre-pandemic levels. Journeys and Schuh, Genesco's retail concepts, led the growth, with sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels and digital sales continuing to increase. Branded concepts, including Johnston & Murphy (J&M) and Licensed Brands, also contributed to the positive results. J&M, in particular, saw progress in its turnaround strategy, with improved sales and the successful launch of new athletically inspired products. For the full year, Genesco expects adjusted earnings of $6.40 to $6.90 per share, representing an increase of approximately 45% over fiscal 2020. The company cited its ongoing footwear-focused strategy, improved gross margins, and cost management initiatives as key drivers of its success."
WNC_q1_2021.txt,"A couple of items before we get started.
I'll now hand it off to Brent for his highlights.
I'd like to start by mentioning how pleased we were with our first quarter results.
The broader operating environment has been unusual to say the least.
But we'll touch more on that in a minute.
I'd like to highlight the dedication and intense focus our team demonstrated in delivering solid quarterly performance.
First quarter operating profit and earnings per share came in above our expectations as we executed on the manufacturing side, while continuing to tightly manage our overall cost structure.
Indicators for our core transportation, logistics and distribution markets continue to be remarkably strong.
Record spot rates and expectations for continued increases in contract rates are indicative of a robust consumer demand and capital spending paired with already strained industry capacity.
All types of transportation solutions are in high demand as we begin 2021, and I'll call it our final mile truck body business because of core correction in FMP's markets during 2020 was more severe than we would have expected during non-pandemic circumstances, and we're optimistic that the bounce back is going to be summerly strong.
Indications from our large leasing customers is that demand has returned from small and medium-sized business segments of the market that they serve so effectively.
Their rental businesses have also benefited as fleets scramble for equipment as well.
We believe these trends have staying power as the pandemic has clearly accelerated changes that were already under way in transportation, logistics and distribution, and we feel good about the demand environment as we look forward to this year and beyond.
We'll now talk about the labor and supply chain situation.
Robust industrial and consumer demand across the broader manufacturing landscape has created imbalances throughout an array of manufacturing supply chains, leading to aggressive increases in the price of materials as well as further compounding labor availability across the country.
I'm not aware of any manufacturer that's been immune to these issues.
And although we have introduced effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact within Wabash, we also feel the result in headwinds rising from those labor availability and material cost increases.
Hiring remains a challenge.
And after a relatively successful fourth quarter, our intake of new team members was less than desired during the first quarter and reflected of the general reality of the U.S., labor market.
We will continue to pursue additional manufacturing talent throughout 2021 as we work to meet our 2021 customer demand and prepare for our 2022 market reality.
And our guidance is the reality that integrating additional manufacturing talent impacts overall productivity in the near term.
This is just a simple reality of the situation.
The other reality is that the bulk of this impact will not carry over into 2022.
It is fair to say that supply chains were already stressed heading into this year, and we had some unique Quarter one weather events to say the least, that compounded supply chain issues and heavy winter storms impacted production; both with ourselves and our suppliers.
This did impact our final mile manufacturing in Texas, disrupted basic flow of commerce for an extended period of time and significantly impacted chemical related production across many industries; all adding to the stressed supply chain, which we feel in terms of increased disruption and further increases in material costs.
The cost of commodities and semi-finish components has reacted strongly to the current manufacturing environment, constraints in basic feedstock and lack of labor availability, already elevating -- already elevated heading into the year, cost of un-hedged inputs have continued to rise which is why despite our earnings per share beat in Q1, we have maintained our prior earnings per share guidance.
As I mentioned when referencing market conditions, our products remain high in demand with our customers.
In particular, our molded structural composite technology is entering a new phase of market adoption, and we're moving into our next phase of modest MSC, molded structural composite technology capacity additions for 2022.
As we mentioned on a prior call, continued high demand for our current dry and refrigerated products, coupled with product innovation opportunities being brought forward by the structural changes made to our product innovation and technology team means that we are in need of manufacturing capacity to capture the full value of innovation in these traditional product markets.
In support, we will be committing new and additional resources into our product development and launch team to further scale and accelerate the introduction of new engineered solutions and our entry into new product and customer markets.
As we have now organized our commercial organization around our dynamic customer base, we're in the early stages of creating the appropriate conditions to leverage new technologies across our industry, leading first the final mile product portfolio to extend our competitive advantage with key customers.
With this evolving landscape, we see real opportunity to grow in our markets and grow the shared value created with our employees, our customers and our shareholders.
Given the opportunity ahead of us, being facilitated by strategic changes to our organizational structure and the ability to leverage flexible manufacturing across product lines, I can think of few opportunities more beneficial to our long-term shareholders than reinvesting in our business to support our future organic growth.
Case in point is our backlog through the first quarter.
It's typical for Q1 backlog to decline sequentially after we booked large deals in the fourth quarter of the previous year.
This year, new orders get paced with our shipment activity during the quarter as we saw strong demand for our non van business, which, again, is sold out for 2021 and obviously unable to book new orders for the year.
This level of demand for diversified products and final mile was expected given our customer conversations heading into the year.
But it's always nice to see the committed customer orders come through.
As we look to the future, demand for Wabash engineered solutions continues to grow in a manner that requires us to act on our ability to satisfy them.
As I previously mentioned, we are maintaining our prior guidance.
We are very pleased with how our demand environment has taken shape in 2021 and its extension into 2022 and beyond.
We expected labor to be a challenge, and we were not disappointed on that.
We remain on track to ramp our total man capacity to enter 2022 in a very strong manner.
However, I would say the rise of material cost has been greater than anything we could have reasonably expected, given that we are in uncharted territory with all-time highs in a number of commodities.
What I'm pleased to see is that we have taken immediate decisive action to recover a large portion of those costs and manage in other ways to mitigate the impact far beyond Wabash's performance of the past.
As the world begins to return to something that resembles normalcy, we are optimistic that the labor and supply chain challenges of 2021 will normalize over time and leave us with a less challenging operating environment in 2022, while freight growth remains strong and customer demand continues to be robust.
We are, therefore, excited about what the future holds as many of the structural and process-based changes that we've made to our organization and having the intended outcome of synergistically furthering our ability to execute on our strategy.
Our improved ability to operate and the growing reality of the established vision of enabling our customers to succeed with breakthrough ideas and solutions that help them move everything in the first to final mile is now an active play.
We are executing the plan.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mike for his comments.
I'd like to start off by giving some color on our first quarter financial results.
On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenue was $392 million, with consolidated new trailer shipments of 9670 units during the quarter.
Gross margin was 12% of sales during the quarter, while operating margin came in at nine -- at 2.9%.
As Brent mentioned, these margins were somewhat above our expectations for the quarter as a result of continued strong cost control.
Additionally, I'd like to reference the 2020 initiatives to lower our cost structure by $20 million, of which $15 million was SG&A.
Because after the first quarter, we lose clean SG&A comparisons from last year as furloughs and other temporary cost control measures were implemented beginning in the second quarter of 2020.
SG&A was lower year-over-year in Q1 by $4.7 million.
Additionally, about 25% of our savings initiatives are being realized as reductions in cost of goods sold.
So we are pleased that these structural savings are more than holding driving a significant ramp in volumes.
Operating EBITDA for the first quarter was $26 million or 6.7% of sales.
Finally, for the quarter, net income was $3.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
From a segment perspective, commercial trailer products generated revenue of $248 million and operating income of $20.9 million.
Average selling price for new trailers within CTP was roughly $26,000, which represents a 7.5% decrease versus Q1 of 2020 as a result of meaningfully higher mix of pump trailers, where prices tend to be significantly lower than 53-foot driving trailers.
Diversified Products Group generated $74 million of revenue in the quarter with operating income of $6.1 million and segment EBITDA margin that hit 14.3%; which was the best level since 2016.
Average selling price for new trailers within DPG was roughly $72,000, which represents a 4% increase versus Q1 of 2020.
Final mile products generated $77 million of revenue as this business ramps to meet stronger market demand.
FMP experienced an operating loss of $4 million, which was expected in our prior quarterly guidance.
Because of FMP's heavy and increasing amortization burden, EBITDA provides a more stable measure of progress and more relevant measure of impact on operating cash generation.
We are encouraged that FMP's EBITDA moved back to positive territory during the first quarter with a gain of $621,000 as improved volumes allowed us to better leverage our fixed cost during the quarter.
We expect FMP EBITDA generation to improve in the second half of 2021 as the business installs additional capacity to continue meeting customer demand through the on-boarding of new employees.
Year-to-date operating cash flow was negative $22 million.
We invested roughly $4 million via capital expenditures, leaving negative $27 million of free cash flow.
Although our payables widened out considerably, receivables and inventory combined to have a meaningful impact on working capital as we expected during the quarter.
We continued to show working capital efficiency in Q1 as part of our One Wabash transformation, and we are well on our way to achieving a capital-efficient ramp in 2021.
We continue to target $35 million to $40 million in capital spending for 2021.
With regard to our balance sheet, our liquidity or cash plus available borrowings as of March 31 was $337 million of $169 million of cash and $168 million of availability on our revolving credit facility; which is fully untapped.
For capital allocation during the first quarter, we utilized $18.2 million to repurchase shares, pay our quarterly dividend of $4.3 million and invested $4.2 million in capital projects.
Furthermore, in April, we made a voluntary $15 million payment on our term loan.
Our capital allocation focus continues to prioritize reinvestment in the business through growth capex while also maintaining our dividend and evaluating opportunities for debt reduction and share repurchases.
Moving on to the outlook for 2021.
We expect revenue of approximately $1.95 to $2.05 billion.
CTP is right back to bumping up against capacity constraints, while FMP is fielding plenty of demand with labor being the primary gating factor.
SG&A as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the lower six range for the full year, and we remain on track to sustain the reduction in our cost structure by $20 million relative to 2019, with around $15 million of that cost out, residing within SG&A.
Operating margins are expected to be in the high 3% range at the midpoint.
Turning to the second quarter.
We expect revenue in the range of $450 million to $480 million, up 17% at the midpoint sequentially versus Q1, with new trailer shipments of 10,500 to 11,500 as we look to keep increasing production throughout the year.
Given our expectations for operating margins in the low 3% range in Q2, this implies earnings per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.15 for the quarter.
In closing, I'm pleased with our results to start the year.
Ramping manufacturing is never easy, and this year certainly comes with unique challenges for ourselves and other manufacturers.
But we see it as a great opportunity to scale up and ensure that we're firing on all cylinders as customers increasingly become focused on 2022 and what we expect to be a smoother operating environment that will allow us to return the company revenues to levels approaching what was recorded in 2018 and 2019.
The company is just beginning to enter into these exciting times as the structure of our organization is in the early days of achieving its intended purpose of advancing our strategy, which emphasizes organic growth, leveraging our industry-leading first to final mile portfolio.
","Despite the challenges of a robust manufacturing landscape and supply chain disruptions, Wabash National (WAB) reported solid Q1 performance with operating profit and EPS exceeding expectations. Demand for their products remains high, particularly for their molded structural composite (MSC) technology, leading to plans for additional MSC capacity expansion in 2022. While material and labor availability issues have impacted costs, the company has taken steps to mitigate these impacts. Wabash National's guidance for 2021 revenue is $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, with operating margins expected to be in the high 3% range at the midpoint. The company is optimistic about the future as demand for their engineered solutions continues to grow and expects to return to revenue levels similar to 2018 and 2019 in a normalized operating environment in 2022."
VGR_q3_2020.txt,"Ron Bernstein, Senior Advisor to Liggett Vector Brands, will join us during the question and answers.
Nick will then summarize the performance of the tobacco business.
As of September 30, 2020, Vector Group maintained sufficient liquidity, with cash and cash equivalents of $451 million, including cash of $76 million at Douglas Elliman and $148 million at Liggett, and investment securities and investment partnership interests with a fair market value of $174 million.
Now turning to Vector Group's operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020.
For the three months ended September 30, 2020, Vector Group's revenues were $547.8 million, compared to $504.8 million in the 2019 period.
In addition to increases in revenue in both the Tobacco segment and Douglas Elliman, the 2020 revenues include $20.5 million from the sale of a real estate investment in The Hamptons.
Net income attributed to Vector Group for the third quarter of 2020 was $38.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $36 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2019.
The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $103.3 million, compared to $73.7 million in the prior year.
Adjusted net income was $38.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $36.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the 2019 period.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Vector Group revenues were $1.45 billion and were flat when compared to $1.46 billion in the 2019 period.
Our Tobacco segment reported an increase of $63.9 million in revenues, and our Real Estate segment reported a decline in revenues of $80 million.
While our Real Estate segment reported increases in revenues in the first and third quarters, the year-to-date decline reflects the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Douglas Elliman's results in the second quarter of 2020 as well as an unusual year-over-year comparison because of the acceleration of real estate closings in New York City in the 2019 second quarter.
This acceleration occurred in anticipation of the increase in the New York state mansion tax on residential real estate on July 1, 2019.
Net income attributed to the Vector Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was $60.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $90.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $240 million, compared to $206.9 million in the prior year.
Adjusted net income was $106.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to $92.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the 2019 period.
For Douglas Elliman's results for the three months ended September 30, 2020, we reported $208 million in revenues, net income of $11.8 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million, compared to $201.2 million in revenues, net income of $1.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2019.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Douglas Elliman reported $506.5 million in revenues, a net loss of $62.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million, compared to $606 million of revenues, net income of $6.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $11 million in the first nine months of 2019.
Douglas Elliman's net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, included pre-tax and noncash impairment charges of $58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.3 million.
When compared to both the second quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2019, Douglas Elliman's third quarter closed sales improved significantly in markets complementary to New York City, including The Hamptons as well as in Palm Beach, Miami, Aspen and Los Angeles.
Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant effect on the New York City real estate market.
To address the impact of COVID-19, in April 2020 Douglas Elliman reduced personnel by 25% and began consolidating some offices and reducing other administrative expenses.
These expense reduction initiatives resulted in a decline in Douglas Elliman's third quarter 2020 operating and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring charges, of approximately $17.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 and $39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
We believe these initiatives have and will continue to provide long-term upside to Vector Group stockholders.
Furthermore, fourth quarter cash receipts have continued to strengthen when compared to the third quarter in all regions, including New York City.
During the third quarter, Liggett continued its strong year-to-date tobacco performance, with revenue increases and margin growth contributing to a 25% increase in tobacco adjusted operating income.
As noted on previous calls, we are well into the income growth phase of our Eagle 20's business strategy and remain very pleased with the results to date.
Our market-specific retail programs have proven successful, and we remain optimistic about Eagle 20's increasing profit contributions and long-term potential.
Our results also reflect the resilience of Pyramid, which continues to deliver substantial profit and market presence for the company.
Pyramid has strong distribution and is currently sold in approximately 98,000 stores nationwide.
I will now turn to the combined tobacco financials for Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenues were $318.9 million and $918.4 million, respectively, compared to $303.3 million and $854.5 million for the corresponding 2019 periods.
Tobacco adjusted operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was $91.6 million and $240.2 million, respectively, compared to $73 million and $202.5 million for the corresponding periods a year ago.
Liggett's increase in third quarter earnings resulted primarily from higher gross profit margins associated with increased net pricing and lower per-unit Master Settlement Agreement expense.
The lower per-unit MSA expense reflects stronger U.S. industry cigarette volumes in 2020, which has increased the value of our market share exemption under the MSA.
Similar to other consumer product categories, cigarette industry volumes have outperformed recent historical trends and have benefited from increased consumer demand related to changes in the underlying cigarette purchasing patterns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for the third quarter increased by 1.1%, while Liggett's wholesale shipments declined by 2.2%, compared to the third quarter in 2019.
For the third quarter, Liggett's retail shipments declined by 1.1% from 2019, while industry retail shipments increased 1.7% during the same period.
Liggett's retail share in the third quarter declined slightly, to 4.2%.
The modest decline in Liggett's third quarter year-over-year retail share was anticipated, with Eagle 20's volume growth slowing due to increased net pricing.
This is consistent with our income growth strategy for Eagle 20's, which began in the second half of 2018.
Eagle 20's is now priced in the upper tier of the U.S. deep discount segment.
Nonetheless, Eagle 20's retail volume for the third quarter increased by approximately 2% compared to the 2019 period, and it remains the third largest discount brand in the U.S. and is currently being sold in approximately 84,000 stores nationwide.
The continued growth of Eagle 20's despite increased pricing also reinforces the effectiveness of our long-term strategy to continue to build volume and margin for our business using well-positioned discount brands providing value to adult smokers.
With that in mind, and after identifying volume growth opportunities in the U.S. deep discount segment, in August we expanded the distribution of our Montego brand by 10 states, primarily in the Southeast.
Prior to August, Montego was sold in targeted markets in only four states.
Montego will be competitively priced in the growing deep discount segment, and we will take a measured approach with further expansion.
Montego represented about 6.8% of Liggett's volume for the third quarter of 2020 and 5.6% of Liggett's volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
To date, we are pleased with the initial wholesale, retail and consumer response to Montego, and I will provide further updates in the coming quarters on our progress.
In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter 2020 performance, particularly in light of the current macroeconomic environment.
Our results continue to validate our market strategy and reflect our competitive advantages within the deep discount segment, including our broad base of distribution, consumer-focused programs and the executional capabilities of our sales force.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on generating incremental operating income from the strong sales and distribution base of both Pyramid and Eagle 20's.
Finally, while we are always subject to industry and general market risks, we remain confident that we have effective programs to keep our business operating efficiently, while supporting market share and profit growth.
Vector Group has strong cash reserves and has consistently increased its tobacco unit volume and profits and has taken the necessary steps to position its real estate business for future success.
We are pleased with our long-standing history of paying a quarterly cash dividend.
It remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy.
While we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter, it is our expectation that our policy will continue well into the future.
","Vector Group's Q3 2020 performance was positive, with revenue increasing to $547.8 million, primarily due to growth in both the Tobacco and Douglas Elliman segments. Net income climbed to $38.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. The company's liquidity remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $451 million. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on Douglas Elliman's revenue for the first nine months of 2020, the segment implemented cost-cutting measures that resulted in a reduction of $39.8 million in expenses compared to the previous year. The Tobacco segment reported revenue increases and margin growth, leading to a 25% surge in adjusted operating income. Liggett's third-quarter results reflect higher gross profit margins and lower per-unit Master Settlement Agreement expenses. Notably, Eagle 20's volume grew by approximately 2% compared to 2019 despite increased net pricing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the company's income growth strategy. Vector Group is confident in its operating outlook, citing its strong cash reserves, consistent growth in tobacco volume and profits, and initiatives to position the real estate business for long-term success. The company remains committed to its quarterly cash dividend policy."
EAT_q1_2022.txt,"As many of you know, we pre-released limited results for the first quarter, ahead of our investor day hosted here in Dallas on October 20.
During our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.
And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.
It's good to be back with you all again.
It was great seeing some of you in Dallas and many of you virtually during our investor day a couple of weeks ago.
What you should have taken away from that was this, we're very optimistic about where the business is going.
We're managing for long-term success and we're confident in the strength of our brands and the levers we have yet to pull to continue to grow the business.
From a top-line perspective, we're sitting in a good spot.
Sales numbers are solid and traffic numbers are extremely good.
Our near-term challenge is not creating demand but rather it's working through the latest pandemic-driven staffing and supply chain issues that are impacting our cost structure.
As you know, there are -- these are the same challenges impacting the industry as well as much as the economy.
But after 40 years in this business, I'll take managing costs over searching for sales and traffic any day.
Those are good problems to solve because they're largely within our control.
Our operators are working extremely hard every day to train our new team members, deliver great guest experiences and tying up the middle of the P&L.
We've taken some additional price during the quarter to help offset our structural labor and cost of sales increases.
As I mentioned during investor day, we're not going to price to buy a quarter.
But as we closely monitor the issues, we've layered in incremental pricing to offset what we believe are the structural labor and cost of sales increases.
And Joe will give you more detail on that.
Moving forward, if we discover that what we thought was transitory, it turns out to be more structural, we'll deal with that from a pricing perspective with a disciplined approach that protects our traffic performance and keeps our brands strong.
We know we have pricing power if we need it, particularly in the delivery in virtual brand channels and we're committed to maintaining our margins and our business model.
And that's what we wanted you to hear.
We're also working hard to remove transitory costs from the system with full recognition that the headwinds are notable and persistent, especially around labor.
And while it takes some time, we're confident with the progress we're making and we will significantly reduce these costs by the back half of the year.
The spike in turnover we experienced during the quarter created short-term pressure on the business as we trained our new team members to run our systems.
The good news is we are quickly building staff and have as many team members now as we did pre-COVID, though there are markets that are still not fully staffed, which is limiting their capacity.
This is particularly true in the Midwest, where it's taking longer to reach these optimum levels.
The impact of these staffing challenges cost us 3% to 4% in first quarter in sales, which we view as upside as we -- as we get those restaurants staffed and trained over the coming months.
Our top talent is engaged in these markets to solve these issues as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, the base business is strong, especially where dining rooms are fully open.
When we look at the totality of the business, Chili's is running positive sales and traffic and maintaining a sizable traffic gap to the industry, most recently at 9% on a two-year look as measured by NAFTrack.
And we've got sales leverage around virtual brands and deliveries that we're holding in reserve until our operations teams are stabilized and fully trained.
And while the last quarter was more challenging than we expected, we're making great progress and my expectation is we will end the year strong.
And as we shared with you during investor day, we've got exciting initiatives and innovation we're working on and we're confident in our future growth opportunities.
Let me continue our prepared comments by providing some additional insight to the first quarter results and then share some guidance on our current expectations for the balance of fiscal year 2022.
During first quarter, top-line sales performed well and outpaced pre-COVID levels by a very respectable amount despite COVID-related constraints.
For the first quarter, Brinker reported total revenues of $860 million with consolidated comp sales of 17%.
Keeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic up 11% for the quarter, a 9% beat versus the industry on a two year look.
The top-line increase resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, up from $0.28 in the previous fiscal year.
It will come as no surprise, our most significant challenge during the quarter came in the form of industrywide headwinds from both commodity costs and labor-related spend, which negatively impacted our margins and bottom-line flow through.
We experienced commodity inflation in the mid-single-digit range, with significant price from pork and chicken driving the increase.
As Wyman mentioned, with a greater-than-normal influx of new team members, we experienced outsized costs in training and overtime.
We do consider the portion of these costs above our normal operating levels to be transitory, approximately 130 basis points in the quarter, 60 of which are incremental training and overtime costs.
I Anticipate these costs working their way out of the system over the course of the next couple of quarters.
In the near term, I expect a significant portion of these transitory costs to remain in the system for the second quarter.
We are taking thoughtful incremental price increases to help offset these higher costs.
Our third price action of this fiscal year is scheduled with our next Chili's menu update in two weeks.
Following this increase, Chili's will be carrying a total of 3% of incremental price compared to last year.
Of course, the mid-quarter price action will not fully impact the total price reported for the quarter.
Due to the timing of price actions and the fact that Maggiano's will evaluate its menu pricing after the holiday season, we expect the second quarter blended Brinker price to be closer to 2%.
Our cash flow for the first quarter remained strong, with cash from operating activities of $40 million and EBITDA of $69 million.
When compared to first quarter last year, our strength in operating performance and lower level of outstanding debt have combined to improve our balance sheet and leverage position.
Our total funded debt leverage was 2.6 times and our lease-adjusted leverage ended the quarter at 3.7 times.
As indicated during our recent investor day, we are targeting to move these leverage ratios below two times and three times respectively over the course of the next two years.
Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal year '22.
We provided some guidance metrics for certain items during our last call and we are reiterating those levels as of this report.
Specifically, annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and annual adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80.
This incorporates our current view of the casual dining operating environment, which assumes continuing challenges in the near term, especially related to supply chain and labor issues.
This guidance, both reiterated and new, assumes no additional meaningful top-line COVID-related disruptions.
While guidance is for our fiscal year performance, I can provide some directional thoughts related to the second quarter.
With the exception of banquet sales at Maggiano's, we expect sales to exhibit closer to normal holiday seasonality, although impacted by labor shortage constraints in certain markets.
As mentioned earlier in my comments, restaurant operating margins for the second quarter will again be impacted by higher food and beverage and labor costs.
We do expect restaurant operating margin to improve when compared to both the recently completed first quarter as well as the second quarter of last year, ending the quarter at a level comparable to the pre-COVID second quarter of fiscal year '20.
Clearly, these are unique times for our industry, creating a variety of short-term challenges to work through.
Challenges we can and will solve.
We firmly believe our strategic initiatives focused on driving traffic in organic top-line growth will differentiate our performance over time with the overall benefit to our team members, our guests, and importantly, our shareholders.
","Despite staffing and supply chain challenges, Brinker reported solid top-line performance in the first quarter, with total revenues of $860 million and consolidated comp sales of 17%, driven by an 11% increase in traffic. However, headwinds from commodity costs and labor-related expenses negatively impacted margins, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34. To offset these costs, Brinker implemented price increases and projects a total price increase of 3% at Chili's following their next menu update. While transitory costs related to training and overtime are expected to improve in the next couple of quarters, the company assumes continued challenges in the near term. Despite these challenges, Brinker remains optimistic about the future, with plans to reduce leverage ratios and implement strategic initiatives to drive traffic and organic top-line growth. The company maintains its fiscal year guidance of annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80, assuming no significant top-line COVID-related disruptions."
TMO_q4_2021.txt,"So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement.
Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute premium statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Security Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We delivered another quarter of very strong results, and as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me.
Our proven growth strategy, powered by our PPI business system, continues to drive outstanding financial performance.
Customer demand is strong.
Our core business is performing very well.
We're gaining market share and we continue to play a leading role in the societal response to COVID 19.
And finally, we continue to build on our trusted partner status with our customers.
All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.
I'll get into more detail in my remarks later.
But first, let me recap the financials.
Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.7 billion.
Adjusted operating income was $3.16 billion and our adjusted operating margin was 29.5%.
Adjusted earnings per share was $6.54 per share.
Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $39.21 billion in 2021.
Adjusted operating income increased 27% to $12.14 billion.
We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points to 31%, and we delivered a 28% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $25.13 per share.
Building on the tremendous success that we had in 2020.
I'm incredibly proud of our team's stellar performance in 2021.
It's really a testament to the strength of our global team and our proven growth strategy, resulting in another year of exceptional financial results and share gains.
Let me now give you color on the results for the quarter and the year, starting with pharma and biotech, with the outstanding performance delivered growth over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year.
In addition to strong market dynamics, these results were driven by a unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID 19 vaccines and therapies.
During the year, we saw broad-based strength across our businesses in this end market, including our bioproduction, pharma services, bioscience, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel.
In academic and government, we declined in the low single digits during in the quarter against strong demand in the year-ago period and grew in the low double digits for the full year.
During the year, we saw very good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly biosciences, electron microscopy, and our research and safety market channel.
Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens during the quarter and we grew in the high teens for the full year.
During the year, we saw strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as in the research and safety market channel.
Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, Q4 revenue was 30% lower than the prior-year quarter, and revenue grew in the high single digits for the full year.
Throughout the year, the team executed really well to support customers testing needs, and in the base business, we had strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic businesses.
Before we move to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on a role in the pandemic response.
In the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in COVID 19 response-related revenue.
This was driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to strong testing demand as well as our significant role in enabling vaccine and therapy production.
Throughout 2021, we continue to operate with speed at scale to meet our customers' needs related to COVID-19 and generated total response revenue of over $9 billion, of which $2 billion were from vaccines and therapies.
I'm very proud of the role that we continue to play around the world to enable our customers and governments to fight the pandemic.
At the same time, we're executing our core business strategy incredibly well.
Let me provide an update on the progress we made in 2021 executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, as you know.
Developing high-impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.
We made outstanding progress in 2021.
Let me share a few of the highlights, starting with the first pillar.
It was a fantastic year of high-impact innovation.
In 2021, we launched a number of new products across our businesses, strengthening our industry leadership and enabling our customers to advance their important work.
In our bioproduction business, we launched a high-performer DynaDrive Single-Use Bioreactor.
Available in sizes up to 5,000 liters, this latest advancement in our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor technology brings the benefits of single-use technologies to unprecedented volumes and performance and ensures consistent scalability from pilot-scale studies through commercial production.
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we continue to innovate across life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development.
During the year, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics.
And during the fourth quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris MX, a mass detector, providing high-throughput analysis to improve the development and production of biopharmaceuticals.
In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL wafer dual-beam scanning electron microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors.
And in genetic sciences, our new Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio 7 Pro Dx real-time PCR system, launched in Q4, enables clinical testing laboratories to accelerate molecular diagnostics.
The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers.
We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets that will highlight a few examples.
To increase our capacity for single-use technology, we open new manufacturing sites in China and Singapore to serve both local and global demand from biopharma customers.
In South Korea, we continue to enhance our local capabilities with customer-focused innovation centers for both the semiconductor industry and our biopharma customers.
These additional capabilities position us really well to support our customers' needs.
The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition.
We've continued to significantly accelerate organic investments in our capabilities and added capacity to be an even better partner for our customers.
In 2021, we invested $2.5 billion in capital to meet short and long-term customer demand.
Highlights included expansion of our sterile fill/finish network, bioproduction, enzymes, nucleotide, plasmids, and lab products capacity As always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture were major factors in our success during the year.
They enable the rapid execution of our capital investments and help us find a better way every day so we can continue to bring innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, and operate with speed at scale to create even greater value for all of our stakeholders.
Turning to capital deployment, we were very active again this year, which further strengthened our customer value proposition.
We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders.
In 2021, we were very active, investing $24 billion in M&A and completing 10 transactions to further strengthen our customer value proposition.
This was highlighted by the addition of PPD, which we closed in December.
We're super excited to have our PPD colleagues as part of the company and share their expertise as we work together to enhance innovation and productivity for our pharma and biotech customers.
PPD is performing at a very high level.
The business delivered great results in 2021 and is entering 2022, with outstanding momentum significantly ahead of our original expectations at the time of the deal announcement.
The customer feedback has been extremely positive and we're excited by the pipeline of opportunities that we're building.
We're executing our proven integration methodology, which is a key element of our PPI business system to create value for all of our stakeholders.
We're well-positioned to deliver year three cost synergies of $75 million and $50 million in operating income from revenue synergies, and we're on track to deliver $40 million in cost synergies in 2022.
At the end of the year, we completed the acquisition of PeproTech, a leading provider of recombinant proteins, which is an excellent complement to our industry-leading bioscience business.
In 2021, we also returned $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.
Turning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG priorities.
I'm very proud that over the past year, we have significantly advanced our environmental, social, and governance initiatives.
Our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant.
Highlights this year include our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
This builds on our earlier goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% across our operations by 2030.
Enhancing the reporting and transparency to our expanded corporate social responsibility report and alignment of multiple ESG reporting frameworks.
And we're actively engaging in our community.
Our foundation for science, which more than 100,000 students globally to our STEM education programs.
Our goal is to make a very positive impact in the communities in which we live and work.
With that, I'd like to now review our 2022 guidance at a high level.
And then, Stephen will take you through the details.
We're significantly raising both our revenue and earnings guidance.
This increase is a result of both the strong performance of our core business and an increase in the assumption for COVID 19 testing-related revenue.
We're raising our 2022 full-year revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, which would result in 7% revenue growth over 2021.
And we're increasing our 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $1.07 to $22.43 per share.
So to summarize our key takeaways from 2021, we executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver outstanding financial performance.
Our business is performing very well and we're gaining market share.
Our exceptional performance in 2021 and momentum entering 2022 enables us to raise our outlook for 2022, and we're incredibly well-positioned for the future.
Our proven growth strategy positions us to deliver long-term core organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%.
With that, I now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson.
For the full year 2021, we delivered 17% organic growth that included 14% organic base business growth and $9.2 billion in COVID 19 response revenue.
We delivered 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and over $7 billion of free cash flow.
All while significantly investing in our company to enable a really bright future.
I'm very proud of what the team accomplished this year.
These results are significantly ahead of our prior guidance.
So let me walk you through the key elements of the beat.
We delivered $2.1 billion more revenue than included in our prior guide.
This included $1.5 billion higher COVID 19 response revenue, $375 million of revenue from the PPD acquisition, and $200 million higher based business revenue.
On our last earnings call, we de-risk testing response revenue in our guidance.
And we said that if any additional opportunities to support customers testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and follow the benefits through our P&L, and that's exactly what we did in Q4.
Then in terms of the base business, in Q4, we delivered 8% base business organic growth, which was 3% points higher than assumed in the prior guide.
This is very good performance, particularly given the four fewer selling days in the quarter.
So excellent momentum on the top line.
Our core business is on a great growth trajectory and we continue to step up and meet our customers' testing needs.
Our PPI business system enable us to generate a great pull through on the very strong revenue performance in Q4, leading to excellent adjusted earnings per share performance.
We delivered $6.54 of adjusted earnings per share in the quarter and $25.13 for the full year.
This is $1.76 ahead of our prior guide to a broad base beat to round out an outstanding year.
Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance.
Beginning with our earnings results.
And as I mentioned, we delivered $6.54 of adjusted earnings per share in the quarter.
And for the full-year adjusted earnings per share was $25.13, up 28% compared to last year.
GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $4.17.
And for the full year, 2021 GAAP earnings per share was $19.46, up 22% versus the prior year.
On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 1% year over year.
The components of our Q4 revenue increase included a 4% organic revenue decrease, a 6% contribution from acquisitions, and a headwind of 1% from foreign exchange.
And as I mentioned, the base business organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%.
For the full year, 2021 reported revenue increased 22%.
This includes 17% organic growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions, and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange.
The full-year base business organic growth was 14%.
And in 2021, we delivered $9.23 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, which includes $2 billion of vaccines and therapy support revenue.
Turning to our performance by geography.
The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior year as well as four fewer selling days in Q4 '21 versus the prior-year quarter.
For Q4, North America declined in the low teens.
Europe grew high in the single digits.
Asia Pacific and China grew in the high single digits and the rest of the world grew mid-single digits.
For the full year, North America grew low double digits.
Europe grew over 25%.
Asia-Pacific grew over 20%, including just under 20% growth in China and the rest of the world grew mid-teens.
Tend to our operational performance, Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 10% and the adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, 380 basis points lower than Q4 last year.
For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 31%, which is 130 basis points higher than 2020.
In the quarter, our PPI business system enables deliver strong volume leverage on the base business and strong productivity.
This is more than offset by the impact of lower testing response revenue and our ongoing strategic investments across our business to support our near and long-term growth.
For the full year, we drove positive volume leverage, and productivity.
We also have a favorable business mix.
This is partially offset by our strategic investments.
Moving on to the details of the P&L.
Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.5%, 340 basis points lower than Q4 last year.
And for the full year, the adjusted gross margin was 51.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin.
Adjusted SG&A in Q4, with 17.3% of revenue for the full year adjusted SG&A was 17.1% of revenue.
An improvement of 80 basis points compared to 2020.
Total R&D expense was approximately $390 million in Q4 and for the full-year R&D expenses $1.4 billion, representing growth of 19% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth.
Looking at results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $150 million, $16 million higher than Q4 last year, largely due to the PPD financing activities.
Net interest expense for the full year was $493 million, an increase of $5 million from 2020.
Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $7 million, $8 million higher than Q4 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.
For the full-year adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $38 million, which was $8 million lower than the prior year.
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.8%.
This is 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, mainly due to the different levels of pre-tax profitability year over year.
For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.6%, or 30 basis points higher than 2020.
Average diluted shares were 398 million in Q4, approximately two million lower year over year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution and for the full year, the average Dillard's shares were 397 million.
Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet.
Cash flow was another great highlight for the year.
Cash flow from operating activities in 2021 was $9.5 billion, up 15% over the prior year, and free cash flow for the year was $7 billion after investing %2.5 billion of net capital expenditure.
This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments that we're making for the long term.
During the year, we returned approximately $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we ended Q4 with $4.5 billion in cash.
Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $34.9 billion, up $13.2 billion sequentially from Q3, largely as a result of the financing activities related to the PPD acquisition.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter with 2.7 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.3 times on a net debt basis, and concluding my comments that total company performance adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, up 180 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.
So now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments.
And let me start with a few framing comments.
The scale and margin profile of our COVID 19 response revenue varies by segment, but it's been consistent throughout the year.
We continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses.
The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the response revenue in each segment does skew some of the reporters' segment margins.
And during Q4, we had four fewer selling days than the year-ago quarter.
And finally, we recently renamed the Laboratory Products segment to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition.
It's now Laboratory Products in the Biopharma Services segment.
And also going forward, we'll refer to PPD as our clinical research business within this segment.
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions.
Q4 reported revenue in the segment decreased 5% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior-year quarter.
In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses.
This was offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter.
For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 28% and organic revenue increased 23%.
Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 14%.
And adjusted operating margin was 48.2%, down 490 basis points year-over-year.
In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments.
And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 28%, and adjusted operating margin was 50%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2020.
In the analytical instrument segment, reported revenue increased 5% in Q4 and organic growth by 6%.
Growth in the segment this quarter was driven by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses.
For the full-year reported revenue in the segment increased 18% and organic revenue increased 17%.
Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points year over year.
During the quarter, we saw a favorable business mix and delivered strong volume pull through and productivity enabled by our PPI business system.
That was partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across the segment.
For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 48%, and adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 390 basis points versus 2020.
Turning to specialty diagnostics.
In Q4, reported revenue and organic revenue were both 26% lower than the year-ago quarter.
In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter.
For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 6% and organic revenue increased 5%.
Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 43% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 20.5%, down 590 basis points from the prior year.
In Q4, we drove positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System.
This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the segment.
For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points versus 2020.
Then finally, Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment.
In Q4, reported revenue in this segment increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 5%.
During Q4, we saw strong growth in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses.
And we recognized $375 million of revenue for PPG to clinical research business.
For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 21% and organic revenue increased 15%.
Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 42% and adjusted operating margin was 11.5%, which is 210 basis points higher than the prior year.
In the quarter, we drove strong productivity by our PPI Business System and saw a favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments.
For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2020.
Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance.
Before we get into the details, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about our definition of the core business, which we introduced at our Investor Day last year and noted we transitioned to it in 2022.
The core includes our base business, the vaccines and therapies response revenue, and the PPD acquisition.
Given the scale of the PPD acquisition at the core, organic growth calculation will include PPD on a full-year basis.
If you think that gives you the best view of how to have a look at the total company business and how it's performing.
For full transparency will also continue to provide total company organic growth when reporting our actual performance in '22.
So moving on to our guidance, as Marc mentioned, we're significantly increasing our full-year 2022 revenue and adjusted earnings per share outlook.
We're raising our full-year '22 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion.
And we're raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $1.07 to $22.43.
This very strong raise reflects the excellent strength of the business, and we continue to expect 8% core organic revenue growth in 2022.
Let me now provide you with additional details on the updated guidance, starting with revenue whether four elements drive the $1.5 billion raise.
$1 billion increase in the COVID 19 testing assumption, a $900 million increase for the core business, a $500 million decrease due to the change in FX rates, and a $100 million increase to reflect the PeproTech acquisition, which closed just before the year-end.
In terms of our COVID 19 testing revenue assumption, we're continuing the same de-risked approach to guidance, as is a range of outcomes for the year.
Guidance now assumes $1.75 billion in testing revenue in 2022.
There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level, and should that be the case, we're well-positioned to support customer needs.
And as we did in 2021, we'll follow the benefits of that through our P&L.
But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risk approach to the outlook.
In terms of the core revenue raise, $600 million relates to PPD and reflects the excellent strength of that business and to a lesser extent, the recent gap changes around deferred revenue measurement for acquisitions.
We now expect PPD, a new clinical research business, to deliver $6.5 billion in revenue for the full year of 2022.
This represents 8% organic growth on a full-year basis on top of the 30% growth it delivered in 2021.
And the remaining $300 million of the core revenue raise is to reflect the strong finish to 2021 by the rest of the core business.
Our core business is in great shape.
It ended 2021 with even more scale.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect that it will grow 8% organically in 2022.
To a very strong raise overall for our revenue guidance, and we will use our PPI business system to generate a strong pull through on that revenue.
And we now expect the adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022 as 20 basis points higher than what we assumed in our prior guidance.
In terms of adjusted EPS, a stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance from $21.36 to $22.43, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year.
So let me now provide you with a couple of other details in 2022 to help you with your models.
As I mentioned PPD is expected to deliver $6.5 billion of revenue and $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022.
This acquisition is now expected to contribute $1.90 to adjusted earnings per share in the year.
PeproTech is expected to deliver revenue of just over $100 million in 2022 and $0.5 of adjusted EPS.
FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $500 million in revenue of 1.3% and $0.31 from adjusted EPS.
We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13% in 2022.
We now expect the full-year net interest cost to be approximately $490 million and other income to be $10 million.
We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately 2.5 to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion.
Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion a share, buybacks that we already completed in January, and $475 million of capital return to shareholders through dividends.
We now estimate that the full-year average diluted share count will be between 395 million and 396 million shares.
And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with the modeling.
In terms of revenue dollars, the assumption in the guide is the revenue dollars are fairly linear for the year, with Q1 and Q4 being slightly higher in Q2 and Q3.
The de-risk assumption for COVID 19 testing used in this guidance assumes that this revenue is very front end loaded in the first half of the year, and then it's an assumed pandemic run-rate level of $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year.
Organic growth of the core business is expected to be fairly consistent throughout the year.
And in terms of adjusted earnings per share phasing this guidance assumes slightly more weighting toward the first half of the year than the phasing we had last year, with Q1 being about the same percentage of the full year as we had in 2021.
To conclude, we delivered another outstanding year and went great position to achieve our 2022 goals.
We're ready to take questions.
","Thermo Fisher Scientific reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. Revenue reached $10.7 billion for the quarter, with adjusted operating income of $3.16 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 29.5%. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.54. For the full year, revenue increased by 22% to $39.21 billion, adjusted operating income expanded by 27% to $12.14 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 28% to $25.13. The company's growth strategy, led by its PPI Business System, has resulted in outstanding financial performance and share gains. Key areas of growth include pharma and biotech, which contributed over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year, driven by customer demand and a unique value proposition in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.

JBL_q2_2022.txt,"To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our investor relations section.
At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's session will be posted for audio playback on our website.
These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31st, 2021, and other filings.
I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today.
To begin with, our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the war in Ukraine.
When I think about our team, along with their families, what comes to mind are words like admiration, courage, and heart.
Please know, we're in constant communication with those on the ground, and we continue to provide resources and financial assistance, as the safety and security of those in Ukraine is our top priority.
At Jabil, we're one corporate family with people located all over the world.
And despite the physical distance between us, we'll always face difficult situations together.
Q2 was another strong quarter, both top line and bottom line, driven by double-digit revenue growth year on year and exceptional execution, respectively.
Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.68 and revenue of $7.6 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase year on year.
All in all, I'm pleased with the quarter, as our performance during the first half of the year gives us positive momentum as we push toward the back half of fiscal '22 and into fiscal '23.
And when I think about a key catalyst driving our momentum, what comes to mind is the makeup of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide.
Slide 7 is a wonderful picture, which shows the construct of our portfolio today.
Jabil's large-scale diversification serves as a solid foundation from which we run our business.
The team has built this foundation over the past five to six years, as we target new end markets and optimize our legacy business.
The output of this effort is twofold: one, a higher level of resiliency across the company; and two, a substantial presence in secular end markets, markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.
If we dissect the pie chart a bit differently with an emphasis on financial contribution and economic relevance, we see a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows, again, a real tribute to the diversified nature of our business today.
Lastly, if we look at a third dimension of our portfolio, we find a library of essential capabilities, capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands.
And when done correctly, our unique set of capabilities offer Jabil a real competitive advantage, as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.
Moving on to Slide 8.
You'll see management's outlook for the year.
We've increased core earnings per share to $7.25, an increase of nearly 30% year on year.
As for revenue, FY '22 now looks to be in the range of $32.6 billion, up more than 10% year on year.
In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year, while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year on year.
For me, this is a positive testament on how the team is managing the business as our strategy has been consistent, and what needs to be done is well understood throughout our company.
With that, let's move to my final slide, where I'd like to start with the importance of our purpose.
At Jabil, with purpose comes expectations, expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe; servant leadership; protecting the environment; giving back to our communities; and offering a workplace, which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance.
Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been more important than they are today.
I'm proud of our team as they fully grasp our purpose.
And in doing so, their conduct is exceptional.
In closing, our improvement is steady commercially, financially, and operationally.
Quite simply, here at Jabil, we build stuff, and we do it really well.
One factor that makes good companies great is having a value set, a culture, if you will, that enhances the way in which they solve problems.
As a team, we embrace this as we take on the challenges put forth by our customers each and every day.
I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our diversified portfolio and the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, as several of our end markets continue to benefit from long-term secular trends.
As Mark just summarized, our Q2 results were very strong.
During the quarter, revenue, core operating income, core EPS, and free cash flow all exceeded our December expectations.
Given the higher revenue, I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive an extra 30 basis points of margin improvement compared to our expectations in December mainly through broad-based strength in several key end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends as well as outstanding execution by our business, operations, and supply chain teams.
For the quarter, revenue was approximately $7.6 billion, up 10.6% over the prior-year quarter and ahead of the midpoint of our guidance from December.
The additional upside was mainly driven by our 5G and cloud businesses, while our automotive, healthcare, and retail end markets remain very strong.
Our GAAP operating income during the quarter was $313 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51.
Core operating income during the quarter was $344 million, an increase of 21% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.6%, up 40 basis points over the prior year.
Core diluted earnings per share was $1.68, a 32% improvement over the prior-year quarter.
Now turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide.
Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis.
The solid year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad based, with strength across our healthcare, automotive, and connected devices businesses.
Core margin for the segment came in at 5.1%.
Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.8 billion, an increase of 19% on a year-over-year basis.
The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad based, with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and 5G wireless and cloud businesses.
Core margin for the segment was 4%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting improved mix and solid execution by the team.
Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.
In Q2, inventory days came in at 86 days.
The sequential increase in days was driven largely by two factors.
Firstly, the ongoing tightness in the supply chain continues to weigh on our inventory balances.
It's worth noting that we've offset a portion of these increases with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet.
Net of these inventory deposits, inventory days was 71 in Q2.
And second, at the end of the quarter, we experienced a timing difference on the sell-through of finished goods within our DMS segment.
I anticipate this timing difference to reverse in Q3.
In spite of these two factors impacting inventory, our second quarter cash flows from operations were very robust, coming in at $246 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $201 million.
From a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter at approximately 1.3 times and with cash balances of $1.1 billion.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $145 million.
And for the year, we've repurchased 4.4 million shares for $272 million, as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.
Turning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide.
DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 17% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.2 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4 billion.
We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $300 million to $360 million, representing a core margin range of 3.8% to 4.2%.
At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 20 basis points over the prior year and down sequentially, reflecting planned investments in our Q3 quarter.
It's also worth noting, sequentially in Q4, we expect robust core margins driven by our scaling automotive business, along with typical seasonality in our mobility and EMS businesses.
In Q3, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $276 million to $336 million.
Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.64.
The core tax rate in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 21%.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market.
Today, the outlook for our business is strong, with end markets across both segments continuing to benefit from multiyear secular trends.
We believe these markets will continue to drive our growth, as we concentrate our efforts on long-term secular growth markets with strong margin and cash flow dynamics, markets such as electric vehicles, personalized medicine, and healthcare, semi-cap, clean and smart energy infrastructure, cloud, 5G infrastructure, and the associated connected devices.
Our electric vehicle business, in particular, continues to outperform, in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates.
We've seen this rapid acceleration manifest in top-line revenue growth in excess of 50% this year alone in our automotive end market.
We're also expecting double-digit growth from the healthcare, automotive retail, industrial and semi-cap, and 5G wireless and cloud end markets.
And importantly, the broad-based growth associated with these secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin and free cash flow expansion.
All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year.
We're now anticipating core earnings per share will be in the neighborhood of $7.25 per share on revenue of approximately $32.6 billion.
Notably, this incremental revenue will improve mix and drive operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.6% for FY '22, as we continue to drive the organization to 5% and beyond.
Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating in excess of $700 million in free cash flow, in spite of the higher revenue and associated working capital.
We've been working extremely hard as a team to expand margins and drive strong cash flows.
I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.
Before we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind our participants that we cannot address customer-specific or product-specific questions.
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
","Jabil's Q2 performance exceeded expectations, with revenue reaching $7.6 billion, driven by strong demand in 5G, cloud computing, automotive, and healthcare. The company's diversified portfolio and exceptional execution resulted in a core operating margin of 4.6%, an increase of 40 basis points year over year. Additionally, core earnings per share reached $1.68, representing a 32% improvement. Jabil has raised its financial outlook for fiscal year 2022, anticipating revenue of $32.6 billion and core earnings per share of approximately $7.25, reflecting a 30% increase year over year. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 is also positive due to the company's momentum and presence in secular growth markets, such as electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure, and personalized healthcare. Jabil remains committed to generating over $700 million in free cash flow this year."
CNS_q2_2021.txt,"Joining me are our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Steers; our President, Joe Harvey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Stadler.
Further, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $0.94 per share compared with $0.54 in the prior year's quarter and $0.79 sequentially.
Revenue was a record $144.4 million for the quarter compared with $94 million in the prior year's quarter and $125.8 million sequentially.
The increase in revenue from the first quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management across all three investment vehicles, the recognition of performance fees and one additional day in the quarter.
Our implied effective fee rate was 58 basis points in the second quarter compared with 57.3 basis points in the first quarter.
Excluding performance fees, our second quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points.
No performance fees were recorded in the first quarter.
Operating income was a record $62.6 million in the quarter compared with $35.5 million in the prior year's quarter and $53.2 million sequentially.
Our operating margin increased to 43.4% from 42.3% last quarter.
The second quarter included a cumulative adjustment to reduce the compensation to revenue ratio.
Expenses increased 12.6% compared with the first quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, distribution and service fees and G&A.
The compensation to revenue ratio, which included the just mentioned cumulative adjustments to lower the incentive compensation accrual, was 35.03% for the second quarter and is now 35.25% for the six months ended.
The increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in US open-end funds, and the increase in G&A was primarily due to higher professional and recruitment fees as well as an increase in travel and entertainment expenses.
Our effective tax rate, which also included a cumulative adjustment, was 26.51% for the second quarter and is now 26.85% for the six months ended.
The reduction in the effective tax rate from the first quarter was primarily due to the diminished effect of the non-deductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre-tax base.
Our firm liquidity totaled $185.6 million at quarter-end compared with $124.3 million last quarter.
Total assets under management was a record $96.2 billion at June 30th, an increase of $9.2 billion or 11% from March 31st.
The increase was due to net inflows of $2.6 billion and market appreciation of $7.4 billion, partially offset by distributions of $769 million.
Advisory accounts, which ended the quarter with a record $23.1 billion of assets under management, had net inflows of $1 billion during the quarter.
We recorded $300 million of inflows from five new mandates and a record $1.2 billion of inflows from existing accounts.
Partially offsetting these inflows were $493 million of outflows resulting from client rebalancing.
Net inflows were evenly a portion between US real estate, Global real estate, Preferred and Global listed infrastructure portfolios.
Bob Steers will provide an update on our institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.
Japan Subadvisory had net outflows of $272 million during the quarter, compared with net outflows of $204 million during the first quarter.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, in January of 2021, our distribution rate cut was made to one of the funds we subadvised.
Encouragingly the rate of net outflows in this fund decelerated throughout the quarter and we actually recorded net inflows for the month of June.
Subadvisory excluding Japan had net outflows of $375 million primarily from a single client who decided to bring the portfolio management for a portion of the assets we manage for them in-house.
Open-end funds, which ended the quarter with record assets under management of $43.5 billion, had net inflows of $2.1 billion during the quarter.
This marks the 10th straight quarter of net inflows into open-end funds, and the first time we have recorded net inflows into each of our 11 US mutual funds.
Net inflows were primarily into US real estate and preferred funds.
Distributions totaled $312 million, $260 million of which was reinvested.
Let me briefly discuss a few items to consider for the second half of the year.
With respect to our outlook for compensation, the double-digit sequential growth in our assets under management and revenue, driven by our industry-leading organic growth rate and our strong investment performance, is tempered by the fact we still have half a year ago.
As a result, we reduced the compensation to revenue ratio by 25 basis points to 35.25% for the six months ended, and we expect that our compensation to revenue ratio will remain at 35.25%.
As we resume certain business activities that have been restricted during the worst of the pandemic, we expect G&A will increase by about 12% from the $42.6 million we recorded in 2020, but only by about 3% from the $46 million we recorded in 2019.
As was the case last quarter, the increase is primarily attributable to incremental investments in technology and global marketing as well as higher recruitment costs associated with the hiring of certain key investment and distribution personnel.
We expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 26.85%.
And finally, during the second quarter, in response to a client requests, we converted the fee structure on two portfolios from a performance-based fee structure to a base fee-only.
This conversion resulted in the realization of the year-to-date outperformance.
The increase in the base fee for these portfolios is not expected to have a meaningful impact on our overall effective fee rate.
Today, I will review our investment performance and discuss related key themes such as our near record, our perfect record of outperformance, what we are doing to sustain and enhance performance, the impact of accelerating inflation on our asset classes and how our major asset classes are performing versus expectations at the beginning of the year.
As we all know, in the second quarter, the US economy reopened from the pandemic and surged powerfully, driving appreciation and positive returns in virtually all asset classes.
A good portion of our AUM did better than the S&P 500, which was up 8.6%.
And we continued to post stellar outperformance versus our benchmarks.
One surprising development was that, treasury yields declined in the quarter against the backdrop of accelerating economic growth and rising inflation.
In fact, inflation surprised on the upside, something that hasn't happened in a long time.
Looking at our performance scorecard, in the second quarter, eight of nine core strategies outperformed their benchmarks.
For the last 12 months, all nine core strategies outperformed.
99% of our AUM is outperforming benchmarks on a one-year basis compared with 93% last quarter, driven by improvements in global listed infrastructure and certain global real estate portfolios.
On a three-year basis 100% of AUM is outperforming, and for five years 99% is outperforming, essentially the same as last quarter.
US REITs returned 12% in the quarter, lifting the year-to-date return to 21.3%.
We outperformed our benchmark in the quarter and for the last 12 months.
Going into this year, we believe 2021 would be a good, so called vintage year for real estate investing starting first with listed and then followed by private, consistent with a long history of the listed market leading the way, particularly during turning points.
The reopening in the US economy has created greater visibility into the turnarounds and demand for space, leasing activity and tenant credit and assorting out of rent deferrals, all of which restrained REIT share prices last year, while investment sales activity resumed including some major portfolio and Company sales.
While fundamentals and share prices for many property sectors have reached or eclipsed pre-pandemic levels, some of the most impacted sectors such as hotels, office and healthcare have loan recovery runways.
We believe that inflation in prices for building materials, such as steel and copper, labor, housing and land have contributed to rising real estate values and share prices.
This is different than in past periods where the replacement cost dynamic has taken a development cycle to kick in.
Global real estate returned 9.2% in the quarter compared with global stocks at 7.7%, lifting the year-to-date return to 15.5%.
For both the quarter and the last 12 months, we have outperformed in all three of our regional strategies as well as in our global and international strategies.
Global listed infrastructure returned 2.9% in the quarter, lifting the year-to-date return to 7%.
We outperformed for the quarter and for the last 12 months.
Similar to real estate, we believed that 2021 would be a good vintage year for infrastructure investing as infrastructure depreciated last year in part due to the sub-sectors that were uniquely impacted by the pandemic.
This year, the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic such as airports, ports and toll roads are still wrestling with concerns about the spread of coronavirus variance and levels of cross-border travel.
And utilities have been flat for the second year in a row, left back in a strong technology-led bull market.
That infrastructure performance, while positive, has not been stronger likely represents an opportunity in our view.
Preferred returned 2.9% in the quarter, helped by the 10-year treasury yield falling 30 basis points to 1.4%.
The year-to-date return is 2.4%.
We outperformed in the quarter and for the last 12 months in both our core and low duration preferred strategies.
Going into this year, we believe that the flat yield curve with the potential for a transition in the rate environment to higher long-term yields suggested investors should pivot toward our low duration strategy.
Notwithstanding the surprise and inflation this year, concerns about the coronavirus variants and global central bank yield management, have resulted in a very orderly interest rate market.
The risks of higher bond yields are on our watch list.
The inflation surprise has helped some of our strategies performance wise and has stimulated investor demand, particularly in our real estate strategies.
Going into this year we believe that inflation risks arising and that our multi-strategy real assets portfolio would see greater investor interest, while conversations have increased, they have yet to translate into flows.
Our real assets multi-strategy benchmark returned 8.5% in the quarter, lifting the year-to-date return to 14.5%.
We outperformed for both the quarter and the last 12 months, driven by excess returns in every strategy sleeve, real estate, infrastructure, commodities, resource equities, gold and high-grade low duration credit, and through top down asset allocation.
In the quarter commodities returned 13.3%, with 25 of the 27 commodities in the index producing positive spot price returns.
On the topic of whether higher inflation is temporary or not, we believe that many factors, including unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, trade bottlenecks, labor markets, housing prices and consumer psychology have come together to support a phase of higher and longer inflation.
If so, the conversations about inflation solutions should turn into more allocations.
In terms of inflation beta or the sensitivity to surprise inflation, the most sensitive of our strategies in descending order are commodities, resource equities, multi-strategy real assets, infrastructure and real estate.
At the same time, the macro environment for real assets is improving.
Real assets are the cheapest versus equities in nearly 20 years.
While we have a near-perfect record of outperformance, we are by no means complacent.
Our goal is to sustain our current level of outperformance, while continuing to innovate, identify alpha sources, put process in place to harvest that alpha and widen our excess return margins versus benchmarks.
The longer our outperformance persist, the better our ability to realize returns on the investments we've made and new vehicles and distribution.
We continue to devote resources to our investment department.
We've talked previously about our initiatives to integrate quantitative techniques and IT efficiencies into our fundamental processes.
Those initiatives are producing positive results and our investment teams are now asking for more.
We've added analysts and are identifying our next group of emerging leaders through our annual talent review process.
We recently added a Head of ESG, who will help our teams take our current ESG integration framework to the next level, contribute to the development of explicit strategies and help address the increasing demands of clients and consultants.
We see many opportunities for innovation and real estate investing.
There is an acute need for next generation real estate strategies to help investors reorganize and rebalance existing allocations, which are heavy in private, heavy in core property types and are not set up to be nimble to pivot to where the best deal is.
We have developed next generation, new economy property type strategies for the listed market.
In April, as we discussed on the last call, we announced the formation of our Private Real Estate group.
Our imperative is to innovate at the intersection of private and listed real estate investing to tilt to where the best returns are and harvest the alphas at those intersections.
Meantime, the pandemic has created change in demographic and business trends, which we believe creates opportunity by geographic market, property sector and business model.
Our private team is organized, our allocation and research processes between listed and private are established and we are commencing efforts to raise capital in institutional vehicles and in closed-end fund strategies.
In closing, we are in a unique phase of the economic and market cycles from an investor's perspective or what we do.
The setup that I've talked about before is how to achieve in a risk-managed fashion, a return bogey of 7% from a 60-40 blend of stocks and bonds.
For a long while now, the 40% in fixed income on a current basis has not been able to meet the return goal.
Now introduce inflation and the exercise becomes more difficult.
The fixed income dilemma is tougher.
There is higher risk for equities and the need to fit real assets into portfolios is greater.
Our strategies offer attractive total returns, current yield, diversification, inflation protection and for the taxable investor, tax advantages.
We have organized our teams to engage with clients to help solve these portfolio challenges.
We are excited about the opportunity.
First off, it's great to be back at work in my office, and I'm 100% healthy.
Also, I'd like to recognize Joe Harvey and our entire Executive Committee, who stepped up seamlessly in my absence, which underscores the quality and depth of our leadership team.
As I look back on the quarter and the year-to-date, it's apparent that we're in an environment that's very favorable for real assets.
The historically strong cyclical recovery that we've experienced this year has fostered a dramatic rebound in fundamentals for real assets ranging from real estate and infrastructure to resource equities and commodities.
The rebound and prospects for real assets versus 2020 is stark.
As Joe just pointed out, whereas the performance of virtually all real asset strategies badly lagged the broader equity markets last year, the reverse has been the case so far this year, especially for our real estate and diversified real asset strategies.
We believe this is a unique point in time for real assets and CNS, one that will not be transient in nature, and is supported by secular trends.
First, this cyclical recovery is historic and underpinned by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli, which are supportive of real asset fundamentals.
Second, investor psychology is shifting toward real assets.
The forces behind this shift are both fundamentals, including growing demand for hedges against unexpected inflation, and technical also including expectations of massive capital flows into public and private infrastructure.
We believe our strong brand and investment performance have put us in a unique position to capitalize on these trends as evidenced by our $2.6 billion in net inflows and the 12% organic growth in this latest quarter.
That said, we're working hard to expand our breadth and depth of capabilities in the real asset space by developing unique and valuable new space [Phonetic].
In addition, we're continuing our work to enhance and improve the results in all distribution channels, especially our US Advisory segment.
Last quarter's net flows in the wealth channel were a near-record $2.1 billion, and just shy of the first quarter record of $2.2 billion.
The organic growth rate in this, our largest channel was 22%.
Importantly, the strong growth in assets was well diversified by channel and product.
We saw strong flows for each of the broker dealer, RIA and independent channels.
DCIO also delivered a $163 million of net inflows, which marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive net flows for this vertical.
Flows by strategy were diverse as well.
The preferred securities fund led the way with $665 million of net inflows, and our low duration preferred securities fund also generated $205 million of net inflows.
Consistent with the growing interest in real estate, our global real estate securities fund achieved a record $370 million of net inflows in the quarter, and year-to-date has generated a 62% organic growth rate.
Net flows into our three US real estate funds were strong as well at $390 million.
Our non-US funds experienced $61 million of net inflows, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive inflows.
These flows, which have been accelerating, are the result of our expanding network of platforms and relationships throughout the EMEA region.
We expect these results will continue to improve over time.
The advisory channel delivered a solid $1 billion of net inflows in the quarter, also with strong demand across a range of strategies.
US real estate led the way with $443 million of net inflows, followed by preferred securities at $314 million.
Global real estate and global infrastructure also experienced net inflows of $227 million and $162 million, respectively.
$860 million of the $1.4 billion beginning institutional pipeline was funded during the quarter.
In addition, $479 million of new mandates was both won and funded in the quarter, and thus, never even made it into the pipeline.
Our end of quarter pipeline stands at $925 million.
As you may remember, less than one year ago, the advisory group under the leadership of Jeff Sharon was reorganized into a regional team approach, and we are very encouraged by these early results.
The subadvisory channel had net outflows of $375 million, which was attributable to one client who took $381 million of US and global real estate mandates in-house as a cost-saving measure.
Similarly, Japan subadvisory saw $272 million of net outflows, and $309 million of distributions, which reflect the continuing effects of a distribution cut in a large US REIT fund.
Looking ahead, the economy and equity markets appear to be at a tipping point, either the economic activity slows materially and inflation pressures turn out to be transitory or not.
As Joe alluded, the indicators that we follow strongly suggest that economic activity and inflation will remain higher for longer than expected.
In this environment, real assets will be highly sought after for their return and diversification characteristics.
Current fundamentals and stock market momentum appear to confirm this view.
We believe that this is a time to step-up new product initiatives to capitalize on what we expect will be strong vintage years ahead of us.
The launch of our first private real estate fund will be an important milestone for us.
Related to this, we are also growing our multi-strat asset allocation team.
And this, together with our listed and unlisted capabilities, will position us at the intersection of what is now for us a $16 trillion real estate universe.
The opportunity as we see it is to advise investors on how to tilt their real estate portfolios between listed and unlisted investments continuously to generate alpha and maximize returns.
This will open a range of opportunities for us from open and closed-end funds and separate accounts to non-traded vehicles.
Separately, we expect to recognize improved results from our EMEA, wholesale and US institutional teams, both of which are benefiting from new leadership and additional resources.
Only time will tell, but our excellent track record, strong cyclical tailwinds and proven distribution make us as excited about our growth prospects as ever.
","CNS reported record earnings of $0.94 per share, driven by higher average assets under management, performance fees, and an additional day in the quarter. Revenue reached $144.4 million, with an implied effective fee rate of 58 basis points. Operating income grew to $62.6 million, with an operating margin of 43.4%. The firm's liquidity totaled $185.6 million at quarter-end. Total assets under management saw a notable increase to $96.2 billion, with net inflows of $2.6 billion and market appreciation. Advisory accounts recorded net inflows of $1 billion, while Open-end funds had inflows of $2.1 billion. Despite some client rebalancing and subadvisory outflows, the firm experienced a strong 10th consecutive quarter of net inflows into open-end funds. Notably, CNS outperformed benchmarks in eight of nine core strategies in the quarter, with 99% of AUM outperforming on a one-year basis. The company is optimistic about its growth prospects, citing favorable conditions for real assets, a strong distribution network, and plans to launch its first private real estate fund."
G_q3_2021.txt,"We expect the call to last roughly an hour.
In addition, during our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide additional information to enhance the understanding of the way management views the operating performance of our business.
Our third quarter performance reflects continued momentum across our business.
Global Client top line performance, which grew at 11% on a constant currency basis was once again driven by strong demand for Transformation Services, made up of analytics, digital and consulting.
Our strategic investments over the years in capabilities and talent, including the continuous training and development of our global workforce positions us well to address the pressing challenges and opportunities our clients are facing.
This quarter, we achieved the milestone of crossing the threshold of $1 billion in quarterly total revenue for the first time.
For the third quarter 2021, we delivered: total revenue of $1.02 billion, up 8% on a constant currency basis; Global Client revenue of $921 million, up 11% on a constant currency basis; adjusted operating income margin of 16.6% compared to 17.1% during the third quarter of 2020; and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.66 per share, up 18% year-over-year.
Global Client revenue growth in the quarter cut across almost all of our industry verticals with double-digit growth in consumer goods and retail, life sciences and healthcare, high-tech and manufacturing and services.
As expected, banking and capital markets growth continued to be muted due to the restructured relationship with one client that resized its asset management business in late 2020.
Our pipeline remains healthy with a mix of both large and regular-sized deals.
We continue to scale our revenue and bookings from existing relationships and add new logos, which sets the stage for future growth.
During the third quarter, we signed four large deals across life sciences, CPG, banking and capital markets and high-tech services.
As we deepen our role as a trusted advisor to our clients, we have seen sole-sourced deals, which was, for many quarters, above 50% of our bookings, now rising above 60%.
We are also seeing great traction build up in fintech, digital banking and other fast growth tech companies where our domain strength and agile development and deployment is helping them scale rapidly.
Global Client Transformation Services continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate and now accounts for more than 35% of total Global Client revenue, including the contribution from the Enquero acquisition.
Year-to-date, approximately 70% of Global Client bookings include a component of analytics, digital or consulting in them.
As a reminder, approximately half of Transformation Services bookings are annuity-based and often lead to large long-term intelligent operations engagements.
Analytics is not only the largest component of Transformation Services, contributing more than half of its revenue over the last several quarters, but is also its fastest-growing component, consistently growing well above 30%.
Many of our analytics solutions are deeply connected to high-growth areas where we are strategically focused, such as sales and commercial, supply chain, financial crimes and risk and SG&A.
Our sharp differentiation is our ability to orchestrate data and analytics in the cloud with deep industry and process knowledge.
The availability of high-quality data and the ability to derive actionable insights with analytics to drive decision-making is now more critical than ever.
It is at this insight to action level where we differentiate ourselves the most.
Our intelligence platform, Genpact enterprise 360 enables clients to do just that.
Genpact enterprise 360 harnesses the power of data and insights from our operations built on proprietary metrics and benchmarks we have deployed and developed over the past 20 years in our digital Smart Enterprise frameworks.
This enables clients to have radical transparency in their businesses.
The platform then uses AI to generate connective insights.
This further empowers clients to take actions, either themselves all through our work with them to deliver better outcomes today and to point transformation opportunities to unlock future growth.
Another differentiator for us is our ability to drive outcome-oriented value for clients beyond just cost and productivity, such as increased growth, lower receivables and inventory, lower losses in fraud and better pricing.
This is one of the key reasons why our Transformation Services solutions resonate so well with our clients.
Some examples include, for a large global CPG client, leveraging our experience and design thinking methodologies, we are using analytics to help them with better sales targeting and automating processes such as contract management and payment reconciliations.
This enables its sales teams to focus on much higher proportion of their time on business development.
For a large fintech client, we have designed, implemented and are now running a best-in-class anti-money laundering and transaction monitoring process to improve their regulatory risk compliance as they experience hyper growth.
For a large high-tech client using our Cora sales assist solution, we are leveraging data and analytics to proactively generate and prioritize advertising leads for small and medium business segment to grow the client's top line.
For a large client in the semiconductor ecosystem, we are using digital and analytics solutions to improve supply and demand forecasting, diversify their supplier base for greater resilience, conduct global inventory analysis and run spot price forecasting to optimize the timing of purchases.
These examples reflect the five trends we continue to see in every CxO conversation.
The five trends are: one, a significant shift from off-line to online across every industry; two, the virtualization of all technology services and solution delivery; three, an accelerated consumption of cloud-based services and solutions; four, an exponential growth in real-time predictive analytics; and five, the move to human-centered design that creates superior experiences for customers, users and employees.
Clients continue to tell us that our approach of bringing together our expertise in digital and cloud-based analytics solutions with our deep industry and process depth to drive actions that deliver outcomes is different.
We continue to see momentum in driving commercial models linked to these outcomes versus traditional input-based models that focus on the cost of FTEs.
These commercial models ensure goal alignment between us and our clients.
For example, being paid for the outperformance of predefined metrics, consumption of transaction-based models or fixed fee models.
As the world continues to adapt to the changes that I've seen over the last 18 months, companies across every industry are intensely competing for talent across the globe.
While this hot talent market presents challenges for our kind of a business, it certainly creates an interesting set of opportunities for us.
We see many engagements where we can help our clients access and nurture global talent, given our ability to scale across a range of skill sets and geographies as well as our focus on reskilling.
We are using our investments in our online on-demand learning platform, Genome, to build the critical skills businesses are looking for across digital, data and analytics.
Specific industry and process knowledge, use of Lean and Six Sigma as well as soft skill and personal development.
As an example, our data and analytics certification program equips our employees with the skills necessary to generate impact immediately after course completion by deriving insights from complex data sets.
To date, Almost 70% of our employees are enrolled with more than 43,000 fully trained and tested.
This is analytics at scale for our clients.
At the height of the pandemic in 2020, we saw historically low attrition rates.
In the third quarter, as expected, our attrition rate increased above our historical average.
This is a global trend that is impacting our peers and clients alike.
However, given our talent management practices to date, we have had no impact on our client engagements or our ability to convert new bookings.
This reflects the strength of our culture of curiosity, innovation and learning as well as the countless learning, development and career opportunities we provide for our employees, enabled by investments like Genome and our redeployment platform, Talent Match.
We are delighted to have had a state of recent recognitions for being a great destination for talent in the market, such as: Forbes 2021 World's Best Employers List; the Refinitiv's 2021 diversity and inclusion top 100; a total of 28 excellent awards from Brandon Hall Human Capital Management; International SOS' Duty of Care award for diversity and inclusion; Aptar's top 10 best companies for women in India.
And earlier today, Forbes 2021 America's Best Employers for Veterans.
We are also being recognized for the work we are doing to improve our communities.
For example, being named to Fortune's Change the World List as one of 100 companies celebrated for having a positive societal impact.
We are deeply committed to our environmental, social and governance initiatives and are proud to have been recently awarded a gold medal from EcoVadis, recognizing our efforts across environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement.
We also recently concluded our annual green-a-thon event with more than 25,000 participants to sponsor the planting of more than 14,500 tree saplings, underscoring our commitment to environmental sustainability.
ESG is not only an important focus for us internally as a company, but also for what we do with our clients.
Given our industry knowledge, strength in data and analytics, and deep familiarity with our clients' processes, we are in a meaningful position to help our clients achieve progress on their own ESG agenda through areas like responsible sourcing, supply chain optimization, financial crimes, climate footprint of equipment usage and many others were able to help our clients generate positive social and environmental impact.
We are very excited about the work we are doing on our pursuit of a world that works better for people.
Lastly, as our teams are beginning to return to the office globally and travel more frequently to collaborate in person or meet with clients.
We are taking every precaution to continue to ensure the health and safety of our own employees and their families.
We are happy to report that a large and increasing number of our employees are getting vaccinated globally.
For example, in our largest delivery ecosystem, India, approximately 80% of our workforce has received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, and we continue to encourage participation for the rest of our population.
Today, I'll review our third quarter results and provide our latest thinking regarding our full year 2021 financial outlook.
Total revenue was $1.02 billion, up 9% year-over-year or 8% on a constant currency basis.
Global Client revenue that expanded to 91% of total revenue increased 12% year-over-year or 11% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by ongoing movement in Transformation Services led by analytics that grew more than 30% in the quarter as we continued underlying strength in our Intelligent Operations business.
Total Global Client growth included approximately one point contribution from revenue related to certain divested GE businesses that we began including in our Global Client portfolio as of January one.
During the quarter, we continued to expand the size of our Global Client relationships.
For example, during the 12-month period ended September 30, we grew the number of Global Client relationships with annual revenue over $5 million from 129 to 142 or a 10% year-over-year increase.
This included clients with more than $25 million in annual revenue, increasing from 23 to 26 or 13% year-over-year.
GE revenue declined 15% year-over-year driven by our delivery of committed productivity and the overall macroeconomic impact on GE.
Excluding the effect of revenue related to divested GE businesses I mentioned earlier, GE revenue would have declined 6% during the quarter, which is in line with our expectations.
Adjusted operating income margin at 16.6% declined from the first half of the year largely due to the increase in investment activity that we discussed with you last quarter as well as higher travel expenses.
As we move into the latter part of the year, we expect travel-related activity to increase as the macro environment continues to stabilize.
Gross margin in the quarter was 35.6% compared to 35.2% during the same period last year largely due to increased productivity from higher revenue and a more favorable mix.
We continue to expect our full year gross margin to expand 70 to 75 basis points year-over-year.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 21.3%, up 10% year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially as we dialed up investment activity to be able to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, up 18% year-over-year compared to $0.56 in 2020.
This 10% -- $0.10 increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted operating income of $0.04, lower taxes of $0.03, a $0.02 impact related to FX remeasurement and a $0.01 impact related to lower year-over-year share count.
Our effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.6% last year largely due to discrete benefits in the quarter as well as a nonrecurring prior period tax refund-related items.
Excluding this onetime tax benefit that equates to $0.03 per share, our effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 21.4%.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet.
During the third quarter, we generated $210 million of cash from operation that corresponds to free cash flow being almost two times higher than net income.
As a reminder, during 2020, we experienced a lower-than-normal working capital impact to our cash flow given improved days outstanding as lower revenue growth related to the pandemic.
This helped drive cash flow from operations of $252 million during the third quarter last year.
Our days outstanding have remained in a consistent range with third quarter 2021 at 84 days.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $922 million compared to $753 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021, and includes $350 million related to the 1.75% bond that we issued in the first quarter.
We continue to closely monitor market conditions for the optimum timing of the pay down of our 3.7% bond that is scheduled to mature in April 2022.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the last four rolling quarters was 1.1 times.
With undrawn debt capacity of approximately $500 million and existing cash balances, we continue to have ample liquidity to pursue growth opportunities and execute on our capital allocation strategy.
While we continue to invest to drive organic top line growth, we have a solid M&A pipeline, and we remain vigilant in searching for companies that can strengthen our capabilities in our chosen service lines.
As our track record demonstrates, to the extent capital is available, we expect to repurchase shares, particularly when the valuation is attractive in comparison to our view of the intrinsic value of the firm.
As expected, capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue increased from levels we saw during the first half of the year due to investments related to deal ramp-ups and the measured pace of our global workforce return to office.
Given our year-to-date spending, we now anticipate capital expenditures as a percentage of total revenue for the full year to be in the range of 1.5% to 2%.
Let me now turn to an update of our full year outlook.
We continue to expect total revenue between $3.96 billion and $4 billion, representing year-over-year constant currency growth of 5.5% to 6.5%.
For Global Clients, the expected growth remains in the range of 10.5% to 11.5% or 9% to 10% on a constant currency basis.
There is also no change to our full year GE outlook of approximately 20% year-over-year decline.
Excluding the effect of approximately $40 million in revenue related to the GE divested businesses, we continue to expect GE full year revenue to decline 10% to 12%.
We continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to 16.5% for the full year.
Factored into this outlook is the impact of continued ramp-ups in investment activity in both sales and marketing, research and development, higher fourth quarter travel, and a higher level of transaction costs related to recent large deal signings.
To be clear, our approximate 16.5% adjusted operating income full year margin remains the baseline for which we think about our trajectory for 2022.
As a result of the nonrecurring tax benefit in the third quarter I referred to earlier, we now expect our full year 2021 effective tax to be approximately 22.5% to 23.5%, which compares to the prior year range of 23.5% to 24.5%.
Given the outlook I just provided, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.43, up from the prior $2.36 to $2.39 range due to the favorable impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit as well as the balance sheet remeasurement gains during the quarter.
Additionally, given our year-to-date performance, we can now expect our full year operating cash flow to be at least $550 million, up from our earlier outlook of $500 million, and we continue to anticipate free cash flow from operations of approximately 1.2 times to 1.3 times net income, above our historical 1:1 ratio.
Our results for the third quarter are a reflection of the focused long-term strategic choices we have made, the capabilities we have built organically and added inorganically over the years are resonating well in the market.
We are pleased with our performance that we believe reinforces our medium- to long-term trajectory of double-digit to low teens Global Client revenue growth driven by continued momentum in Transformation Services, particularly analytics with an expanding adjusted operating income margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share growing ahead of total revenue, all supported by strong cash flow generations.

EW_q4_2021.txt,"Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards released fourth quarter 2021 financial results.
These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities; regulatory approvals; clinical trials; litigation; reimbursement; competitive matters; and foreign currency fluctuations.
Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures.
Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results.
We're proud of our performance in 2021.
Although hospitals continue to be impacted by COVID, it was a year of significant milestones and investment for Edwards and our teams were relentless.
In TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy.
In particular, we invested in increasing awareness, pursued further therapy expansion and advance new technologies.
We completed enrollment of the EARLY-TAVR trial, an important pivotal study studying the treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients before their symptoms develop.
Separately, we initiated enrollment in our PROGRESS trial for moderate AS patients, and we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to start our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.
In TMTT, we achieved our significant 2021 milestones as we continue to make meaningful progress on advancing our three key value drivers: a portfolio of pioneering therapies for patients; positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.
We are pleased to have treated over 3,000 patients in 2021 with our differentiated portfolio of TMTT therapies, gaining valuable learnings through both our clinical and commercial experiences.
Each of our platforms demonstrated promising outcomes and clinical performance.
I'm also pleased to announce that we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial in 2021, an important milestone that keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year.
In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the adoption of our premium technologies.
We also implemented valuable additions to our smart monitoring advancements in critical care.
Most importantly, in 2021, even more patients benefited from Edwards' life-saving technologies than ever before.
I'm also proud to say that throughout the year, our employees remain dedicated to keeping our commitments to patients and to one another.
Despite the ongoing pandemic that fueled global challenges, our employees found innovative ways to support hospital procedures and to ensure our ability to supply our life-saving therapies was not impacted.
And through their efforts, we were able to get our technologies into the hands of our trusted partners around the world so they could serve their patients.
Now I'd like to cover several 2021 financial highlights before I get into the quarterly details.
In 2021, we are pleased to achieve all of our key financial expectations.
Underlying sales increased 18% to $5.2 billion, driven by balanced organic sales growth in each region.
We achieved 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share, while also increasing R&D, 19%.
The significant increase in R&D and infrastructure investments this year helped strengthen our long-term outlook.
And as you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever about the tremendous opportunity we have to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the healthcare system.
Turning to our financial results.
Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period.
Growth was driven by our portfolio of innovative technologies, although at the lower end of our October expectations due to the pronounced impact of Omicron on hospital resources in December, especially in the U.S. Full year 2021 global TAVR sales of $3.4 billion increased 18% on an underlying basis versus the prior year.
Despite intermittent challenges associated with the pandemic throughout the year, sales were in line with our original guidance of 3.2 to 3.6 billion and were driven by increased awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy with our SAPIEN platform.
In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales were $872 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, with impressive strength outside the U.S.
We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth.
And globally, average selling prices were stable as we maintained our disciplined pricing strategy.
In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 10% year over year in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable.
As previously mentioned, the Omicron variant had a noticeable impact on hospital resources in December as cases were postponed or limited in a number of hospitals.
Growth in the U.S. was highest in small- to mid-volume centers, which are helping provide access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients.
Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% year over year on an underlying basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable.
We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions.
In Europe, Edwards' growth was in the mid-teens, and we estimate that our competitive position was stable.
Growth was broad-based across the region.
It's worth noting that a recent cost-effectiveness study demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN 3 was economically dominant when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating French patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at low surgical mortality -- who are at low risk of surgical mortality.
We're also encouraged by the recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery, which now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over 75.
We believe both of these developments represents an important long-term opportunity to bring TAVR therapy to even more patients in need.
Sales growth in Japan was also strong, where therapy adoption is still relatively low.
Several important milestones were achieved in Q4.
For the first time, the number of TAVR procedures performed in Japan was comparable with the surgical aortic valve replacements.
Furthermore, in each prefecture in Japan, there is now at least one hospital offering SAPIEN.
Following the recent reimbursement approval for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country.
Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.
In addition to our geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion.
In Q4, we completed enrollment of our EARLY-TAVR pivotal trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic AS patients.
Separately, we initiated enrollment in PROGRESS, an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease.
We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment before they have symptoms or before their AS becomes severe, rather than risking irreversible damage to their heart as the disease progresses.
We also took steps to advance our innovative product portfolio.
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to study our next-generation TAVR device, SAPIEN X4.
Additionally, in Q4, we received FDA approval to use SAPIEN 3 with our Alterra adaptive pre-stent for congenital heart patients.
This should result in a quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that these younger patients will require over their lifetime.
In summary, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, we continue to anticipate 2022 underlying TAVR sales growth of 12 to 15%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference.
Our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges early in 2022, turning to more normalized growth environment as headwinds from Omicron subside and hospital resource constraints stabilize.
We remain confident in this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.
As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial, and we remain on track to present data in the second half of 2022.
This important milestone keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year of PASCAL for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation.
We also continue to expect European approval of our next-generation PASCAL Precision System later this year.
At the PCR London Valves conference in Q4, PASCAL 30-day outcomes from our MiCLASP post-market approval study of more than 250 patients in Europe were presented.
The data highlighted safe and effective MR reduction in a post-market setting.
We also progressed on the enrollment of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral disease.
In mitral replacement, we continue to expand our experience with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos.
Early experience with these sub-French transfemoral therapies increase our confidence in both platforms.
Turning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies, results from the TRISCEND study were presented at the Annual TCT Conference in November and demonstrated that early patient outcomes with the EVOQUE tricuspid were favorable and sustained at six months.
We are encouraged by the procedural success rates and also the significant TR reduction and sustained improvements in quality of life measures experienced by these patients.
We continue to make meaningful progress in enrolling our two tricuspid pivotal trials the tri cusp -- the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE system and the CLASP IITR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation.
We anticipate a late 2022 approval of EVOQUE tricuspid in Europe and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients that have very poor prognosis and few treatment options today.
Turning to the sales performance of TMTT.
Fourth quarter revenue of $25 million grew sequentially from the third quarter as we saw increased adoption of the PASCAL system despite the negative COVID impact in December.
Full year 2021 global sales more than doubled to $86 million.
As we continue to expand the availability of PASCAL to more centers in Europe, we are pleased with the excellent outcomes for patients supported by our high-touch model.
We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease in 2022 with the milestones that we outlined in our recent investor conference.
Despite the COVID impact so far this year, we continue to expect TMTT sales of 140 to $170 million for 2022.
We estimate the global TMTT opportunity will grow to approximately $5 billion by 2028, and we remain committed to bringing our groundbreaking portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases.
We are confident our portfolio strategy positions us well for leadership.
In Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $889 million, up 15% on an underlying basis versus the prior year.
Fourth quarter 2021 global sales of $221 million increased 9% on an underlying basis over the prior year.
Although we saw that hospital staffing shortages continued to worsen throughout the quarter, especially in the U.S., life-saving surgical therapies continue to be prioritized over elective procedures.
We're excited about the continued global adoption of INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA valve.
We remain encouraged by the growing evidence that supports Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including two studies being presented at the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Conference this weekend.
The COMMENCE study demonstrates excellent hemodynamics of this tissue technology across all aortic valve sizes at five years, while a European economic value study shows a cost reduction with the use of INSPIRIS versus mechanical valves.
In summary, we continue to expect that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by adoption of our premium technologies and procedure growth.
Even as TAVR adoption expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients, extend our global leadership, and be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons.
Turning to Critical Care.
Full year global sales of $835 million increased 14% on an underlying basis versus the prior year.
2021 growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales as capital spending resumed.
Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU also remained in high demand due to the elevated COVID hospitalizations in both the U.S. and Europe.
Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $212 million increased 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong demand for HemoSphere.
Demand for our broad portfolio of smart recovery sensors also remained robust in the fourth quarter, including ClearSight, our noninvasive finger cuff, which achieved sustained performance at or above pre-COVID levels.
As discussed at our recent investor conference, the integration of a full range of technologies creates a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytics capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in hemodynamic monitoring.
In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, and we remain excited about our pipeline of innovative critical care products.
Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2021, including detailed results from the fourth quarter, as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of this year.
Sales in the fourth quarter increased 12.6% on an underlying basis.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.53.
Our fourth quarter sales were negatively impacted by the wave of COVID that began late in the quarter, especially in the U.S. Earnings per share in the quarter was below our expectations as it was impacted by weaker-than-expected sales and we accelerated certain spending into the fourth quarter of 2021 that we had planned to incur during 2022, including preparation for TMTT product launches.
For the full year 2021, we are pleased with our performance as sales increased 18% on an underlying basis to $5.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $2.22.
I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2022.
For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8%, compared to 75.3% in the same period last year.
This increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from foreign exchange.
We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78 and 79%.
This year, our rate should be lifted by a favorable impact from foreign exchange and an improved product mix, partially offset by investments in our manufacturing capacity.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $424 million or 31.9% of sales, compared to $339 million in the prior year.
This increase was driven by the resumption of medical congresses and commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year, as well as the addition of personnel in preparation for new product launches.
We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be between 28 and 30%.
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 19% to $233 million or 17.5% of sales.
This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased TMTT clinical trial activity.
For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17 to 18% range as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $18 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.03.
This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 I mentioned earlier.
This reduction reflects an accounting adjustment associated with reduced expectations of making a future milestone payment for a previous acquisition.
Our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.9% or 12.7%, excluding the impact of special items.
This rate included an approximate 3 percentage point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation.
Our full year 2021 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.6%.
We continue to expect our full year rate in 2022 to be between 11 and 15%, which includes an estimated benefit of 3 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.
Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales by approximately 1% or $10 million compared to the prior year.
At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million negative impact or about 2% to full year 2022 sales as compared to 2021.
Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year.
Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $284 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $374 million, less capital spending of $90 million.
Full year 2021 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up from $734 million in 2020.
We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow to be between 1.2 and $1.5 billion.
In 2022, we expect our cash flow will be reduced by approximately $200 million due to a change in tax regulations involving the timing of the deductions for research and development expenses.
Turning to the balance sheet.
We have a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of the year.
Consistent with our practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares, we purchased approximately $100 million during the fourth quarter.
We still have remaining share repurchase authorization of $1.1 billion.
Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were $632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter.
We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between 630 and $635 million.
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2022.
Despite a slow start to the year associated with Omicron's impact on hospital resources, we are planning for conditions to gradually improve and therefore, are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2022.
For total Edwards, we continue to expect sales to grow at a low double-digit rate to 5.5 billion to $6 billion.
For TAVR, we expect sales of 3.7 to $4 billion.
And for TMTT, we expect sales of 140 to $170 million.
We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of 870 to $950 million and Critical Care sales of 820 to $900 million.
For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.65.
For the first quarter of 2022, we project total sales to be between 1.27 and $1.35 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.62.
And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.
So in conclusion, we're proud of the significant progress we made in 2021, advancing new transformational therapies and delivering strong financial performance.
We expect continued growth and progress in 2022.
We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of catheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us well long-term success.
As the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the No.
1 largest health burden, we believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028.
We are confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and the healthcare system.
","Edwards reported solid fourth quarter 2021 results, driven by strong growth in its TAVR therapy portfolio. Despite the impact of the Omicron variant in December, TAVR sales rose 13% on an underlying basis, largely driven by international markets. Edwards remains confident in its long-term TAVR opportunity, with a target to double sales to $10 billion by 2028. The company also made significant progress in its TMTT business, completing enrollment in pivotal trials for early-stage and moderate aortic stenosis. TMTT sales more than doubled in 2021, and Edwards anticipates continued growth in this market. Additionally, Edwards reported steady growth in its Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care businesses, with solid sales increases in both segments. Despite a slow start to 2022 due to Omicron, Edwards maintained its previous sales guidance for the full year, expecting total sales to grow by a low double-digit rate."
AME_q3_2020.txt,"A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC, including in our 10-Q, which we file later today.
I will now turn the meeting over to Dave.
AMETEK delivered a strong third quarter, despite ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
While sales continue to be impacted by the pandemic, the demand environment shows solid improvements from the second quarter, as customers return to work and travel restrictions began to slowly ease.
In addition, our businesses delivered outstanding operating performance, allowing us to expand margins, generate excellent cash flow and drive earnings ahead of our expectations.
I continue to be impressed by the strength of our workforce and the dedication to our mission of solving our customer's most complex challenges.
We remain vigilant and focused on our employees' safety.
Our site and country level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the shifting guidelines provided by the CDC, and local health and safety agencies.
The flexibility our teams have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been excellent.
Now let me turn to our results for the quarter.
Third quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Organic sales were down 14%.
With the recent acquisitions contributing five points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a three point headwind and foreign currency adding one point.
As expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company, experienced the largest impact from COVID, with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year.
Our businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness.
These efforts lead to excellent operating results in the quarter.
Third quarter operating income was $270 million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter.
EBITDA in the third quarter was $332 million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year's comparable period.
This led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Furthermore, our businesses generated a strong level of cash flow.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of that income.
Next, let me provide additional details at the operating group level.
Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the quarter, despite end-market weakness, delivering outstanding operating performance resulting in strong margin expansion.
Sales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2019.
As expected, we saw solid and wide-spread sequential sales improvements from the second quarter.
Organic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing six points and foreign currency contributing one point.
Commercial aerospace remains a largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG.
EIG's third quarter operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.
Our Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand environment with solid operating performance.
EMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year's third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture.
Organic sales were down 13%, with a divestiture of 8-point headwind, the acquisition of PDT added two points and foreign currency adding one point.
EMG's operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the quarter.
Let me comment briefly on end-market dynamics for some of our businesses.
Overall, we saw solid sequential sales improvements across all markets in the third quarter.
We expect continued sequential improvements in the fourth quarter for all businesses other than customer aerospace, where we expect largely flat conditions sequentially.
Our strongest market remains defense, where we continue to be well-positioned with content across a wide range of important defense platforms.
We are also very well-positioned with our medical and healthcare businesses.
Although, they experienced a delay in the return of electro procedures during the third quarter, which offsets solid COVID-driven demand.
And our most challenging market remains commercial aerospace remain cautious of a trajectory of a recovery given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19.
Given the uncertain and challenging end-market dynamics, our businesses remain highly focused on driving operational excellence initiatives, both structural and temporary, to manage topline weakness, while ensuring we maintain our investments and key growth initiatives across the company.
AMETEK's asset-light operating model provides us with the flexibility to do both.
Our ability to expand margins and generate strong levels of cash flow during this pandemic is evidence of the strength of our operating model.
In the third quarter, we generated $70 million in total cost savings, which was at the high end of our expectations, with $40 million in structural savings and $30 million in temporary cost reduction savings.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly higher level of structural savings, while temporary savings will be reduced from the third quarter levels, as we add back additional temporary costs during the quarter.
As a result, we expect approximately $55 million in our total cost savings in the fourth quarter, with $45 million in structural and $10 million in temporary cost savings.
And for the full year, we expect approximately $230 million in total cost savings, with $140 million in structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings.
Our businesses continue to implement new and innovative ways to reach our customers around the world in new markets.
Through virtual meeting platforms, augmented reality product demonstrations and service, and enhanced digital marketing initiatives, our businesses have adapted quickly to the new landscape.
Seeing our businesses adopt these new ways of doing business quickly and effectively has been very impressive.
Our businesses are also collaborating across platforms.
As an example, AMETEK Land and AMETEK Rauland recently partnered together to help support Rauland's reopen schools safely campaign for their Telecenter U solution.
Rauland is the leading provider of critical communications, workflow and safety solutions for hospitals and schools.
Their Telecenter U solution connects classrooms and educational facilities to district offices for emergencies, event management and everyday communications.
As I mentioned on our last earnings call, AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions, recently developed their new VIRALERT three system for rapid detection of elevated skin temperatures at points of entry to various facilities, including schools.
Through this collaborative effort, Rauland was able to incorporate Land's VIRALERT three technology into their Telecenter U solution to help their customers safely reopen their schools by allowing for temperature screening of students and faculty.
In return, AMETEK Land will reach thousands of new potential customers through Rauland's well-established network of school districts.
The result was a valuable solution for our customers.
Congratulations to the AMETEK and the AMETEK Rauland team for the success on this project.
We are also finding ways to support our customers through new product innovation.
Throughout the pandemic, we continue to invest meaningfully in our research and development initiatives, and we are seeing great success from these efforts.
Our Vitality Index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 25% in the quarter.
During the quarter, Creaform, a worldwide leader in 3D measurement solutions, unveiled its R-Series 3D scanning solution that is designed for automated dimensional quality control applications.
The suite of R-Series solutions includes the new robot-mounted MetraSCAN 3D scanner with CUBE-R, a turnkey industrial measuring cell that is designed to be integrated into factories for at-line inspections.
Together, the solution provides customers with much faster cycle times, more accurate and repeatable results, higher resolution and operational simplicity, to increase productivity by measuring more dimensions on more parts without compromising on accuracy.
Congratulations to the Creaform team for launching this outstanding new solution.
Now shifting to acquisitions.
While deal flow during the second quarter and third quarter has been impacted by the pandemic, we are starting to see a healthy pickup in activity.
Our pipeline is strong and conversations with acquisition targets are accelerating.
As Bill will highlight in a moment, over the last two quarters, we have further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, and remain poised to deploy significant capacity -- capital on strategic acquisitions.
We will remain active, yet disciplined, in our acquisition process.
We continue to focus on acquiring niche technology leaders with attractive growth profiles with opportunities for us to add value commercially and operationally.
Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year.
While the global economy continues to present challenges and uncertainties, visibility has improved across most markets.
As a result, we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter.
Overall sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be down high-single digits with a similar level of organic sales decline.
Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.04, down 4% to 7% versus the prior year.
Fourth quarter decremental margins are expected to remain solid in the low 20%s.
To summarize, our businesses delivered a solid quarter in a difficult environment.
AMETEK continues to manage this global crisis well to the proven strength of the AMETEK growth model and with a talented workforce.
Our cost mitigation efforts have allowed the company to weather this ongoing storm and we are confident that we will overcome these challenges with a bright future.
I'd like to echo Dave's comments on the quarter, as we saw outstanding operating performance driven by the tremendous efforts of our team in a very challenging economic environment.
Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Third quarter general and administrative expenses were down $4.5 million, compared to the same period of 2019, primarily due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts.
As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.7% last year.
The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, down from 19.5% in the same period last year.
The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to returned provision adjustments and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.
For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%, and as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.
Operating capital and working capital was an impressive 17% in the third quarter, down sequentially from the second quarter's 19.6% on outstanding working capital management.
Capital expenditures in the quarter were $10 million.
We now expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, which is $5 million higher than our full year expectations last quarter, as we are investing in incremental growth opportunities.
Our full year capital expenditures estimate remains below our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $63 million.
For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million, free cash flow was $300 million and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 146% of net income.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, up slightly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $68 million from the end of the second quarter.
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion.
Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.1 times, as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances.
This was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times at quarter end, which improved by two -- 0.2 turns in the quarter.
We remain well-positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.3 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives.
This includes approximately $1 billion in available revolver capacity.
As we have highlighted on previous calls, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.
In summary, our businesses continue to manage through the pandemic exceptionally well, delivering strong operating results and high levels of cash flow.
The dedication of our world-class workforce to serving our essential customers has truly been impressive.
We remain well-positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges, while investing in our long-term growth initiatives.
Andrew, we are ready to take questions.
","AMETEK faced economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a 12% dip in sales compared to 2019's third quarter. Despite this, the company's businesses performed exceptionally, resulting in expanded margins, strong cash flow, and earnings that surpassed expectations. Operating income was $270 million, with a record 24% margin. EBITDA reached $332 million, a 29.5% margin, and adjusted earnings per share were $1.01, a decline of only 5% compared to the previous year. The Electronic Instruments Group saw solid margin expansion despite weak markets, and the Electromechanical Group demonstrated operational excellence, mitigating weak demand. AMETEK remains optimistic despite uncertain end-market dynamics and expects continued improvement in all markets except commercial aerospace. The company's asset-light operating model and cost-saving initiatives have provided flexibility. With a strong balance sheet, liquidity of $2.3 billion, and healthy pipeline for acquisitions, AMETEK anticipates fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share between $1.00 to $1.04."
AME_q2_2021.txt,"A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC.
I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter.
Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations.
We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter.
This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams.
We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile.
The five acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth.
Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year.
Now let me turn to our second quarter results.
Our businesses saw robust, broad-based sales growth in the quarter.
Overall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020.
Organic sales growth was 25%.
Acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added two points.
Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year.
Our business has also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter.
While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges as is reflected in our results.
Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020.
And operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%.
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%.
EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%.
This operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10.
Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions.
In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% of net income.
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level.
Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter.
Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter.
Organic sales were up 27%.
Recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly two points.
EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year.
And operating margins were 24.3%.
Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period.
The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance.
EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus the prior year to $452 million.
Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added three points to the quarter.
Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business.
EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 33% compared to the prior year period.
And EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to a record 24.9%.
Now switching to our acquisition strategy.
As we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter.
These acquisitions as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected.
AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions.
Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year.
Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives.
We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications.
In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E.
And for the full year, we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales.
For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments.
In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our front-end sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth.
As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure.
While we are seeing higher levels of inflation due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we are capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions and allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread.
Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives.
For the full year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings.
Now moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021.
Given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance.
For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020.
Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share.
For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year.
Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter.
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb, with excellent sales and orders growth and high-quality earnings growth exceeded expectations.
Our strong operating performance through the first half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model.
Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time.
The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK Growth Model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.
As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings.
Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense.
As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter versus 1.7% in the same period last year.
For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6% compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year.
The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. rate change and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities.
For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.
And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well.
For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020.
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million.
For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management.
In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income.
Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion.
Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million.
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front.
During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI.
This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software and Magnetrol, which were completed in the first quarter of the year.
Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on five strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021.
At quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio were 1.9 times and 1.6 times, respectively.
We remain well positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility.
At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.
To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations.
The performance of our businesses through the first half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation and the dedication of our world-class workforce, has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.
Michelle, we're ready to take questions.
","AMETEK's second quarter performance exceeded expectations, with record sales of $1.39 billion, up 37% year-over-year, driven by organic growth, acquisitions, and favorable exchange rates. Orders grew significantly by 92%, leading to a record backlog of $2.5 billion. Operating income also surged by 40% to a record $317 million, expanding operating margins by 40 basis points. Excluding acquisitions, core margins increased significantly by 160 basis points. The company's strategic acquisitions are integrating well and contributing to growth. Despite supply chain challenges, AMETEK's operational excellence initiatives have resulted in $145 million in savings for the year. Given this strong performance, AMETEK has raised its full-year sales guidance to approximately 20% growth and earnings guidance to a range of $4.62 to $4.68 per share, representing a 17-18% increase. The company remains well-positioned for continued growth, with strong cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet, and a robust acquisition pipeline."
AYI_q4_2021.txt,"These beliefs are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control, including those detailed in our periodic SEC filings.
Please note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and we undertake no obligation to update these statements.
There will be an opportunity for Q&A at the end of the call.
For those participating, please limit your remarks to one question and one follow-up if necessary.
I'm pleased with our company's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
In a challenging global supply chain environment, we grew sales 11% and expanded our gross profit and operating profit margins.
Our performance demonstrated our focus on product vitality and customer service.
We allocated capital effectively by closing the acquisition of OSRAM's North American digital business and have created permanent value for our shareholders through the repurchase of company shares.
2021 was a pivotal year for us as we advanced our corporate transformation and I'd like to take a few minutes to recap some of those achievements.
We returned the company to growth.
We grew sales in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, and the full year and we expect this growth to continue.
We expanded gross profit margins for the full year, despite a challenging global environment.
We realigned our businesses into ABL, our Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls business and ISG, our Intelligent Spaces Group.
This alignment creates the necessary strategic focus on each business and allows us to develop the leadership teams that will deliver on their potential.
We generated strong cash flow and allocated capital in a way that creates permanent value for shareholders.
We held our first ever Investor Day.
We built a strong and diverse leadership team and are attracting new talent throughout the organization.
Our continuing improvements around ESG, are central tenants to our strategy.
We have made significant progress by reaching carbon neutrality in our operations and by committing to the reduction of 100 million metric tons of carbon from our put in place products and services by 2030.
We made progress on diversity, equity, and inclusion and on governance.
And you can read more about all of this in our upcoming 10-K, our Annual Report, our annual EarthLIGHT report and our proxy.
And finally, we have positioned ourselves well for 2022 and beyond.
I now want to update you on our ongoing transformation in each of our businesses and I will start with ABL.
We've had a good year in ABL.
Our focus on innovation through product vitality and increasing our service levels for the benefit of our customers has delivered strong results.
And we are continuing our efforts to drive our product expansion.
The Compact Pro High Bay, which we've discussed before, continues to deliver from both a revenue and margin perspective in the high growth industrial sector.
Our product vitality efforts include improvements to existing products and the introduction of new ones.
In the fourth quarter, we introduced the HomeGuard LED Security flood light.
It's an exciting addition to our contractor select portfolio.
This new platform offers a technology upgrade, higher efficacy, greater safety options, and ease of installation.
Sales have been strong.
We're off to a great start in a category where we currently have low share and strong growth opportunities.
We are also continuing to increase our service levels and deliver productivity improvements.
We are using better, smarter, faster to improve our processes and our technology for better, more efficient, customer service.
Today, I'd like to focus on Agile.
Agile as our commerce platform that is used by our channel for all of the key step that they need to do business in lighting and lighting and controls.
From finding products to creating solutions for large projects, to bidding on those projects, to placing the orders and finally tracking those orders to completion.
Our team is constantly improving Agile.
One of our key areas of focus has been to improve the quality of the product data that we provide.
This improvement provides many tangible benefits including ease of use and improved order accuracy.
Another area of focus that I have spoken about before is order status.
I bring this up again because it has been essential during this complicated period.
We were able to provide clear information to our channel about their order status, which allows us to better meet their needs in the face of the global supply chain challenges.
These examples address significant historical pain points and our foundational, which allow us to improve our service levels today and in the future.
As we enter 2022, the priorities for Trevor and the rest of the ABL team remain the same.
Maintain high product vitality, continue to elevate our service levels, and continue to use technology to differentiate ourselves.
Now moving to the Intelligent Spaces Group.
The mission of ISG is to use technology to solve problems in spaces by making them smarter, safer, and greener.
We believe that each of these provides ample opportunities for future growth.
This tech controls is a collection of open protocol products necessary to effectively operate spaces.
Atrius provides applications which use data to deliver value in those spaces.
We are having success across Europe and North America with our Distech platform, especially around campuses, data centers, and spaces that require a significant amount of control around the operation of the facilities.
We continue to add products to this ISG portfolio.
During the quarter we added the ECLYPSE Connected Thermostat, an open protocol device that reduces installation costs, helps manage energy costs, and improve the comfort of spaces.
In the face of a challenging global environment, we have demonstrably improved our company and its performance.
We have demonstrated our ability to grow sales through innovation and our ability to service our customers.
We've improved our gross profit margins through product and productivity improvements.
We have improved our operating profit margin by leveraging our costs, we have allocated capital efficiently through reinvestment in the business, acquisitions and share repurchase.
We have the talent and the tools to build upon the operating strength we have developed over the last 18 months.
As we look forward, we expect to continue this performance.
We are strategically positioned at the intersection of sustainability and technology.
We have assembled a world-class team.
We have demonstrated the ability to both build and acquire businesses.
We have strong organic cash generation and we have demonstrated that we know what to do with it to create value.
I want to start by recognizing the accomplishments of the team this year.
We have made progress on our transformational priorities, improve the financial performance of the business, and continue to thoughtfully allocate capital.
Our fourth quarter performance was solid.
Net sales were $192 million, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year.
This performance was driven by strong customer demand, improved execution across our go-to-market channels, and the addition of the OSRAM acquisition, which added approximately 200 basis points.
Gross profit margin was 42.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 10 basis points over the prior year, despite rising costs from raw materials, electrical component supply chain interruptions and a significant escalation of freight costs.
We were able to offset the increased costs with higher sales volume, product and productivity improvements and a benefit from price increases.
I'm extremely pleased with the team's execution around our gross profit margin that led to such a great result in a volatile cost environment.
Reported operating profit margin was 13.4% of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 150 basis points over the prior year.
Adjusted operating profit margin was 15.8% of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 110 basis points over the prior year.
The majority of this improvement was driven by the higher gross profit margin and leverage of our operating expenses.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was 21.9% compared with 24.5% in the prior year due to the impact of several discrete items.
Finally, we saw significant improvement in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Diluted earnings per share of $2.72, increased $0.85 or 46% over the prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27 increased $0.92, or 39% over the prior year.
Our share repurchase program favorably impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.24 versus the prior year.
Before I move on to the segment results, I want to highlight a few numbers in our full year 2021 operating results.
Net sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year, driven by improved sales performance in the second half of 2021.
We delivered a full year gross profit margin of 42.6%, an increase of 40 basis points over the prior year.
Reported operating profit margin was 12.4% of net sales for fiscal 2021, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year with adjusted operating profit margin at 14.6% for fiscal 2021, an increase of 90 basis points over the prior year.
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 22.7% compared with 23.5% in the prior year.
We expect this rate to be approximately 23% for the full year in fiscal 2022, excluding any unusual or discrete items and assuming no change to the corporate tax rate.
Diluted earnings per share of $8.38, was 34% increase over the prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.17 was a 23% increase over the prior year.
We had 36.6 million diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2021, with our share repurchase program favorably impacting diluted earnings per share by $0.07 versus the prior year.
Moving onto our segments.
During the quarter, the Lighting and Lighting Controls segment delivered a sales increase of 11% versus the prior year.
This was driven by improvements within our independent sales network, which grew approximately 10% and the direct sales network, which grew about 15% in the current quarter as a direct result of our strong go-to-market efforts as well as recovery in the construction market.
Our corporate accounts channel continued the positive momentum and saw an increase in sales of 16% compared to the prior year, as large retailers move forward with previously deferred renovation spend.
The performance in this channel is dependent upon our customers' renovation cycle and can be uneven quarter to quarter.
Sales in the retail channel declined approximately 20% as compared to the prior year and will continue to be impacted through the remainder of the calendar year as a result of a customer inventory rebalancing.
The retail channel continues to be an attractive channel for Acuity.
During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of OSRAM's DS business.
The acquisition contributed around 200 basis points of growth to ABL revenue and we expect a similar level of impact in 2022.
Now moving to ABL operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased 23% to $149 million versus $122 million in the prior year, with operating profit margin improving 150 basis points to 15.8%.
Adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 improved 21% versus the prior year with adjusted operating profit margin improving 140 basis points to 16.8%.
2021 was a year of improvement.
To summarize the full year the ABL business saw sales growth of 3% to $3.3 billion versus the prior year and an improvement across profitability metrics.
Operating profit for the full year increased 12% to $476 million versus the prior year with operating profit margin improving 110 basis points to 14.5%.
Adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2021 improved 10% to $515 million versus the prior year and adjusted operating profit margin improved 100 basis points to 15.7%.
Now moving on to the results for our Intelligent Spaces Group.
For the fourth quarter of 2021 sales in spaces increased approximately 24% to $51 million, reflecting continued demand with strength across our building and HVAC controls.
Spaces operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased $3.6 million to $2 million versus the prior year.
Adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $6 million was $3.9 million greater than the prior year as a result of continued sales growth.
The spaces team had a great year.
We recruited an incredible leadership team and broke the business out into a stand-alone segment.
The team ended fiscal 2021 with sales growth of 21% to $190 million versus the prior year.
Operating profit increased $13.8 million to $9.9 million versus the prior year and operating profit margin of 5.2% for fiscal 2021 improved 770 basis points versus the prior year, with adjusted operating profit margin improving 400 basis points to 13.5%.
Now turning to cash flow.
We continue to generate solid cash flow.
The net cash from operating activities for fiscal 2021 was $409 million.
This was a decrease of $96 million or 19% compared to the prior year, largely due to the increase in working capital needed to support the higher level of sales.
We invested $44 million or 1.3% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 and we continue to believe that capital expenditures of around 1.5% of net sales is an appropriate annual level as we head into 2022.
We continue to allocate capital effectively by prioritizing growth investments, M&A, maintaining our dividend, and creating permanent value for shareholders through share repurchases.
During the year, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock for $435 million at an average price of $114 per share.
We have around 3.8 million shares still remaining under our current Board authorization.
I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the most important conversations around our company and offer insight into how we are thinking about them.
This is a complicated global environment and input costs have been changing frequently, for example, freight costs.
I'd like to use this as a window into how we are managing these challenges.
We balance our long term freight contracts, which are favorable costs with additional capacity at current cost to deliver high levels of service to our customers.
We have passed along some of these costs through price increases and we are balancing delivering on our margin expectations and delivering on our most important promise, which is to be the company which our customers can rely upon.
As we head into 2022 we are confident in our businesses and in our team.
We expect ABL to grow net sales in the high single digits for the full year of 2022.
We expect ISG to deliver net sales growth in the mid-teens.
We expect 42% plus annualized gross profit margin for the full year of 2022.
And we believe we can continue to leverage our operating costs as we increase net sales.
Finally, we will continue to allocate capital effectively.
We are transforming our business and focusing on our customers, our investors and our associates.
We enter 2022 a much stronger company and with clear opportunities.
","In Q4 2021, the company reported strong financial performance, with an 11% increase in net sales to $192 million and a rise in gross profit margin to 42.2% despite rising costs. Adjusted operating profit margin improved to 15.8%, driven by higher gross profit margin and operating expense leverage. Diluted earnings per share increased 46% to $2.72, while adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 39% to $3.27. For the full year 2021, net sales increased 4% to $3.5 billion, gross profit margin improved to 42.6%, and both operating profit margin and adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly. The ABL segment drove sales growth of 11% and ABL's operating margin improved 150 basis points to 15.8%. The ISG segment experienced 24% sales growth, contributing to a full-year sales increase of 21%. The company generated $409 million in net cash from operating activities in fiscal 2021 and repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock for $435 million. Looking ahead, the company expects ABL to grow net sales in the high single digits, ISG to deliver mid-teens net sales growth, and an annualized gross profit margin of 42% for the full year 2022. The company emphasizes its commitment to allocate capital effectively and continue transforming its business."
BC_q1_2021.txt,"Please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from these expectations.
All these documents are available on our website at brunswick.com.
Our businesses had a fantastic start to 2021 with a very healthy marine market, strong boating participation and outstanding operating performance, driving historic financial results.
Robust retail demand for our products continues to drive low field inventory levels, with increased production across all our facilities necessary to satisfy orders from our OEM partners and dealer network.
Our teams have performed exceptionally well in the face of supply and transportation headwinds, tighter labor conditions, and continued impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.
And we are excited about our ability to further harness the positive momentum we've generated to propel our growth and industry leadership.
Our Propulsion business continues to deliver outstanding top-line, earnings and margin growth, outperforming the market by leveraging and expanding the strongest product lineup in the industry.
Our parts and accessories businesses delivered strong top-line growth and robust operating margins as a result of increased boating participation, which drove strong aftermarket sales, together with high demand for our full range of OEM systems and services, as boat manufacturers attempt to satisfy retail demand.
Our boat business performed well, as anticipated, in the quarter, reaching double-digit adjusted operating margins for the first time in over 20 years.
Despite elevated production levels consistent with our plans for the year, the continued surge in retail demand is still driving historically low pipeline inventory levels, with 41% fewer boats in dealer inventory at the end of the first quarter, versus the same time last year.
Finally Freedom Boat Club has had an extremely busy start to the year, which I will discuss further in a couple of slides.
We have exceptional momentum as we enter the prime retail season in most markets, and as you can see from our significant guidance increase, we are confident in our ability to perform for the rest of the year and well beyond.
Before we discuss the results for the quarter, I wanted to share with you some updated insights from 2020 concerning our boat buyers and Freedom Boat Club members that reflect very favorable trends for the future of our business.
We continue to outperform the industry in attracting new, younger and more diverse boaters, positioning us for very strong growth in the years to come.
Last year, Brunswick's average boat buyer age was two years younger than the industry average and reached its lowest level in over a decade.
Additionally, Brunswick's first-time boat buyers averaged five years younger than our overall boat buyer demographic, and three years younger than the industry.
Equally encouraging was the fact that the percentage of Brunswick female boat buyers in 2020, while still a minority, equaled the highest percentage on record and first-time female boat buyers entered at double that rate, which was a notable 700 basis points higher than the industry.
In Freedom Boat Club, we saw even more promising trends with the average Freedom member being almost three years younger than our typical boat buying customer, and female Freedom members making up 35% of our member base in 2020 and 2021.
These trends are an extremely important validation of our strategy to secure a healthy future for Brunswick and are also favorable for the entire marine industry.
I also wanted to briefly update you on some very important awards and milestones for Brunswick during the first quarter, which are important in positioning Brunswick for investors and employees, and our ability to secure top new talent.
I am pleased to announce that for the second consecutive year, Brunswick has been recognized by Forbes as one of the Best Employers for Diversity.
Those recognized were chosen based on an independent survey of over 50,000 employees working for companies employing at least 1,000 people in their U.S. operations.
Diversity and inclusion are cornerstones of our culture and a source of innovation and inspiration for our Company.
We also published our 2020 Sustainability Report at the end of March which reviews the exceptional progress we have achieved against our sustainability goals, including our prioritization of the health and safety of our employees.
In 2020, we reported the lowest recordable incident rate in Company history, in the face of immense challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
And I also wanted to share with you a snapshot of what the return to in-person boat shows looks like.
The Palm Beach International Boat Show was recently held for the first time since the Spring of 2019.
This was the first major in-person saltwater show of the 2021 season and the outcomes were very positive.
Attendance was up and our brands outperformed the broader marine industry.
Over the course of the four-day show, Sea Ray and Boston Whaler more than doubled the number of boats sold this year vs.
2019 and revenues more than tripled, driven by increased demand for the recently launched models.
Consumers were also able to see Mercury's V-12 600 horsepower Verado in person for the first time, with many eager to repower their boats with this new, game changing engine.
I'll now provide some first quarter highlights on our segments and the overall marine market.
Our Propulsion business continues to gain significant retail market share in outboard engines, especially in higher horsepower categories where we have focused higher levels of investment in recent years.
Mercury gained share in each horsepower category over 50 horsepower in the first quarter, with outsized gains in nodes in excess of 200 horsepower.
As I mentioned earlier, Mercury launched its new 600 horsepower, V-12 Verado engine in February at Lake X in Florida to much fanfare.
Many OEM partners, including Fountain, Scout, Viking and Tiara, and our own Boston Whaler and Sea Ray brands, have already designed boats with this engine in mind and are taking orders.
Many models are already sold out for 2021, with twin-, triple- or even quad-configurations being very popular with both OEMs and customers.
New or enhanced OEM relationships, along with significant investments in new technology, have also helped fuel the continued growth in Mercury's industry-leading controls, rigging and propeller businesses.
As Mercury's growth continues to accelerate, we regularly review our capacity requirements to ensure we are able to meet projected demand and fully capitalize on future growth opportunities.
In this regard, we anticipate having to pull ahead some additional capacity actions.
Our Parts and Accessories businesses also experienced significant top-line and earnings growth in the quarter as aftermarket sales remain elevated due to strong participation trends and service needs, with increased OEM orders to keep up with production resulting from the accelerating retail demand.
Our dealer network reports that their service centers are busier than ever, with the strong participation trends from 2020 continuing into 2021.
In addition, favorable weather conditions in many parts of the U.S. are enabling consumers to return to the water early and in force.
This demand drives the need for aftermarket service parts and a healthy distribution network to get dealers the products they need on a same-day or next-day basis.
The Advanced Systems Group, which has a larger OEM component to its business and also serves some non-marine segments demonstrated significant growth across all its product categories and delivered strong operating margins that were accretive to the overall segment.
Our boat segment had an outstanding quarter, with successful execution of its product plan, resulting in strong revenue and earnings growth, together with double-digit operating margins.
Given the continued retail demand surge, 95% of our production slots are now sold for the calendar year, with many Whaler, Sea Ray and other models now sold out at wholesale well into 2022.
Pipeline inventory, which Ryan will discuss in more detail in a few slides, remains at historically low levels, and we continue to hire additional workers at most facilities to ramp up production consistent with our stated plan.
We remain on track with our plans to reopen and staff the Palm Coast facility and expand our operations at Reynosa and Portugal.
However, it remains very unlikely that pipelines will be significantly rebuilt until 2023 at the earliest.
Freedom Boat Club also continues to exceed our growth expectations, now with over 40,000 memberships and 280 locations, which is more than 100 new locations since we acquired Freedom in 2019.
Freedom has been expanding both through acquisition and organic growth in 2021.
We acquired franchise operations in major boating markets including Chicago and New York, and opened our first location in the U.K. As a reminder, having company operated locations allows us to gain the full economic benefits of the territories, and allows us to increase investment to enable faster growth.
In addition, company operated locations provide the opportunity to get close to the end boating consumer and allow us to enhance our other offerings including Boateka and our F and I businesses.
The outstanding operational and financial performance I have been discussing has not been without some external challenges that our businesses continue to manage and mitigate, sometimes on a daily basis.
Our supply chain teams in particular performed exceptionally well.
Winter storms and resulting power outages in the Central and Southern United States affected oil-based product production and supply, including our third-party producers of resin and foam, while tight semiconductor supply, raw material shortages, and transportation disruption, and resulting cost increases, continue to present challenges to our businesses to varying degrees.
However, the global reach of our supply network and our unique scale in the marine industry, together with our purposeful vertical integration, have so far enabled us to mitigate these challenges and keep our production plans on track for 2021.
Finally, labor conditions remain tight in many locations in which we manufacture product, but our talent acquisition teams have been working hard and successfully to add manufacturing and other talent to our teams as we increase production.
Next, I would like to review the sales performance of our business by region on a constant currency basis.
First quarter sales increased in each region, with international sales up 42% and sales in the U.S. up 47%.
International growth was very strong across all regions, with continued strength in Europe and Asia-Pacific contributing to growth in propulsion and P&A sales.
Canada continued its trend from the back half of 2020 with significant sales growth in all three segments.
This table provides more color on the recent performance of the US marine retail market.
All boat categories reported retail gains in the first quarter, continuing the momentum from 2020.
The main powerboat segments were up 34% in the quarter, with Brunswick's unit retail performance ahead of market growth rates, especially in outboard boat categories.
Outboard engine unit registrations were up 21% in the first quarter, with Mercury significantly outperforming the market and taking market share as I discussed earlier.
As we enter the primary selling season in the U.S., lead generation, finance applications, dealer sentiment and other leading indicators all remain very positive.
In addition, similar to our comments on previous calls, at the end of March, our percentage of dealer orders received with a customer name already attached is approximately three times the percentage from the same time last year.
All these factors give us high confidence in the continuing strength of the retail market as we move through 2021.
Our first quarter results were outstanding.
Year-over-year comparisons are not particularly helpful given the significant COVID impact starting in March of last year, but our performance in the quarter stands on its own against any quarter from the last two decades.
First quarter net sales were up 48%, while operating earnings on an as adjusted basis increased by 116%.
Adjusted operating margins were 17% and adjusted earnings per share was $2.24, each being the highest mark for any quarter for which we have available records.
Sales in each segment benefited from strong global demand for marine products, with earnings positively impacted by the increased sales, favorable factory absorption from increased production, and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher variable compensation costs.
Finally, we had free cash flow usage of $23 million in the first quarter as we built inventory ahead of the prime retail selling season, which is very favorable versus free cash flow usages of $144 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $159 million in Q1 of 2019.
Revenue in the Propulsion business increased 47% as each product category experienced strong demand and market share gains.
All customer channels showed growth in the quarter as boat manufacturers continued to ramp up production, and increased capacity enabled continued elevated sales to the independent OEM, dealer and international channels.
Operating margins and operating earnings were up significantly in the quarter, benefiting from positive customer mix in addition to the factors positively affecting all our businesses.
In our Parts and Accessories segment, revenues increased 52% and adjusted operating earnings were up 83% versus first quarter 2020 due to strong sales growth across all product categories.
Adjusted operating margins of 21.3% were 350 basis points better than the prior year quarter, with strong sales increases, together with favorable sales mix, driving the robust increase in adjusted operating earnings.
Continuing the theme from 2020, this aftermarket-driven, annuity-based business is benefiting from more boaters on the water, which is being augmented by flexible work schedules allowing for more leisure time, with the OEM component of the business leveraging investments in technology to take advantage of strong demand from boat builders as they increase production.
In our boat segment, sales were up 44%, with 31% adjusted operating leverage resulting in 10.9% margins for the quarter.
Each brand had strong operational performances and contributed to the successful results, with Lund and Boston Whaler leading the gains in the premium brands, and Bayliner having another strong quarter as a mid-tier value brand.
Although it's only one quarter above our stated goal of double-digit margins, this is the third consecutive quarter of margins above 9%, and we believe that we can continue this trend throughout the year and beyond.
Operating earnings were also positively impacted by the increased sales and the lower retail discount levels versus 2020.
Freedom Boat Club, which Dave discussed earlier, contributed approximately two percent of the segment's revenue, at a margin profile that continues to be accretive to the segment.
Our boat production continues to ramp consistent with our plans to produce in excess of 38,000 units during the year.
Despite producing approximately 9,400 units in the quarter, which is up 16% from the 4th quarter of 2020, we only added a few hundred units to dealer inventories given the continued robust retail market.
Our boat brands ended March with just under 19 weeks of boats on hand, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, with units in the field lower by 41% versus same time last year.
We continue to believe that our current manufacturing footprint will support the production necessary to satisfy the anticipated 2021 retail demand, but we continue to work with our brands to unlock additional near-term capacity through automation, labor and select capital initiatives, including the capacity actions announced earlier in the year related to our Palm Coast, Reynosa and Portugal facilities, which will begin providing benefits by the end of the year.
As a result of historically low product pipelines and continued very strong boating participation, including in many northern regions in recent weeks due to the early Spring, production levels remain elevated across all our businesses to both satisfy retail demand and to rebuild product pipelines.
These factors, together with our strong pipeline of new products and outstanding operational performance, continue to provide enhanced clarity on our ability to drive growth in upcoming periods, resulting in the following guidance for full-year 2021.
We anticipate U.S. Marine industry retail unit demand to grow mid-to-high single-digit percent versus 2020; net sales between $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion, adjusted operating margin growth between 130 and 170 basis points, operating expenses as a percent of sales to remain lower than 2020, free cash flow in excess of $425 million; and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.30 to $7.60.
We're also providing directional guidance regarding the second quarter, where we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 50% over the second quarter of 2020, with adjusted operating leverage in the low-20s percent.
As we look to the second half of the year, despite extremely challenging comparisons to 2020, we still believe that we will deliver top-line and earnings growth over the second half of last year.
I will conclude with an update on certain items that will impact our P&L and cash flow for the remainder of 2021.
The only significant update relates to the working capital usage for the year.
Projected increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable are exceeding anticipated increases in accounts receivable, resulting in a lower working capital build throughout the year.
We now estimate a working capital increase of $80 million to $100 million for 2021, which together with the higher anticipated earnings, results in a stronger free cash flow projection of $425 million.
Our capital strategy assumptions, however, have been augmented in places to take advantage of our stronger, early year cash position.
We still plan to retire approximately $100 million of our long-term debt obligations, as we repaid $9 million in the first quarter and $60 million already in April.
We repurchased $16 million of shares in the quarter, and plan to continue our systematic approach throughout the year.
We anticipate spending $250 million to $270 million on capital expenditures in the year to support, and in some cases accelerate, growth initiatives throughout our organization.
This slightly increased spending will be directed to new product investments in all of our businesses, cost reduction and automation projects, and select additional capacity initiatives to support demand and future growth, primarily in the Propulsion business.
We are also raising our dividend, for the ninth straight year, to $0.335 cents a share, or a 24% increase, as our strong cash position enables us to raise our dividend earlier in the year than usual, and keep our payout ratio close to our target 20% to 25% range, and continue to provide strong returns to our shareholders.
Finally, we've had a busy start to the year with M&A activity, primarily in expanding Freedom Boat Club as Dave discussed earlier.
Completed deals to date will have an immaterial impact on 2021 results, but we remain active in several areas including P&A, Freedom and ACES and intend to close additional deals throughout the year.
As we discussed on our January call, we felt that 2021 was setting up to be an outstanding year for all of our businesses and the first quarter did not disappoint.
The combination of robust consumer demand during the quarter and solid operational execution by our businesses has us squarely on track to deliver against our operating and strategic priorities.
Our top priority for the Propulsion segment continues to be satisfying outboard engine demand from new and existing OEM customers and expanding market share, especially in the dealer, saltwater, repower and international channels.
We are continuing to invest heavily in new product introductions and industry-leading propulsion solutions that we project will enable top-line and earnings growth far into the future.
Our Parts and Accessories segment remains focused on optimizing its global operating model to leverage its distribution and position of product strength in the areas of advanced battery technology, digital systems, and connected products in support of our ACES strategy.
We will continue to focus our M&A activity in this area as we look for opportunities to further build out our technology and systems portfolio.
The Boat segment will build on its first quarter successes by continuing to focus on operational excellence, improving operating margins, launching new products, executing capacity expansion plans, and refilling pipelines in a very robust retail environment.
Lastly, we remain keenly focused on accelerating the Company's ACES strategy, building on our connectivity and shared access initiatives, but also in the areas of autonomy, where we recently announced a new partnership with Carnegie Robotics, and in marine electrification, where we plan a portfolio of new products.
We will also continue to advance our ESG and DEI strategies across the company.
As we have done with past investor days, we have gathered our business leaders to provide you with an update to our 2022 strategy that was originally presented in February of 2020 in Miami, as well as to discuss certain longer-term initiatives that will grow and differentiate Brunswick through the next decade.
We will also hold a Q&A session for investors to ask questions of our management team on Monday, May 17th at noon Central Daylight Time.
Just a reminder that while we will not be providing a full financial update during this event, Ryan will be providing an abbreviated update on our 2022 financial targets, which will include further details regarding the substantial increase of our 2022 earnings per share target to between $8.25 and $8.75 per share as announced today.
Your hard work has enabled us to seamlessly execute our strategic plan and significantly outpace our initial growth and profit expectations.
","Brunswick Corporation's Q1 2021 earnings report showcased a robust performance driven by strong market demand and operational excellence. Propulsion, Parts & Accessories, and Boat segments all experienced significant growth, with the Boat segment reaching double-digit adjusted operating margins for the first time in over 20 years. Freedom Boat Club continues to expand rapidly, with over 40,000 memberships and plans for further acquisition and organic growth in 2021. Despite supply chain and labor challenges, Brunswick's teams have successfully mitigated these issues and maintained production plans. The company remains confident in its ability to meet the projected demand, having increased its 2021 guidance to a net sales range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, adjusted operating margin growth between 130 and 170 basis points, and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.60. Brunswick is also accelerating its ACES strategy (Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared Access) to capitalize on future growth opportunities and invest in new product introductions and capacity expansion plans."
FLR_q1_2021.txt,"There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially.
You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in our Form 10-Q filed earlier today.
Before we get started on operational results, one of the strategic priorities outlined during our Strategy Day was to foster a high-performance culture with purpose.
And I'm pleased to announce that we have appointed Tolani Azis, a six-year Fluor employee with 20 years of EPC experience, to lead our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Fluor is a vast and diverse company, and with Tolani's leadership, she will help us retain, attract and cultivate a workforce that represents the world in which we live and operate.
On a separate subject, please note that earlier this week, a favorable motion was granted as it relates to an outstanding securities class action lawsuit.
This motion dismissed with prejudice all allegations, except those relating to a single statement in 2015 about one gas-fired power project.
While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this remaining allegation, we do not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred.
It's been great to see the vaccine rollout around the globe, and I'm particularly encouraged at the speed of distribution here in the United States.
Although there are still many regional challenges to deal with, the end of the pandemic seems to be in sight, which will be a relief to all of us.
Currently, well over 90% of our project sites and about 80% of our offices are operating at limited operations or better.
One exception is our office in New Delhi, where a surge in COVID cases has caused local officials to issue a lockdown and curfew order effective until May 10.
The safety and well-being of all employees is our top priority.
To help support our Delhi colleagues and families that are in medical need, we airlifted several oxygen concentrators from Houston.
Our 1,500 New Delhi employees are all now working safely and productively from home.
In the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.25, with new awards led by the Dos Bocas in our Energy Solutions Group.
While we continue to see softness in the markets when it comes to capital spending, we anticipate that awards will start to pick up as we get into the back half of 2021.
And our teams are busy on front-end work and project pursuits that will help to build a healthy backlog over the next few years.
Note again that we are now reporting in line with our three new business segments: Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions and Mission Solutions.
Additionally, Stork is now a part of discontinued operations.
Joe will give an update on our divestitures of Stork and AMECO in just a few minutes.
Moving to Slide 5, with regard to NuScale's.
On April 5, we announced a $40 million equity contribution from JGC.
We know JGC well, having executed projects with them for more than 10 years.
They are an ideal partner that could support NuScale's industry-leading carbon-free energy solution.
This is consistent with the strategy announced in January to reduce Fluor's equity ownership of NuScale.
Regarding our cost savings initiative, efforts are now well under way to streamline the organization.
We will be updating you on our progress as the year proceeds.
Key to this program will be ensuring the deployment of world-class execution teams onto new prospects over the coming quarters, coupled with the proper level of fit-for-purpose back-office support.
I'd like to take the next few minutes to inform you on what is happening across our end markets and what we expect to see over the next few quarters.
In Energy Solutions, this quarter, our ICA Fluor joint venture was awarded three contracts totaling $2.8 billion for the PEMEX Dos Bocas refinery in Mexico.
We have a long and successful history of PEMEX contracts, and we are pleased to be adding our $1.4 billion share of this refinery program to backlog.
During the quarter, a chemicals project was canceled.
And as a result, we removed approximately $1 billion from backlog while slightly increasing Energy Solutions total backlog to $11.1 billion.
When we unveiled our strategy in January, there was a lot of interest in Fluor's energy transition opportunities, supporting a reduced carbon future.
Over the past few months, we've been in extensive conversations with clients about our energy transition capabilities.
We are executing several carbon capture FEED and feasibility studies using our proprietary Econamine FG plus technology.
Additionally, we are doing early work in the areas of refinery efficiency, gasification to produce carbon-negative energy, green hydrogen, renewable diesel, renewable jet fuel and energy storage.
In each of these areas, we have identified projects and are continuing to pursue new opportunities as well.
I encourage all of you to check out the project website and social media channels to see our progress on the project.
On site, we have completed all site preparation work.
The Cedar Valley Lodge camp is filling up, pilings are in place and -- overseas -- modules are being constructed in the fab yards.
We've been remobilizing craft workers on site and are currently at required staffing levels.
In 2021, the focus on site is completing the installation of underground cable and pipe as well as concrete foundations.
This will allow the project team to go vertical and be positioned for the receipt of large equipment and the first modules which are scheduled to arrive later this year.
COVID-19 and changes in law have impacted both engineering and material deliveries as well as the site's ability to mobilize workers due to public health orders.
However, several opportunities are being jointly explored with the client to mitigate the COVID-19 and change in law impacts.
We will keep you updated on the outcome of these discussions.
Moving to Urban Solutions on Slide 8.
This segment is comprised of the infrastructure, mining and metals and advanced technologies and life sciences end markets.
In infrastructure, we completed the handover for the 183 South Highway project outside of Austin, just a few miles from the Oak Hill Parkway project we booked in 2020.
There is obviously a lot of interest and excitement with the proposed federal infrastructure plan.
We think a long-term infrastructure bill would obviously be a good thing for the U.S. economy.
In addition to providing needed funding for surface transportation improvements, it would enable state and local governments to better plan for future growth and capacity needs.
It's too soon to tell what impact the bill could have on Fluor, but we typically experience a two- to three-quarter lag between any new federal infrastructure spending and the release of construction and services RFPs within the states.
Within our infrastructure-focused area of regional projects in selected states, we are tracking some key opportunities in Texas and North Carolina this year.
Next, we remain confident in our mining and metals opportunities and prospects.
We are currently completing FEED work that represents $20 billion of potential projects, and we see a robust pipeline of FEED and feasibility studies ahead of us.
These projects will support an increasingly urbanized and electrified world that is driving the need for investment in minerals like copper and lithium.
We have several large prospects in 2021 and expect awards throughout the year.
For our last group in Urban Solutions, we have a lot of positive momentum in advanced technologies and life sciences, as we briefly mentioned in February.
In the first quarter, we won a significant EPCM biotech project in Europe.
This award from Fujifilm is for a world-scale biologics drug substance manufacturing facility that will be used to produce a variety of treatments, including vaccines.
As we have seen over the last 18 months, vaccine development is an integral part of our global economy, and facilities like this one will be essential going forward in protecting the population.
Finally, there's been a lot of news recently about the inability of semiconductor chip manufacturers to increase production to meet demand.
While it will take several months for the supply chain to overcome this shortage, this is another area where we can leverage our advanced manufacturing capabilities.
Currently, we are tracking several semiconductor prospects in the United States.
Moving to Mission Solutions on Slide 10.
This quarter, our Fluor-led joint venture won an extension for the Portsmouth decontamination and decommissioning contract from the Department of Energy in Ohio.
This reimbursable 12-month contract with two six-month options is valued at $690 million.
The DOE is a key long-term client, and we look forward to continuing our support at Portsmouth.
And finally, a few weeks ago, the federal government announced that it was -- would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by September 11.
Although uncertainty about the pace of withdrawal remains, Fluor expects to book an additional three-month extension to LOGCAP IV in the second quarter that will allow us to further support the U.S. Army in Afghanistan until they are demobilized.
Peter is the last of a long line of family members to serve the company since our founding in 1912.
Joining the Board in 1984, he continued the Fluor family legacy of a commitment to excellence, integrity and ethics, always putting the safety and well-being of employees first and recognizing that teamwork is a key component of our success.
For the first quarter of 2021, we are reporting adjusted earnings per share of $0.07.
As a reminder, we are adjusting out NuScale expenses, foreign exchange fluctuations, impairments and certain legal-related costs.
Our adjusted results also exclude an embedded foreign currency derivative for an Energy Solutions project in Mexico.
This derivative is based on exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso and will fluctuate over the life of the contract or at least until the job has been fully procured.
Our overall segment profit for the quarter was $60 million or 2% and includes the $29 million embedded derivative in Energy Solutions and quarterly NuScale expenses of $15 million.
This compares favorably to $55 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Removing NuScale expenses and the effect of the embedded derivative would improve our total segment profit margin to 3.6%.
Margins in Energy Solutions and Urban Solutions reflect reduced execution activity on certain projects and the lack of new awards to replace projects we are completing.
We anticipate project activities will accelerate as we move through 2021.
In Mission Solutions, margins were strong due to the increased execution activity on DOE projects as well as an increase in performance scores on several projects.
As David mentioned, we received a $40 million investment in NuScale from JGC this quarter and are anticipating other significant investments in the near future.
Note here that even though partners are meeting NuScale's cash needs, we will continue to expense 100% of this investment on our income statement on a consolidated basis.
Our G&A expense in the quarter was $66 million.
This is higher than our expected run rate due to the increase in our stock price driven -- driving up the value of our executive compensation expense.
As David said, our cost savings initiative is well under way.
We have identified cost savings above the $100 million target previously discussed.
I look forward to providing an update on the progress as we get into the execution phase later this year and transition into a fit-for-purpose organization.
On Slide 12, our ending cash for the quarter was $2 billion, 25% of this domestically available.
As a reminder, the rest of our cash is tied up in either VIEs in projects or in foreign accounts and is not easily accessible.
Our operating cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $231 million and was negatively impacted by increased funding of COVID costs on our projects, higher cash payments of corporate G&A, including the timing and extent of employee bonuses, and increased tax payments.
While it is typical to have a lower operating cash flow in the first quarter, we expect full year operating cash flow to be positive.
We used approximately $50 million in cash for challenged legacy projects in the first quarter.
As I stated in February, we expect to spend an additional $65 million over the balance of 2021 to fund these projects.
As we announced earlier this week, we have divested our AMECO North America business for $73 million.
This follows our successful transaction of our AMECO Jamaica business last year.
We are now focusing on our South American assets, and we'll update you on that plan later in 2021.
The store divestiture process is well under way, and we have received interest from a number of promising buyers.
We are working through our diligence and are targeting a sale near the end of this year or early in 2022.
Please move to Slide 13.
We are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $0.50 and $0.80 for the full year.
Hitting this target is dependent on projects being awarded in a timely fashion and revenue picking up over the next two quarters.
We are also maintaining our previous segment level guidance and expect 2021 full year segment margins to be approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in Energy Solutions, which excludes any fluctuation from the embedded foreign currency derivative; 2% to 3% in Urban Solutions; and 2.5% to 3% in Mission Solutions.
We have posted unaudited financials for 2019 and 2020 that aligns with our new reporting structure on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Operator, we are now ready for our first question.
","Fluor reported adjusted EPS of $0.07 for Q1 2021, excluding NuScale expenses, foreign exchange fluctuations, impairments, legal costs, and an embedded foreign currency derivative. The company maintained its EPS guidance of $0.50 to $0.80 for the year, anticipating an uptick in awards and revenue in the second half. Energy Solutions contributed $60 million in segment profit, while Urban Solutions and Mission Solutions saw higher margins due to increased execution activity and performance scores. Fluor announced a $40 million equity investment in NuScale from JGC and plans to sell off its AMECO South American assets and Stork by year-end or early 2022. The company remains optimistic about energy transition opportunities and is pursuing projects in carbon capture, refinery efficiency, green hydrogen, and renewable energy."
APH_q4_2020.txt,"This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, Our CEO.
I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends.
Then we will take questions.
The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively.
Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically.
Breaking down sales into our two segments.
The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
For the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019.
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020.
In the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020.
For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019 and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019.
This 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and results -- resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year.
Given the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the Company's performance.
Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment.
The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019.
For the full year, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively.
On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% -- 24.5%.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019.
This was a strong performance considering the significant challenges and related incremental costs related -- resulting from the pandemic.
Orders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 to 1.
The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.
We are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the Company.
Cash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter, or 124% of net income.
Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million, or 104% of net income.
Cash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion, or approximately 132% of net income.
And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion, or 110% of net income.
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within a normal range.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million.
Total debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion.
Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion plus the availability under our credit facilities.
Fourth quarter and full year 2020 EBITDA was approximately $600 million and $2 billion, respectively.
And at December 31, 2020, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 times.
Lastly, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be effective as of March 4, 2021.
First, I just want to express my hope that all of you on the call here today that you, your family, your friends and colleagues are all staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic.
I'm going to highlight our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year.
As Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets.
Now, with respect to the fourth quarter and amid what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance.
Sales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record $2.426 billion.
This organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets in particular.
The Company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter and that's a strong book-to-bill of 1.04 to 1.
Despite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year.
Craig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the Company, very strong at $441 million and $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter.
Both just excellent reflections of the quality of the Company's earnings.
I just want to say, with this fourth quarter how proud I am of our team around the world.
And our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amid the environment that still has continued challenges.
Our small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January.
As we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors, for $58.50 a share.
The MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals, as well as customary closing conditions.
In addition, last week we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Tool Works, under which ITW will acquire MTS' Test & Simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS.
The sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
We continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS, as well as the follow-on sale of the Test & Simulation business to ITW, will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021.
I can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding technology and deep entrepreneurial culture of MTS Sensors and look forward to welcoming this wonderful team of people into the Amphenol family.
This acquisition, which is highly complementary to our current sensor offering, represents a further broadening of our high technology sensor offering to customers across the automotive, industrial, military and commercial air industries.
We expect the addition of MTS Sensors to add approximately $350 million in revenues and to generate approximately $0.10 per share of earnings accretion in the first year post closing.
Now here in the last few weeks of January, we're also pleased to have closed two additional acquisitions of outstanding entrepreneurial companies, which we purchased for a combined price of $160 million.
First, Positronic is a provider of high reliability harsh environment connectors for customers primarily in the military aerospace, IT datacom and industrial markets.
Based in Springfield, Missouri and with also operations in France, India and Singapore, and with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Positronic represents a great addition to our harsh environment product offering.
Next El-Cab, which is based in Poland, is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and related interconnect products, primarily serving the industrial market and with annual sales of approximately $55 million.
What I'm very pleased by is that both Positronic and El-Cab are private, family owned companies with rich histories, leading technologies and excellent positions with customers in their target markets.
Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the Company.
Now, if we just look back on 2020 and some of the highlights from the year, despite the many challenges we all faced in 2020, from both a personal and a professional standpoint, Amphenol's dedicated entrepreneurial team performed just incredibly well.
And I just could not be more proud of our performance this year.
Sales reached a record $8.6 billion, growing 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and actually surpassed our pre-pandemic outlook that we had given back a year ago.
Our full year adjusted operating margins of 19.2%, did decline 80 basis points from prior year, but this decline was due to the significant cost challenges we experienced in the first half of 2020, after which our team was able to return to more typical profit levels in the second half.
And that enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.74, which was the same level as we achieved in 2019.
No question, an impressive result given the circumstances.
We generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.592 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively.
Excellent confirmations of the Company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management, even in these most unprecedented of times.
Our acquisition program remains strong, despite the challenges related to the pandemic, with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2020, EXA Thermometrics and Onanon, as well as Positronic and El-Cab here in January and the signing of MTS that we already discussed.
These acquisitions expand our position across a broad array of technologies and markets, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization.
We're particularly excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the Company's future performance.
In addition, in 2020, we bought back over 6 million shares under our buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend to 16%.
And as Craig mentioned, we're announcing today, a 2-for-1 stock split of the Company's shares.
So, while the overall market environment in 2020 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can now drive superior long-term performance.
Now turning to our -- the trends and our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the Company's balanced and broad end-market diversification continues to create value for the Company, with no single end-market representing more than 22% of our sales in the year 2020.
We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets.
That was particularly important here in 2020, but while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.
The military market represented a 11% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year.
Sales in the quarter grew modestly from prior year, increasing by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, with growth in naval, space and avionics applications offset in part by moderations in ground vehicles, rotorcraft and airframe.
Sequentially, our sales increased as we had expected coming into the quarter by 3%.
For the full year 2020, our sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production disruptions that we experienced in the first half of 2020.
Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease modestly from these fourth quarter levels.
I just want to say that our organization working in the military market has worked long and hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market.
Our performance in 2020, especially given the many disruptions related to the pandemic, is a great reflection of the results of those efforts.
Given the ongoing and favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demands of our customers by supporting the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.
The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% of our sales for the full year.
Not surprisingly, fourth quarter sales were down significantly, reducing by approximately 50%, as the commercial air market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft, due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry.
Sequentially, our sales were a little bit better than expected, declining 10% from the third quarter and for the full year 2020, sales declined by 34%, reflecting that significant impact of the pandemic on travel and aircraft production.
Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels.
Look, there is no doubt that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry, which is seriously impacting the market for commercial airplanes.
Nevertheless, our team, who has just been so resilient over the course of this year, remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms, as well as next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes and we remain well positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth.
The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and in the full year of 2020.
Our sales in this market significantly exceeded expectations that we had coming into the quarter, increased by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year.
This robust growth was driven, especially by the battery and electric vehicle, instrumentation, heavy equipment, factory automation and medical segments of the industrial market.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the third quarter.
We're really pleased with our results in industrial for the full year, with sales growing 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we saw strong demand in really those same markets, battery and EV, instrumentation, heavy equipment, also alternative energy and of course, medical, which was a very strong segment in the year.
Looking into the first quarter, we expect a slight moderation from the strong fourth quarter sales levels.
I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment or managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital goods and next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen during the pandemic.
The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2020.
Sales in this market were also much stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically in the fourth quarter, and that was really driven by broad-based growth across all geographies in the automotive market.
Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 22% as we continue to benefit from the broad recovery in the global automotive market.
For the full year 2020, our sales declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically.
And that really reflected the significant challenges in factory shutdowns experienced by the auto industry in the first half of the year related to the pandemic, but was partially offset by our strong recovery that we drove in the second half.
Looking into 2021, we do expect a sequential moderation from these high sales levels in the first quarter.
Look, no doubt about it, the automotive industry faced one of the most difficult periods in recent memory, during the first half of 2020, in particular in the second quarter, and that was followed by an unexpectedly robust recovery here in the second half.
I'm just so proud of our team working in this important market, who has clearly demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, secured the Company's position with our customers across the automotive market.
Regardless of this most dynamic of years, we have continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional fuel and electric-powered vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world.
This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us long into the future.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 15% of our sales for the full year.
Our sales in the quarter to mobile device customers increased by a much stronger-than-expected 32% from prior year, with strength in all product types, but particularly in wearables and laptops.
Sequentially, our sales increased by 15% and that was driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices.
For the full year 2020, sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 16%, as we continued to benefit from our agility in reacting to changes in demand in this dynamic market.
For the full year, we saw particularly strong sales growth in products incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories as well as production-related products, and that was offset in part by a slight moderation of sales of products incorporated into smartphones.
Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typically significant seasonal sequential decline of approximately 40%.
While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond.
Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, all positioning us well for the long term.
The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and 6% of our sales for the full year of 2020.
Sales in the quarter decreased from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with declines in sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as operators.
Sequentially, our sales did increase by a bit less than we had expected, 12%.
For the full year 2020, sales declined by 16% from prior year, which reflected the impact of the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese customers that had been imposed in 2019, as well as other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase from this quarter's levels, as operators expand their investments in next-generation mobile networks.
Regardless of the challenging demand environment in the mobile networks market in 2020, we're confident in the Company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry.
Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks.
And as customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world.
The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year of 2020.
Sales in the quarter was stronger than expected, rising by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year, as stronger sales of networking equipment and server-related products were offset by lower sales of storage-related products.
Sequentially, our sales declined by 8% from our very robust third quarter.
We're very pleased with our performance for the full year for IT datacom, with our sales growing a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we capitalized on increased demand from our OEM and service provider customers, as they work to accelerate bandwidth capacity expansions, in particular to support home-based work, school and entertainment.
Our team working in support of these customers has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products.
At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop that broad range of leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world.
Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a typical seasonal moderation of sales here in the quarter.
But nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market.
Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power.
In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom.
The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year.
Sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from our broadband operators.
On a sequential basis, sales decreased as expected by 9% from the third quarter.
For the full year of 2020, sales were flat and that's despite the significant disruptions to production and demand that we experienced in the first quarter, offset by the accelerated investments in support of bandwidth later in the year.
Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and we remain encouraged by the Company's position in the broadband market.
With our expanded range of products, together with strong relationships with customers around the world, we look forward to benefiting as operators increase their network investments in the future.
Now just to summarize, there is no question that 2020 was one of the most challenging years we've all experienced.
But in the face of these challenges, I'm just so proud of the entire team of Amphenolians around the world, who have managed extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic and the related disruptions to the economy.
Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the Company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance.
Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and I can say, most importantly in this pandemic-impacted 2020, an agile and entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to our outlook and regardless of our strong performance in the fourth quarter, there still remains significant economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Accordingly, we will not be providing full year guidance at this time.
Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.120 billion to $2.180 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.90 to $0.94.
I would just note that on a post-split basis, this adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance would be $0.45 to $0.47.
This guidance represents sales growth in the first quarter of 14% to 17% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 27% to 32%, again compared to the first quarter of 2020.
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our position and expand our profitability.
Our entire organization remains committed to delivering strong financial results, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.
","Amphenol reported record fourth-quarter 2020 revenue of $2.426 billion, with organic growth of 11%. Sales were driven by mobile devices, industrial, and automotive end markets, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by 15% year-over-year to $1.13 and diluted GAAP earnings per share reaching $1.15. Despite pandemic-related challenges, the Company's full-year adjusted operating margin remained at 19.2%, with adjusted diluted earnings per share remaining unchanged at $3.74 compared to 2019, reflecting the strength of the Company's performance and cost management. Amphenol continues to expand its product offerings through acquisitions, including MTS Systems, Positronic, and El-Cab, and has announced a 2-for-1 stock split. For the first quarter of 2021, the Company expects sales growth of 14-17% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 27-32% compared to the same period in 2020."
OXM_q1_2021.txt,"Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to fiscal 2019 results.
We are extremely pleased to be reporting an incredibly strong start to fiscal 2021.
We took decisive actions at the start of the pandemic to protect our people, our brands and our liquidity.
This combined with our focus over the past year on delivering happiness to our customers and investing in enhanced digital, marketing and store capabilities, as well as in our bars and restaurants, have strengthened our foundation for profitable growth.
As consumers have become increasingly more comfortable returning to physical shopping, our overall engagement levels have greatly accelerated, leading to strong momentum across our entire portfolio of brands.
Given conditions last year, it is not surprising that we were able to post strong sales gains across all brands and all channels of distribution during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
What's much more impressive about our first quarter 2021 performance is how it compares to the first quarter of 2019.
We believe that the comparison to 2019 is much more informative for most purposes than comparing to 2020.
Accordingly, during our discussion today, we will focus on the positive traction we have made toward returning to and even exceeding our 2019 levels of performance.
First quarter sales came in at $266 million compared to $282 million in fiscal 2019 and versus our guidance range of $220 million to $240 million.
It is worth noting that $14 million of the $16 million sales decrease from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is due to lower sales in Lanier Apparel, which, as you know, we are in the process of exiting.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased to a $1.89 compared to our earnings of a $1.30 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Scott will provide more detail in a few minutes, but these results were driven by very strong performance in our e-commerce businesses and outstanding gross margins.
Our bar and restaurant business also performed very nicely during the quarter.
In our bricks and mortar stores, we generally saw a sequential improvement in traffic and sales in the quarter with regions in Florida, the Southeast and Texas showing the most strength while the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and the Midwest are recovering at a somewhat slower pace.
There is no question that we are benefiting from some pent-up demand so far this spring and summer and the alignment of our brands' focus on products related to travel, vacation and social occasions with the consumers' desire to travel and reengage socially.
We expect this to continue as more regions of the country begin to normalize.
That said, we believe that the results we have seen thus far this year and that we are projecting for the balance of the year also demonstrate the value of staying true to our brands during the challenges that we faced last year.
Our commitment to the happy, upbeat and optimistic messages of our brands and delivering those messages to our consumers through our products and services is paying off handsomely as the world reengages.
In addition, we are seeing positive returns on the investments we have made and continue to make in enhancing our brands' creative content in improving our omni-channel customer service and continuing to hone our digital marketing capabilities, and in our stores, bars and restaurants.
In our biggest brand, Tommy Bahama, we are anchored in the relaxed island lifestyle.
We deliver this lifestyle to our guests through our amazing products, our wonderful stores and e-commerce website, and very importantly through our bars and restaurants.
By staying true to our Live the Island Life brand message and making the types of investments outlined above, we were able to deliver outstanding first quarter results.
Sales overall came close to 2019 levels, driven by healthy gains in e-commerce and restaurants while stores in the wholesale continued to improve sequentially.
Very importantly, increased full-price selling and stronger initial IMUs, coupled with excellent expense control, helped contribute to a marked improvement in gross margin, operating margin and a 36% increase in operating income over first quarter of 2019.
We are delighted with the margins we achieved for the quarter.
Finally, we were pleased to see that while performance in our men's business was strong, our women's business at Tommy Bahama was even stronger.
We are honored to have the dedicated cadre of true Tommy Bahama fans that comprise our very loyal customer base.
That said, we believe there is room on the island to delight even more customers.
Through the investments we are making and the priorities we have established, we are intent on expanding our customer reach while continuing to serve our loyal guests.
Staying anchored to its resort chic lifestyle and as we say being the sunshine served Lilly Pulitzer very well during the first quarter.
Lilly's product priority for spring '21 was feel-good fashion with a focus on the happy color and print, easy chic comfortable pieces and a resort state of mind.
This focus together with the investments that we have made in enhancing our brand creative and enhancing our store and digital capabilities paid off in strong first quarter results.
We continue to see strong growth from e-commerce while our stores in the wholesale business continue to improve as consumers feel increasingly comfortable engaging in the physical world.
In total, first quarter '21 sales exceeded first quarter 2019 sales, and operating margin came in at an impressive 27% as compared to 21% in 2019.
Our Luxletic and lounge product continued to drive growth and we saw a healthy rebound in our dress business as for social calendar begins to fill up.
At the same time, our golf and tennis collections have also been bright spots and the consumer is showing strong renewed interest in swim as she thinks about travel and vacation this summer.
Our recent results demonstrate that we have the product she wants and our brand message is resonating with her.
We look forward to continuing to drive a strong business through the balance of the year.
Our smaller brands, Southern Tide, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head, also had a great first quarter, all posting meaningful sales gains above first quarter 2019 levels.
All three are poised to contribute to our profitability this year.
We are very pleased with our first quarter results and are excited about the balance of the year.
Scott will provide more details in our guidance momentarily, but I will say that we do expect to have a strong year, particularly in terms of profitability.
Our enthusiasm is based on both external factors as well as the internal priorities that we have been focusing on for the last year.
I'll start with the external factors.
As the summer progresses, we expect some of the regions that have been slower to recover for us, namely the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and the Midwest, to pick up momentum.
We also believe that consumers will continue to have a high degree of interest in travel, vacation and social events through the year.
Finally, after a long pandemic, consumers appreciate the highly differentiated happy, colorful, upbeat nature of our brands and products more than ever.
All of these external factors portend a strong 2021.
We are also excited about the benefits we are seeing as the result of our internal priorities.
There are many, but I will highlight five here.
First, in our brand message, we are taking care to ensure that our messages are both true to our core brand values and relevant for today's consumer and marketplace.
Second, we have realigned our creative teams and are enhancing our creative content to make sure it is delivering the full impact of our powerful brand messages.
Third, as part of our effort to enhance our digital capabilities, we are improving our ability to capture and analyze customer data in a way that respects her privacy but also puts us in position to serve her in a better and more personalized way.
It also helps us identify and reach new audiences of potential customers.
Fourth, we are honing our skills in measuring the effectiveness of and optimizing the various channels, many of them digital media that we used to reach both existing and potential new customers.
Fifth, we continue to enhance our store order fulfillment capabilities.
This allows us to use inventory located anywhere in our footprint to satisfy demand from anywhere.
The implications for inventory efficiency sell-through rates and ultimately gross margin are huge.
We believe the combination of the positive external factors as well as the benefits from our work on our internal priorities gives us ample reason to be bullish on 2021.
In closing, please allow me to express my sincere appreciation for our wonderful and loyal customers and for our world-class employees, an incredible group of women and men who worked harder than ever over the last year and a half to deliver happiness to those customers.
As Tom just mentioned, fiscal 2021 is off to a great start with record earnings in the first quarter.
I'll walk you through how we got there.
Sales were stronger than expected, and excluding the impact of the exit of the Lanier Apparel business were comparable to 2019 levels.
Our full-price e-commerce channel was 55% higher than in 2019, with significant growth over 2019 in all of our branded businesses.
Our retail store performance reflects the significant regional differences in the pace of recovery.
We saw real strength in the Southeast and Southwest, particularly in Florida, where retail sales achieved 2019 levels.
However, we are experiencing a much slower recovery in other parts of the country where sales levels in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest while improving versus Q4, were still over 30% lower than in 2019.
Overall, our retail sales were 16% lower than in 2019.
We continue to see improvement so far in the second quarter and expect that improvement to continue as restrictions lift and as summer arrives in these areas.
Our restaurants benefited from the addition of five Marlin Bars and the strong recovery in certain regions with a sales increase of 7% compared to 2019.
All restaurants are now open except for New York, which we plan to reopen this fall.
We are particularly proud of the work we have done to improve our gross margin, which on an adjusted basis expanded 520 basis points over 2019 to 64%.
As demand remained high, more of our sales in the first quarter were at full price than in the first quarter of 2019.
Gross margin also benefited from our focus and investments in our direct-to-consumer businesses and lower sales in Lanier Apparel, which has resulted in a meaningful shift in our sales mix to these higher margin channels of distribution.
In the first quarter of 2021, our direct business was 72% of revenue compared to 64% in the first quarter of 2019.
We have also increased our IMUs by reducing product cost and selectively increasing prices.
SG&A modest -- decreased modestly from 2019 levels with lower employment costs, occupancy costs, variable expenses and travel costs, partially offset by increased performance-based incentive compensation.
Putting it altogether, in the first quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded 410 basis points over 2019 to 15%, with operating margin expansion in all operating groups.
Our business is supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow from operations.
Here are some highlights.
On a FIFO basis, inventory decreased 29% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding Lanier Apparel, which we are exiting, FIFO inventory decreased 22% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each decreased inventory levels significantly year-over-year with conservative purchases of seasonal inventory and higher-than-expected first quarter sales.
Ongoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems are also contributing to a more efficient use of inventory.
On a LIFO basis, inventory decreased 36% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Supply chain challenges, including higher transit cost and production and transit delays, are ongoing.
However, our emphasis on direct-to-consumer channels gives us more flexibility on product release dates.
Our liquidity position is strong with $92 million of cash and no debt at the end of the first quarter.
In the first quarter of 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $41 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $46 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Turning to our outlook.
The positive momentum we experienced in the first quarter has continued, and we expect to deliver strong revenue and earnings in the second quarter.
Sales in the second quarter expected to be in a range of $300 million to $310 million compared to $302 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Impacting sales in the second quarter is the wind down of our Lanier Apparel business.
We estimate Lanier Apparel revenue to decline to approximately $5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $20 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Strong full-price sales, a shift of our sales mix toward our brands and our direct-to-consumer channels, and higher IMUs in the second quarter are expected to contribute to a meaningful increase in consolidated gross margin over 2019.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021 are expected to be in a range of $2.15 to $2.35 compared to $1.84 per share in the second quarter of 2019.
Our third quarter is historically our smallest sales and earnings quarter due to the seasonality of our brands.
We also cleared end-of-season inventory in both the third and fourth quarters with the highly profitable Lilly Pulitzer after party sales as the most notable of our events.
High sell-throughs in the first quarter and elevated sales plan -- levels planned in the second quarter are expected to reduce the availability of excess inventory for these clearance events.
As a result of lower planned revenue from clearance events in the third quarter and the impact of the Lanier Apparel exit, we are projecting an adjusted loss in the quarter in a range of $0.20 per share to $0.35 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
With our better-than-expected first quarter results, combined with our projection for a strong finish to the year driven by continued strength planned in our full-price e-commerce channel, retail and restaurant channels of distribution, we are raising our previously issued guidance for 2021.
We now expect sales in the range of $1.015 billion to $1.05 billion compared to net sales of $1.12 billion in 2019.
For the full year, Lanier Apparel sales are expected to be approximately $20 million or $75 million lower than 2019, with no Lanier comparable sales planned in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share for 2021 are expected to exceed 2019 levels, benefiting from meaningful gross margin expansion.
SG&A for the full year is expected to be comparable with 2019, with lower employment cost, occupancy cost and travel cost partially offset by increased performance-based incentive compensation and investments in marketing, including top-of-the-funnel expenditures.
We now expect adjusted earnings in a range of $4.85 per share to $5.15 per share compared to $4.32 per share in 2019.
We plan to continue investing in our growth opportunities, primarily in information technology initiatives such as the redesign and relaunch of the Lilly Pulitzer mobile app and additional development of digital marketing and customer service enhancements.
We also plan to open new retail stores and a new Marlin Bar at Town Square in Las Vegas, which will replace our full service restaurant in the center.
In 2021, capital expenditures for the full year is expected to be approximately $35 million comparable to 2019 levels.
","In fiscal Q1 2021, despite ongoing challenges from COVID-19, the company reported a strong start, exceeding expectations. Sales reached $266 million, close to 2019 levels, driven by impressive growth in e-commerce and restaurants. Gross margins expanded significantly, resulting in improved profitability across all operating groups. The company's focus on delivering happiness to customers, investing in digital and store capabilities, and enhancing brand messages has strengthened its foundation for profitable growth. As restrictions ease and regions recover, the company anticipates continued momentum in the coming quarters. Despite the closure of Lanier Apparel, overall sales are projected to range between $1.015 billion to $1.05 billion in 2021, with adjusted earnings per share exceeding 2019 levels. Plans include ongoing investments in growth opportunities, including IT enhancements, new store openings, and the launch of a new Marlin Bar."

Starting on slide three.
We concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter.
Our Environmental Services segment outperformed our expectations, driven by a combination of factors, including the level of high-value waste in our disposal network, greater-than-expected COVID decontamination work and ongoing cost controls.
Total fourth quarter revenues were in line with expectations as our Safety-Kleen business remained constrained by the effects of the pandemic.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 increased to $136.1 million, which included $5.6 million in benefits from government programs, primarily from Canada.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew by 3% to $555.3 million, with annual margins growing to 17.7%.
We generated record adjusted free cash flow of $265 million, a noteworthy accomplishment considering the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.
Without question, the success we achieved in 2020 is a direct result of the dedication, flexibility and perseverance of our exceptional team.
2020 was a challenging year on many levels.
Turning to our segment results, beginning with Environmental Services on slide four.
Revenue, while down year-over-year due to a market -- due to market conditions, was up on a sequential basis.
Typically, Q4 is a seasonally weaker quarter for us, but the $18 million increase from Q3 is evidence that many of our markets are on the road to recovery.
We also saw strong disposal and recycling volumes to close out the year.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% from a year ago, with margins up nearly 400 basis points.
This was driven by a combination of business mix, cost savings and $3.9 million in benefits from government assistance programs in Q4.
Revenue from our COVID-19 decon work totaled $31 million in Q4.
For the full year, our team completed nearly 14,000 responses and was an essential resourcing and protecting our customers' people and facilities.
In Q4, we benefited from a record level of drums collected as well as some high-value complex waste streams we received into our network.
This resulted in an average price per pound increase of 16% from the year earlier period when we saw more bulk streams.
Incineration utilization in the quarter was 84% due to a higher-than-expected number of maintenance days.
Landfill volumes were down 37% in the quarter as the lack of remediation and waste projects opportunities intensified with the resurgence of the pandemic.
However, our strong base landfill business largely offset that decline with a 42% increase in our average price per ton.
Moving to slide five.
Safety-Kleen revenue was down 15% from a year ago, but was flat sequentially as the ongoing recovery offset normal year-end seasonality.
Vehicles miles driven had been on a nice upward trajectory throughout the summer, but plateaued a bit in Q4, with the COVID-19 surge resulting in some new local restrictions in areas such as California, and all across Canada.
Most of our core services in the SK branch business were down year-over-year as a result, but flat from Q3.
Safety-Kleen's adjusted EBITDA declined 21%, mostly due to the lower revenue and business mix.
This decline was partly offset by our cost reductions initiatives as well as the government assistance programs that provided $1.4 million of benefits in Q4.
Waste oil collections were 49 -- no, excuse me, were 49 million gallons in Q4 with a healthy average charge for oil, given the lack of available outlets for generators.
On the SK oil side, we saw typical seasonal softening of the demand for base oil and lube products.
However, due to lower production levels in the traditional refinery space, available base oil and lubricant supply shrank in the quarter, resulting in a rising price environment that should benefit us here in 2021.
Percentages of blended products and direct volumes came as expected and consistent with prior year.
Turning to slide six.
Looking back at 2020 from a capital allocation standpoint, our strategy due to the pandemic was focused on capital preservation, which served us well.
capex in Q4 was slightly higher than the prior year, but our full year spend was down from 2019.
Moving forward, we expect to focus on internal growth capital on our plants and other assets that we believe generate the best returns.
From an M&A standpoint, our opportunity pipeline is healthy, as businesses emerge from the pandemic, and we gain a clear light -- line of sight on our end markets.
We prudently increased our level of share repurchases in Q4 and had an active repurchase program for the year, and Mike will provide the detail on our buyback shortly.
Looking ahead, we're beginning 2021 in excellent shape, both operationally and financially.
The markets we serve are on an upward trajectory.
For our lines of business that have been held back by the pandemic, such as waste projects and remediation, we expect a measurable recovery this year.
In 2021, we expect to pursue growth opportunities through our core suite of offerings and by capitalizing on market conditions.
And Mike is going to talk about our new sustainability report in a moment.
But let me say that we expect to take full advantage of the growing market acceptance of our sustainable offerings in 2021 and beyond.
We provide a broad array of green solutions that go well beyond our role as the largest collector and recycler of waste oil.
Within Environmental Services, we entered the year with higher deferred revenue and given the availability of waste in the marketplace, expect strong incineration performance in 2021.
We anticipate our offerings within Industrial Services and Tech services to grow from last year.
We expect Field Services to generate $25 million to $35 million of COVID-related revenues in 2021.
Within Safety-Kleen, we remain below normal demand levels as we kick off 2021.
However, later this year, we anticipate a steady recovery in the SK branch business.
For Safety-Kleen Oil, our rerefineries are producing well.
And as I mentioned, pricing for both base oil and blended products is favorable to start the year.
We will continue to actively manage our charge for oil rates, while focusing on growing collection volumes to supply our rerefinery network and take advantage of market conditions for recycled fuel oil.
As I look at 2021, the underlying dynamics in both our operating segments remain positive, and we expect a strong sales growth year with healthy free cash flow as a result.
I anticipate another great year for the company in 2021.
Before I take you through the financials, let me comment briefly on our first ever sustainability report, which is available on the IR section of our website.
We're proud of this document, which we created based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework.
The document highlights the integral role that sustainability plays in our business decisions as well as our environmental, social and government goals and benchmarks for 2030.
The At a Glance page of the report shown on slide eight is an overview of some of the -- of our ESG benchmarks.
I want to reiterate the point that Alan made about ESG and sustainability as foundational to our business.
For many customers, we are their sustainability solution.
When companies generate potentially harmful byproducts, they call Clean Harbors to safely remove and dispose of them.
When they accidentally release chemicals into the environment, they call Clean Harbors to help clean it up.
When they have waste oil, solvents, precious metals or paint, they call Clean Harbors to recycle.
The new report also highlights the vital role our employees play in our performance.
We strive to create a diverse and inclusive culture, one that values the unique backgrounds, perspectives and experiences of our people.
We are committed to building a sustainable culture through training programs that enable our employees to have -- to enjoy long and successful careers at Clean Harbors.
I encourage everyone to take a look through the report.
It provides the detailed picture of how closely intertwined sustainability is with our entire organization, culture and business model.
We ended 2020 on a high note with another strong financial performance.
If you asked me back in April, when the pandemic began, what level of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow we would have delivered this year, these would have not been the numbers.
Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA results exceeded the guidance we provided in November.
Revenue declined 9% year-over-year, but was up in the third quarter despite Q4 typically being a sequentially lower quarter due to seasonality.
Our efforts to control costs and grow our highest margin businesses, combined with some further government program assistance, resulted in 180 basis point improvement in gross margin.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 3% to $136.1 million.
Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin rising 190 basis points from last year speaks to the effectiveness of the actions we have taken this year.
We have improved our adjusted EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis for 12 consecutive quarters.
For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA margins grew 17.7% -- grew to 17.7%.
If you excluded the $42.3 million of government assistance, those margins would have been 16.3% or a 50 basis point improvement from 2019.
SG&A total costs were down in the quarter based on our lower revenue and cost controls.
But on a margin basis, we're essentially flat.
For the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 14.3%, which beat our target of 14.5%.
For 2021, using the midpoint of our guidance range, we would expect SG&A to be up in absolute dollars from the prior year and essentially flat on a percentage basis.
Depreciation and amortization in Q4 was down to $71.4 million.
For the full year, our depreciation and amortization was $292.9 million, which was within our expected range.
For 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization in the range of $280 million to $290 million.
Income from operations in Q4 increased by 18%, reflecting a higher gross profit, cost controls and mix of revenue.
For the full year, our income from operations rose 10% to $251.3 million.
Turning to slide 10.
We conclude the year with our balance sheet in terrific shape.
Cash and short-term marketable securities at December 31 were $571 million, up nearly $40 million from the end of Q3.
Our debt was at $1.56 billion at year-end, with leverage on a net debt basis at 1.8 times, our lowest level in a decade.
Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.2%, with a healthy mix -- healthy blend of fixed and variable debt.
With the recent revolver we put in place, we have no debt maturities until 2024.
Turning to cash flows on slide 11.
Cash from operations in Q4 was $113.2 million.
capex, net of disposals, was up slightly to $43.6 million.
That combination resulted in adjusted free cash flow in Q4 of $69.6 million.
For the year, we hit our net capex target, excluding the purchase of our headquarters, with $165.6 million of spend.
That helped us deliver record annual adjusted free cash flow of $265 million, which is toward the high end of our guidance range.
For 2021, we expect net capex in the range of $185 million to $205 million, which is higher than prior year.
Our net capex as a percentage of revenue ranks as one of the lowest among our specialty waste peers.
During the quarter, we increased the level of our share repurchases as we bought back 500,000 shares at an average price just under $71 for a total buyback of $35 million.
In 2020, we repurchased slightly over 1.2 million shares of our authorized $600 million share repurchase program, we have just under $210 million remaining.
Moving to guidance on slide 12.
Based on our 2020 results and current market conditions, we expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $545 million to $585 million.
That amount in 2021 should be about $16 million to $18 million compared with $18.5 million in 2020.
Looking at our guidance from a quarterly perspective, we expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA using our revised definition to be 5% to 10% below prior year levels given the record Q1 results we posted in 2020 prior to the pandemic taking hold and the deep freeze we are experiencing in the Midwest and the Gulf here in February.
Here is how our full year 2021 guidance translates from a segment perspective.
In Environmental Services, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decline in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2020.
We expect to benefit from growth and profitability within incineration, a rebound in the majority of our service businesses, along with our comprehensive cost measures, but not enough to fully offset the decline in high-margin decontamination work as well as the large contribution from government assistance programs in 2020 that totaled $27.1 million in this segment.
For Safety-Kleen, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to increase in the mid- to high single digits on a percentage basis from 2020.
Despite the fact this segment received $12.2 million in government assistance last year.
We expect a mild rebound in the branch business weighted toward the second half of the year post vaccination.
At the same time, we expect SK Oil to deliver a vastly improved performance in 2020, given the current base oil industry supply dynamics as well as our ability to aggressively manage our rerefining spread and collect more gallons of waste oil.
In our Corporate segment, we expect negative adjusted EBITDA to be flat with 2020, which includes $3 million of governance assistance.
For 2021, our EBITDA guidance assumes receiving $2 million to $3 million of Canadian government assistance.
We are not assuming any additional CARES money in 2021 at this time, but we are reviewing the new program.
Based on our EBITDA guidance and working capital assumptions, we now expect 2021 adjusted free cash flow in the range of $215 million to $255 million.
We believe this puts us in a great position to execute on our capital allocation strategy.
In summary, although the pandemic is still with us, we entered the new year with strong momentum in multiple service businesses and most importantly, across our facilities network.
Industrial production in the U.S. is back on the rise by all indications, particularly in the chemical space.
The Chemical Activity Barometer, published by the American Chemistry Council, show that industry levels have been climbing sequentially from May to January, and January was the first time in 10 months that the activity levels were above the prior year, which is a great sign for us.
In addition, our rerefinery business is off to a great start, given the current market conditions.
We expect some of the project and turnaround work that was pushed out in 2020 to benefit us this year and the overall sales pipeline remains strong.
While we are seeing COVID cases decline sharply in recent weeks, we anticipate continued opportunities for near-term decontamination work and disposal of vaccination waste volumes.
Overall, the number of favorable industry and regulatory trends should support our business moving forward.
And while we don't give specific revenue guidance, we certainly expect aline growth in 2021.
","In 2020, Clean Harbors' financial performance exceeded expectations, with adjusted EBITDA growing 3% to $555.3 million and record adjusted free cash flow of $265 million. Despite ongoing pandemic challenges, Environmental Services outperformed, driven by high-value waste, COVID-19 decontamination work, and cost controls, recording an impressive 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA with margins up nearly 400 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 is in the range of $545 million to $585 million, with Environmental Services experiencing a mid-single-digit decline on a percentage basis due to the reduction in high-margin decontamination work and government assistance but expecting growth in incineration, service businesses, and cost measures. Safety-Kleen is projected to see a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from a rebound in the branch business and improved performance in SK Oil. The company is optimistic about 2021, citing rising industrial production, a strong sales pipeline, and opportunities for decontamination work and disposal of vaccination waste volumes."
NFG_q3_2020.txt,"With us on the call, from National Fuel Gas Company are Dave Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Camiolo, Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer; and John McGinnis, President of Seneca Resources.
We vmay refer to these materials during today's call.
While National Fuel's expectations, beliefs, and projections are made in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis, actual results may differ materially.
National Fuel will be participating in the Barclays Energy Conference in September.
Please contact me or the conference planners to schedule a meeting with the management team.
As with most oil and gas companies, lower commodity prices weighed on the third [Technical Issues] gathering business.
However, the remainder of the system had a very solid third quarter with pipeline earnings up nearly 45% on the strength of Supply Corporation's recent rate settlement and stable utility earnings, in spite of the COVID pandemic.
Also the quarter was another great example of the benefits of our integrated, diversified model where the earnings and cash flows of our regulated businesses provided a strong measure of stability against the more variable earnings of our E&P business.
Operationally, this was a really significant quarter for National Fuel, one in which we reached several important milestones that make us well positioned to deliver meaningful growth in the years to come.
First and foremost, last week we closed on the acquisition of Shell's upstream and midstream properties in Appalachia.
This is a terrific opportunity to check all the boxes we are looking for in an acquisition.
From start to finish, it was the results of the exceptional work of dozens of employees across our upstream and midstream operations.
Hats off to the team on a job well done.
The acquisition meaningfully increases our presence in Appalachia.
In fact, earlier this week Seneca's gross natural gas production crossed the 1 Bcf per day threshold.
This is a great milestone.
And to put in perspective, in fiscal 2018, our average daily production was only about half of that.
With the added scale, we expect to realize immediate cost synergies and you can see that in our guidance on cash operating costs, which we expect will be down about $0.05 per Mcfe in '21.
The financing for the transaction is complete.
Kudos to our finance team and the banks that supported them.
We're getting the deals done in the face of a challenging backdrop in the capital markets.
As I described a few months ago, the plan was to finance the deal with roughly 50-50 debt and equity, and I'm happy to say that we achieved that objective.
In May, we issued $500 million of bonds, the proceeds from which were used to fund the debt component of the acquisition and to term out our revolver.
We also raised just under $175 million through a common equity offering that was done at a better price than we would have received under the equity backstop arrangement available to us under the Shell purchase-and-sale agreement.
And lastly, earlier this week, we signed an agreement to divest substantially all of our Appalachian timber properties for approximately $116 million, which will fund the remaining equity needed for the transaction.
The timber properties are our non-core asset that we've held for some time.
The earnings and cash flows associated with them are modest, in fact, pretty close to break-even.
Reinvesting the proceeds from the sale allows us to avoid issuing another roughly 2 million common shares at the midpoint of our fiscal 2021 guidance.
That saves approximately $0.08 per share of dilution.
In addition, the timber properties have a very low tax basis.
By selling them now, we're able to structure the timber sale and Shell acquisition, is a like kind of exchange and by doing so, defer a large tax gain.
The remainder of Seneca's operations continue to run smoothly and John will have a full update later on the call.
But I'd like to emphasize the improvement we expect in this business in fiscal '21.
As you can see in last night's release, the midpoint of our production guidance is 320 Bcfe, a 32% increase over our expected production for fiscal 2020.
In addition with the NYMEX strip in the $2.65 to $2.75 area, there is cause for optimism on natural gas prices and we've been aggressive with our hedging program.
At this point about two-thirds of our fiscal '21 gas production is hedged.
Both of these factors should cause cash from operations to grow meaningfully.
On top of that, as a result of moving to a single rig program, capital spending at Seneca and NFG midstream is expected to decrease by $105 million or about 25%.
So, putting it all together, assuming the current strip, next year we expect more than $150 million in free cash flow from our E&P and gathering businesses.
The Pipeline and Storage segment is also positioned to deliver meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.
And several noteworthy events occurred during the quarter to help make that a reality.
On the expansion front, we placed a portion of our Empire North project into service ahead of schedule, which allows us to capture some modest short-term growth -- short-term revenue opportunities this summer.
Once it's fully in service, which we expect will occur by the end of September, this project will add $25 million in annual revenues.
In July, we received our FERC certificate for the FM100 project and Transco also received their FERC approval for the companion Leidy South project.
Both projects are on track for a late calendar 2021 in-service date.
And as a reminder the expansion portion of this project is expected to add $35 million in annual revenue.
Lastly, in early June, FERC approved the settlement of Supply Corporation's rate case.
As I discussed on last quarter's call, new rates went into effect this past February and are expected to add $35 million in annual revenues.
Settlement also addressed the rate-making treatment of the modernization component of the FM100 project.
On the later of the in-service date of that project or April 2022, a step up in rates will go into effect, providing an incremental $15 million in annual revenues.
In total, the expansion projects and rate case settlement are expected to provide in excess of $100 million of incremental annual revenues for our pipeline business by mid-2022.
To put that in perspective, our fiscal 2019 pipeline revenues were $288 million.
So we're looking at some really meaningful growth in the next two years.
In addition to improving earnings and cash flows, the growth in our pipeline business will help us maintain relative balance between the regulated and non-regulated portions of our company.
On the utility front, despite the pandemic, our operations and financial performance remain right in line with our expectations.
With the reopening of most of the economies in our New York and Pennsylvania service territories, our capital program has returned to pre-pandemic levels.
We continue to focus on modernization projects that enhance the safety and reliability of our system, while at the same time reducing emissions.
In New York, our system modernization tracker allows us to do this in a manner that minimizes the regulatory lag to recover these large investments.
And given that we can add rate base to this tracker, through March of 2021, we expect to maintain consistent returns at our utility for at least the next few years.
Lastly, a few words on the COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall the business continues to run smoothly across the system.
Employees who can work from home are doing so and those who cannot, mostly our field personnel, have been provided appropriate PPE and are practicing social distancing.
In closing, despite the backdrop of a pandemic it's an exciting time for National Fuel, we just closed the most significant acquisition in the company's history and next year we'll construction on what will be our largest pipeline expansion project to-date.
Our balance sheet is strong and will likely get stronger as we generate free cash flow and we've extended our impressive dividend track record having increased it in June for the 50th consecutive year.
All of this makes National Fuel well positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders in the coming years.
In echoing Dave's remarks we are excited to move forward after successfully closing on the acquisition of Shell's Appalachian upstream and midstream assets last week.
At the time of closing these shallow declining properties were producing around 220 million cubic feet per day net.
This additional scale is expected to be immediately accretive to Seneca's cost structure and to put this into context our G&A expense as a result of the Shell acquisition is expected to increase, less than 5% in fiscal '21, while our net production is expected to increase by over 30%.
Although, our purchase price for these assets ascribe no value for the reserves beyond proved producing, we are working towards maximizing the upside as we integrate these assets into our overall development plan.
We have now added significant Utica and Marcellus inventory in Tioga County, contiguous to our existing operations, an area we have been active for over a decade and we know very well.
In addition, we've also acquired valuable low cost pipeline capacity, including 200 million a day of firm transport on National Fuel's Empire system and 100 million a day on Dominion.
In fact, as a result of this Dominion capacity, which provides access to Leidy Hub, Seneca is in the unique position of being able to flow production from each of its three major producing areas into its FM100 Leidy South capacity.
Moving forward, we'll work closely with our midstream group to determine how to best integrate our development and pipeline activity, minimize capital deployment, drive operating efficiencies and maximize the value of these assets.
Turning to our third quarter, Seneca had strong operational results, producing 56 Bcfe, an increase of around 2% compared to last year's third quarter despite 7.3 Bcf price related curtailments.
In response to sustained, low natural gas prices, we reduced our activity to a single rig in June and have since curtailed an additional 2 Bcf of production in the month of July.
We have now curtailed around 13 Bcf of our gas production so far this year.
Moving forward, we expect prices to remain low over the next couple of months and therefore we are now forecasting to curtail our remaining spot volumes for the rest of this fiscal year.
While pricing and related curtailments put a damp around Seneca's results for the quarter, operationally, we're very pleased with our business.
We continue to drive down our well costs and have seen an 18% to 20% improvement this year compared to last.
This cost reduction has been driven primarily through fewer drill days per well, improved efficiencies and lower service costs across the sectors.
We will provide an updated well cost economics table in the investor deck next quarter.
In California, we produced around 584,000 barrels of oil during the third quarter, an increase of 2% over last year's third quarter.
Fortunately, with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged for remainder of the year at an average price of about $60 per barrel.
We are well-positioned to weather the downturn in oil prices.
Taking into account our price-related natural gas production curtailments, we are decreasing our fiscal '20 production guidance slightly to range between 240 to 245 Bcfe.
We are reiterating our capex range of $375 million to $395 million around 20% lower than fiscal '19 at the midpoint.
Moving to fiscal '21 guidance.
We are currently planning to remain at a one rig pace in Pennsylvania, due to our lower activity level with only a single rig and completion crew operating in Pennsylvania, our $290 million to $330 million range of capital expenditures for the year represents a 20% decrease at the midpoint of our fiscal '20 guidance and a 35% decrease from fiscal '19.
Fiscal '21 net production is expected to be in the range of 305 to 335 Bcfe, a 32% increase versus fiscal '20.
This increase is driven almost entirely by the production acquired from Shell.
With only a single rig operating in Pennsylvania, we plan to bring to production 32 wells next year, 16 Marcellus and 16 Utica.
As to production cadence, 27 of the 32 wells are to be brought on line during the first seven months of our fiscal year.
In California, we have deferred our development program until oil prices improve and therefore we are only currently forecasting to spend around $10 million in capex next year.
Unlike other oil producing basins in the U.S., however, our California assets enjoy a low rate of decline.
However, if prices improve we will move to quickly return to our development program and with approximately 49% of our oil production hedged in fiscal '21 at an average price of $58 per barrel, we will continue to generate free cash flow even at today's low prices.
In fiscal '21 through physical firm sales contracts, as well as our firm transport capacity, we have secured marketing outlets for around 91% of our expected Appalachian production and two-thirds protected with price certainty where the downside production -- protection of callers with a floor at $2.37.
That leaves only 9% available for sale onto the spot market.
But as always when we see opportunities we will layer in additional firm sales to minimize price related curtailments.
And finally, we continue to be very pleased with how our Seneca team has conducted business through the impact of the pandemic.
Our offices remain close except for those who need access and our operations team has done a great job continuing to operate successfully and safely in the field during this period.
GAAP earnings per share were $0.47 for the third quarter, adjusting for items impacting comparability, including the ceiling test impairment charge recorded in our E&P segment, adjusted operating results were $0.57 per share, a decrease of $0.14 from the prior year.
Strong results from our Pipeline and Storage segment due to the impact of the supply rate case and lower operating expenses were more than offset by lower natural gas and oil price realizations.
Last night's release explains the major earnings drivers.
So I won't repeat them here, instead, I'll discuss our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year and our initial guidance for next year.
As it relates to fiscal '20 our updated earnings guidance is $2.75 to $2.85 per share, a decrease of $0.10 at the midpoint.
This change is due to a few main drivers.
As John mentioned, the largest decrease can be attributed to price related curtailments during the third quarter and approximately 6 Bcf of additional curtailments expected during the fourth quarter.
These curtailments will have a corresponding reduction to throughout in the Gathering segment.
From a pricing perspective, we've revised our NYMEX Gas and WTI oil assumptions, but given our strong hedge position, these changes generally offset each other from an earnings perspective.
Additionally, we've reflected the execution of our permanent financing for the Shell acquisition.
Given the market backdrop, we completed the necessary financing well ahead of closing and upsized our debt issuance to term out our revolver and enhance liquidity in advance of our December 2021 maturity.
As it relates to the rest of our assumptions there were some movement of expenses between the third quarter and fourth quarter in our regulated subsidiaries, but substantially all of our other guidance items for fiscal '20 remain intact.
Looking forward to fiscal '21 we are expecting material increase in earnings per share when compared to fiscal '20.
We are initiating preliminary guidance in the range of $3.40 to $3.70 per share, an increase of nearly 27% at the midpoint.
This range excludes the impact of any future ceiling test impairments which we expect to incur in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as well as the first quarter of fiscal '21 based on the forward curve as of today.
So I won't repeat that information.
As a reminder even with the level of hedges we have given our base of production, changes in pricing can impact earnings for the year.
For reference, a $0.10 change in natural gas prices is expected to impact earnings by $0.11 per share, a $5 change in oil by $0.04 per share.
The biggest driver of the year-over-year earnings increase related to the impact of the Shell acquisition in both the E&P and Gathering segments.
Production is expected to be up nearly 80 Bcfe at the midpoint, in excess of 30% from fiscal '20, the bulk of which comes from the acquired assets.
All of this incremental production will flow through our gathering systems and is expected to lead to $185 million to $200 million in revenue for our Gathering segment.
This is an increase of approximately $50 million from fiscal '20 or approximately 35% of the midpoint.
A portion of this revenue growth will be offset with slightly higher expenses related to the acquisition, where we now expect O&M expense in the segment to be approximately $0.08 to $0.09 per Mcfe of gross throughput.
This is driven by higher compression lease expense.
With respect to our legacy gathering facilities, we typically don't lease compression equipment.
So therefore, this has the effect of a higher per unit O&M expense as we recognized the lease costs on the income statement.
In addition, we are forecasting higher depreciation expense related to the allocation of the acquisition purchase price and the higher plant balances on existing operations due to capital spending during the course of fiscal '20.
We generally assume a 25 year depreciable life on these assets, which will drive an $8 million to $9 million increase in depreciation in the Gathering segment.
In our regulated businesses, we are expecting relatively flat earnings in the utility business and a nice increase in the Pipeline and Storage segment due to the Empire North expansion project and the full year impact of the Supply Corporation rate case.
Focusing first on the utility, there are three major moving pieces.
First, we are forecasting a return to normal weather.
For the first nine months of fiscal '20 weather was 8% to 11% warmer than normal across our service territory.
This reduced margin by about $5 million, the majority of which was in our Pennsylvania service territory, where we do not have a weather normalization costs.
In addition to normal weather, we are forecasting a continued increase in margin related to our system modernization tracker in New York, which we expect will add approximately $3 million to margin in fiscal '21.
Going to the other direction is a modest 1% to 2% increase in O&M expense in line with inflation.
Touching briefly on the Pipeline and Storage segment, we expect revenues to increase approximately 10%, driven by the full year impact of the supply rate case, of which we only saw eight months of impact in fiscal '20 on the Empire North project, both of which Dave touched on earlier.
Collectively, these items will add approximately $35 million in revenue next year.
Partially offsetting these revenue additions is forecasted recontracting that happens in the normal course of business, as well as the reduction in short-term contracts, which we don't assume to recur.
On the expense side, we expect O&M to increase by approximately 3% to 4%, partially driven by general inflationary assumptions and the remainder due to expenses from the operation of two new compressor stations associated with the Empire North expansion project.
Additionally, we expect to see an increase in depreciation expense due to higher depreciation rates that were part of the Supply Corporation rate settlement, as well as normal increases due to higher plant balances and placing Empire North in service.
From a financing perspective, given our relatively flat capital spending forecast and 25% plus forecasted earnings growth, we anticipate generating in-excess of $100 million in consolidated free cash flow in fiscal '21, exclusive of our dividends.
Combining this with our anticipated cash-on-hand at the end of the year, resulting from the timber sale, we don't anticipate the need for incremental borrowing next year, even as we embark on one of the most capital-intensive pipeline projects in our history.
Looking beyond fiscal '21, we expect our cash from operations to cover capital spending and our dividend, which will lead to the continued strengthening of our balance sheet.
In summary, we're in a great spot financially, we've successfully financed the acquisition of Shell Appalachian asset, anticipate closing on the sale of our timber properties in the next few months and capitalized on the opportunity to enhance our liquidity with an upsized debt issuance.
We don't have a debt maturity until December of 2021, so we have a good amount of time to monitor the capital markets for the right opportunity to complete debt refinancing.
","National Fuel reports a challenging third quarter amidst lower commodity prices, particularly impacting its E&P gathering business. However, its Pipeline and Storage segment performed strongly due to Supply Corporation's recent rate settlement and stable utility earnings. The company recently acquired Shell's Appalachian assets for a combination of debt and equity, significantly increasing its presence in the region and boosting production by 32% in fiscal 2021. As a result, cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $150 million in its E&P and gathering businesses next year. Moreover, ongoing growth in the Pipeline and Storage segment and steady utility operations are expected to significantly increase earnings per share in fiscal 2021, with a range of $3.40 to $3.70. The company remains financially strong, with ample liquidity and a favorable capital structure."
PII_q2_2021.txt,"Mike Speetzen, our chief executive officer; and Bob Mack, our chief financial officer; have remarks summarized in the quarter and our revised expectations for the full year, then we'll take questions.
You can refer to our 2020 10-K for additional details regarding these risks and uncertainties.
I continue to be incredibly impressed with the dedication, commitment and execution of the Polaris team as we navigated ongoing supply chain pressures, logistical challenges and increasing input costs to deliver impressive second-quarter results.
Focused execution is our mantra and it once again paid off as the team expertly navigated the challenges to enable us to exceed expectations.
The powersports industry has experienced significant demand, and that trend continued into the second quarter.
Demand, while down from unprecedented levels in the second quarter of last year was up over prepandemic levels of Q2 2019 by 14%.
Overview market share gains continued in the second quarter with gains in both ATVs and side-by-sides.
We did, however, lose a small amount of share in India, particularly in our midsized bikes given the supply chain challenges.
That said, demand remains strong for these models, and we anticipate our share gains will resume as our vehicle supply improves.
Boats also remained strong, growing retail sales and market share during the quarter and we have a healthy and significant backlog.
Although it's off season for snowmobiles with over half our snowmobile build this year being represented by our near-record high snow check preorders, the sales cadence of our snowmobile business will be even more heavily weighted toward our fourth quarter this year given the timing variation in our component deliveries.
Our PG&A and International businesses also performed quite well.
PG&A sales were up 35% during the quarter.
I'd also note that we are experiencing an increase in the attachment rate for PG&A as more consumers look to personalize their vehicles.
Our International business continues to see strength.
We grew sales 64% as the economies outside North America continued to improve in Q2.
Our earnings outperformed expectations, demonstrating the team's ability to overcome challenges with focused execution.
Not surprisingly, production and delivery were and continue to be impacted by global supply chain and logistics challenges.
As a result of this and continued strong consumer demand, our dealer inventories are at the lowest levels in decades.
I'll talk more about this in a moment.
Given our first half results, continued strong consumer demand and our team's hard-fought ability to execute, I am pleased to report that we are again raising our full-year earnings guidance.
Bob will give more details shortly.
On a two-year basis, our retail is up 14%, reflecting continued growth in powersports, driven by strong underlying consumer demand.
As expected, our second quarter North American retail sales were down 28% from the 57% increase reported in the second quarter of 2020.
The gating factor for retail sales today compared to a year ago is low dealer inventory driven by supply chain impacts on delivery.
Retail sales would have likely been significantly higher without these impacts.
Despite the supply impacts to ORV retail sales, market share again grew during the quarter.
Our ORV business gained over 1 percentage point of market share in both ATVs and side-by-sides.
Motorcycle retail sales also continued to grow, increasing 22% during the quarter.
However, Indian lost a modest amount of share during the quarter, driven by low availability of bikes, particularly our very popular scout and chief models.
Strong boat retail also continued and remained ahead of the industry.
Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter down 57% on a year-over-year basis and were also down sequentially.
Our presold order process continues to be an effective lever that our dealers are utilizing to ensure they don't lose a sale.
And I'll go into this in more detail in the next slide.
Looking at the remainder of the year, dealer inventories are expected to remain lean into Q4, which is when we are anticipating the supply chain issues will begin to slowly improve.
Given stronger-than-anticipated demand, coupled with continued supply constraints, our expectations for dealer inventory levels to return to RFM profile levels is now sometime in late 2022 or even into 2023.
As I discussed earlier, the unprecedented demand, coupled with the supply chain constraints, has created significant disruption in our shipping cadence.
With dealer inventory at record lows, the most effective, efficient way for our customers to secure the product they want, and for our dealers to maximize retail and profitability is through our presold order process.
The advantage to consumers is that orders placed in the presold system received priority in our production and shipping schedule.
In addition, dealers and consumers can receive PG&A priority is placed at the time of the vehicle order.
As a result, presold orders have increased significantly since the pandemic began.
Pre-pandemic presold orders accounted for roughly 3% of our retail.
Exiting Q2, ORV presold orders were approximately 80% of retail.
While there have been some reports that the presold order process can be misused, our audits have found that not to be the case.
We regularly audit the system looking for a name change from the presold order at the time of registration.
These audits have found less than 1% where the names changed at registration and where there were changes, the majority had valid reasons for the change.
I'd also point out that the presold order cancellations remain at low single-digit percent, which is similar to pre-pandemic levels.
Lastly, we have analyzed shipping patterns to our dealers by tiers, volumes and regions and were all within 1% of pre-pandemic levels.
The bottom line is that there's high confidence in the presold order process, which is why it continues to be a competitive advantage in this very tight inventory environment.
Our manufacturing plants are operating at peak supply chain constrained capacity.
Our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics teams continue to execute at a very high level, managing the ever-changing production schedules driven by component availability with a singular focus to meet the demand of our consumers and dealers with high-quality vehicles and components.
Despite our efforts, we couldn't meet all the demand during the quarter.
As I indicated earlier, our presold order levels have increased significantly, and it appears those customers are waiting for the high-performing high-quality vehicles we produce.
I'd like to be able to say today that we see the light at the end of the tunnel.
But given the ongoing heightened demand for our vehicles and supplier challenges, it appears we, along with the entire powersports industry will be in a period of tight vehicle supply for the remainder of the year.
Our teams are doing impressive work to keep the flow of products moving, including expediting components, adjusting build schedules, substituting materials were appropriate and buying select materials on the spot market.
Focused execution and teamwork will ensure we win the competitive battle.
As indicated in our last call, we are also adding capacity later this year and into 2022 that will bring on 30% more production capability between ORV boats and motorcycles.
This capacity is needed to meet demand, fill the dealer channel and allow for the addition of some very exciting new products coming next year.
One of the drivers behind the unprecedented demand has been new customers coming into powersports.
New customer growth in the first half of 2021, while down slightly from the robust rates in the first half of 2020 remains comfortably ahead on a comparable two-year pre-COVID basis with approximately 300,000 new customers coming into the Polaris family over the first half of 2021.
The mix of new to existing customers has remained high at over 70% of the total customers for ORV, motorcycles, snowmobiles and boats.
Our existing customers continue to grow at a healthy rate.
And lastly, it's exciting to see the diversity of our customers also grow, led by Hispanic and female riders joining the Polaris family.
Overall customer demand in total remains very strong.
We track repurchase rates for our customers, which are increasing on a year-over-year basis.
This provides us with the confidence that our customers intend to remain with the sport.
The Polaris team is battling each day for the components needed to meet the strong demand of our consumers.
And as our results this quarter indicate, we are winning many of those battles.
Second-quarter sales were up 40% on a GAAP and adjusted basis versus the prior year.
Shipments and sales improved considerably across all segments ORV, motorcycles, adjacent markets, aftermarket and boats.
Second-quarter earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.52.
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.70, which was up 108% for the quarter, exceeding our expectations.
This strong performance was driven by a combination of revenue growth, lower promotional costs, increased pricing and operating expense leverage during the quarter partially offset by higher input costs.
Adjusted gross margins were up approximately 310 basis points year over year, primarily due to lower promotional and floor plan financing costs driven by low dealer inventory and strong demand, which requires minimal promotional dollars to drive retail.
This was muted somewhat by higher input costs associated with supply chain constraints, including logistics, commodity and labor cost pressures.
Operating expenses were down considerably due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairments recognized in Q2 2020.
Adjusted operating expenses were up 33% in the quarter relative to Q2 2020, which was heavily impacted by short-term cost actions taken to offset COVID-19 shutdowns.
Q2 2021 operating expenses grew sequentially versus the prior quarter due to the timing of legal, sales and marketing and engineering expenses along with staffing additions.
Operating expenses are expected to be down slightly versus the Q2 run rate in the second half of 2021.
Foreign exchange also had a positive impact on our quarterly results, primarily driven by the Canadian dollar.
From a segment reporting perspective, all segments reported increased sales for the quarter driven by strong demand.
ORV/Snowmobile segment sales were up 38%.
Motorcycles were up 50%, Adjacent markets increased 98%, Aftermarket was up 15% and Boats increased 49% during the second quarter relative to Q2 2020, which was adversely impacted by COVID-19 closures.
Average selling prices for all segments were up, ORV increased about 13%, Motorcycles were up approximately 8%, Adjacent markets increased 10% and Boats were up 14% for the quarter.
All segments benefited from continued lower promotional costs given high demand and the lack of product in the channel.
Pricing actions taken in the quarter and model mix also had a favorable impact.
Our International sales increased 64% during the quarter, with all regions and segments growing sales as the heavily pandemic impacted countries began to open their economies again.
Currency added 15 percentage points to the International growth for the quarter.
And lastly, our parts, garments and accessories sales increased 35% during the quarter, driven by increased demand across all segments and categories of that business.
Moving on to our guidance for 2021.
Given the stronger-than-anticipated performance in the second quarter, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2021 and now expect earnings to be in the range of $9.35 to $9.60 per diluted share.
The increase is driven by the expectation that the even lower promotional environment we experienced in the second quarter will continue through the second half as demand is expected to remain high and dealer inventory levels low for the remainder of the year.
Additionally, we expect price increases and surcharges for the upcoming model year to provide incremental benefit in the fourth quarter.
These benefits are partially offset by the escalating input costs, particularly component cost increases driven by both the global supply chain shortage and higher commodity prices, along with the increased cost from manufacturing inefficiencies, increased expedites and higher logistics costs.
Overall, for the full year, we are pleased that our product pricing and promotional cost reductions are offsetting the expected annualized incremental cost headwinds on a dollar basis.
We are narrowing our total company sales growth guidance by holding the upper end of our sales guidance range at 21% and raising the lower end of the range to 19% given our sales growth performance to date.
Our dealers have ample presold orders in hand that combined with additional product would typically allow us to increase the top end of our sales guidance range.
However, given the uncertainty around component supply, we are leaving the upper end of our sales guidance unchanged at this time.
Moving down to P&L.
Adjusted gross profit margins are now expected to be down in the range of 40 to 70 basis points.
This is an improvement from our previously issued guidance and primarily due to the higher-than-expected margins in the second quarter which was driven largely by lower current quarter promotional costs and the timing of promotions accrual adjustments as dealer inventory continued to decline.
Adjusted operating expenses are now expected to improve 90 to 120 basis points as a percentage of sales versus last year given the higher sales growth expectations.
Income from financial services is now expected to be down in the mid-20s percent range driven by the historically low dealer inventory levels, as well as lower retail financing income due to lower penetration rates of our retail providers as more customers are buying with cash and/or have more time to shop their financing needs with other financing sources given the delays in delivery.
Guidance for the remainder of the P&L items remains materially unchanged from our previously issued guidance.
While our full-year earnings guidance improved as a result of our year-to-date performance, and the pricing actions being implemented at the upcoming model year changeover, our second half performance is expected to be down compared to the second half of 2020 and sequentially from our reported first half results.
Let me give some clarity on the second half cadence for earnings.
Our first half 2021 earnings per share finished at $4.99, a 228% increase over the first half of 2020.
Given our full-year revised guidance, the second half earnings per share equates to a range of $4.36 to $4.61 per diluted share, a decrease of 26 to 30% on a year-over-year basis and an 8 to 13% decline on a sequential basis from the first half of 2021.
This reduction in earnings per share on a sequential basis is driven by a number of positive and negative factors, including increases in input costs in the second half of the year, principally commodities, labor, expedite and rework costs related to supply chain shortages, as well as unprecedented ocean and truck transportation rates and the timing of operating expense spend.
These costs are expected to be partially offset by increased product pricing through both low promotions, higher base prices and surcharges.
On a two-year basis, our second half earnings per share results at the high end of the range are expected to be up over 30% compared to the second half of 2019.
I would also add that the quarterly cadence for earnings per share in the second half of 2021 is more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter with approximately 60% of our second half earnings per share occurring in Q4.
This is driven by a couple of key factors: First, the majority of our high margins, no Check snowmobiles won't ship until Q4 as compared to a stronger Q3 shipping quarter in 2020.
Second, while we are increasing selling prices and adding surcharges to offset a portion of the cost increases.
These increases do not take effect until late Q3, thus having a larger impact in Q4.
Let me quickly cover our sales expectations by segment.
ORV snowmobile sales guidance remain unchanged at up high teens percent.
The only modification is the timing of shipments, as indicated earlier, with more snowmobiles being shipped in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus prior year, given the supply chain disruptions and the timing of our pricing actions hitting Q4 more heavily than Q3.
Motorcycle sales are anticipated to be up low 30%, down slightly from prior guidance.
While we continue to expect our motorcycle business to grow and take share for the year, supply chain challenges are impacting production enough to possibly shift to some shipments into 2022.
In the remaining segments, Global Adjacent Markets, Aftermarket and Boats, we are increasing our sales expectations given the sales growth realized through the first half of 2021.
Year-to-date second quarter operating cash flow finished at 196 million, down 37% compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in factory inventory due to the supply chain inefficiencies.
Our expected full-year cash flow performance remains unchanged at down mid-30% compared to last year.
During the second quarter, we spent $111 million on share repurchases.
We will continue to prioritize organic investments in our business, along with share buybacks throughout the remainder of the year, subject to market conditions.
This quarter's results demonstrated the drive and determination of the Polaris team in the face of ongoing challenges.
We will continue to effectively manage a challenging environment to meet consumer demand.
The underlying earnings power of the company remains strong as does our financial health.
Demand for our products remains robust, and we do not see that changing in the medium to long term.
Our supply chain remains the top challenge for the company with component supply not expected to improve until sometime late 2021 or even early 2022.
And as a result, dealer inventories are not expected to return to normalized levels until sometime in late 2022 or even early 2023.
While much of the focus has been on the supply chain, innovation continues to be the lifeblood of Polaris, and we have a number of new products coming, including the all-new electric RANGER, along with exciting model year 2022 launches.
Let me close by reiterating that we're winning in a challenging environment, and we remain focused on navigating through the current supply chain challenges and rising input costs to deliver products our customers are demanding while at the same time, delivering improved results and value to our shareholders.
","Polaris reported strong Q2 results, exceeding expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $2.70, up 108% year-over-year. Adjusted sales grew 40% to $2,117 million, driven by strong demand across all segments. Market share gains continued in ATVs and side-by-sides, with boats also performing well. International sales grew 64%, benefiting from improving economic conditions. Despite supply chain challenges, the company remains confident in customer demand and has raised its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $9.35 to $9.60 per share. However, the second half of the year is expected to see a decline in earnings compared to H2 2020 due to increasing input costs, primarily commodity, labor, and supply chain-related expenses. Polaris continues to navigate supply chain disruptions, with dealer inventories remaining low and expected to normalize late in 2022 or even 2023. The company is focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges and delivering improved results for shareholders."

For medical ultrasound, our design wins are increasing through new programs with existing customers and several new customers sampling our solutions.
We received two transportation OEM quality awards and we're also recognized for delivery performance by an industrial OEM and a large distributor.
Overall, across all end markets, demand remains robust.
Some automotive customers have confirmed demand through 2022.
Order intake for electronic components was strong in the second quarter.
Although we've not seen signs so far, we remain cautious of potential inventory buildup in various end markets.
This past quarter we announced the $50 million stock buyback program.
As we look to capital deployment, our emphasis remains firmly on supporting organic growth investments and using our strong balance sheet to advance on M&A in alignment with our strategic priorities.
We continue to strengthen our M&A pipeline.
Potential changes in capital gains taxation may also provide some further momentum in our areas of interest.
We continue to seek to expand our range of technologies, products, customers, and geographic reach.
And at the same time, continue to diversify our end market profile to complement our quality of earnings.
For the second quarter, transportation sales represented 55% of our total company revenues as we made progress in Industrial, Medical, and Defense sales.
Operationally, we can see the end of our journey and the rollout of the SAP system, though we will continue to optimize our learnings and capabilities.
The previously announced restructuring savings of $0.22 to $0.26 by the second half of 2022 are tracking close to the target range.
Building the CTS operating system capability continues with four sites advancing their proficiency on the system and tools as we aim to empower our teams and strengthen operational and enterprise expertise.
Transitioning to end markets, the semiconductor shortage is expected to reduce vehicle builds by 6 million units this year.
The supply of global microcontrollers is improving from companies such as Renesas and NXP, which should deliver some improvements to vehicle OEMs. For the U.S. light vehicles transportation market, demand remains robust.
We still expect approximately a 15 million to 16 million unit range this year, up double digits year-over-year.
On-hand days of supply are between 25 and 30 days, the lowest in recent history, and down 50% since January of this year.
European production is forecasted in the 16 million to 18 million unit range with some uncertainty persisting due to the extended COVID lockdowns.
The Chinese market has fluctuated recently showing the first chip-related impact.
China volumes are expected in the range of 23 million to 25 million unit range for this year.
The commercial vehicle market remains strong, not only for this year but likely into the first half of 2022.
The biggest challenge is the supply of semiconductors as demand remains robust.
As I mentioned earlier, for transportation, the supply challenges will continue to impact our sales in the second half of this year.
However, we see improvements in medical as well as solid growth in industrial and defense markets.
In terms of guidance for the full year 2021, we are updating our range.
Our previous guidance was for sales in the range of $445 million to $500 million, and adjusted earnings in the range of $1.35 to $1.70.
We are now updating our guidance for sales to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million, and adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90.
Further updates will be provided as we continue to monitor the ongoing supply challenges.
Phase 2 of our journey and our biggest priority as we advance toward our 2025 goals is layering on a more robust sales growth profile.
Our teams are making progress as we continue to focus on existing accounts and add resources and capabilities to further support business development.
At this time, Ashish will take us through the financial performance.
Second quarter sales were $129.6 million, up 54% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 1% sequentially from the first quarter.
Sales to transportation customers bounced back 88% compared with the pandemic-driven lows in the second quarter of 2020.
However, we were down 6% sequentially as we saw the impact of supply challenges on global production volumes.
Sales to other end markets increased 26% year-over-year and were up 10% sequentially.
We had another quarter of solid year-over-year double-digit growth in the industrial as well as aerospace and defense end markets.
Sales to the transportation end market represented 55% of our total revenue.
This reflects progress toward our strategic goal to further diversify our business by growth in the Industrial, Medical as well as Aerospace and Defense end markets.
Our two temperature sensing acquisitions have performed well and had strong top line growth in the second quarter.
Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted our revenue favorably by approximately $2.7 million.
Our gross margin was 36.8% in the second quarter, up 525 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 360 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2021.
These improvements reflect the progress in operational efficiency in our foundry operations over the last 12 months, as well as improvements in other parts of our business.
We also benefited from a larger portion of our revenue coming from the Industrial, Medical and Aerospace and Defense end markets.
Raw material price increases, as well as freight costs continue to impact us unfavorably.
And we are working closely with our customer base to offset or share these cost increases.
In the last quarter, we generated $0.03 of earnings per share in savings from our restructuring program announced in the third quarter of 2020, bringing the total savings to $0.12 of earnings per share so far.
As we mentioned back in April, the timing of some of our projects is being impacted due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on travel, as well as an increase in demand.
We are still on track to achieve the targeted annualized savings of $0.22 to $0.26 by the end of 2022.
SG&A and R&D expenses were $27 million or 21% for the second quarter.
Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of reinstating cost cuts made during the pandemic to offset the impact of revenue decline and higher incentive compensation expenses.
In the second quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of $20.1 million related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan.
We are expecting the remaining non-cash charge of approximately $101 million to be booked in the third quarter when we complete the settlement process.
As a reminder, these are non-cash charges and the U.S. pension plan is expected to be overfunded at settlement.
Second quarter tax rate was 246% as a result of the impact of the pension settlement charge on our income statement.
We anticipate our 2021 tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21% excluding the impact of the pension settlement and other discrete items.
We are carefully watching the new tax proposals and initiatives of the Biden Administration, and we'll discuss the impact on our business in the coming months as we get more clarity.
Second quarter 2021 earnings were $0.03 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.52 compared to $0.16 for the same period last year and $0.46 last quarter.
Now I'll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow.
Our controllable working capital is essentially flat from the end of 2020.
While we remain focused on working capital efficiency, we anticipate carrying some excess inventory where possible to manage supply chain concerns over the next few quarters.
Our operating cash flow was $19 million for the second quarter which is an improvement from $12 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We generated $16 million in free cash flow.
Capex was low in the first half primarily due to the timing of various projects.
In 2021, we expect capex to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% of sales.
Our cash balance on June 30, 2021 was $117 million, up from $92 million on December 31, 2020.
Our long-term debt balance was $50 million, down from $55 million on December 31, 2020.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was at 9.9% at the end of the second quarter compared to 11.4% at the end of 2020.
The combination of a strong balance sheet with a net cash position and access to approximately $250 million through our credit facility gives us the liquidity to make progress on the right M&A transactions.
In early July, we successfully went live on SAP at Boise, Idaho, and Tecate, Mexico.
These are locations from our first temperature acquisition.
As we had previously mentioned, more than 90% of our revenue now comes from sites that are running on SAP.
We expect to complete the rollout to our remaining sites in early 2022.
Before we wrap up, as Kieran mentioned earlier, we see a sustained demand environment in the second half of 2021.
However, supply chain challenges are expected to persist for us and our customers on both material availability and cost through the rest of the year.
Our current expectation is that Q3 could be the most challenging with some improvements in the fourth quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments.
","CTS's second-quarter performance was marked by a 54% surge in sales to $129.6 million, with organic growth reaching 52%. Despite supply chain challenges impacting automotive sales, customer demand remained strong. Gross margin improved significantly to 36.8%, driven by operational efficiencies and a higher mix of sales from non-transportation markets. EBITDA margin also rose to 21.5% from 16.7% a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share reached $0.52, a 225% increase from the prior year. New business awards grew to $174 million. The company continues to progress with its strategic initiatives, including diversification, expansion, and operational enhancements. However, supply chain disruptions and some customer shutdowns are expected to persist during the second half. The company remains optimistic about the demand outlook and has updated its guidance for full-year sales and adjusted earnings."
PEG_q1_2021.txt,"PSEG released first quarter 2021 earnings results earlier today.
We also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which differ from net income as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
I'm pleased to report that PSEG has achieved several major milestones on our path to becoming a primarily regulated utility company with a complementary and significantly contracted carbon-free generating fleet.
Our GAAP results for the first quarter were also $1.28 per share versus $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Results from ongoing regulated investments at PSE&G and the effect of cold weather on PSEG Power drove favorable comparisons at both businesses.
We are well positioned to execute on our financial and strategic goals for the balance of the year given this eventful quarter.
Beginning was out nearly $2 billion of Clean Energy Future programs, which have moved from approval to execution.
PSE&G is helping to advance the decarbonization of New Jersey in a sizable and equitable way.
Our Clean Energy Future investments are paired with a jobs training program that offers opportunities to low and middle-income New Jersey community.
Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted unanimously to award a continuation of the full $10 per megawatt hour zero-emission certificates, I'll just call them ZECs from now on, for all three New Jersey nuclear units, that would be Hope Creek, Salem number one and Salem number two through May of 2025.
This was the maximum amount that the BPU could have awarded, and we are appreciative of the support received from the many community, labor, business, environmental and employee organizations that participated in this enormously important process.
Each of these groups recognizes the value of the reliable around the clock and carbon-free electricity supply our nuclear plants provide.
Throughout this process, our nuclear team has approached operations at the units with the utmost professionalism and dedication to safety.
I congratulate PSEG Nuclear for being recognized by as an industry leader in operational reliability, one of only two nuclear fleets across the industry with no scrams over the past 365 days.
The BPU's decision to extend the ZEC program will advance climate action in New Jersey by helping to preserve the state's largest carbon-free generating resource and is consistent with the growing interest at the federal level in preserving existing nuclear as an essential part of a clean energy mix.
We applaud the BPU for its decision, which is in the best interest of the state of New Jersey and its ability to achieve its long-term clean energy goals without compromising reliability or going backward on environmental gains made to date.
Looking ahead, we will soon work with stakeholders to obtain alignment of state and federal climate goals in seeking ways to extend the duration of support for carbon-free nuclear power.
During the quarter, the BPU also approved PSEG's 25% equity investment in Orsted's Ocean Wind project.
In addition, Ocean Wind received a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, which we will also review -- which will also review the project's construction and operations plan.
In April, PJM, closed cooperation with the BPU, opened a four month solicitation window to seek transmission solutions to support New Jersey's offshore wind generation target.
This process is PGM's first public policy transmission solicitation, and we will participate in this proceeding.
The recent Biden administration proposal focusing on climate action is clearly supportive of offshore wind, existing nuclear generation and electrification of transportation, all of which are aligned with PSEG's business plan and strategy for sustainability.
PSEG eagerly encourages an advocate for a national approach to accelerate economy wide, net zero emissions even sooner than 2050 in a constructive manner that expands green jobs by investing in clean energy infrastructure.
I am more optimistic than ever that the momentum for real climate action is taking hold, PSEG continues to press ahead with our powering, progress, vision, that incorporates energy efficiency and the electrification of transportation to help our customers use energy -- use less energy.
We are pairing that with our move to make the energy our customers use cleaner, which aligns with our efforts to preserve our existing nuclear units and pursue strategic alternatives for our Fossil fleet.
Then we strive to deliver with high reliability and resiliency, which ties to our investments in Energy Infrastructure and the Energy cloud.
Today, we are also announcing progress on our strategic alternatives exploration with an agreement to sell our solar source portfolio to an affiliate of LS Power.
The sale resulted from a robust marketing process, and we're pleased with the outcome of the sale, having determined that the transaction is modestly accretive on the sum of the parts and on an operating earnings basis going forward.
We expect the solar source portfolio deals to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to customary, regulatory and other closing conditions.
PSEG Power is continuing the exploration of strategic alternatives for its Fossil generating fleet and currently anticipate reaching an agreement around midyear.
These expected transactions, along with over a decade of capital allocation directed mainly toward PSE&G to position the remaining company as a primarily regulated electric and gas utility with a complementary carbon-free nuclear fleet and offshore wind investments that will be highly contracted.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact continued to affect the New Jersey economy.
The large contribution of the transmission and residential electric and gas components to our overall sales mix has had a stabilizing effect on the margins of our utility business as does a supportive regulatory order that authorizes deferral of certain COVID-19-related costs for future recovery.
Governor Murphy recently announced that a significant easing of COVID-19 restrictions on the state's businesses, venues and gatherings would begin on May 19 following progress in vaccinating over half of the state's population and a sustained reduction in positivity and hospitalization rates.
PSE&G has begun implementing the Clean Energy Future Energy Efficiency programs by initiating customer engagement and outreach as well as advancing the clean energy jobs training program I mentioned earlier and related IT system build-out activity.
Following the BPU approval of our $700 million AMI proposal in January, we have begun implementation of the 4-year program.
Our current focus is on planning the AMI communications network, customer outreach and developing the installation schedule of the new meters.
On the regulatory and policy front, there are several upcoming developments at the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the BPU and PJM that could influence future results.
Last month, FERC promulgated a new proposed rule to limit the 50 basis point RTO return on equity incentive to a 3-year period.
Given the Biden administration's interest in the significant transmission build out to expand the integration of Clean Energy into the nation's power grid, this development was disappointed.
We have long supported the need for higher incentives for transmission investment over distribution returns based on the added complexity and risk of these projects.
Coordination through the RTO has benefits, but -- risks and complications must be considered as well.
Based on the short comment window provided, the proposed rule could be enacted as early as the third quarter.
We will file comments to recognize the merits of continuing the RTO adder, but this looks to be an uphill battle, given the Chair's support for the supplemental rule.
While we await the results of the first PJM capacity auction in three years, which PGM will announce on June 2, PSEG is continuing to advocate for a minimum offer price rule, I'll call it MOPR going forward, that will avoid double payment for resources such as offshore wind and nuclear or other supply need to achieve state goals.
FERC Commissioner Danly has developed a state option to choose resources proposal, or SOCR, intended to achieve the major goals of establishing the rights of states to choose their preferred capacity resources to achieve their energy policy objectives and eliminate double payments by states for the capacity they choose.
This proposal could have the added benefit of keeping much of FERC's capacity market reform rules intact while addressing state objections.
New Jersey is expected to issue its consultants report and recommendation for resource adequacy this month.
This report could determine whether a fixed resource requirement, or FRR, will be chosen to satisfy the state's future capacity obligations beyond the 2022 and 2023 energy year.
We continue to believe that the state could pursue an FRR without legislation and will suggest options to minimize the cost impact of FERC's capacity ruling on New Jersey customers.
Earlier in April, the BPU released its strong proposal to address the design of the solar successor program.
Stakeholder meetings are being conducted to consider a solar financial incentive program that will permanently replace the Solar Renewable Energy Certificate, or SREC program, and the Temporary Transitional Renewable Energy Certificate, or TRAC program, which was instituted in 2020 upon the state attainment of 5.1% of kilowatt hours sold from solar generation fee.
Given the substantial increase in New Jersey solar target, the high cost of solar and the solar cost caps in the Clean Energy Act of 2018, we believe it is critical to develop a cost-effective approach to incent future solar generation.
By far, the most efficient and cost-effective way for New Jersey to optimize what solar can bring to the achievement of its clean energy goals is to maximize grid-connected utility-scale projects by involving the state's electric distribution company.
So to wrap up my remarks, we are reaffirming non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share.
Our guidance assumes normal weather and plant operations for the remainder of the year and incorporates the conservation incentive programs that begin in June for electric and in October for gas to cover variations in revenue due to energy efficiency and other impacts.
In addition, as we mentioned on our year-end call, our 2021 guidance assumes a prospective settlement of our transmission return on equity at a lower rate and the inclusion of Fossil's results for the full year.
We are on track to execute PSEG's 5-year $14 billion to $16 billion capital program through 2025 and had the financial strength to fund it without the need to issue new equity.
Over 90% of the current capital program is directed to PSE&G, which is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth in rate base over the '21 to '25 period, starting from PSEG's year-end 2020 rate base of $22 billion.
As we've noted previously, PSE&G's considerable cash-generating capabilities are supported by over 90% of its capital spending, continuing to receive either formula rate last based or current rate recovery of and on capital.
From nuclear operations marking a second breaker-to-breaker uninterrupted run at Hope Creek to a cross-functional regulatory, legal, financing, government affairs group that multi cash on Clean Energy Future, ZECs and a host of other regulatory proceedings, to our field crews in New Jersey and Long Island who exemplify a safety conscious mindset, I could not be prouder of our entire PSEG team.
As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter.
We've provided you with information on Slide 12 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter.
And Slide 13 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business.
I'll now review each company in more detail.
PSE&G, as shown on Slide 15, reported net income for the first quarter 2021 of $0.94 per share compared with $0.87 per share for the first quarter of 2020, up 8% versus last year.
Results improved by $0.07 per share, driven by revenue growth from ongoing capital investment program and favorable pension OPEB results.
Transmission capital spending added $0.02 per share of the first quarter net income compared to the first quarter of 2020.
On the distribution side, gas margin improved by $0.03 per share over last year's first quarter, driven by the scheduled recovery of investments made under the second phase of the Gas System Modernization Program.
Electric margin was $0.01 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020 on a higher weather-normalized residential volume.
O&M expense was $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2020, reflecting higher costs from several February snowstorms.
Depreciation expense increased by $0.01 per share, reflecting higher plant in service, and pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Flow through taxes and other were $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020.
And this tax benefit is due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year and was partly offset by the timing of taxes related to bad debt expense.
Winter weather, as measured by heating degree days, was 4% milder than normal, but was 18% colder than the mild winter experienced in the first quarter of 2020.
For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, total weather-normalized sales reflected the higher expected residential and lower commercial and industrial sales observed in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19.
Total electric sales declined by 2%, while gas sales increased by approximately 1%.
Residential customer growth for electric and gas remained positive during the period.
PSE&G invested approximately $600 million in the first quarter and is on track to fully execute on its planned 2021 capital investment program of $2.7 billion.
The 2021 capital spending program will include infrastructure upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities as well as the rollout of the Clean Energy Future investments in Energy Efficiency, Energy Cloud, including smart meters and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
PSE&G is continuing to defer the impact of additional expenses incurred to protect its employees and customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PSE&G has experienced significantly higher accounts receivables and bad debts, and lower cash collections from customers due to the moratorium on shut offs for residential customers that began last March and has been extended through June of this year.
We've launched an Expanded Customer Communications Program designed to inform all customers about payment assistance programs and bill management tools.
As a reminder, PSE&G continues to make quarterly filings with the BPU, detailing the COVID-19 pandemic related deferrals.
And as of March 31, PSE&G has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $60 million for net incremental costs, which includes $35 million for incremental gas bad debt expense.
Electric bad debt expenses recovered through the societal benefits charge and trued up periodically.
With respect to subsidiary guidance for PSE&G, our forecast of net income for 2021 is unchanged at $1.410 billion to $1.470 billion.
Now moving to Power.
In the first quarter of 2021, PSEG Power reported net income of $161 million or $0.32 per share, non-GAAP operating earnings of $163 million or $0.32 per share, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $321 million.
This compares to first quarter 2020 net income of $13 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $85 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $201 million.
And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 22.
PSEG Power's first quarter results benefited from a scheduled improvement in capacity prices for the first half of 2021, a favorable weather comparison to the mild winter in the first quarter of 2020, and other items, some of which are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.
The expected increase in PJM's capacity revenue improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share compared with last year's first quarter.
Higher generation in the 2021 first quarter added $0.01 per share due to the absence of the first quarter 2020 unplanned [on one average.
] And favorable market conditions influenced by February's cold weather benefited results by $0.03 per share compared to last year's first quarter.
We continue to forecast a $2 per megawatt hour average decline in recontracting for the full year recognizing that the shape of the annual average change favors the winter months of the first quarter.
The weather-related improvement in total gas send out to commercial and industrial customers increased results by $0.04 per share.
We expect some of this increase to gas apps will reverse later in 2021, reflecting the absence of a onetime benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2020 related to a pipeline refund.
O&M expense was $0.03 per share favorable in the quarter, benefiting from the absence of first quarter 2020 outages at Bergen two and Salem 1, and lower depreciation and lower interest expense combined to improve by $0.01 per share versus the quarter ago -- or the year ago quarter.
Generation output increased by just under 1% to total 13.3-terawatt hours versus last year's first quarter when Salem Unit one experienced a month-long unplanned outage.
PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced 4.7-terawatt hours, down 8%, reflecting lower market demand in the quarter.
The Nuclear fleet produced 8.2-terawatt hours, up 3%, and operated at a capacity factor of 98.8% for the first quarter, representing 62% of total generation.
As Ralph mentioned, Hope Creek posted an uninterrupted run between refueling outages and just began its 23rd refueling outage in April.
PSEG Power is forecasting generation output of 36 to 38 terawatt hours for the remaining three quarters of 2021 and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $30 per megawatt hour.
Gross margin for the first quarter rose to approximately $34 per megawatt hour compared to $30 per megawatt hour in the first quarter of 2020, which contained one of the mildest winters in recent history.
Power prices in the first quarter of 2021 were stronger across PJM New York and New England compared to the year earlier period.
And this winter's temperatures were 12% cooler on average and resulted in better market conditions compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Power's average capacity prices in PJM were higher in the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020 and will remain stable at $168 per megawatt hour -- per megawatt day through May of 2022.
In New England, our average realized capacity price will decline slightly to $192 per megawatt day, beginning June 1.
However, Power's cleared capacity will decline by 383 megawatts with the scheduled retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor Unit 3, achieving our goal of making Power's fleet completely coal free.
Over 75% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2021 is secured by our fully hedged position of energy output, capacity revenue set in previous auctions and the opportunity to earn a full year of ZEC revenues and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.
The forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2021 remain unchanged at $280 million to $370 million and $850 million to $950 million, respectively.
Now let me briefly address results from PSEG Enterprise and Other.
For the first quarter of 2021, Enterprise and Other reported net income of $10 million or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $5 million or $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2020.
The improvement in the quarter reflects higher tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2021 due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year as well as interest income associated with a prior IRS audit settlement.
For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million.
With respect to financial position, PSG ended the quarter with $803 million of cash on the balance sheet.
During the first quarter, PSE&G issued $450 million of 5-year secured medium-term notes at 95 basis points and $450 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes at 3%.
In addition, we retired a $300 million, 1.9% medium-term note at PSE&G that matured in March.
In March of 2021, PSEG closed on a $500 million, 364-day variable rate term loan agreement, following the January prepayment of a $300 million term loan initiated in March of 2020.
For the balance of the year, we have approximately $950 million of debt at PSEG Power scheduled to mature in June and September.
$300 million of debt scheduled to mature at the parent in November and $134 million of debt at PSE&G scheduled to mature in June.
Our solid balance sheet and credit metrics keep us in a position to fund our 2021 to 2025 capital investment program without the need to issue new equity.
As Ralph mentioned earlier, we are affirming our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share.
That concludes my comments.
And Christi, we are now ready to take questions.
","PSEG reported Q1 2021 earnings per share of $1.28, up from $0.88 in Q1 2020. The company reaffirmed its full-year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. The positive results were driven by PSE&G and PSEG Power. PSE&G's net income increased 8% due to higher revenue from capital investments and favorable pension results. PSEG Power benefited from higher capacity prices, favorable weather, and higher generation. PSEG continues to invest in its $14-16 billion, 5-year capital program, with 90% directed to PSE&G. The company secured a continuation of zero-emission certificates for its nuclear units through 2025, which will support its goal of becoming a primarily regulated utility with a carbon-free generating fleet. PSEG is exploring strategic alternatives for its solar source portfolio and Fossil generating fleet, expected to reach agreements by mid-year. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, PSEG expects a significant easing of restrictions in May and anticipates reaching an agreement on its Fossil fleet soon. The company remains confident in its ability to fund its capital program and execute its plans without issuing new equity."
WEC_q2_2021.txt,"I'd like to interrupt just for a minute.
I'm Peter Feigin, President of the NBA champion, Milwaukee Bucks.
And I can tell you, firsthand, in a big way, that you can't have a truly great NBA team without an incredible energy company to power you up.
So I'm proud to introduce a personal friend, one of the terrific minority owners of the Bucks and the Chairman of one of the best energy companies in America, Gale Klappa.
Go Bucks, and go WEC.
Well, wonders never cease.
And I'm not sure I can top all of that, but no pun intended, let's give it a shot.
We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Xia will provide you with more details in just a few minutes.
But given our strong performance through the first half of this year, we're raising our annual guidance.
The new range is $4.02 a share to $4.05 a share, and our expectation is that we will reach the top end of that range.
As always, this assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
Now as we look across our business lines, I'm pleased to report that every segment is performing at a high level.
Our companies continue to deliver superior reliability and customer satisfaction.
A solid economic recovery in Wisconsin with commercial and industrial expansion gives us confidence in our projected sales growth.
Our balance sheet is strong.
We have no need to issue new equity to fund our ESG progress plan, and our plan is well on track for both our regulated and our infrastructure segments.
As you may know, we expect our ESG progress plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%.
At the same time, it's bolstering our sustainability as we invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art technology.
A good example of our progress is the announcement we made just a week ago about a $400 million investment in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center.
Scott will provide you with more detail on this development in just a moment, but I will tell you that the offtake agreement is with one of the largest high-tech companies in the world, and we expect the project to meet or exceed all of our financial metrics.
We've also made great progress on our plan to build 1,800 megawatts of regulated solar, wind and battery storage.
These carbon-free assets will play a significant role in improving our environmental footprint.
Recall that, back in May, we set near-term goals that are among the most ambitious in the industry: reducing carbon emissions by 60% from our electric generation fleet by 2025 and achieving an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline.
So ahead that we now expect only 8% of our regulated electricity supply to come from coal by the end of 2030.
We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units; operating refinements; and the use of existing technology as we execute our ESG progress plan.
Of course, our long-term goal remains net-zero carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050.
And our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and introduce renewable natural gas into our system will help us achieve another aggressive goal: net-zero methane emissions by 2030.
You can learn more about these goals and much more in our corporate responsibility report, which we published just last week.
And now let's switch gears a bit and take a quick look at our regional economy.
We're still seeing the positive effects of a strong recovery.
Wisconsin's unemployment rate, in fact, stands today at 3.9%.
Folks, that's two full percentage points better than the national average.
As I mentioned, business continues to grow with new projects across the region.
For example, Milwaukee Tool is expanding the operations again here in Milwaukee.
If you're not familiar with Milwaukee Tool, company has been a leader in the development of battery-powered, cordless tools.
It now has become the world's number one producer of tools for professionals in the construction trades, utility sector, as well as for auto mechanics.
And now Milwaukee Tool is redeveloping a vacant downtown office tower to provide space for one,200 new employees over the next five years.
In addition, a number of other economic development projects are in the pipeline, and we'll be covering those with you in future calls.
On that note, I'll turn our call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segment.
Well, wonders never cease.
And I'm not sure I can top all of that, but no pun intended, let's give it a shot.
We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Xia will provide you with more details in just a few minutes.
But given our strong performance through the first half of this year, we're raising our annual guidance.
The new range is $4.02 a share to $4.05 a share, and our expectation is that we will reach the top end of that range.
As always, this assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
Now as we look across our business lines, I'm pleased to report that every segment is performing at a high level.
Our companies continue to deliver superior reliability and customer satisfaction.
A solid economic recovery in Wisconsin with commercial and industrial expansion gives us confidence in our projected sales growth.
Our balance sheet is strong.
We have no need to issue new equity to fund our ESG progress plan, and our plan is well on track for both our regulated and our infrastructure segments.

On that note, I'll turn our call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segment.
We continue to see customer growth across our system.
At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 4,000 more electric customers and 18,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago.
Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on page 13 of the earnings packet.
Overall retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 7.1% from the second quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis were up 5.8%.
We are encouraged by the economic rebound we are seeing in our service territory.
For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 10.4% from last year's second quarter and on a weather-normal basis were up 9.2%.
Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 14.8% from the second quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis were up 13.9%.
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were down 4.9%.
This excludes gas used for power generation.
And on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%.
Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up.
Turning now to our WEC infrastructure segment.
As Gale noted, we have agreed to acquire a 90% ownership interest in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center.
The project is being developed in McLean County, Illinois by Invenergy.
The site will consist of 64 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts.
We expect it will go in service late in 2022.
The project fits our investment criteria very well.
We plan to invest $412 million for the 90% ownership interest.
We now have eight wind projects announced or in operation in our infrastructure segment.
This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investment.
We expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion in this segment over the remainder of our five-year plan.
Our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year, and our Thunderhead Wind investment is now projected to go in service in the first half of 2022.
These time lines have been factored into our forecast.
In case you're wondering about the impact of inflation on these projects, to date, we have not encountered any significant inflationary pressure.
Remember that we primarily invest in turnkey projects with developers, so we are seeing no reduction of returns.
Touching on some recent developments in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow I solar project is nearing completion and is producing test energy.
As you may recall, we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin, and Madison Gas and Electric owns the remaining 50 megawatts.
This is our second large-scale solar project and part of our plans for more than triple renewable energy between 2021 and 2025 we expect the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, to achieve commercial operations next year.
Now for a few regulatory updates.
Recall that after reaching an agreement with a major customer and environmental groups, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission to forego a rate base for our Wisconsin utilities this year.
We expect a decision in the weeks to come.
And we're pleased that the commission has approved pilot programs for electric vehicle charging in our Wisconsin service areas.
With these programs, we plan to install charging equipment and electric distribution infrastructure.
This is the first step in our effort to promote affordable charging options for electric vehicles.
And we also have updates on the rate reviews at two of our smaller utilities.
In Illinois, earlier this year, North Shore Gas requested a rate increase, primarily due to the significant capital investments we have made since the last rate case in 2015.
Recently, the administrative law judge on the case issued a proposed order.
The order recommends a $4.2 million rate increase on a 9.67% ROE and 51.6% equity component.
We expect the commission's final decision by mid-September.
Finally, in Michigan, I'm pleased to advise you that we have reached a settlement with all parties to conclude our rate review for Michigan Gas Utilities.
This settlement stipulates a 9.85% return on equity and a revenue increase of $9.25 million with an equity layer of 51.5%.
We expect the commission's approval by the end of the third quarter.
We have no other rate cases pending at this time.
Our 2021 second quarter earnings of $0.87 per share increased $0.11 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations.
Our regulated utilities benefited from warmer-than-normal weather, recovering economy, continued execution of our capital plan and our focus on operating efficiency.
I'll walk through the significant drivers.
Starting with our Utility Operations.
We grew our earnings by $0.09 compared to the second quarter of 2020.
First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic drove a $0.06 increase in earnings.
This reflects stronger weather-normalized sales, as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges.
Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.01, and all other factors resulted in a positive variance of $0.02.
These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense.
I'd like to point out that quarter-over-quarter, the impact of weather was flat.
Overall, we added $0.09 quarter-over-quarter from Utility Operations.
Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company.
Earnings decreased $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2020.
While we picked up $0.01 in the current quarter from continued capital investment, this was more than offset by a $0.03 benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2020 related to a FERC order.
Recall that this order allowed ATC to increase its ROE from 10.38% to 10.52% retroactive to November 2013.
Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020.
This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions, partially offset by less-than-projected wind resources.
Finally, we saw a $0.03 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment.
Lower interest expense contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter.
We recognized a $0.03 gain from our investment in a fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development.
These positive variances were partially offset by a reduction of $0.01 in rabbi trust performance and $0.01 in taxes and other.
In summary, we improved on our second quarter 2020 performance by $0.11.
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items.
For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%.
Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%.
As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021.
Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan.
Looking now at the cash flow statement on page six of the earnings package.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $153 million.
Our increase in cash earnings in the first six months of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements.
Recall that the spike in natural gas costs seen throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with higher accounts receivable balances, contributed to this increase in working capital.
We were able to improve our working capital position in the second quarter.
With normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year.
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2021, a $93 million increase as compared with the first six months of 2020.
This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and Energy Infrastructure business.
On the financing front, we continue to find opportunities to lower our interest costs.
In fact, in June, we refinanced $300 million of debt at Wisconsin Electric, reducing the average coupon of these notes by over 1.2% and extending the maturity to 2028.
We are expecting a range of $0.72 to $0.74 per share for the third quarter.
This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
This also takes into account timing of our fuel recovery and the costs associated with major storms that impacted our system last week.
As a reminder, we earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter last year.
This includes an estimated $0.05 of better-than-normal weather.
And as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our 2021 earnings guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.05 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range.
This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
In addition to raising our annual guidance, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% a year with a strong bias toward the upper half of that range.
And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend.
As you may recall, in January, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 7.1% to $0.6775 a share.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.
We're in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.
Overall, ladies and gentlemen, we're on track, focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.
And operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.
","Due to strong performance in the first half of the year, the company has raised its annual guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.05 per share, with expectations of reaching the top end of the range. The company's focus on ESG progress is driving a 7% average annual growth in asset base and improving sustainability through investments in renewable energy and technology. The Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center project is a notable example with an offtake agreement from a major high-tech company. Wisconsin's positive economic outlook, with a low unemployment rate and business expansion, contributes to the company's confidence in its sales growth. The company remains financially sound with no need to issue new equity for ESG initiatives. Additionally, the company is investing significantly in its infrastructure segment, with $2.3 billion invested to date and plans for $1.1 billion more over the next five years. It is closely monitoring inflation but has not encountered any significant impacts on projects yet."
WEC_q3_2021.txt,"We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
I'm sure you saw the announcement last week that our Board of Directors has taken the next step in our long-term succession planning.
Kevin has decided to devote more time with his grandchildren and to water-skiing barefoot on his favorite lakes.
He'll be retiring in 2022.
We're delighted that Scott will assume the role of President and Chief Executive on February 1.
And finally, I've agreed to continue serving as Executive Chairman until our Annual Stockholders Meeting in 2024.
Kevin and Scott, of course, have been instrumental in shaping our progress over many years.
And I look forward to working hand-in-hand with Scott as he takes on his new role.
Our results were significantly better than expected, driven by warmer than normal weather, continued economic recovery in our region, and our focus on operating efficiency.
Our balance sheet, our cash flows remained strong, and as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity.
In just a moment, we'll update you on the details of our new five-year ESG Progress Plan, a plan that will cover our investments in reliability and decarbonization over the period 2022 through 2026.
As we've reported to you, we're well on our way to achieving some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions.
Across our generation fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction by 2025 and then 80% reduction by 2030, both from a 2005 baseline.
Importantly, we have a roadmap to reach these goals without any major advances in technology.
So today, we're announcing that our use of coal will continue to decline to a level that we expect will be immaterial by the end of 2030.
By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal will account for less than 5% of the power we supply to customers.
A number of you have also been asking when can we exit coal completely.
Here is the answer.
We believe we'll be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the year 2035.
The next logical question is, what does this mean for the modern coal-fired units at our Oak Creek site?
As you recall, these units were part of our Power the Future plan and were completed only about a decade ago.
Well, our modern units at Oak Creek will remain a key part of our fleet for many, many years to come.
These Power the Future units rank as some of the most efficient in the country, among the top 5% of all coal-fired plants in heat rate performance over the past decade and they're strategically -- as we've discussed, they are strategically located to support reliability on the Midwestern transmission grid.
Fortunately, we can plan for the future of the new units at Oak Creek with fuel flexibility in mind.
We've tested coal firing on natural gas at the site.
So subject to the receipt of an environmental permit, we plan to make operating refinements over the next two years that will allow a fuel blend of up to 30% on natural gas.
And then over time, we will be able to transition completely away from coal by making incremental investments in plant equipment.
This would include, for example, new burners and, of course, we will need additional pipeline capacity reaching into the site.
So we see a very bright and long future for the newer units at Oak Creek.
And now, let's take a look at the capital plan that will continue to shape a decarbonizing economy.
For the period 2022 through 2026, we expect to invest $17.7 billion.
Our focus remains on efficiency, sustainability and growth.
This ESG Progress Plan is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $1.6 billion or nearly 10% above our previous five-year plan.
We expect this plan to support compound earnings growth of 6% to 7% a year over the next five years without any need to issue new equity.
We'll be increasing our investment in renewables for our regulated utilities from 1,800 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 2,400 megawatts in this brand-new plan.
These carbon-free assets include solar, wind and battery storage.
We're also dedicating more capital to hardening our electric distribution networks, so that we can maintain a superior level of reliability for our customers, and investments in our gas delivery systems and the development of renewable natural gas will support our goals for the gas distribution business as well.
As a reminder, we're targeting net zero methane emissions by 2030.
So add it all up and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan.
The projects that are driving our growth are low-risk and highly executable, and they are accelerating the transition to a clean energy future.
We continue to see customer growth across our system.
At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and 15,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago.
Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet.
Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.4% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather normal basis were up 2.5%.
We continue to see economic rebound in our service territory.
For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 3.5% from last year's third quarter and on a weather normal basis, they were up 4.2%.
Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 3.8% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather normal basis were up 3.5%.
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were up 1%.
This excludes gas used for power generation.
And on a weather normal basis natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%.
Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up.
Turning now to our Infrastructure segment, our new capital plan calls for the investment of $1.9 billion between 2022 and 2026.
Considering the three projects that are currently under development, we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion at that timeframe.
As a quick reminder, we have eight wind projects, all with long-term off-takers.
Announced through an operation in our Infrastructure segment, this represents approximately $2.3 billion of investments.
As previously discussed, our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year and our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service in the first half of 2022.
These timelines have been factored into our updated capital plan.
First, I'll cover some developments here in Wisconsin.
I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow I Solar project is just weeks away from completion.
You'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin.
For the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, we now are performing civil work and grading.
Our target for completing that project is the end of 2022.
That date will depend on module supply which is uncertain as we await clarity on matters before the Department of Commerce.
Now, for a few regulatory updates.
We expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission shortly on our plans to build two liquefied natural gas storage facilities in the Southeastern part of the state.
This proposed investment would greatly enhance customer savings and reliability during Wisconsin's cold winters.
Pending approval, we expect the facilities to enter service in late 2023.
They are projected to save our We Energies customers approximately $200 million over time.
We also have updates on the rate reviews at two of our smaller utilities.
The Illinois Commerce Commission unanimously approved the final order for our rate case at North Shore Gas.
The order authorizes a rate increase of 4.5%, including an ROE of 9.67% and an equity ratio of 51.58%.
New rates went into effect on September 15.
And the Michigan Public Service Commission unanimously approved a settlement in our rate case for Michigan Gas Utilities.
The settlement authorizes a rate increase of 6.35%, including an ROE of 9.85% and an equity ratio of 51.5%.
New rates will be effective January 1.
We have no other rate cases pending at this time.
And as we look forward to the winter heating season ahead, I'm pleased to report that we're ready.
We have our gas contracts in place and our gas inventories are at our targeted levels.
We continue to deliver quality and consistent earnings.
Our 2021 third quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations.
Our regulated utilities benefited from the strong economic recovery in our region, continued execution of our capital plan and our focus on operating efficiency.
I'll walk through the significant drivers.
Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2020.
First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic and stronger weather normalized sales drove a $0.03 increase in earnings.
Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the third quarter of 2020 and lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.04.
These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and $0.02 of increased fuel costs related to higher natural gas prices.
It's worth noting that we estimate weather was $0.05 favorable compared to normal in the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020.
Overall, we added $0.05 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations.
Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.01 compared to the third quarter of 2020 driven by continued capital investment.
Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020.
This was driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions.
Finally, we saw a $0.01 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment.
This increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense.
In summary, we improved on our third quarter 2020 performance by $0.08 a share.
Now, I'd like to update you on some other financial items.
For the full-year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%.
Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%.
As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021.
Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan.
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $57 million.
Our increase in cash earnings in the first nine months of 2021 more than offset the higher working capital requirements.
As expected, with normal collection practices underway in all of our service territories, we made great strides in improving our working capital position in the third quarter.
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.7 billion for the first nine months of 2021, a $129 million increase as compared with the first nine months of 2020.
This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utilities and energy infrastructure business.
Looking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plans to invest $17.7 billion over the next five years in key infrastructure.
This ESG Progress Plan supports 7% annual growth in our asset base.
Pages 18 and 19 of the earnings packet provide more details of the breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here.
As we continue to make our energy transition, nearly 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $5.4 billion in renewable investment and $6.8 billion in grid and fleet reliability.
Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to support our strong customer growth.
We also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and modernization of our infrastructure to further generate long-term operating efficiency.
With our strong economic development backdrop and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead, even beyond the next five years.
We're raising our earnings guidance again for 2021 to a range of $4.05 to $4.07 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range.
This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
This is the second time we're raising our guidance.
If you recall, our original guidance was $3.99 to $4.03 per share.
We're on track for a solid year.
Again, in light of our strong performance, our guidance range now stands at $4.05 to $4.07 a share.
We're also tightening our projection of long-term earnings growth to a range of 6% to 7% a year.
And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend.
As usual, I expect our Board will assess our dividend plans for next year at our scheduled meeting in early December.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.
We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.
Overall, we're on track to focus on delivering and providing value for our customers and our stockholders.
And operator, we're now ready to open it up for the Q&A portion of the call.
","We Energies posted impressive third-quarter results, driven by factors such as warmer weather, economic recovery, and operational efficiency. Their balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, enabling them to fund a substantial $17.7 billion ESG Progress Plan from 2022-2026. This plan aims to support 7% annual growth in their asset base, with a focus on sustainability, grid reliability, customer growth, and infrastructure modernization. Significantly, the company announced its intention to eliminate coal as an energy source by 2035, relying on their highly efficient Oak Creek coal-fired units as a key part of their fleet in the meantime. Despite higher natural gas prices, We Energies' earnings guidance for 2021 has been revised upward to a range of $4.05 to $4.07 per share, reflecting their strong performance and long-term investment strategy."
ZTS_q1_2021.txt,"I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP.
We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.
I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon.
We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall.
But that is not the situation everywhere.
In many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery.
Yet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this pandemic.
I'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis in our own small way to support the global effort.
We've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals.
And we're off to a very strong start in 2021, executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets outside the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics.
In the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales.
In total, our containment animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticides and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products.
Digging deeper on pet care, it has been one year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio.
It is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a 90% plus penetration rate in our largest U.S. corporate accounts.
Simparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides.
After several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart.
We believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy.
And our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world.
Meanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and Cytopoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth.
We are seeing excellent traction and significant growth across the range of international market.
Our dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for pruritus in dogs.
Veterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide.
In the containment animal space, we've also continued to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter.
We have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales, made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan images platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch.
We're also making progress on our Reference Labs integrations and look forward to future expansion in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Our growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter.
Cattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and generic competition projection was later than expected.
Meanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China.
Looking ahead, we are raising guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10.5% to 12%.
And while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN.
Glenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks.
Since the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands.
Since our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year.
Osteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats.
Meanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU.
And we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dog owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets.
In the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia, and we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year.
We will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans.
It is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH a one-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine, and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats.
We continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth.
We're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion.
In poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets.
And in parasiticides, we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets.
In terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to communities, animals and the planet.
We've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
We'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June.
In closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum.
Pet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U.S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally.
We feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach.
In 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue.
Last year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand.
In livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, and we expect modest growth for the year.
Livestock growth is tied closely to the pandemic and how quickly the foodservice industry recovers.
For Zoetis, we also anticipate increasing headwinds of generic competition to DRAXXIN, but we expect our life cycle innovations and competitive strategies to help us mitigate the impact.
While U.S. livestock may present challenges for us in the near term, I feel very positive about our catalysts for growth in pet care, diagnostics, and international markets like China and Brazil.
We continue to be led by our companion animal parasiticide and dermatology portfolio with more growth to come, and we see a bright future ahead for our monoclonal antibodies for pain.
Diagnostics is accelerating its growth as we increase our global footprint, expand our reference labs and demonstrates the potential for VetScan images to veterinary clinics.
And internationally, China continues to be a market with significant growth potential, not only in swine products, but with a sizable opportunity for increased medicalization of pets.
And we expect major growth to continue in Brazil across the companion animal and livestock portfolios.
As always, we remain confident that Zoetis' diverse portfolio across species and geographies, our continued pipeline of innovative new products and life cycle innovations, and the agility and commitment of our colleagues will continue driving our success in 2021 and beyond.
Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our first quarter results and updated guidance for the full year 2021.
As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas.
Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance, and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance.
In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 22% on a reported basis and 21% operationally.
Adjusted net income of $603 million with an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 34% operationally.
Operational revenue grew 21%, resulting entirely from volume increases with price flat for the quarter.
Volume growth of 21% includes 13% from other in line products, 5% from new products, and 3% from key dermatology products.
Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 34% operationally, with livestock growing 8% operationally in the quarter.
Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada, Australia and Mexico.
We also saw growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in small animal vaccines and diagnostics.
Following blockbuster sales in year one, Simparica Trio began 2021 with strong first quarter performance, posting revenue of $90 million, growing sequentially each quarter since launch.
The underlying dynamics that drove first quarter sales are very favorable for significant future growth, such as increasing clinic penetration and robust reordering rates within penetrated clinics.
I'd again like to mention how pleased we are with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio, which, in addition to the Simparica franchise, had significant growth in the Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart franchises as well.
U.S. market share within the flea, tick and heartworm segment is now at an all-time high of 31%, representing an increase of more than 9% for the first quarter versus the same period in the prior year.
Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $245 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally.
We remain confident that key dermatology sales will exceed $1 billion this year.
Our diagnostics portfolio grew 47% in Q1, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue.
2020 presented challenging conditions for our diagnostics business, as social distancing restrictions limited our ability to enter vet clinics and increase our market share.
However, our vast product portfolio, commitment to innovation, and ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio has us well positioned to grow faster than the overall diagnostics market.
Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses.
Improving market conditions from the COVID-19 recovery as well as successful promotional activities led to increased sales across the cattle portfolio.
In addition, later-than-expected timing of generic entrants led to strong first quarter sales for DRAXXIN.
Our swine portfolio grew 19% operationally as large producers continued rebuilding herds as they recover from African swine fever and created significant demand for our products.
Poultry sales declined in the first quarter as producers expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our premium products.
The decline in poultry partially tempered the growth in cattle, swine and fish.
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter.
U.S. revenue grew 19%, with companion animal products growing 32% and livestock sales declining by 4%.
For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain promising.
While severe weather caused a slight decline in vet clinic traffic for the quarter, revenue per visit was up more than 10%.
In addition, pet ownership has increased and is trending toward a younger demographic, and younger pet owners typically spend more on pet care.
This is a key driver for increased revenue per visit and creates robust demand for our diverse portfolio.
Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth, growing 74% in the quarter.
Diagnostics, key dermatology products and small animal vaccines also contributed to growth.
Simparica Trio continues to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $83 million.
The Simparica franchise generated sales of $112 million in the quarter and is now the number 2 brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm segment.
Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 62% in the quarter as the continued recovery at the vet clinic and a favorable prior year comparative period led to significant growth in point-of-care consumable revenue.
Key dermatology sales were $157 million for the quarter, growing 16% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint.
U.S. livestock declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by poultry as producers switching to lower-cost alternatives unfavorably impacted our business.
Swine also declined in the quarter, which is attributed almost entirely to a favorable nonrecurring government purchase, which occurred in Q1 2020.
Cattle grew 6% in the quarter as promotional programs and the timing of generic entrants drove growth across the product portfolio.
Growth in cattle partially offset the declines in poultry and swine.
To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a very favorable companion animal market environment, in which we offer the broadest and most innovative product portfolio.
Although livestock declined in the quarter with expectations of further declines for the year, we are encouraged by a series of foodservice trends such as increased dining out and school and business reopenings.
Revenue in our international segment grew 25% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 37% operationally and livestock revenue growing 17% operationally.
The strength in companion animal was fueled by the continuing trends of pet adoptions, increasing standard of care by pet owners, and our investments in advertising, all of which drove growth across our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios.
Companion animal diagnostics grew 18% in the quarter, led by a 24% increase in point-of-care consumable revenue and a second consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in instrument placement revenue.
We began early experience programs for Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs.
The feedback from the programs has been extremely positive, and further solidifies our view of the long-term potential of the product with an EU launch currently under way.
Our feline monoclonal antibody, Solensia, will begin early experience programs in Q2 with an EU launch to follow in the third quarter.
Solensia will provide cat owners an innovative therapy to address one of the largest unmet needs in animal health.
Our international livestock business saw double-digit growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which grew low single digits in the quarter.
Swine revenue grew 29% operationally led by growth in China of 128%, marking the third consecutive quarter with swine growth in excess of 100%.
While additional outbreaks and strains of African swine fever have occurred, we believe it is contained to a specific region and a limited number of customers.
Cattle grew 11% operationally in the quarter as a result of marketing campaigns, key account penetration, and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets.
Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 39% operationally driven by strong performance in Chile, the timing of seasonal vaccination protocols, and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group.
All major markets grew in the first quarter, many in double digits.
China total sales grew 75% operationally, which in addition to the significant growth in swine, delivered 59% operational growth in companion animal.
Brazil grew 48% operationally in the quarter as sales of Simparica, the leading oral parasiticide in the Brazilian market, drove a 73% operational increase in companion animal.
Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, again, demonstrating the value of substantial geographic and species diversification.
Our companion animal business benefited from favorable trends such as rising medicalization rates outside the U.S. And while swine was the largest growth driver for our international livestock business, the contributions were broad-based with growth across all species.
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.
Adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and other costs, including freight.
Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs and advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio.
This was partially offset by reductions to T&E costs as a result of COVID-19.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, an increase of 230 basis points driven by a reduction in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 34% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth.
We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter, repurchasing approximately $180 million worth of shares.
Along with our dividend, share repurchase is a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy.
We remain in a strong liquidity position and are highly cash generative.
And as a result, we expect to be able to execute on all investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development, while still returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising as a result of our first quarter performance.
Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April.
For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range, with projected revenue now between $7.5 billion and $7.625 billion and operational revenue growth between 10.5% and 12% for the full year versus the 9% to 11% in our February guidance.
Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14% compared to our prior guidance of 9% to 12%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.51, and reported diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.19.
Our key assumptions for 2021 have not changed materially since the guidance we provided on our Q4 2020 call.
However, our current view is that we will not face competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or our key dermatology products until the second half of 2022.
On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we anticipated growth to be heavily weighted toward the first half of the year, and I'd like to take this time to expand upon that further.
We are expecting first half 2021 growth to materially outpace growth in the second half of the year, primarily resulting from Simparica Trio sales and the favorable Q2 2020 comparative period related to COVID-19.
Subsequently, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of increased generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as challenging comparative periods when pent-up demand in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half.
Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth in the first quarter with significant gains in both companion animal and livestock and across nearly every therapeutic area and geography.
In addition, we raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance.
And while growth will moderate in the back half of the year for the reasons I outlined, we again expect to grow faster than the market and feel very positive about our position for sustained growth beyond this year.
","In Q1 2021, Zoetis reported a strong start with revenue growth of 21% operationally, driven by companion animal products, with pet care and diagnostics portfolios showing particular strength. Companion animal products grew 34%, led by parasiticides and dermatology products, while livestock growth was 8% due to strong performance in cattle, swine, and fish. Simparica Trio, a triple combination parasiticide, exceeded expectations with 90% penetration in large U.S. accounts and drove growth in the small animal parasiticide portfolio. The diagnostics portfolio grew 47%, with advancements in point-of-care diagnostics and the VetScan images platform gaining positive customer feedback. International revenue grew 25% operationally, with China and Brazil leading the growth. Zoetis also anticipates approvals for Librela and Solensia, monoclonal antibodies for pain management in dogs and cats, in the U.S. in 2022. Despite expectations of normalized revenue growth in the second half of 2021 due to tough comparative periods and increased generic competition for DRAXXIN, Zoetis raised guidance for the full year with revenue projected at $7.5 billion to $7.625 billion and adjusted net income expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14%."
PKG_q2_2021.txt,"I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll then wrap things up and then would be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $207 million or $2.17 per share.
Excluding special items, second quarter 2021 net income was also $207 million or $2.17 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share.
Second quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2020.
Total company EBITDA for the second quarter excluding special items was $397 million in 2021 and $299 million in 2020.
Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included special items expense and income rounding to a negligible impact while last year's second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our Paper segment.
Excluding special items, the $0.79 per share increase in second quarter 2021 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.01 and volume $0.74 in our Packaging segment, higher volume in our Paper segment of $0.03, and lower non-operating pension expense of $0.03.
These items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.57 primarily due to inflation related increases in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies, recycled fiber cost as well as other indirect and fixed cost areas.
We also had inflation related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.05 per share while annual outage expenses were up $0.19 per share compared to last year.
Freight and logistics expenses were higher by $0.19 per share driven by historically high load to truck ratios, driver shortages, increases in fuel costs, and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep pace with the box demand.
Lastly, depreciation expense was higher by $0.01 per share and Paper segment prices and mix were lower by $0.01 per share.
Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter of 2021 of $409 million with sales of $1.7 billion resulted in a margin of 24% versus last year's EBITDA of $313 million and sales of $1.4 billion or a 22% margin.
Our mills and plants continued to do an outstanding job of meeting our customer needs while managing through certain material and chemical availability issues, a tight labor market, various freight and logistics challenges as well as the planned maintenance outages at four of our mills during the second quarter.
The mills executed the planned outages extremely well and with the help of the No.
3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill provided our plants the necessary containerboard to achieve an all-time record for total box shipments.
Although we were able to build some much-needed inventory, due to very high demand, we ended the second quarter below our targeted levels and at a new low for weeks of inventory supply for this time of year and ahead of expected very busy third and fourth quarters.
In the second half of the year, we still anticipate a planned outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill later in the third quarter as well as a significant planned outage at our DeRidder mill in the fourth quarter.
Implementation of the previously announced price increases continues to be executed extremely well by our sales organization while our engineering and technology organization and the employees at all of our mills and corrugated products plants continues to successfully implement numerous initiatives and projects to reduce cost through efficiency, productivity, and optimization improvements.
With inflation driven cost increases across most all areas of our company coupled with truck, rail, and barge challenges for both incoming and outgoing products and materials at our facilities, these efforts are absolutely critical to our success.
In addition, being a primarily virgin fiber based producer of containerboard minimizes the impact of significant increases in recycled fiber costs over the last several quarters.
As Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets.
Our plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter.
Through the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%.
Driven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments, supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year.
We are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines.
Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Finally, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases.
The benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last few years have been extremely successful and put us in position to serve our customers better than ever before.
Our strategy of improving the technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our footprint through the construction of new facilities as well as closing certain plants to consolidate business with other locations is based upon our customer's needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them.
We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and savings, and cost reductions in several conversion areas throughout our plants.
Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $12 million with sales of $142 million or an 8% margin compared to second quarter 2020 EBITDA of $5 million and sales of $3 million or a 4% margin.
Although about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continued to implement our announced price increases.
Volume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama mill down for two months during the second quarter while this year, we ran the No.
1 machine at Jackson on paper and the No.
3 machine ran linerboard.
Now that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a three machine paper system.
We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and will run our paper system accordingly.
Cash provided by operations for the second quarter was $228 million with free cash flow of $97 million.
The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $131 million, common stock dividends of $95 million, cash taxes of $87 million, and net interest payments of $40 [Phonetic] million.
We ended the quarter with $972 million of cash on hand or $1.1 billion including marketable securities.
Our liquidity at June 30th was just under $1.5 billion.
As we move from the second to the third quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard and corrugated products with one additional day for box shipments.
Paper segment volume should be relatively flat primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the Jackson mill.
We will also continue to implement our previously announced price increases in both our Packaging and Paper segments.
Our annual outage costs will be lower with one outage in the third quarter versus four mill outages in the second quarter.
Inflation associated with most of the operating costs as well as freight and logistics expenses is expected to continue.
Energy costs will also be impacted due to higher seasonal usage and wood costs in our southern mills will be higher due to wet weather, low inventory, and high demand.
Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.37 per share.
The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.
","Packaging Corporation of America reported strong second-quarter results, with $207 million in net income and $2.17 per share, driven by increased prices, higher volume, and lower pension expenses. The Packaging segment recorded record box shipments, supported by effective price increases. Despite inflationary pressures and freight challenges, the company's efficiency initiatives and strong demand resulted in a 24% EBITDA margin. In the Paper segment, volume growth offset lower prices, and management remains cautiously optimistic about paper demand. Looking ahead, third-quarter earnings per share are projected at $2.37, reflecting continued demand in the Packaging segment and inflationary impacts on costs. The company has sufficient liquidity and plans to implement previously announced price increases to mitigate escalating costs."
HBI_q2_2020.txt,"We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the second quarter of 2020.
Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.
These risks include those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures by governmental or regulatory authorities to combat the pandemic on our business and operations as well as the business and operations of the consumer, our customers, suppliers, business partners and labor force.
These risks also include those detailed in our various filings with the SEC, which may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.
The use of the term PPE relates to our personal protection garment business, including face masks, face coverings and gowns.
Also, please note that unless otherwise stated, all prior year comparisons are to 2019 results that have been rebased to reflect the exited C9 Champion program at Target and the DKNY intimates license.
With me on the call today are Gerald Evans, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer.
This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic.
Despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses.
For the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow.
Our strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio, the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model.
In my view, there are four key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model.
And our ability to grow this business going forward.
First, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity.
Touching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our three main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international.
Point-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settled into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world.
In fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. Basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels.
In U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter.
Moving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June.
We experienced strong momentum in our Basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter.
Within our Intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened.
We experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment.
In the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continued to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel.
With store reopenings under way in our International business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia.
Strength in our Online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year.
We experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website.
Within our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter.
We are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trend in our Apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year.
Turning to the second highlight of the quarter.
Our newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue.
This was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses.
We recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail.
We expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year.
Looking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity.
The third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations.
Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year.
With the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating cost and working capital.
We continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year.
And finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities.
This focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend.
We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward.
Looking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly.
Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half.
Our core brands are healthy.
We are gaining market share.
Point-of-sale trends remain strong.
Our back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring 2021 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region.
We believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment.
So in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment.
Momentum is building in our Apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity.
We believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years.
I've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years.
To the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years.
Together, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories.
These are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together.
I look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead.
Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate.
Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion, which includes $752 million of PPE revenue.
As compared to last year, sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis.
Excluding PPE, Apparel revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year.
This is well ahead of our expectation and accounted for more than half of the upside in the quarter relative to our base case scenario.
Adjusted gross margin of 37.9% decreased approximately 180 basis points over the last year.
Approximately 50 basis points of the decline was the result of deleverage from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business.
The remainder of the decline was driven by COVID related door closings, which had a greater sales impact on our core international and our Champion and U.S. Activewear businesses.
As a reminder, these businesses carry higher gross margins, but they also carry higher SG&A expense.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased approximately 430 basis points over prior year to 17.5%.
Higher sales drove meaningful SG&A leverage, which was further benefited by our temporary cost savings initiatives.
Interest and other expense declined $8 million over prior year to approximately $47 million due primarily to lower average rates in the quarter.
Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $63 million in the quarter.
Our planned supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs, which remain unchanged, accounted for $11 million of these costs.
The remaining approximately $52 million are nonrecurring COVID related costs in the quarter, which are noncash.
These include a $20 million intangible asset write down, $11 million of bad debt expense and approximately $21 million of inventory adjustments primarily related to canceled orders from retailers for seasonal product we already made.
The tax rate of 17.8% was higher than our expectation as better-than-expected performance in U.S. Innerwear and PPE resulted in a higher mix of U.S. profit in the quarter.
And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 58% and 12% over prior year to $0.60 and $0.46, respectively.
Now let me take you through our segment performance.
From a high level, all of our segments experienced a similar progression through the quarter.
We saw significant year-over-year pressure in April, as regions sheltered in place.
This was followed by sequential improvement in May and June as consumers shifted to open channels, including online and closed stores began to reopen.
For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased approximately 67% over the prior year, while the operating margin expanded nearly 550 basis points to 27.8%.
Both revenue and operating profit exceeded our base case scenario, driven by better-than-expected sales in both our core Innerwear and new PPE businesses, our significant fixed cost leverage from higher sales and by lower SG&A expense due to our temporary cost reduction initiatives.
Adjusting for sales from our PPE business, core U.S. Innerwear performed significantly better than our base case scenario.
Core revenue declined approximately 27% over prior year, with Basics down 18% and Intimates down 52%.
These better than base case results were driven by the strong performance of our Basics and Intimates businesses, within the channels that remain open as well as the reopening of mid-tier and department store channels late in the quarter.
On the back of improved point-of-sale during the quarter, we have seen booking trends in both Basics and Intimates strengthen through July.
Turning to U.S. Activewear.
Revenue declined 52% over prior year, which was better than our base case scenario.
The year-over-year decline was due to COVID related door closures as well as school closings and fewer group events that significantly impacted our Sports Apparel and Printwear businesses.
As expected, Activewear's operating margin declined over prior year.
Deleveraged from lower sales, deleveraged from minimum royalty payments in our Sports License business.
And our decision to hold Champion marketing investment flat over prior year more than offset our temporary cost savings initiatives.
While Champion experienced headwinds due to COVID related channel closures, we were encouraged by the accelerating point-of-sale trends through the quarter and a continued POS strength in July.
We believe this underscores the consumers' ongoing desire for the brand and points to improving revenue trends going forward.
Switching to our International segment.
Revenue is well ahead of our base case scenario.
As compared to last year, revenue declined approximately 20% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis.
Adjusting for PPE sales, core International revenue declined 44% as compared to the prior year.
The better than base case performance in our core International business was driven by online as well as the performance of our company-owned stores as they reopened.
The International segment's operating margin of 17.3% increased 310 basis points over prior year, driven by lower SG&A costs as we benefited from various temporary cost savings initiatives.
Touching briefly on our Global Champion business.
Excluding C9, revenue declined 46% over prior year with declines in both our domestic and international businesses.
Like other parts of our business, Global Champion was hindered by closures of our company-owned stores and channel partner doors early in the quarter.
As doors reopened, Global Champion trends improved through the quarter with momentum continuing through July, reinforcing our expectation for sequential improvement in Champion sales through the balance of the year.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet.
We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter, generating $65 million of cash flow from operations.
Year-to-date, operating cash flow was approximately $40 million above last year.
The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, temporary cost savings initiatives, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network.
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $265 million or 12% compared to last year.
Leverage was 3.4 times on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, down from 3.5 times last year.
And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with significant cash capital cushion in this uncertain environment.
Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing third quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time.
However, I will like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of the key levers within our business model.
Looking at our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year in the second quarter.
Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we currently foresee an environment for the year-over-year decline in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in both this third and fourth quarter.
With respect to our PPE business, we currently expect more than a $150 million of PPE revenue in the second half, the vast majority of which is expected in the third quarter.
While we continue to tightly manage SG&A expenses, the amount of temporary cost savings from the second quarter are currently not expected to repeat in the second half.
Combined with a lower overall unit and sales volume, we believe it is reasonable to assume year-over-year pressure on margins in both this third and fourth quarters.
Now with respect to our tax rate, we currently expect a rate of approximately 17.5% for the second half.
And in terms of cash flow, we continue to expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year.
So in closing, we delivered strong second quarter results.
Our balance sheet is healthy, and we believe we have ample liquidity.
While there remains a significant amount of uncertainty, we are encouraged by the positive underlying momentum in our Apparel business, which we believe points to a return to pre-COVID levels in our business once the pandemic has passed.
","Hanesbrands reported a strong second quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, with revenue increasing 6% to $1.74 billion. Excluding PPE revenue, apparel sales declined approximately 40%, outperforming the company's expectations. The company's new PPE business, which generated over $750 million in revenue, led to a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $0.60. Other highlights include strong cash flow generation of $65 million, boosting year-to-date operating cash flow by $40 million compared to last year. The company ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, providing ample financial flexibility. Although Hanesbrands faces ongoing uncertainty due to COVID-19, the company is encouraged by positive underlying momentum in its core apparel business. It anticipates sequential improvement in apparel sales declines in Q3 and Q4, expects to generate over $150 million in PPE revenue in H2 2020, and remains confident in generating positive cash flow in the second half of the year."
WWW_q1_2021.txt,"On the call today are Blake Krueger, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brendan Hoffman, our President; and Mike Stornant, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
These disclosures were reconciled in attached tables within the body of the release.
I hope everyone on the call is safe and well.
E-commerce led the way, growing 84% during the quarter as our global digital strategy continued to deliver results.
Our two largest brands exceeded expectations with Merrell up nearly 25% year-over-year, and Saucony up nearly 60% in the quarter.
Both brands easily beat their 2019 Q1 revenue levels with Saucony up over 75% versus 2019.
The Company's international business was up 40% with every region growing over 35%.
Our DTC channels are outpacing the market and our wholesale order book is very healthy.
As we look to the rest of the year, demand for our brands is very strong and we've raised our full year guidance on the strength of this demand and robust outlook.
For today's call, I'll start by providing some additional insight on our Q1 performance and then Mike Stornant will detail our financial results, and update you on our financial outlook for the year.
Finally, Brendan Hoffman will share the latest on our strategic growth priorities, before I conclude.
In the first quarter, the Wolverine Michigan group revenue was up 20.1% on a reported basis and up 18.2% on a constant currency basis.
The Wolverine Boston group revenue was up 10.3% on a reported basis and up 8.2% on a constant currency basis.
Let me now focus on key brand performance starting with Saucony.
Saucony grew revenue nearly 60% and expanded operating margin nearly 800 basis points in Q1, a great start to what we anticipate will be a spectacular year for the brand.
All regions delivered strong growth, led by North America and EMEA [Phonetic].
Saucony.com revenue increased by over 150% driven by compelling digital storytelling and impactful product launches.
Product design and innovation remain at the core of Saucony's growth momentum, delivering both superior technical product in trend-right lifestyle collections to the global marketplace.
The brand's road running category nearly doubled in Q1 with the launch of new models for several of its biggest product franchises.
The new Guide 14 and Kinvara 12 drove significant growth with the Guide more than doubling year-over-year.
New colors and collection packs also drove excellent growth and freshness for the innovative Endorphin series.
Saucony also grew its trail running business with the launch of the Peregrine 11, which received the coveted Runner's World Editors' Choice Award.
New product launches that are fueling momentum in the brand's technical product category with existing runners and with the many new enthusiasts to the sport.
Saucony Originals, the brand's heritage lifestyle sneaker business also grew double-digits in Q1.
The brand continues to leverage its Italian product design and marketing hubs to build on its pinnacle positioning and success in Europe with elevated trend right product.
The new Jazz Court, a sneaker made with 100% natural materials and zero plastic launched at the end of Q1, driving substantial buzz in social media and immediately becoming the brand's top-selling product on Saucony.com.
Looking ahead, Saucony will continue its steady introduction of new product launches.
Both the new Ride 14 and Freedom 4 launched within the last few weeks and are off to a fast start.
Over the next several months, the brand will also roll out the next generation of all three models of the Endorphin collection, the Pro, the Speed and the Shift which has quickly become one of its largest franchises.
The brand will also introduce the new Triumph 19, a follow up to the award winning predecessor.
The momentum in the Saucony business continues to accelerate across both its performance and lifestyle offering.
Revenue grew nearly 25% in the quarter.
All regions delivered increases led by especially strong performance in EMEA.
North America grew double-digits, including DTC with Merrell.com up approximately 135% and Merrell stores comping up 30%.
Merrell kicked off its Future 40 campaign at the start of the quarter, celebrating the brand's 40th anniversary and amplifying its inclusive commitment to sharing the power of the outdoors with everyone.
The brand announced a significant partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America aiming to provide greater accessibility to the outdoors for nearly 200,000 youth.
Merrell continues to focus on cultivating its well-established product franchises, as well as delivering innovation across new product introductions.
In Q1, performance footwear grew by nearly 30% as the brand continued to advance its vision of faster and lighter footwear for the trail.
Building on the unmatched success of the world's number one hiker, the Moab, Merrell launched the all-new Moab speed and Moab flight collections, quickly exceeding sell through expectations, including selling out on Merrell.com and helping to drive very strong double-digit growth for the Moab franchise overall.
The Antora 2 and Nova 2 trail runners also continued to perform exceptionally well in the quarter.
Merrell has a steady stream of new performance offerings scheduled for the remainder of the year.
Merrell's lifestyle business grew approximately 20% in the quarter driven by the growth of the classic Jungle Moc and newer hydro Moc which more than tripled year-over-year.
The brand plans to continue to leverage the easy on-off trend throughout 2021 with new products in the Hydro Moc, Hut Moc and Jungle Moc franchises.
Merrell is well positioned with both its outdoor performance and lifestyle businesses, and we expect the brand's growth will continue to accelerate going forward.
Our work business, which represented almost 20% of our revenue in Q1 also delivered significant growth led by Wolverine, up nearly 30% and Cat footwear up over 30% with strong contributions from a couple of our smaller brands.
We are the market share leader in the U.S. work boot category which is currently trending with consumers and it's been an important consistent performer for the Company over time.
We expect growth in this category to accelerate in Q2.
Turning now to Sperry.
Revenue was down approximately 10% in Q1, a continued sequential improvement compared to prior quarters.
Despite more than $10 million of expected revenue which slid into Q2.
During the quarter, Sperry.com was up 40% and Sperry stores grew more than 20%.
The brand's full price business remains very healthy with gross margin expanding nearly 500 basis points in Q1.
Looking ahead, Sperry is back on the growth path for the remainder of the year.
Sperry possesses unique elasticity across genders, product categories and price points.
Its new float collection, a fun and affordable injected version of the boat shoe for younger consumers launched at the end of the quarter and quickly became Sperry.com's best selling product introduction in several years.
The brand expects to build on the success of the float throughout the year with seasonal drops, including the cozy float collection this fall.
Sperry also plans to capitalize on the easy on-off trend with the launch of the new Moc Sider collection later this summer and to drive energy through several product capsules, leveraging fashion, entertainment and pop culture icon, including collaborations with John Legend, Rebecca Minkoff, and the Netflix hit series, Outer Banks, Good Humor Popsicles Ice-cream and Rowing Blazers.
Before Brendan and I share some additional insight regarding our strategic growth priorities, I'm going to hand it off to Mike to review the first quarter financial results in more detail.
Let me start by providing additional detail on the Company's first quarter performance, and then some insight on our improved outlook for 2021.
First quarter revenue of approximately $511 million represents growth of 16% compared to last year.
As Blake pointed out, most elements of our global growth agenda delivered excellent year-over-year growth on the strength of expanding digital platforms and innovative product offerings.
This strong growth performance was achieved despite a meaningful shift of customer shipments into the second quarter.
Adjusted gross margin improved 290 basis points versus the prior year to 44.3%, due to our continued e-commerce expansion and favorable wholesale product mix.
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of $174.4 million in the quarter were about $23 million more than last year, primarily due to the higher mix of DTC revenue, $8 million of additional investment in digital e-commerce marketing and more normalized incentive compensation costs.
Q1 adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, an improvement of 330 basis points over last year, as a result of healthy operating leverage.
Net interest expense was up $1.9 million and the effective tax rate was 16%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.40 compared to $0.28 in the prior year.
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.45 versus $0.16 last year, and reflect a partial settlement of certain insurance claims related to our ongoing legacy litigation, offset by a legal defense costs and specific COVID related costs.
Let me now shift to the balance sheet.
At the end of the quarter, inventory was down approximately 21% year-over-year.
Our global sourcing team continues to adjust to the supply chain headwinds, impacting our industry.
Our inventory position has improved nicely in the second quarter allowing us to fill nearly all of the orders that slipped from Q1 into Q2.
In Q1, we generated $26.3 million of cash flow from operating activities.
The Company finished the quarter with $506 million less debt compared to the prior year and total liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion, including $365 million of cash on hand and nearly $800 million of revolver capacity.
Our bank defined leverage ratio continued to improve, ending the quarter at a low 1.5 times.
I will now provide details on our improved outlook for 2021.
As we have shared, the trends in our business remained very encouraging, with revenue assumptions improving since we offered our annual guidance in February.
Our wholesale order book remains strong.
Our D2C business is performing well.
International regions have returned to strong growth and our inventory position continues to improve.
All of this provides us with a heightened level of confidence as we manage the business and invest in future growth.
As a result the Company now expects fiscal 2021 revenue in the range of $2.24 billion to $2.30 billion.
Growth of 25% to 28% compared to the prior year.
At the high end of the range, this is a raise of $50 million from our original outlook and nicely exceeds 2019 revenue.
We now expect reported diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.70 to $1.85 and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.95 to $2.10.
In the face of unpredictable near term supply chain delays, the Company will continue to invest in air freight to ensure our ability to service the very strong demand we are seeing in the business.
These COVID-19 related air freight costs above normal levels are included in our updated guidance and will be adjusted from our reported results for the remainder of the year.
The Company is in an enviable position to invest in meaningful growth for 2021 and to continue to drive momentum in our brands.
With that, I'm going to hand it over to Brendan to share additional insight on our strategic growth drivers.
As we emerge from the pandemic, the power and relevance of our brands is evident as we execute our global growth agenda across the portfolio.
With roughly two-thirds of our business in running, outdoor and work, our brands are well positioned in the lifestyle and performance-oriented product categories favored by consumers and macro trends.
In addition to the unique positioning of our brand portfolio, our global growth agenda is driving strong momentum through three key pillars.
First, the brand's new product and marketing stories are resonating well with consumers including Sperry's Float, Merrell's Moab Speed and Moab Flight and Saucony's Guide 14, new Endorphin collections and several other new launches.
Our brands are focused on developing big, innovative and impactful product collections based on consumer insights, trend intel [Phonetic] and testing.
And recent investments in our advanced concepts and innovation Center of Excellence are proving invaluable.
Second, our ongoing investments in digital capabilities continues to fuel e-commerce growth, which is exceeding our expectations at this early stage in the year as we track toward our bold revenue goal of $500 million through our brands.com in 2021.
In Q1, we leveraged increased digital marketing investments to drive more traffic, richer digital content and storytelling to engage consumers, better merchandising to optimize conversion and additional testing and learning to improve site user experiences.
These assets and investments are also helping drive the online business of our global distribution partners and wholesale customers.
In the coming months, we anticipate integrating and launching several new innovations and technologies including a Merrell mobile app.
We are excited about the substantial runway that remains for our digital business.
Finally, our international business has recovered quickly from last year's shutdown with every region delivering very strong Q1 growth.
As Blake mentioned, our Saucony Italy business and its product design and marketing hub are helping drive upper tier distribution for our fastest growing brands.
Overall, EMEA continues to outperform and the investments in our Merrell and Saucony JV targeting a significant opportunity for our two biggest brands are beginning to pay dividends.
Our brands are well aligned with today's marketplace and consumer trends and our global growth agenda is fueling our biggest and most profitable growth opportunities.
I could not be more excited about 2021 and the future beyond.
Our strong start to the year is reflective of our intense focus on the consumer and our continued investments in talent, product design and innovation, digital and consumer research and insights.
The Company drove meaningful growth in Q1, despite the impact from short-term industry logistic headwinds and we are increasingly optimistic about the year ahead.
Vaccination rollouts appeared to be tracking well, consumer confidence continues to improve and our demand outlook remains very strong.
Our DTC business is performing well and our wholesale order book continues to provide good visibility to accelerated growth for the year ahead.
We are clear on our strategic priorities and enthused about the opportunities in front of us.
The Company's strong position is a testament to our team's tremendous vigilance, focus and hard work over the last 15 months.
Throughout this period, we focused on managing our brands for the post COVID world and continued to invest.
","Wolverine Worldwide experienced a robust Q1, with revenue increasing 20.1% on a reported basis and 18.2% on a constant currency basis. Saucony led the charge with an impressive 60% revenue growth and nearly 800 basis point operating margin expansion. Merrell followed closely with a 25% revenue increase, driven by strong performance in EMEA and North America. The work business also contributed significantly, with Wolverine and Cat footwear growth exceeding 30%. Sperry revenue declined slightly, but showed sequential improvement and a strong full-price business. The company raised its full-year guidance based on strong demand and a healthy order book, projecting revenue growth of 25-28% to $2.24-$2.30 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to range from $1.95 to $2.10."
WAT_q4_2020.txt,"It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifices.
From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost-saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination, and an indomitable spirit.
I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other.
During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our 4th quarter and full-year operating results as well as an update on the, on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021.
Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full-year financial outlook.
Briefly reviewing our operating results for the 4th quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis and adjusted, adjusted earnings per share grew 14%.
For the full year, revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%.
The strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong -- strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives.
Looking more closely at our top line results, first from a customer perspective.
Our largest market category pharma was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 15% growth.
Our industrial market grew 5% while academia and government declined 15%.
On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 12% with China, up 19%.
Meanwhile, sales in the Americas grew 3% for the US growing 4% and European sales grew at 6%.
From a product perspective, our Waters branded products and services grew approximately 8% while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis.
While still navigating the global pandemic, we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues, and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand.
Services grew 10% while consumables business grew approximately 14% driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched PREMIER Columns, which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market.
LC Instruments grew most -- grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth.
This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal pharma year end budget flush, and early contributions from our LC replacement initiatives.
Following last June's release of the Arc HPLC System in the core HPLC market with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA-QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio.
On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY PREMIER, a next generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity, and overall capability.
This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research.
This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the 4th quarter.
The combined solution will alleviate non-specific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation, and an increased confidence in analytical results.
After a very strong 3rd quarter, mass spec sales were about flat in Q4.
As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy, which we saw with biomedical research.
There was also a general softness in clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing.
Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double-digits, driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and the QDA.
Finally, to TA, revenues declined low single digits, which was -- which was much improved from earlier in the year.
We saw the core thermal business start to pick up driven by market improvement in Asia.
In particular, life sciences including pharma and medical devices grew double-digits.
Combined these, comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues.
However, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers.
Looking now, at our geographies, all major regions grew.
The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double-digits.
In the US, the growth was driven by pharma, which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental, academic, and government.
Though Latin America continued to decline, it improved meaningfully relative to earlier in the year.
Europe also experienced strong pharma performance, partially offset by material science, food, and academic and government.
In both US and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based including strength in big pharma, large molecule customers, genetics, and contract labs.
China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth driven by continuing acceleration in pharma as well as strong environmental growth.
The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers including particularly strong growth at contract labs.
India also continued to grow double-digits.
In summary, overall in the 4th quarter, we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year end spending trends.
Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the US, Europe, and India all seeing positive growth.
Industrial declined 3% for the full year and academic and government declined 16%.
Notably, our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8% owed in part to strength in small molecules, the industry recovered from lock-downs.
Industrial also grew in the second half at 4% while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22% respectively.
Geographically for the year, Asia sales were down 4% with China -- China sales down 8%.
Sales in Americas were down 4%; for the US, down 2%.
Europe sales were up 2%.
Notably, all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year with the US up 4% and Europe up 6% following first half declines of 9% and 3% respectively.
China market grew in the second half, up 11%, reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year.
Now, I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program, as several of the initiatives we're putting interaction are starting to contribute to growth.
First, I would talk about our instrument replacement initiative, then our progress in contract lab expansion followed by e-commerce and lastly, I'll give you a BioAccord update.
First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative under way, we delivered our first quarterly LC Instrument revenue growth in two years and our LC Instrument win-loss was the highest it has been in three years.
Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the Arc HPLC as well.
Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiatives, we have made important progress in targeting this high growth customer group.
We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings, which have -- which have been well received by the segment.
It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we're making.
Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com traffic is up double digits, driven by search engine optimization and paid search.
While there isn't a one-to-one relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel.
In tandem with our e-commerce actions, we've also enhanced our e-procurement platform on which we have expanded our coverage of customers leveraging this channel.
This supported strong e-procurement growth indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters.
Fourth, driving launch excellence.
BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our market development efforts and our specialty sales model have started to take effect, particularly in the US and Europe.
Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders.
Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be, we will be seeing more follow-on orders.
More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis.
In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team, we are encouraged to see Waters consumable specked in on QA-QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics.
We're also seeing an uptick in COVID driven demand for our instruments and consumables.
This peaked in the 4th quarter were COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth, driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics who saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID-related programs.
In summary, as a wrap up to 2020, we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running.
Our teams have focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engaged in COVID-related efforts.
Meanwhile, our base business is showing signs of recovery, and our transformation is well under way.
Turning to 2021, while the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the 4th quarter momentum.
Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021, which is based on three key factors.
One, we're assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market.
Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China.
Lastly, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp up, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to increasingly contribute to performance.
In the 4th quarter, we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency.
Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3% resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported.
For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported.
Looking at product line growth, our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue increased by 11% in the quarter while instrument sales increased 4%.
For the full year, reoccurring revenue grew 3% while instrument sales declined 9%.
Chemistry revenue were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth.
On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10%, as customers continue to reopen labs, catch up on performance maintenance in professional services, and repair visits.
As we noted last quarter, recurring sales were impacted by two additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales.
Looking ahead, there are five additional calendar days in the first quarter and six fewer calendar days in the 4th quarter of 2021 compared to 2020.
Breaking 4th quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters' branded products and services grew 8% while sales of TA-branded products and services declined 1%.
Combined LC and LCMs instrument sales were up 5% while TA system sales declined 4%.
Now, I'd like to comment on our 4th quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, an increase compared to the 58.2% in the 4th quarter of 2019, primarily due to the higher sales volume in FX.
On non -- on a full year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020.
Moving down the 4th quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis.
The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance.
For the year, operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after.
In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8% respectively, an increase from last year at the comparable period included some favorable discrete items.
Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about 3 million, as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came in at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the 4th quarter of last year.
This is a result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020 subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the 4th quarter increased 40% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49 compared to $3.12 last year.
For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 last year.
On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019.
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment in our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our 4th quarter results and activities.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items.
In the 4th quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures.
Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.
In the 4th quarter, this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
For the full year in 2020, free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures.
This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operations and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 US tax reform.
Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost actions -- cost saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle.
In the 4th quarter, accounts receivables days sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down seven days compared to the 4th quarter of last year.
Inventories decreased by 16 million in comparison to the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth in revised production schedules.
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well structured debt maturity profile.
We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $443 million and debt of 1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter.
This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.1 times at the end of the 4th quarter.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent and better growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return of capital to shareholders.
We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities.
As such, our Board of Directors has approved a two-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month.
As of today, we have 1.5 billion remains available credit program for share repurchases.
As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021.
The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market.
We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China.
Our outlook does not anticipate a return to lock down seen in 2020.
We had a 1% tailwind from COVID-related revenue in 2000, three-quarters of which was in the second half of the year.
We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021, including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1.
We anticipate the first-half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year.
Improved execution on our near-term growth initiatives contributed to our 4th quarter growth, but the quarter also benefited from capital spending that were delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021.
The second half of 2021, we'll have to content with a challenging comp resulting from the revenue shift that took place in 2020.
These dynamics support full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%.
At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57, 5% to 58.9%.
Every year, we look to balance growth, investment, and profitability.
Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID-related cost actions, and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line, other key assumptions for full-year guidance are net interest expense of 35 million to 38 million, a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new five-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026, a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 to 61.5 million shares outstanding.
Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate.
Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%.
At today's rate, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60.
At current rates, the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings-per-share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points.
In summary, we're pleased with our resilience in the second half of 2020 and the strong finish to the year, which is a true testament to the determination of this team.
Though the environment remains variable, pharma markets have shown resilience and our transformation program is already demonstrating results and contributing to growth.
Despite the challenging environment, the progress we've made as an organization over the last five months is nothing short of extraordinary.
I remain ever more confident in the team, our portfolio, and our market position.
There remains a lot of work to do, but we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us to turn the business around.
","Waters Corporation reported strong results for Q4 2020, with revenue growth of 10%, driven primarily by the pharmaceutical market. Growth was widespread across geographies, with Asia posting double-digit gains and strong performances in Europe and the Americas. While mass spec sales remained relatively flat, LC Instruments grew in most major markets, signaling stabilization in LC instrument demand. The company's near-term growth initiatives, including the instrument replacement program and expansion of contract lab relationships, are gaining traction and contributing to revenue growth. Looking ahead to 2021, Waters anticipates a gradual improvement in customer activity, led by the pharmaceutical market, and strong growth in China. The company expects full-year constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.32 to $9.57. Waters is well-positioned for growth based on its resilient team, strong product portfolio, and ongoing transformation program."
GTY_q4_2020.txt,"We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.
With Josh and me on the phone today are Mark Olear, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Dickman, our new Chief Financial Officer.
I've known Brian for many years and we are all enjoying working with him and looking forward to his contributions at Getty for years to come.
I'll begin today's call by providing an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance, update everyone on our business in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, touch on our 2021 strategic objectives and then we'll pass the call to Mark and Brian to discuss our portfolio and financial results in more detail.
We closed out 2020 with a highly productive quarter, which saw each aspect of our business pose significant accomplishments.
During the year, we maintained high monthly rent collections and stable occupancy in our portfolio, acquired 34 properties and completed six redevelopment projects.
The net result was the continued growth of both our revenues from rental properties, which increased by 3.5% for the quarter and 5% for the year.
And our adjusted funds from operations per share, which grew by 12% for the quarter and 7% for the year.
In a normal year, we'd be proud to report on this growth.
When you consider the countless challenges brought upon us by COVID-19, I can say with great satisfaction that these results were only possible due to the extraordinary efforts put forth by the entire Getty team this year.
I believe these results reflect the value of our portfolio and combined with our strong and flexible balance sheet and growing pipeline of investment prospects position the Company well for success as we work toward 2021 and beyond.
I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the stability of our triple-net lease rents and growth platform.
Our portfolio of convenience stores, gas stations and other automotive assets produced another strong quarter of rent collections, operating performance and growth at Getty.
We saw the rent collection rate increase to 98.7% and we collected substantially all of the deferred rent and mortgage payments that were due to us in the fourth quarter.
We entered 2021 with a small balance of COVID-related deferrals, which we expect to collect throughout this year.
In addition, Getty completed several leasing and disposition transactions in the quarter, which we -- which will serve to stabilize the small number of assets where we were experiencing difficulties with rent collections.
Looking ahead, although uncertainty remains regarding the forward impact of COVID-19 to the broader economy, we are encouraged by the strength exhibited by our tenants and assets since the beginning of the pandemic.
We will continue to be vigilant in monitoring the health of our tenants as we believe the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US economy will continue to impact the consumer and retail activity through at least the first half of 2021, and therefore, could negatively affect Getty's rent collections and financial results.
The execution of the Company's acquisition strategy was an important driver of Q4 and full year 2020 performance.
For the quarter, Getty acquired 10 properties for $45.1 million and for the year, we acquired 34 properties for $150 million, which represents significant growth over the Company's acquisition activity in the prior year.
These high-quality assets are located in numerous markets across the country and include portfolios of both convenience stores which offer consumers food, traditional merchandise and fuel as well as car washes.
We also continued the momentum of our redevelopment program as we completed our third project with AutoZone, bringing our total of completed projects for the year to six.
We are closing in on completing 20 projects since the inception of our redevelopment strategy further demonstrating the value of the real estate we hold in our portfolio.
Our balance sheet also ended 2020 in excellent condition as we successfully issued a $175 million, 3.4% debt private placement in December and we issued approximately $65 million of equity under our ATM program during the year.
Our leverage continues to be less than 5 times and with a revolver that is almost completely undrawn, Getty has significant capacity to fund its growth plans.
As we enter 2021, we feel encouraged about our portfolio of nearly 1,000 properties.
The convenience store industry and other automotive businesses are essential and largely internet resistant.
Our rents 65% of which come from the top 50 MSAs in the US continue to be well covered.
In fact, despite COVID-related challenges, our rent coverage ratio remained stable throughout the year and ended 2020 at a healthy 2.6 times.
Our portfolio is built around serving the needs of the car driving individual and it's continuing to do so whether it's stopping for convenience store items, fuel, getting snacks, meals, or getting your car washed or reserviced.
These are needs that continue to be in high demand today and which we believe will be stable for the mobile consumer for years to come.
Our team is more focused than ever on executing our growth initiatives, including maximizing the quality of our input portfolio through continued active asset management, enhancing our portfolio through accretive acquisition in stores and other automotive assets which serve the mobile consumer and unlocking embedded value through our selective redevelopments.
We are confident in our targeted investment strategy, which focuses on acquiring high-quality real estate in Metropolitan markets across the country and in our ability to continue to successfully execute on these strategic objectives.
Our approach and focus on driving growth should result in driving additional shareholder value as we move through the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
During 2020, Getty's underwriting of potential transactions grew as we added resources to focus on convenience store and other automotive opportunities.
For the year, we reviewed approximately $2.1 billion of opportunities, which met our initial screen process.
Convenience store opportunities represented 62% and other automotive represented 38% of the total.
As Chris mentioned, we remain highly committed to growing our portfolio in terms of both the convenience store industry, which offers consumers food, traditional merchandise and fuel, and with other automotive-related assets that are tied to mobile consumer spending.
Going forward, we anticipate growing both areas of our underwriting platform as we view the businesses as highly complementary and the underwriting characteristics to be very similar.
To review a few highlights of our investment activities, for the fourth quarter, we invested $45.1 million in 10 highly -- high quality convenience store and car wash assets.
In October, we completed a sale-leaseback with CEFCO Convenience Stores, one of the leading independent convenience store operators in the Southern United States.
In this transaction, Getty acquired six properties for $28.7 million, all of located throughout the state of Texas.
These properties are subject to unitary triple-net lease with a 15-year base term and multiple renewal options.
They have an average lot size of 2.7 acres and an average store size in excess of 5,300 square feet, which reflect that the assets we acquired have all the attributes of today's modern full service convenience store.
Our initial cash yield is in line with our historical acquisition cap rate range.
In addition, we acquired four car wash assets in individual transactions with Go Car Wash and Zips Car Wash for $16.4 million in the aggregate.
For the year, we acquired 34 properties for $150 million.
Our weighted average initial return on acquisitions for the year was 7%.
Finally, the weighted average initial lease term of the properties acquired for the year was 14.6 years.
Overall, our acquisition team remains busy sourcing and underwriting potential investments and we continue to feel strongly that the volume of opportunities we are underwriting will produce additional growth as we progress through this year.
We expect that our future acquisition activity will remain focused on the convenience store and other automotive sectors and that we will pursue direct sale-leasebacks, acquisitions of net leased properties and funding for new to industry construction.
Finally, we remain committed to our core underwriting principles of acquiring high quality real estate and partnering with strong tenants in our target asset classes.
Moving to our redevelopment platform.
For the year, we invested approximately $2.9 million in both our completed projects and sites which are in progress.
In the fourth quarter, we returned one redevelopment project back to the net lease portfolio bringing our total for completed rent commencement projects to six in 2020 and 19 since the inception of our program.
Specifically, in October, rent commenced on project with AutoZone in New Jersey.
In this project, we invested $0.2 million and we expect to generate a return on our investment of more than 45%.
In terms of redevelopment projects, we ended the quarter with 10 signed leases or letters of intent, which includes six active projects and four signed leases on properties, which are currently subject to triple-net leases, but which have not yet been recaptured from the current tenants.
We expect to have rent commencements at several sites during 2021 with remainder completing within three years.
On the capital spending side, we have invested approximately $1.8 million in the 10 redevelopment projects in our pipeline and estimate that these projects will require total investment by Getty of $5.8 million.
We project these redevelopments will generate incremental returns to the company in excess of where we could invest these funds in the acquisition market today.
We remain committed to optimizing our portfolio and continue to anticipate redevelopment opportunities over the next five years, possibly involving between 5% and 10% of our current portfolio with targeted unlevered redevelopment program yields of greater than 10%.
We sold 11 properties during 2020 realizing proceeds of approximately $6 million.
These properties are sold -- sold were vacant or returned to us by tenants for the terms of their lease agreements.
We expect the net financial impact of these dispositions will be minimal.
In addition, during the year, we exited 10 properties, which we previously leased from third-party landlords.
As we look ahead, we will continue to selectively dispose of properties where we have made the determination that the property is no longer competitive as a convenience store location or does not have redevelopment potential.
The net result is our portfolio is now 35 states plus Washington DC and 65% of our annualized base rent comes from the top 50 national MSAs.
We ended the year with 946 net lease properties, six active redevelopment sites and seven vacant properties.
Our weighted average lease term is approximately 9.5 years, and our overall occupancy, excluding active redevelopments, increased to 99.3%.
I'm excited to be here with Chris, Mark, Josh and the rest of the Getty team and I look forward to interacting with all of you going forward.
I'll start with a recap of earnings.
Hopefully, everyone's had a chance to see yesterday's release.
AFFO, which we believe best reflects the Company's core operating performance, was $0.48 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.84 per share for the full year, representing year-over-year increases of 12% and 7% respectively.
FFO was $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.32 per share for the full year.
Both periods were impacted by non-recurring legal settlement in the company's favor.
Our total revenues were $37.1 million in the fourth quarter and $147.3 million for the full year, representing year-over-year increases of 3.3% and 4.7% respectively.
Rental income, which excludes tenant reimbursements and interest on notes and mortgages receivables grew 3.9% to $31.8 million in the fourth quarter and 7.1% for the full year to $128.2 million.
Acquisition activity, rent escalators in our leases, and the completion of redevelopment projects, all contributed to the growth in our rental income.
On the expense side, we benefited from a reduction in property costs in both the fourth quarter and full year, primarily due to decreases in third-party rent expense and professional fees related to property redevelopments.
Environmental expenses increased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, although the amounts were credits in both periods, a decrease for the full year versus 2019.
Environmental expenses are subject to a number of estimates and non-cash adjustments and continue to be highly variable.
G&A expenses increased in both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation and certain legal and other professional fees.
As previously mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we had a non-recurring benefit of $20.5 million as a result of the settlement of a litigation matter.
Turning to the balance sheet and our capital markets activities.
During the fourth quarter, we issued $175 million of new 10-year unsecured notes at 3.43% via direct private placements at three life insurance companies.
We used the proceeds to retire the full $100 million outstanding under our 6% Series A notes, which were coming due in early 2021 and to repay borrowings under our credit facility.
As a result of this transaction, we incurred a $1.2 million debt extinguishment charge which is included in GAAP net earnings and FFO.
We are also active with our at-the-market equity program during the quarter, raising $25.1 million at an average price of $28.45 per share.
For the full year, we raised $64.4 million through the ATM at an average price of $29.16 per share, which helped to fund our growth and maintain our low leverage profile.
As of December 31, we had total debt outstanding of $550 million, including $25 million outstanding under our credit facility and $525 million of long-term fixed rate unsecured notes.
Our weighted average borrowing cost was 4.1% and the weighted average maturity of our debt is 7.3 years.
In addition, our total debt to total market capitalization was 32%, our total debt to total asset value was 40% and our net debt to EBITDA is 4.9 times.
With no debt maturities until June of 2023, other than our credit facility, which matures in March of next year that has a one-year extension option in our election.
As we look ahead and think about our capital needs, we remain committed to maintaining a conservative, well-laddered and flexible capital structure.
With respect to our environmental liability, we ended the quarter and year at $48.1 million, which was down $2.6 million from the end of 2019.
For the fourth quarter and full year, net environmental remediation spending was approximately $1.6 million and $6.4 million respectively.
And finally, we are introducing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance at a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share.
Our guidance includes transaction activity today but does not otherwise assume any potential acquisitions or capital markets activities for the remainder of 2021.
Specific factors, which impact our guidance this year include the full year impact of our 2020 investment and capital raising activities, our expectations that operating cost will generally continue to increase, our expectation that we will forego rent when we recapture properties for redevelopment and our expectation that we will remain active in pursuing acquisitions and redevelopment, which could result in additional expenses for deals ultimately not completed.
","Getty Realty Trust reported strong financial results for Q4 2020, driven by growth in rental income and acquisitions. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share rose 12% year-over-year to $0.48, while total revenues increased 3.3% to $37.1 million. The company acquired 34 properties for $150 million in 2020, including 10 in Q4 that generated a weighted average initial return of 7%. Getty also completed six redevelopment projects in 2020, with one commencing rent in Q4 and delivering an expected return of 45%. The portfolio consists of 946 net lease properties, with 65% of annualized base rent coming from the top 50 MSAs. The company maintained a high occupancy rate of 99.3% and a low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9x. Getty anticipates continued growth in 2021 and has established AFFO per share guidance at $1.86 to $1.88."
PPL_q2_2021.txt,"Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 in a brief cautionary statement.
We appreciate you joining us for our second-quarter investor update.
Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call.
Joe will then provide a detailed review of second-quarter financial results and walk through some recent actions we've taken to strengthen PPL's balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 4.
The second quarter has been a busy one as we continue to advance the strategic repositioning of the company.
First, we completed the sale of our U.K. utility, achieving exceptional value for the business and once again demonstrating our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities to maximize shareowner value.
The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of $10.4 billion, which will support the repositioning of PPL as a high-growth U.S.-regulated utility company.
As a reminder, we've earmarked $3.8 billion of those proceeds to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid.
We also deployed some of the proceeds to achieve our previously stated objective of strengthening our balance sheet, utilizing $3.9 billion to retire $3.5 billion of outstanding holding company debt which will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility.
Regarding the remaining proceeds, we continue to review various options as previously discussed, including investing incremental capital at our utilities or in renewable energy, as well as the repurchase of PPL shares.
On the topic of share repurchases, our board recently authorized the company to repurchase up to $3 billion in PPL common stock.
We currently expect to repurchase about $500 million by year-end, while we continue to assess other opportunities to deploy proceeds to maximize shareowner value.
The actual amount we apply to share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the determination of other uses for the proceeds.
We believe our current plan provides a balance of an efficient use of proceeds while still maintaining financial flexibility.
I'll note that we are in the process of reevaluating our capital plans for incremental investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers.
We'll provide further updates to our capital and rate base plans after we complete this review.
The U.K. sale represented an important first step in our strategic repositioning.
rate-regulated utilities and strengthening our balance sheet while providing much greater flexibility to support future growth.
We're also making great progress in the acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island.
To date, we've satisfied our HSR and FCC requirements.
And on July 16, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities granted a waiver of jurisdiction over the sale, streamlining the overall path to regulatory approval for the acquisition.
We continue to make progress on securing approvals from FERC and the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers, which are the two remaining approvals required for the transaction.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to close the transaction by March of next year with hopes of closing before year-end.
As we pursue the final regulatory approvals, we are working closely with National Grid on transition planning to ensure a seamless transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing.
We've also announced our planned leadership team for the Rhode Island Utility, Dave Bonenberger, who has nearly four decades of energy industry experience, including leading both the transmission and distribution businesses at PPL Electric Utilities will serve as the Rhode Island President upon completion of the transaction.
Dave is well-positioned to lead the execution of our operational strategy in Rhode Island as we seek to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers and to support the state's decarbonization goals.
Dave will be joined in Rhode Island by former National Grid employees in creating a strong, experienced, and local leadership team with a deep commitment to delivering energy safely and reliably to Rhode Island customers.
Moving to Slide 5.
This goal encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from our Kentucky generation, as well as other aspects of our business as outlined in the footnote on the slide.
PPL is fully committed to driving innovation to enable net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
And to ensure a balanced, responsible, and just transition for our employees, communities, and customers as we advance toward our clean energy goals.
Our new goal reflects our continuous evaluation of our progress and opportunities through ongoing business and resource planning efforts.
Based on our latest reviews, we believe we are on a path to achieve 80% emissions reduction by 2040, a full decade ahead of our prior goal.
As a result, in addition to today's announced net-zero emissions goal, we've also accelerated our previous interim goals, now targeting an 80% reduction by 2040 and a 70% reduction by 2035.
In addition, we are undertaking an enterprisewide effort to enhance our clean energy strategy and develop additional programs, metrics, and goals that will guide our path to net-zero emissions.
We've hired an industry-leading global consulting firm to assist us in this endeavor.
In addition to the strategic initiative, we are completing an updated scenario-based climate assessment to evaluate the potential impacts to PPL from climate change and potential future requirements.
Our last climate assessment report was published in 2017.
Our updated assessment, which we intend to publish later this year, will analyze multiple scenarios, including a scenario tied to limiting the global temperature increase to no more than one and a half degrees Celsius.
As we conduct our climate assessment, our efforts will be informed by our ongoing integrated resource planning activities in Kentucky.
LG&E and KU submit an IRP once every three years to the Kentucky Public Service Commission.
And the next IRP will be filed in October of this year.
Both the Climate Assessment and the IRP will serve as key inputs as we further define the pathway to achieving our emissions goals.
Wrapping up this slide, we recognize that achieving these emissions reductions while maintaining reliability and affordability will require significant advances in clean energy technology and solutions, that can be scaled economically to meet the country's energy needs.
This is especially true as we support greater electrification of other sectors.
With that in mind, investing in research and development is a key pillar of our clean energy strategy.
And we continue to look for opportunities to engage in this area to drive the innovation and solutions necessary to achieve net-zero.
PPL, for example, is an anchor sponsor of the low carbon resources initiative, being led by EPRI in the Gas Technology Institute and I chair EPRI's LCRI Board Working Group.
We also recently joined Energy Impact Partners global investment platform, which brings together leading companies and entrepreneurs worldwide to foster innovation toward a sustainable energy future.
Through our participation in the EIP platform, PPL will support up to $50 million in investments aimed at accelerating shift to a low carbon future and driving commercial-scale solutions needed to deliver deep economywide decarbonization.
Apart from LCRI and EIP's investment platform, we also continue to engage in a number of other R&D efforts related to clean energy technologies and enhancing the power grid.
These collaborative efforts provide PPL greater visibility into emerging technologies that can be leveraged to advance the clean energy transition, and we will continue to look for opportunity to expand our work and support in this area.
Moving to Slide 6.
We've outlined our updated path to net-zero carbon emissions on this slide, along with our current expectations on coal-fired generation capacity in Kentucky, which is consistent with the generation planning and analysis study included in our recently approved rate case filings.
It's clear that we'll need to advance technology to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 as we balance the need for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for our customers.
Based on these current factors and consistent with our most recent rate case filings in Kentucky, we currently expect to achieve a reduction in our coal-fired capacity of 70% by 2035, 90% by 2040, and 95% by 2050 from our baseline in 2010.
We anticipate having about 550 megawatts of remaining coal-fired generation in 2050 due to our highly efficient and relatively new Trimble County Unit 2 that started commercial operation in 2011.
Therefore, our objective is to continue to explore innovative ways through our R&D efforts to economically drive these reductions further while supporting our customers and local communities.
We have also assessed the implications of advancing these goals even further.
Our internal view of what it could take to achieve 100% carbon-free generation by 2035 as proposed by the Biden administration using current technologies would create significant affordability issues for our customers.
our new commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is backed by the actions that we are and will continue to take to support a low-carbon energy system that is affordable and reliable and provides the time needed for technology to advance.
Next, on Slide 7, I'll cover the details of the Kentucky rate cases.
On June 30, the KPSC approved the settlements that LG&E and KU had reached with parties to their rate reviews with certain modifications.
At a high level, the orders support continued investment to modernize our energy infrastructure, strength, and grid resilience and upgrade LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability for those we serve.
Effective July 1, the KPSC authorized a combined $199 million increase in annual revenue for LG&E and KU with an allowed base ROE of 9.425% and a 9.35% ROE for the environmental cost recovery and gas line tracker mechanisms.
In addition, the KPSC approved a $53 million economic release or credit that was proposed by LG&E and KU to help mitigate the impact of rate adjustments until mid-2022.
Importantly, the commission's order authorized full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, which will empower customers with detailed energy usage information, enable LG&E and KU to respond more quickly to power outages, and improve operational efficiency.
We continue to believe the resulting O&M savings from installing advanced meters will exceed the cost of this investment for the benefit of our customers.
The $350 million capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in the new rates that took effect July 1.
Instead, we will record our investment in the AMI project as CWIP and accrue AFUDC during the project's implementation period.
The KPSC also approved a very constructive retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and a return on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets, as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs.
The rider will provide cost recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement of such assets, as well as return on those investments at the utilities then weighted average cost of capital.
As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024.
Mill Creek Unit 2 and EW Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives.
These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity.
The retired asset recovery rider balances the interest of all stakeholders and provide certainty of recovery for the prudent investments made in these coal plants.
Pursuant to the settlement agreements approved by the KPSC, LG&E and KU have committed that they will not increase the new base rates for at least four years, subject to certain exceptions.
And before leaving this slide, I would note that in approving the settlement agreements, the commission adjusted the proposed base ROE downward from 9.55% to 9.425% and disallowed the recovery of certain legal costs.
These modifications reduced the annual revenue requirements proposed in the settlements by approximately $20 million.
We have filed a request for a limited rehearing on these matters.
And finally, turning to Slide 8.
In other highlights across PPL, we continue to achieve recognition for our strong commitment to diversity equity inclusion, innovation, and safety.
During the second quarter, PPL was recognized by Diversity Inc. in two distinct areas.
First, as one of the top utilities in the nation for workforce diversity, and second, as one of the top 50 companies for ESG, determined by several factors, including our programs and practices surrounding talent in the workforce, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy, supplier diversity programs and overall leadership in governance.
PPL was also named the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fourth consecutive year, earning a perfect score on the 2021 disability equality index.
And finally, PPL Electric Utilities received the Southeastern Electric Exchange's Chairman's Award for its groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power line.
These awards reflect the corporate strategy focused on creating value for all stakeholders as grounded in our five strategic priorities.
These include achieving industry-leading performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction, and optional efficiency, advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability, maintaining a strong financial foundation, and creating a long-term value for our shareowners, fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace, and building strong communities in the areas we serve.
Turning to Slide 10.
Today, we announced second-quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share.
tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by earnings from the U.K. utility business that have been recorded as discontinued operations.
I'll note that the tax-related item was a noncash adjustment prior to the completion of the sale of WPD in June.
Adjusting for these special items, second-quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.19 per share compared with $0.20 per share a year ago.
We remain encouraged by the economic recovery from the pandemic in both our Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, which has resulted in continuously improving commercial and industrial sales.
These higher sales were offset by several factors, which I will cover on the next slide.
So let's move to Slide 11 for a more detailed look at our second-quarter segment results.
As a reminder, we've adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K.-regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense.
Total amount of these costs was about $0.02 per share for the quarter.
Turning to the ongoing segment results.
Our Pennsylvania-regulated segment results were $0.02 per share lower compared to a year ago.
The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower transmission demand as discussed in Q1 and consistent with our expectations and an increase in the reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission-based return on equity, partially offsetting these negative variances were increased returns on additional capital investments.
We also experienced an additional $0.01 decline due to favorable tax-related items recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to our Kentucky-regulated segment.
Results were $0.01 per share higher than our comparable results in Q2 2020.
The increase was primarily driven by higher commercial and industrial demand revenue as we experienced a strong recovery in 2021 in these sectors from the significant impacts of COVID-19 and lower interest expense primarily due to the interest costs previously allocated to the Kentucky-regulated segment in 2020 that are now reflected in corporate and other.
Partly offsetting these items was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants.
Results at corporate and other were flat compared with a year ago.
Higher interest costs of $0.01 a share related to the corporate debt previously allocated to the Kentucky segment were offset by several factors that were not individually significant.
Turning to Slide 12.
I'll cover some notable financing-related updates.
First, following the sale of the U.K. utility business, we successfully completed a series of financing activities in June and July that led to a significant reduction in holding company debt.
The result was a total reduction of PPL capital funding debt by about $3.5 billion, which was in line with our previously discussed targets.
Through these actions, we've reduced total holding company debt to about 20% of PPL's total outstanding debt, while effectively clearing all near-term maturities at PPL capital funding through 2025.
In addition to the activity of PPL capital funding, we redeemed at par $250 million at LG&E and KU Energy in July, which was part of our original financing plan for the year in order to simplify the capital structure of the company by eliminating intermediate holding company debt.
That was the final remaining outstanding debt security at the LKE entity.
Therefore, we have deregistered LKE as we no longer expect to issue debt out of this entity.
We expect PPL capital funding will be the financing entity at the holding company level to provide support to all of our operating subsidiaries.
The successful execution of liability management leaves PPL well positioned and on track to achieve our targeted credit metrics post closing of the Narragansett Electric acquisition.
In addition to these notable financing updates, we also reduced outstanding short-term debt as an efficient use of available cash until we fully deploy the remaining proceeds from the sale of WPD.
In summary, as we continue to execute our strategic priorities, I am incredibly excited about PPL's future.
We continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely, reliably, and affordably for our customers.
We continue to evolve our clean energy strategy and to drive innovation across our company.
We completed the sale of our U.K. utility business, achieving outstanding value for our shareowners.
We're on track to close on our Narragansett acquisition within the expected time frames.
And the new PPL will emerge from our strategic repositioning as a much stronger company, one poised for long-term growth and success.
","Following the sale of its U.K. utility for $10.4 billion, PPL plans to repurchase $500 million in shares in 2021. The company also announced an ambitious new goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with interim targets of 80% reduction by 2040 and 70% reduction by 2035. This goal reflects PPL's commitment to driving innovation and enabling a clean energy transition. The company also recently secured the necessary approvals to acquire Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island, which is expected to close next year. In the second quarter, PPL reported $0.03 in earnings per share according to GAAP, and $0.19 in adjusted earnings per share."
PKG_q2_2020.txt,"I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
After which, I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take any questions.
Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $57 million or $0.59 per share.
Excluding the special items, second quarter 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share compared to the second quarter of 2019, net income of $194 million or $2.04 per share.
Second quarter net income was $1.54 billion in 2020 and $1.76 billion in 2019.
Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $299 million in 2020 and $376 million in 2019.
Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our paper segment.
Bob will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes.
Special items expenses also included the previously reported closure of our corrugated products facility in San Lorenzo, California and costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Excluding the special items that we mentioned, the $0.66 per share decrease in second quarter 2020 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment of $0.66 and paper segment $0.05, lower volumes in our paper segment, $0.40 and higher depreciation expense, $0.04.
These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.33, primarily in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies and several fixed cost areas.
We also had lower annual outage expenses of $0.10, lower converting costs, $0.03, lower freight expenses, $0.02 and other costs, $0.01.
Looking at our packaging business.
EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2020 of $313 million with sales of $1.4 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $349 million and sales of $1.5 billion or 23% margin.
We ran our containerboard mills to demand, built some much-needed inventory from the historically low levels at the end of the first quarter and maintained the industry-leading integration rate by supplying our box plants with the necessary containerboard to establish a new second quarter record for box shipments per day.
We ended the second quarter with inventory still at the relatively low levels but in adequate position to meet our expected stronger third quarter demand.
Our efficiencies and cost control at the mills and corrugated products facilities throughout the quarter were truly remarkable.
And we continue to see improvements in freight and logistics expenses through the optimization of our trucking operations and geographic footprint of our containerboard supply.
Demand for our corrugated products was very good in the second quarter, especially during the month of June.
As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new second quarter record for shipments per day, which were up 1.2% compared to last year's second quarter.
Total shipments for the quarter were also up 1.2% over last year.
As a comparison for the second quarter, the industry was down 1.4% in total and on a workday basis.
Through the first half of 2020, our box shipment volume is up 2.5% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 0.6%.
Outside sales volume of containerboard was about 10,000 tons below last year's second quarter and 23,000 tons below the first quarter of 2020, and as we ran our containerboard system to demand, supplied the record needs of our box plants and positioned our inventory for even higher demand during an expected stronger third quarter.
Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.61 per share below the second quarter of 2019 and down $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Export containerboard prices were down about $0.05 per share versus last year's second quarter and flat compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Finally, I'd like to point out that the benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last couple of years are continuing to gain traction.
As we have said many times, this strategy of improving the technology and equipment in various plants as well as the construction of new box plants is based upon our customers' needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them.
We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and various operating and conversion cost areas.
Looking at the paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $5 million with sales of $123 million or a 4% margin compared to second quarter 2019 EBITDA of $48 million and sales of $238 million for a 20% margin.
Second quarter paper prices and mix were about 5% below last year, and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2020.
As expected, our sales volume was about 45% below last year, and as announced back in April, we had our Jackson mill down for the months of May and June to help manage our supply with our demand outlook.
Unfortunately, our view of demand as we approached the end of June did not improve to the point of allowing us to restart the mill, resulting in us recently announcing that Jackson will also be down for the months of July and August.
We'll continue to assess the market conditions for potential September restart of the mill.
Cash provided by operations for the second quarter was $227 million, with free cash flow of $146 million.
The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $81 million, common stock dividends of $75 million; net interest payments of $41 million and cash taxes of $39 million.
We ended the quarter with $853 million of cash on hand or $977 million, including marketable securities.
Our liquidity at June 30 was just over $1.3 billion.
During the second quarter, uncoated freesheet market conditions and especially demand for our cut size office paper products, continued to deteriorate rapidly arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
These conditions, along with the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations, resulted in a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets within our paper segment.
Due to this triggering event in a more likely than not assessment that an impairment of goodwill occurred, an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020, was performed.
Based on this evaluation, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the paper segment and recognized a noncash impairment charge totaling $55.2 million.
The impairment charge is not tax deductible.
We also performed a recoverability test on the long-lived assets within our paper segment, including long-lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2020.
The results of this test indicated that these assets were 100% recoverable.
Lastly, we are planning to take or to make a change to the scheduled outages in our containerboard mills for the fourth quarter of this year versus what we discussed during last quarter's call.
Our current plans are to pull forward some recovery boiler work at the DeRidder Mill from next year to eliminate the risk of unscheduled downtime and during this period, perform a high-return capital project on the No.
one paper machine real section.
The fourth quarter estimate for our scheduled outages is now $0.59 per share, and the full year increment is now $1.05 per share.
As in the first quarter, the employees at all of our manufacturing and office locations ran their operations safely and in a very cost effective manner while facing the unprecedented conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
All facilities continue to operate in adherence to CDC guidelines and followed a strict protocol for workplace operations as well as notification of and response to potential issues.
Although we did experience some challenges during the second quarter we have not experienced any material disruption in our operations or our supply chain to the pandemic due to the pandemic.
The accomplishments of our employees during this period with the help of our customers and suppliers were truly amazing.
Looking ahead to the third quarter we'll stay focused on preserving our financial and balance sheet strength during these uncertain times.
We remain well positioned to manage whatever lies ahead while ensuring we take care of the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
During the unprecedented times corrugated products demand has performed quite well so far this year, and we expect the third quarter to be even stronger.
We began the third quarter with replenished yet still relatively low container board inventories and our expectation is that we'll end the quarter at levels below where we started while managing scheduled outages at two of our mills.
We've already announced the actions being taken in the paper business and we'll continue to evaluate the demand for our paper products throughout the third quarter.
However, shelter in place and lockdown conditions continue to change constantly across the country and such events and actions could adversely impact those expectations in the operations in not only our facilities but also the availability of services and products we rely upon from our suppliers.
As a result, we're not able to quantify our guidance for the third quarter.
These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC.
","PCA reported a second quarter net income of $57 million, or $0.59 per share, driven by strong demand for corrugated products. Excluding special items, net income was $132 million, or $1.38 per share, a decrease of $0.66 compared to the same period last year due primarily to lower prices and volume in the paper segment, as well as higher depreciation expense. The Packaging segment performed well, posting an EBITDA margin of 22%, driven by increased volume and cost control. Total company EBITDA, excluding special items, was $299 million. PCA also recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $55.2 million related to goodwill in the paper segment. Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID-19, the company ended the quarter with $853 million of cash on hand and liquidity of over $1.3 billion. Looking forward, PCA expects the third quarter to be stronger for corrugated products demand and is evaluating the impact of shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions on its paper operations."
TNC_q4_2020.txt,"I'm William Prate, Senior Director of Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.
Chris will brief you on our operations, Dave will provide an update regarding our enterprise strategy and Tom will cover the financials.
After their remarks, we will open the call to questions.
These risks and uncertainties are described in today's news release and the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We encourage you to review those documents, particularly our Safe Harbor statement, for a description of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results.
Additionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items.
We hope that you and your loved ones are continuing to stay safe.
2020 tested us all.
And I'm extremely proud of the way the Tennant team rose to the challenge.
We did so by remaining true to our guiding principles while continuing to provide the solutions and service that our customers have always expected from Tennant.
Our full year 2020 results reflect our speed and effectiveness in responding to the pandemic, specifically in how we prioritized the health and safety of our employees, the measures we took to manage costs and ensure liquidity, and above all, the determination and dedication that our employees showed in meeting the needs of our customers.
Their hard work helped minimize the overall operational and financial impact of the pandemic.
While the business impact of the pandemic significant across most of our markets, it had little effect on our strategic initiatives within the company.
A year ago, I shared with you our enterprise growth strategy, which is based on three pillars.
To win where we have competitive advantage.
To reduce complexity and build scalable processes.
And to innovate for profitable growth.
We follow through with our plan in spite of the pandemic.
In fact, our strategy was integral to everything we accomplished in 2020.
For example, our recent launch of a range of new floor scrubbers reflects Tennant commitment to innovation and our focus on winning where we have competitive advantage.
We've also made meaningful improvements to our operating model as illustrated by our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales, for which full year 2020 was in line with that of 2019 despite the decline in organic sales.
As part of the ongoing implementation of our enterprise strategy, which Dave will speak to in greater detail in a moment, we've made the strategic investments needed to allow us to exit the pandemic in a strong position as markets continue to recover.
We recognized that now more than ever our customers are relying on us to help them maintain the safety and appearance of their facilities, while at the same time reducing their overall cost to clean.
Also, I cannot overstate how important our strategy has been in channeling those team efforts to ensure the best possible results.
I will walk you through some of our key achievements of the past year in that regard and provide a look at where we are headed.
As Chris mentioned, our enterprise strategy is based on three pillars in support of our value creation objectives.
One, winning where we have competitive advantage.
Two, reducing complexity and building scalable processes.
And three, innovating for profitable growth.
In 2020, the first pillar, winning where we have a competitive advantage, began with a thorough evaluation of all aspects of our business, including products, market geographies, channels and customers in order to identify where we have the strongest competitive advantage.
The findings of that comprehensive review have led to meaningful changes within Tennant.
For example, as we announced earlier this month, we completed the sale of our coatings business.
Although the business represented approximately 2% of our total sales, it was not central to our core strength in professional, industrial and commercial floor cleaning.
By divesting it, we can redirect resources toward more strategic and profitable activities.
Our strategy implementation has been truly global, expanding across our operations worldwide.
In Japan, for example, after a thorough review of our direct sales go-to-market strategy in that market, we have made the decision and begun to shift to a distributor-only model, which offers compelling S&A savings, while delivering a superior customer experience.
On the product side, we continued to simplify.
And in 2020, managed a 35% reduction in our core Tennant legacy product portfolio along with a 20% reduction in product options.
These changes have far reaching benefits in terms of manufacturing, supply chain and sales efficiency.
Furthermore, after rigorously assessing our product lines, we have created a standard offerings across our legacy Tennant products.
This helps customers by eliminating guesswork from the buying process.
Where customers used to have to pick from literally dozens of options and features, they can now rely on Tennant's expertise to identify the solutions and features that best suit their needs.
In addition to enhancing our sales funnel, this change improves our manufacturing process as well.
We will continue to provide customized solutions when needed, but we will do so while prioritizing manufacturing efficiency.
The second pillar of our strategy, reducing complexity and building scalable processes goes to the level of product design and subsystem architecture.
2020 initiatives in this area targeted cost reductions along with customer facing quality and performance improvements.
A great example of this is an industrial tire project review we completed last year.
Through an engineering redesign effort across our large scrubbers and sweepers, we introduced new tires that reduced our cost, improved traction and performance for our customers and reduced our tire SKUs by over 50%.
Another example of reducing complexity is the plant optimization work we completed in China last year.
Our acquisition of Gaomei included a number of benefits, including a skilled workforce based in Hefei, China where we have now centralized our China manufacturing.
These optimization efforts allowed us to close our facility in Qingpu and will enable greater manufacturing flexibility and improved profitability.
As Chris noted, the implementation of our enterprise strategy is a continuous process, particularly with respect to our third pillar, innovating for profitable growth.
That means using a process of innovation to unlock value for our customers and for Tennant.
A great example of how we executed against this pillar in 2020 is the advances in our robotic floor cleaning product category.
In November of last year, we introduced our T380AMR robotic floor scrubber.
Its smaller size enhances maneuverability and navigation in tight areas, leading to maximum productivity and is ideal for customers with narrow spaces or layouts that may have been too challenging for our other robotic machine.
Our customer-centric approach in identifying and solving real world problems is the reason our customers see us as the market leader.
Looking ahead, the continued execution of our enterprise strategy will be central to our success, and is what will enable us to deliver on our annual and longer term goals.
This year, we will be diligent in following through on the projects we started in 2020 and we will selectively activate specific initiatives that will further our ability to improve our operating model.
Included in our plans are improvements to our service infrastructure, specifically in North America.
By investing in new tools to better leverage our teams of service technicians, we are creating additional capacity within our current workforce, improving the way they work and also increasing our ability to meet our customers' needs.
On the product side, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio such as with the introduction of our new commercial products and the recent launch of our new T16AMR. The T16AMR is an important addition to our product category because it makes our autonomous cleaning technology available to our industrial customers.
With this machine, along with the previously introduced T7AMR and T380AMR, we believe Tennant has the broadest robotics offering available that covers the widest range of autonomous cleaning applications.
Furthermore, the commercial products we introduced at the beginning of February, demonstrate how seamlessly the three pillars of our strategy can work together in practice.
In addition to leveraging the benefits of our IPC platform from a value engineering perspective, we are offering versions of these products as Tennant-branded machines with the full complement of Tennant brand sales and support benefits.
The result is a superior value proposition for budget-minded customers backed by Tennant's reputation for quality and service.
On a personal note, I am thrilled with the progress we've made and the plans we have in place to continue executing our enterprise strategy.
While we are cautiously optimistic about the pace of a global recovery, I look forward to working with our team to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.
With that, I will hand the call over to Tom who will discuss our financials.
Please note that in my comments today any references to earnings per share or earnings per share both GAAP and non-GAAP are on a fully diluted basis.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, Tennant reported net sales of $273 million, down 7.4% year-over-year as a result of the pandemic-related slowdown, while our organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency effects, declined 8.9%.
Shifting to our fourth quarter results by geography.
As a reminder, we group sales in the three geographies.
The Americas, which includes all North America and Latin America.
EMEA, which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
And Asia Pacific, which includes China, Japan, Australia and other Asian markets.
Sales in the Americas declined by 11.6% year-over-year and were down 10.5% organically.
Our results in the region were impacted by continued market weakness driven by the pandemic-related slowdown, which impacted both our direct and distribution sales channels.
The region is also lapping an unusually large AMR order in the previous year ago period, which offsets the organic growth we experienced in Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Sales in the EMEA region increased by 3.7% year-over-year due to currency effects, but were down 3.4% organically, primarily due to pandemic-related restrictions in the U.K., the Netherlands and the Iberian Peninsula.
Despite the negative organic growth, it's worth highlighting the region did deliver positive organic growth in Italy and Germany in the fourth quarter of 2020 with strong year-over-year growth in the parts and consumables and service businesses.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined by 10.4% year-over-year and were down 13.9% organically.
The year-over-year decline in fourth quarter sales was primarily due to Korea, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic along with declines in Australia.
These results offset organic growth in China from distribution and strategic accounts as well as growth in service across the region.
Now on to margins.
Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 41.3% compared with 40.5% in the year ago period, increasing due to the positive effect of pricing actions and cost out initiatives driven by our enterprise strategy, which more than offset regional mix and strategic investments we made during the quarter related to our employees.
During the fourth quarter, our adjusted S&A expenses were 33.9% of net sales compared with 30.4% in the year ago period.
As we discussed last quarter, we made a number of strategic investments to enable us to exit the pandemic in a strong position as the markets continue to recover as well as investments in our employees to recognize our efforts through the pandemic.
Our S&A expenses also include additional planned expenses related to our new corporate headquarters.
As for the profitability, we reported net earnings of $2.5 million or $0.13 per share, down from $10.9 million or $0.59 per share in the prior year.
Adjusted EPS, which excludes non-operational items memorization expense totaled $0.48 compared with $0.86 in the prior year.
In terms of adjusted EBITDA, our results decreased to $25.4 million or 9.3% of sales compared with $34 million or 11% of sales in the year ago period, driven by our lower year-over-year revenue and the incremental investments in the quarter mentioned a moment ago.
As for our tax rate, in the fourth quarter, Tennant had an adjusted effective tax rate excluding the amortization expense adjustment of 32.3% compared to 23.3% in the year ago period.
The increase was mainly due to the mix of taxable earnings by country and a decrease in discrete favorable tax items compared to the prior year.
Turning to cash flow, capital allocation and balance sheet items.
In the fourth quarter, Tennant generated $36.3 million in cash flow from operations, primarily driven by business performance and improved working capital levels.
We also reduced outstanding debt by $15.2 million and paid $4.2 million in cash dividends to shareholders.
Turning now to our full year performance.
In 2020, net sales totaled $1 billion compared to $1.14 billion in 2019, reflecting a decline of 11.8% on an organic basis driven by market weakness due to the global pandemic.
As Chris mentioned, our ability to quickly respond to the pandemic and manage costs and ensure liquidity allowed us to deliver an adjusted EBITDA for full year 2020 of $119.4 million or 11.9% of sales compared with $136.9 million or 12% of sales in 2019.
These actions also allowed Tennant to generate cash flow from operations of $133.8 million, reduce outstanding debt by $31.1 million and pay $16.3 million in cash dividends to the shareholders.
While the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, we are ready to ramp up quickly as the anticipated recovery continues to gain pace.
In addition to improving market conditions, we expect we'll benefit from our strategic investments in the improvements to our operating model that began last year as part of our enterprise strategy.
As included in today's earnings announcement, our guidance for full year 2021 is as follows.
Net sales of $1.05 billion to $1.08 billion with organic sales rising 5% to 8%.
GAAP earnings of $3.30 to $3.75 per share.
Adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.95 per share, which excludes certain non-operational items and the amortization expense.
Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $130 million to $140 million.
Capital expenditures of $20 million to $25 million.
And an effective tax rate of 20%.
We are cautiously optimistic about the overall pace of recovery and expect to deliver on our full year guidance assuming no further pandemic-related issues in 2021.
Based on our anticipated pace of recovery in 2021 and our actions to manage costs during the pandemic in 2020, we expect that EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share will improve sequentially each quarter this year with Q1 likely being the lowest quarter for EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share as Q1 2020 was least impacted by COVID last year.
Our guidance also incorporates the divestiture of our coatings business, which we estimate having $20 million to $25 million impact to sales.
Before we start the Q&A, I want to take a moment to discuss our leadership transition.
As you know, Dave Huml will become CEO on March 1 and I will serve as a strategic advisor until the end of this year.
I have been at Tennant for almost 18 years, including 15 years as President and CEO.
This has been, without a doubt, the most wonderful and fulfilling experience of my professional career.
But this is definitely an opportune time for a change in leadership.
One of the most important things a CEO can do is ensure a smooth and seamless transition to new leadership.
I am proud to say that we have accomplished that with the succession plan we have in place, which is the culmination of more than two years of work in cooperation with our board of directors.
I hired Dave a little over six years ago, and we have a very close working relationship.
It's been such a great pleasure to see him grow as a leader and become an important contributor to Tennant's success.
Dave loves the company and has a deep understanding of our business.
He has led our global marketing group.
He has been responsible for Asia Pacific and EMEA.
He was the executive sponsor of our IPC integration.
And he even had us then running our global operations group.
Dave has exceptional leadership abilities as well as the vision to take Tennant to new levels of success.
His industry knowledge, global experience and foundational understanding of our company have been powerful attributes in working with our senior leadership team to develop and now implement our enterprise strategy.
Dave has a keen understanding of where we need to go as an organization to serve all of our stakeholders.
And I am excited to see where he takes us.
In closing, I would like to say that what has touched my heart most profoundly through all my years with the company are the people.
The thousands of wonderful, talented, dedicated and caring people of the Tennant family.
They are the lifeblood of this great organization and the reason it has thrive for 150 years and will continue to flourish for the next 150.
With that, we will now open the call to questions.
","Tennant Company recorded a 7.4% net sales decline in Q4 2020 to $273 million due to the pandemic's impact, with organic sales decreasing by 8.9%. The Americas saw an 11.6% sales decline, EMEA saw a 3.7% increase (3.4% organic decline), and Asia Pacific saw a 10.4% decline (13.9% organic decline). Adjusted gross margin, however, improved to 41.3% from 40.5% due to pricing actions and cost-cutting initiatives. Though adjusted S&A expenses rose to 33.9% due to strategic investments, net earnings fell to $2.5 million from $10.9 million. Adjusted EPS decreased from $0.86 to $0.48. For 2021, Tennant anticipates net sales between $1.05 billion and $1.08 billion, with organic sales growth of 5% to 8%. They also project adjusted EPS of $3.50 to $3.95, an adjusted EBITDA range of $130 million to $140 million, and a 20% effective tax rate. Tennant remains cautiously optimistic about the recovery pace and expects to deliver on its guidance, excluding further pandemic-related disruptions."
AEO_q3_2021.txt,"These statements are based upon information that represents the company's current expectations or beliefs.
The results actually realized may differ materially based on risk factors included in our SEC filings.
aeo-inc.com in the Investor Relations section.
I hope everyone is doing well.
I'm extremely happy with the continued strength across our business.
It was truly a milestone quarter in which we posted best ever third quarter results and announced an important strategic acquisition.
I'll start with our results, which were simply outstanding.
This quarter, we delivered record revenue of $1.27 billion, reflecting growth at 24% from 2020, and an increase of 19% to 2019.
Healthy sales and merchandise margins combined with cost efficiencies drove profit flow-through, which surpassed our expectations.
Record operating income of $210 million, reflecting a margin at 16.5%, our highest rate since 2007.
We are extremely pleased to see a sustained momentum across our brands and channels, which posted growth versus 2020 at pre-pandemic 2019 levels.
Casualwear remains in high demand, and AE and Aerie are perfectly positioned to benefit.
We are delivering great product and sharper marketing as well as brand [Phonetic] experiences, both in-store and online that are second to none.
AE brand is achieving exceptional results.
Under Jen's leadership, the product style and quality has improved remarkably and customers are noticing.
As back-to-school came rolling back, AE received more than its fair share of growth.
Shopping frequency and spend is up dramatically and we are acquiring and reactivating more customers.
At the same time, we are seeing renewed growth in categories that have been underpenetrated in recent years.
Aerie's growth continues at a fast pace, with momentum across all categories, including our new activewear brand OFFLINE by Aerie.
Customers who try Aerie love it and the brand is just beginning to unlock its true potential.
Healthy acquisition retention are fueling strong sales and we are seeing nice reception as we expand into new markets.
strategic pillars have provided a roadmap and instilled focus across the company.
Simply put, we are running our business better than ever.
Key initiatives such as inventory and real estate optimization and the transformation of our supply chain are driving significant profit flow-through.
The processes, disciplines and capabilities we have put in place over the past 18 months will continue to set us apart, fueling strong returns and taking AEO to even greater heights.
As an organization, innovation is a core value and at the heart of everything we do.
We clearly recognize that many of the changes in our industry over the past year are here to stay.
In order to remain competitive today and in the years to come, we must pivot and think differently about our business.
That brings me to our exciting plan to acquire Quiet Logistics.
This acquisition marks a major milestone for our company, which I believe will be transformative.
Acquiring Quiet allows us to build on the efficiencies we've gained over the past 12 months and position us for success as we grow our business over the coming years.
We also have a broader vision.
We expect the combination of Quiet Logistics and the recent acquisition of AirTerra to create a unique platform that revolutionizes logistics within our business and retail.
Through consolidation and pooled resources, the customer at Quiet and AirTerra will enjoy the agilities and efficiencies that were previously only available to the world's largest brands and retailers.
I believe this will create an exciting new profit center with meaningful growth opportunities for AEO.
Lastly, our efforts around sustainability and building a better world through our ESG initiatives remain front and center at all times.
We continue to increase our most sustainable real good styles across all merchandise categories.
Additionally, we are investing to decrease emissions in our operations as we make progress toward becoming carbon-neutral.
AE's outperformance year-to-date was truly remarkable and exceeded our expectations.
They clearly demonstrated the agility to meet unexpected challenges, while also staying the course toward our long-term goals.
Our results continue to be fueled by a sound and meaningful strategy, resilient operations and focus on innovation and a passionate world-class team.
Strong demand continues and we expect a strong close to 2021.
This was another amazing quarter for AEO.
We saw tremendous excitement around Aerie and AE as customers turned to their favorite brands this back-to-school.
Customer KPIs were very favorable as we brought in new customers and won more of their wallet.
It was a great set up for the holiday season, where I'm happy to note the energy has stayed just as elevated.
Starting with Aerie, we consistently reach new heights each and every quarter.
28% revenue growth in the third quarter following a 34% increase last year demonstrates Aerie's strong growth path.
This marked the 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
Profit flow-through was also very healthy with a 16.5% operating margin, reflecting new third quarter highs for the brand.
We achieved this despite some unevenness of inventory flow during factory shutdowns in South Vietnam.
This occurred primarily in our high demand legging business, which is also one of our best margin categories.
Sales metrics in the third quarter were incredibly healthy.
The AUR was up in the high teens, driven by higher full price selling and more strategic decision-making around promotions.
Demand was strong across the Aerie portfolio with our core intimates bralettes and apparel leading the charge.
The OFFLINE activewear brand is continuing to generate excitement as it expands its product offering.
We feel great about what's to come as we grow the store footprint and widen the customer base.
Marketing is also playing a key role.
In August, we launched the Voices of AerieREAL.
This was Aerie's largest integrated marketing campaign featured across TikTok and connected TV and Snapchat.
This platform is giving our customers a voice and opportunity to share what makes them real.
The response was truly amazing, hundreds of customers shared their touching and funny real stories and will be featured in our upcoming campaigns.
Year-to-date, Aerie's customer file has expanded 15%.
Customers are transacting more frequently and across more categories.
This is driving higher spend per customer as Aerie becomes the go-to for intimates activewear and cozy apparel.
We opened 29 new Aerie doors in the quarter, including a mix of new stand-alone and side-by-side formats, roughly a quarter of them are OFFLINE doors.
Momentum heading into the holiday season remains strong.
We are focused on driving broad-based scale recognition of Aerie as a must-stop gifting destination, and I am so excited for what we have planned and I look forward to sharing more Aerie highlights in the upcoming quarters.
Now, turning to American Eagle.
I'm thrilled with the great progress we're making just 11 months into the launch of our new strategy.
As I shop our website and walk our stores, I have to tell you the strong AE heritage we all know and love is back.
The assortment has been refreshed, our advertising and messaging is reenergized and it's working.
Sales in the quarter rose 21% compared to 2020 and increased 8% to 2019.
Reigniting our brand product together with inventory optimization and promotional discipline drove strong AUR growth and merchandise margin expansion.
This resulted in significant profit flow-through and operating margin of 27.8% that reflected new highs.
Our strength during back-to-school is clear -- is a clear signal that we are the destination for jeans, which continues to hit new highs.
AE's customer file is up and, here too, customers are buying more frequently and spending more.
As we predicted, current trends and shifts in silhouettes are playing right into AE's strengths as the market leader.
In the quarter, our men's business saw tremendous growth across all categories.
The women's business also posted strong sales, supported by our signature denim category and a focus on outfitting.
AE continues to explore innovative ways to reach and broaden its audience.
I am so proud to share that AE was included in TikTok's pilot of its social commerce program this quarter.
Being a part of the new initiative is a true testament to the growing strength of the AE brand and its importance to customers.
AE also launched a store on Snapchat and became the official partner of twitchgaming, a new channel created by gamers for gamers.
There is so much momentum across the brands as we head into the holiday season.
The teams did a great job getting our product out here and we're positioned to meet strong demand.
It's paying off in spades and I'm so happy how far we have come and how much we've accomplished in such a short period of time.
More to share in the coming quarters.
I'm very pleased with how we executed this quarter.
The teams did a remarkable job managing through a highly disrupted operating environment.
Strong top and bottom line results are a clear indication that our strategies are working.
We are making sustained progress against the strategic pillars outlined in our Real Power.
And with this, we are unlocking structural benefits across our business and building a competitive edge in the industry.
A key pillar of our strategy is to create the best brand experience for our customers and our selling channels really delivered this quarter.
We are pleased to see store traffic rebuild rising in the double-digits, driving a 29% increase in store revenue.
Selling trends were robust across our factory outlets and mainline stores, with both formats also seeing significant profit improvement.
Momentum was broad-based across all regions in the US, and all international markets also posted positive results.
Our digital business continued at a healthy pace with revenues up 10%, successfully lapping 29% growth in the prior year.
I am pleased to note that both our store and digital revenues and profits in the quarter surpassed levels we achieved in the third quarter of 2019.
This is reaffirming that we are emerging from the pandemic stronger.
Year-to-date, digital penetration is 35%, and our trailing 12-month digital revenue is approximately $1.8 billion with very strong profitability.
As we prioritize enhancing the omnichannel shopping experience, we are launching new tools and technologies.
This quarter, we expanded our virtual selling tool, AE Live, which leverages our amazing store teams and local influencers to connect directly with customers looking for inspiration and guidance on the latest trends.
We also launched Afterpay in stores, enhanced our e-gifting for a more engaging experience and expanded both same-day delivery services and customer self-checkout to more geographies.
I am very encouraged by the strength in our customer data.
We closed the third quarter with the highest active customer count and highest average annual spend since 2010.
Over the past 12 and 24 months, we added almost 1.75 million and 2.25 million new customers, respectively.
Approximately a third are engaging across both brands and spending approximately 2 times that of our average customer annually.
Following a successful relaunch last summer, the royalty program is growing, with members spending more and staying longer.
Now, shifting gears to logistics and supply chain, we continue to reap the benefits from our in-market fulfillment model.
Delivery costs leveraged 120 basis points in the quarter.
In fact, delivery cost dollars were down year-on-year, led by efficiencies created in digital delivery.
With product located closer to stores and customers, delivery times and the average cost per shipment declined versus last year.
And with greater control over inventory placement, shipments per order were also down dramatically.
This created enormous cost savings and efficiencies.
As Jay said, we are thrilled to announce the purchase of Quiet Logistics, which will allow us to increase these benefits over time.
In particular, the ability to drive substantially greater sales and margin on far less inventory, create more precision in our inventory allocation decisions and deliver products to customers both faster and at a lower cost.
This comes shortly after our acquisition of AirTerra, which we discussed on last quarter's call.
The combination of Quiet and AirTerra has meaningful growth potential, offering a one-stop shop for cost-effective transportation and fulfillment solutions to a growing customer base.
A technology-led supply chain is the backbone of the successful retail business today and into the future.
We believe we are demonstrating the power of this and that Quiet and AirTerra are providing capabilities that are much needed in today's marketplace.
As we discussed in September, the global supply chain remains highly disrupted with core backlog and shifting production schedules leading to longer delivery times and higher transportation costs.
Overall, we managed effectively through these challenges.
In the third quarter, the AE brand essentially had no disruption.
However, as Jen discussed, Aerie's legging category experienced uneven inventory flows when factory closures in Vietnam created product delays.
As a result, we chose to air the product to ensure we were in stock for the holidays.
Although there is a related cost that Mike will discuss in more detail, we are in a healthy inventory position and are set up for a very strong holiday.
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance year-to-date and I'm looking forward to sharing more details on our new investments in the coming quarters.
In the third quarter, we built on strong momentum from the first half of the year, posting yet another record revenue and profit result.
Even with the global operating environment still in flux, our teams executed with precision, guided by the initiatives we outlined in our Real Power.
value creation plan back in January.
We continued to place strong emphasis on product innovation that strengthens customer affinity for our brands, inventory discipline and focus, and real estate optimization and supply chain investments that build on our leading omnichannel capabilities.
Together, these initiatives are fueling our performance and improving our gross margin for the long-term.
Revenue of $1.27 billion, operating income of $210 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 marked third quarter records for the company.
Gross margin of 44.3% and operating margin of 16.5% hit their strongest levels since 2007.
Growth across the business was also exceptional compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 period.
Consolidated third quarter net revenue increased $242 million or 24% versus third quarter 2020 and is up $208 million or 19% from 2019.
Across brands, sales metrics were very favorable, strong demand, higher full price sales and fewer promotions drove the average unit retail up 15% and fueled a high single-digit increase in our average transaction value.
As Michael noted, our selling strategy as an omnichannel retailer continues to be a competitive advantage fueling growth across channels.
We offer customers the convenience they seek on where and how to shop and continue to work to optimize the costs associated with that convenience.
From a brand standpoint, Aerie continued its industry-leading multiyear growth trajectory.
Revenue rose 28% from third quarter 2020 and over 70% from third quarter 2019.
Aerie's operating profit rose 46% and the operating margin expanded to 16.5%, marking a new third quarter high.
Incremental freight costs were $5 million or a 170 basis point headwind to brand operating margins in the quarter.
Additionally, uneven flow of goods, particularly in our signature leggings business put pressure on volumes as well as product mix as this is one of our highest margin categories.
Despite these headwinds, Aerie posted a significant improvement in profitability compared to prior years, almost tripling versus third quarter 2019.
Moving to American Eagle's brand performance, I cannot be more pleased with our results here.
The third quarter saw a significant profit unlock at AE as top line grew 21% and operating profit jumped 68%.
Operating margins hit a remarkable 27.8%.
As Jen mentioned, with improvements across key categories, the top line grew 8% against 2019.
We are seeing far better profitability even beyond our expectations.
Strong demand for our products is being met with healthier decision-making across all areas of the business, and we are truly benefiting from the inventory optimization work unveiled in January.
With significant progress here, we see -- still see room for further unlock moving forward.
Total company consolidated gross profit dollars were up 36% compared to the third quarter of 2020, reflecting a 44.3% gross margin rate.
A strong top line allowed us to realize expense leverage and rent as we benefited from lease negotiations.
And as Michael indicated, efficiencies in our distribution network fueled leverage and delivery.
Merchandise margins also expanded due to our focus on inventory optimization, promotional discipline and higher full price selling, partially offset by higher freight costs.
As a result of strong sales, we saw SG&A leverage 190 basis points.
The dollar increase of $41 million was due primarily to higher store payroll, especially as we lapped capacity constraints last year as well as new store openings and increased advertising.
This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation due to accruals earlier in the year.
Record operating income of $210 million reflected a 16.5% operating margin, our highest third quarter rate since 2007.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.76 per share, marking a record third quarter.
Our diluted share count was 205 million and included 34 million shares of unrealized dilution associated with our convertible notes.
Ending inventory was up 32% compared to a 13% decline last year.
The increased freight costs had about a 10 point impact on ending inventory at cost.
We're really happy with our inventory position.
I'd like to take a minute to recognize the hard work our teams put in to get our product here on time to support strong demand this holiday season.
Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $741 million in cash, up from $692 million in the third quarter 2020.
Capital expenditures totaled $58 million in the quarter and $144 million year-to-date.
For 2021, we continue to capital expenditures to come in on the low end of our $250 million to $275 million guidance range, reflecting cost savings and project timing.
With regards to our real estate strategy, we have significant flexibility in managing our store fleet to support our revenue and profit goals.
As we work toward our long-term target of rightsizing AE store footprint, we are dealing with a sharp eye on maximizing profitability.
For Aerie, we are focused on markets with the greatest opportunity.
Due to backlogs in building materials and fixtures, several of our third quarter store openings shifted into the fourth quarter, we expect the majority of these stores to open by the end of the year.
We're very excited about our recently announced acquisition of Quiet.
This will improve our ability to service both channels and lock in the cost benefits and overall gross margin efficiencies we've consistently seen over the past last year.
To wrap up, our performance year-to-date has been truly phenomenal and even more so in the context of challenges and uncertainties in our external environment.
We're extremely pleased with our record results year-to-date and continued progress on our strategic initiatives.
Sales trends remain strong heading into the key Black Friday and Cyber Week period.
We have met our goal to ensure our customers do not feel any impact from the supply chain disruptions and we're well positioned to meet holiday demand.
However, that has come with additional freight costs in the range of $70 million to $80 million, which will impact the fourth quarter.
Of course, we expect to nicely exceed $600 million of operating income for the year, well above the $550 million 2023 target.
We will be updating our longer-term financial targets at ICR this January.
Our results year-to-date continue to reaffirm that the Real Power.
value creation plan is working and that we're focusing on the right levers to drive financial success and returns to our shareholders.
","AEO delivered record Q3 results with a 24% revenue growth to $1.27 billion, driven by strength across both AE and Aerie brands. Strong sales, healthy merchandise margins, and cost efficiencies led to a record operating income of $210 million, with a margin at 16.5%. Aerie continued its growth momentum, exceeding 2019 levels by over 70%. American Eagle brand achieved a profit unlock with a 27.8% operating margin, aided by inventory optimization, promotional discipline, and higher full-price sales. The company's strategic initiatives, such as Quiet Logistics acquisition, are expected to further enhance profit flow-through and improve logistics capabilities. Despite supply chain disruptions, the company managed effectively, resulting in a strong inventory position for the holiday season. However, additional freight costs in Q4 are estimated to be between $70 million to $80 million."
RPM_q4_2021.txt,"Matt will then review our fourth-quarter results in some detail, then Rusty will conclude with comments on our outlook for the first half of fiscal 2022.
On our April investor call, we referenced rising inflation across our P&L at structurally high single digits with some select spikes of 150% to 200%.
Someone in our call today thought that by now raw material costs and availability would have gotten better to the point of pressure from some customers to give back price.
That was wrong in April and way wrong today.
Raw material costs have increased to levels on average in the high teens.
More importantly, certain critical raw material shortages across our industry are negatively impacting our ability to produce and meet market demand.
In Q4, this raw material availability cost us an estimated $100 million in revenue.
It's likely to cost us more in Q1 and we anticipate having more raw material availability lost production days in Q1 this year than we had from the impact of COVID shutdowns in Q1 last year.
Our full-year consolidated sales increased 11% to $6.1 billion, our EBIT margin increased by 150 basis points, and adjusted EBIT was up 26.5%.
Operating cash flow climbed nearly 40% to a record $766.2 million, and our adjusted EBIT margin climbed to 12.8%, which was also a record.
Our MAP to Growth program has been the principal driver of this strong financial performance.
The successful execution of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, especially in light of the incredible disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic and more recently by unprecedented supply chain challenges, is a true testament to the dedication and resilience of the RPM associates worldwide.
At the program's onset, we recognized that RPM had reached the point where a center-led approach in selected areas of the business was required to take it to the next level of growth.
In manufacturing, we formed a center-led team that has created a lasting culture of manufacturing excellence and continuous improvement disciplines across the organization.
This team launched our MS-168 manufacturing system, which is allowing us to produce better products more quickly, more cost-effectively, and more sustainably.
In addition, we reduced our global manufacturing footprint by 28 facilities, consolidating production to more strategically advantageous plants.
Our original target was 31 plants but consolidation efforts were slowed by the COVID pandemic.
We expect to exceed the original target in the coming year.
We also created a center-led procurement team that has consolidated material spending across our operating companies, negotiated improved payment terms with our supplier base, and has helped us reduce working capital.
These initiatives have created millions of dollars in cost savings.
With stronger supplier partnerships, longer-term contracts, we are in a much better position to secure necessary raw materials and control costs through the current raw material supply shortages than we would have been just three years ago.
Additionally, we took significant steps to streamline many of our administrative functions.
Through our financial realignment, we consolidated 46 accounting locations, improved controls, developed more effective and efficient accounting processes, and reduced costs.
Similar initiatives were undertaken in our IT infrastructure as we have migrated 75% of our organization to one to four group-level ERP platforms.
Additionally, we have reduced the number of data centers we manage by shifting systems and hardware to the cloud, and we are creating a number of platforms for centralized data-driven decision making.
Over the course of the three-year MAP to Growth program, we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases.
Aside from a significantly improved profit margin profile and stronger cash generation, as reflected in the cumulative total return generated by RPM, which has exceeded our peer group over the three years of the MAP to Growth program, the lasting legacy of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan is the revolutionary change in how people work together at RPM.
Our operating company leadership is managing today with a broader view of RPM as a whole, allowing us to better leverage resources.
Another permanent change has been the operational disciplines we developed that will continue to generate improvements in profitability, cash flow, and operating efficiency well into the future.
Perhaps more significant has been our ability to maintain our unique entrepreneurial growth-oriented culture, evidenced by the fact that our revenues continue to grow at or above industry averages throughout the MAP to Growth program.
The real heroes behind the MAP to Growth success were our associates worldwide, particularly our frontline workers who kept our manufacturing and distribution centers operating during the COVID pandemic.
We also owe a debt of gratitude to my good friend and one of RPM's great operating leaders, Steve Knoop, who is the architect of the MAP to Growth program and passed away prematurely in 2019.
Additionally, I'd like to recognize Mike Sullivan, vice president of operations and chief restructuring officer; Tim Kinser, vice president of operations procurement; and Gordy Hyde, vice president of operations, manufacturing, who successfully executed the program with an intense focus and strong leadership that were integral to delivering these results and instilling a permanent focus on operating efficiency and continuous improvement into our culture.
While we have reached the 2020 MAP to Growth conclusion, there will be some runoff from the MAP to Growth program in fiscal '22, during which we expect to capture approximately $50 million in incremental savings.
We will also be leveraging the lessons learned from this program to chart a course for 2025.
Over the next six to 12 months, we will be working on a MAP 2.0 program in conjunction with our operating leaders.
We remain fully committed to achieving our long-term goal of a 16% EBIT margin, and we will be sharing more information about our progress for a new program in the coming quarters.
Please keep in mind that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis.
For the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.74 billion, an increase of 19.6%, compared to the $1.46 billion reported in the year-ago period.
Sales growth was 13.9% organic, 2.2%, the result of recent acquisitions, and 3.5% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds.
We are very pleased with this strong top-line growth in light of raw material shortages and supply chain disruptions.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $1.28, compared to $1.13 in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter.
Our adjusted EBIT was $236.2 million, compared to $213.6 million during the year-ago period, which was an increase of 10.6%.
Keep in mind that last year's fourth quarter was impacted by the pandemic's onset, which created the extraordinary situation where our non-operating segment reported a profit due to lower medical expenses, incentive reversals, and other factors.
On the other hand, during this year's fourth quarter, we experienced higher insurance costs due to business interruptions created by hurricanes and the winter storm Uri as well as higher incentives tied to improve performance.
If you exclude the impact of our nonoperating segment from both years, our four operating segments combined generated impressive sales growth of 19.6% and adjusted EBIT growth of 27.5% as they overcame margin pressures and supply availability challenges.
Turning now to our segment performance for the quarter.
Our construction products group generated record results.
Construction, maintenance, and repair activity accelerated in the U.S. during the quarter and even more so in international markets.
Construction products group net sales were a record $629.4 million during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which was an increase of 33.2%, compared to fiscal 2020 fourth-quarter net sales of $472.4 million.
Organic growth was 28.4% and foreign currency translation provided a tailwind of 4.8%.
Leading the way for the segment were our businesses in North America that provided commercial roofing materials and concrete admixtures and repair products as well as our European businesses, all of which generated record sales.
Demand for our Nudura Insulated Concrete Forms remained at elevated levels due to the relatively low installed cost, in addition to the environmental and structural benefits as compared to traditional building methods.
Adjusted EBIT was a record $110.4 million, compared to adjusted EBIT of $77.3 million reported during the year-ago period.
This represents an increase of 42.7%.
The bottom line was boosted by volume leveraging, savings from our MAP to Growth program, and higher selling prices.
Our performance coatings group also benefited from the release of pent-up demand for the construction, maintenance, and repair of structures in the U.S. and abroad, which has leveraged into strong financial results.
The segment's net sales were $283.3 million during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which was an increase of 20.5%, compared to the $235.1 million reported a year ago.
Organic sales increased 12.9% and acquisitions contributed 2.9%.
Foreign currency translation increased sales by 4.7%.
This segment had been particularly challenged through the pandemic because of its greater exposure to international markets and the oil and gas industry as well as a greater reliance on facility access to apply its products.
Points of strength in the performance coatings group were its businesses providing commercial flooring systems and North American bridge and highway products as well as recovery in its international businesses.
Adjusted EBIT was $31 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to $23.7 million during the year-ago period, representing an increase of 31.2%.
Segment earnings increased due to higher sales volumes, the MAP to Growth program, and pricing, which helped to offset raw material inflation.
Our consumer group reported record net sales of $628.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 2%, compared to net sales of $616.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
Organic sales decreased 3.8% since this was the first quarter in which we comped against the surge in demand at the beginning of the pandemic.
Acquisitions contributed 3.8% to sales.
Foreign currency translation increased sales by 2%.
During the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our consumer group sales and earnings have grown rapidly as it served the extraordinary demand for DIY home improvement products by consumers who were homebound during the pandemic.
As more Americans became vaccinated and were no longer confined to their homes, DIY home improvement activity began to slow from its torrid pace during the quarter, though the pace of sales remained higher than the pre-pandemic levels.
In international markets, many of which still have stay-at-home orders in place, they remain quite strong.
Fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT was $93.6 million, a decrease of 10.4%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $104.5 million reported during the prior-year period.
Helping to partially offset the cost pressures were selling price increases and savings from our MAP to Growth program, some of which was invested in advertising programs to promote new products.
The specialty products group reported record net sales of $202.8 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which increased 49.9%, compared to net sales of $135.2 million in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter.
Organic sales increased 46.2% while acquisitions contributed 0.7% to sales and foreign currency translation increased sales by 3%.
For the second quarter in a row, our specialty products group generated the highest organic growth among our four operating segments.
Its results have improved sequentially over the past three quarters, with excellent top- and bottom-line results by nearly all of its businesses, including those providing coatings for recreational watercraft, OEM equipment, wood, food, and pharmaceuticals as well as cleaning and restoration equipment and chemicals.
Adjusted EBIT was a record $36.3 million in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, an increase of 395%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $7.3 million in the prior-year period.
Its record results were driven by recent management changes, increased business development initiatives, and improving market conditions.
Lastly, I have a few comments on our liquidity.
Our fiscal 2021 cash flow from operations, as Frank mentioned, was a record $766.2 million, compared to last year's record of $549.9 million.
This is primarily due to continued good working capital management and margin improvement initiatives from our MAP to Growth program.
At year end, our total liquidity was $1.46 billion and included $246.7 million of cash and $1.21 billion in committed available credit.
Our net leverage ratio, as calculated under our bank agreements, was 2.17 as of May 31, 2021.
This was an improvement, as compared to 2.89 a year ago.
With a healthy balance sheet, we continue to use some of our record cash flow to reduce debt.
Total debt at the end of fiscal 2021 was $2.38 billion, compared to $2.54 billion a year ago.
And as Frank mentioned, we are also investing more aggressively in growth initiatives, including advertising, operating improvements and acquisitions, plus we are rewarding our shareholders through our cash dividend and our stock repurchase program.
Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 38 million of stock.
As we discussed last quarter, various macroeconomic factors are creating inflationary and supply pressures on some of our product categories.
As a result of the lag impact from our FIFO accounting methodology, we expect that our fiscal 2022 first-half performance will be significantly impacted by inflation throughout our P&L, which is currently averaging in the upper teens.
We are working to offset these increased costs with incremental MAP to Growth savings and commensurate selling price increases, which we will continue to implement as necessary.
More importantly, the limited availability of certain key raw material components is negatively impacting our ability to meet demand.
Our most significant challenge for the first half of fiscal 2022 will be in our consumer group.
Several factors are compressing margins in this segment.
First, selling price negotiations took place last spring, and material costs have rapidly risen further since then.
Secondly, insufficient supply of raw material, several of which are severely constrained due to trucking shortages or force majeure being declared by suppliers, has led to intermittent plant shutdowns and low productivity.
Lastly, the Consumer Group has outsourced production in several cases to improve service levels at the expense of margins.
To address these first-half margin challenges, the consumer group is cutting costs and working with customers to secure additional price increases.
We expect that our other three segments will successfully manage supply challenges to continue their robust top and bottom-line momentum from the fourth quarter and carry it into the first half of fiscal 2022.
Turning now to Q1 of fiscal 2022.
We expect consolidated sales to increase in the low to mid-single digits compared to Q1 of fiscal 2021 when sales grew 9%, creating a difficult year-over-year comparison.
Additionally, supply constraints have slowed production in some product categories.
Despite these factors, our revenue growth is expected to continue in three of our four segments.
We anticipate our construction products group and performance coatings group to generate sales increases in the high single or low double digits.
The specialty products group is expected to generate double-digit sales increases.
These sales projections assume that global economies continue to improve.
Sales in our consumer group are expected to decline double digits as it continues to experience difficult comparisons to the prior year when organic growth was up 34%.
However, the consumer group's fiscal 2022 Q1 sales are expected to be above the pre-pandemic record, indicating that we have expanded the user base for our products since then.
We expect our Q1 adjusted EBIT to grow in three of our four segments, with the exception again being our consumer group.
Based on the anticipated decline in this one segment, our Q1 consolidated adjusted EBIT is expected to decrease 25% to 30% versus a difficult prior-year comparison when adjusted EBIT in last year's first quarter was up nearly 40%.
Moving to Q2 of fiscal 2022, we expect good performance again with the exception of the consumer group.
As discussed earlier, the challenges in this segment are anticipated to result in a significant decline in adjusted EBIT against difficult prior-year comparisons when sales were up 21% and adjusted EBIT was up 66%.
We anticipate that the Q2 decline in consumers will be mostly offset by the combined EBIT growth in our three other segments, leading to consolidated adjusted EBIT being roughly flat versus another difficult prior-year comparison when consolidated adjusted EBIT was up nearly 30%.
After we work through the temporary supply chain challenges, we expect to emerge with the consumer group that has broader distribution and a larger user base than it had pre-pandemic.
For our other three segments, good results are expected to continue due to recent strategic changes in our specialty products group continuing to pay off and the catch-up of deferred maintenance driving additional business at our construction products group and performance coatings group.
","RPM International reported strong financial performance in Q4, with consolidated sales increasing 19.6% to $1.74 billion and adjusted earnings per share rising 13.3% to $1.28, exceeding analyst estimates. However, the company faces challenges in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Raw material costs have increased to high teens, resulting in an estimated $100 million revenue loss in Q4 and anticipation of more in Q1. Limited raw material availability is also impacting production, with the consumer group facing particular difficulties due to margin compression and plant shutdowns. Despite these challenges, RPM expects three segments (construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products) to continue their momentum with strong revenue growth in Q1. However, consolidated adjusted EBIT is projected to decrease by 25% to 30% in Q1, with the consumer group experiencing a significant decline."
HUM_q3_2021.txt,"In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Susan Diamond, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our third quarter 2021 results and our updated financial outlook for 2021.
Joe Ventura, our Chief Legal Officer will also be joining Bruce and Susan for the Q&A session.
Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement.
Actual results could differ materially.
Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.
Finally, any references to earnings per share or earnings per share made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.
Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for the third quarter of 2021, slightly above consensus estimates.
Our year-to-date results reflect the strength of our core operations as we continue to see strong underlying fundamentals across all lines of business and have remained focused on ensuring our members receive the right care at the right time despite the continued disruption caused by the pandemic.
While our underlying fundamentals are strong, 2021 financial results have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic, which has resulted in an adjustment to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance.
As Susan will share in more detail, this reduction of approximately $1 in adjusted earnings per share is a direct result of COVID and corresponds to our current expectation of the total Medicare Advantage utilization inclusive of COVID costs will run 1% below baseline in the fourth quarter, which is a 150 basis points less than our previous assumption of 2.5% below baseline.
This update reflects a more conservative posture going into the final months of the year and notably $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022.
As a reminder, prior to this guidance update we had not recognized a COVID headwind in our '21 guidance as many of our peers did.
Our adjusted earnings per share guidance has been above our long-term growth target at the midpoint throughout the year at 16% growth.
This update results in an expected adjusted earnings per share growth at the lower end of our long-term range.
And importantly, it is not reflective of any concerns with our core operations.
I will now turn to our operational and strategic update.
Our Medicare Advantage individual above market growth in 2021 of 11% can be in part contributed to our industry-leading quality and consumer satisfaction scores.
We are pleased to be recognized by CMS for having 97% of our members in 4-Star or higher rated contracts for 2022.
We also increased the number of contracts that received a 5-Star rating from one contract in 2021 to four contracts in 2022, the most in our history.
Excuse me participants, this is the operator.
Your conference will begin momentarily.
Please stay on hold until the conference begin.
Sorry for the technical glitch share.
Let me just -- just maybe just go back to our guidance update here and reinsure that investors understand the guidance and in addition how it reflects in the -- as we look at the future here.
First, the guidance reflects a much more conservative posture going into the final months of the year.
And notably $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022.
As a reminder, prior to the guidance update we had not recognized the COVID headwind in our 2021 guidance as many of our peers did.
Our adjusted earnings per share guidance has been above our long-term growth target at the midpoint throughout the year at 16% growth.
This update results an expected adjusted earnings per share growth at the lower end of our long-term range and is importantly does not reflect any concern with our core operations.
I will now turn to our operational and strategic update.
Our Medicare Advantage individual above market growth in 2021 of 11% can be in part attributed to our industry-leading quality and consumer satisfaction scores.
We are pleased to be recognized by CMS for having 97% of our members in 4-Star or higher contract for 2022.
We also increased the number of contracts that received a 5-Star rating from one contract in 2021 to four contracts in 2022, the most in our history.
And while CMS did make adjustments to the 2022 Star Ratings due to the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these adjustments had minimal impact on our ratings.
This further demonstrates our enterprisewide focus on quality, clinical outcomes and best-in-class customer service, which has been recognized from notable organizations such as Forrester, J.D. Power, and USAA.
Importantly, the Star's bonus allows us to maintain a strong value proposition for our members and provided value for supplemental benefits that address social determinants of health and other barriers not addressed by fee-for-service Medicare.
Looking ahead to 2022, we are pleased to be able to provide stable or enhanced benefits for the majority of our Medicare Advantage members.
Operating plans that support members whole health needs while continuing to deliver the human care our members have come to expect from us.
Our strong clinical and quality programs drive improved clinical outcomes and cost savings that allow our Medicare Advantage plans to continue to expand member benefits on those covered by fee-for-service Medicare.
Our plans include highly valuable extra benefits including dental, vision, hearing and over-the-counter medication allowance, transportation support, business program memberships and home delivered meals following an inpatient hospital set.
Over the last few years, we've made great progress in addressing social determinants of health and health equity by expanding our Medicare Advantage benefits.
Examples of those impactful areas include respite care distributing 1.5 million meals during COVID, sending fans to seniors with COPD during a heat wave and providing support for financial need impacting a senior's health and well-being.
Given the increased demand for health equity across America, we have aggressively expanded our efforts to address it.
We continue to advance our consumer segmentation efforts developing plans that are tailored to the unique needs of specific member populations.
This has allowed us to provide benefits that enhance and complement an individual's existing coverage through programs like Medicaid or entities such as Veterans Affairs.
This approach leads to disproportionate growth.
As you've seen in our D-SNP plans designed for dual eligible members where we have grown our membership approximately 40% in both 2022 and 2021.
We've expanded our D-SNP offerings for 2022 to cover nearly 65% of the dual eligible population nationally.
To reduce food and security, 97% of our members enrolled in our D-SNP plans, and we'll have a healthy foods cart, which provides a monthly allowance to purchase approved food and beverages at various national chains.
New for 2022, many of our D-SNP members will have reduced Part D drug co-pays as a result of the D-SNP prescription drug savings benefit, which will help address the financial barriers some members face when assessing needed prescriptions leading to better medication adherence, an important driver of member's health -- overall health outcomes.
As previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2022 bids recognizing the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and potential impacts to premium and claims assumption allowing us to prioritize long-term benefit stability for our members.
While it is early in the selling season we believe we struck the right balance and are competitively positioned for our continued growth in Medicare Advantage.
Our brand promise to deliver human care resonates with seniors given our comprehensive set of offerings and focus on providing a patient-centric experience based on their specific needs.
Susan will provide more detail and 2022 commentary in our remarks, including high level earnings per share and membership guidance.
I now would like to highlight the continued progress of our strategy through the build out of our healthcare service platform starting with Primary Care business and then moving to our Growing Home Solutions offerings.
We have the largest senior-focused, value based primary care organization in the country, which by year end will include approximately 200 clinics serving 300,000 patients across 24 markets in nine states.
We are accelerating organic and inorganic growth nationally and plan to open a total of 30 de novo senior focused centers in 2022, up from 24 in 2021.
This will include launching in two new major metropolitan areas, Dallas and Phoenix next year.
This faster pace expansion comes as we continue to gain conviction in our de novo center model with panel growth in centers launched in 2021 exceeding plan and clinical performance in our more mature markets continuing to improve.
At our more mature centers hospitalizations and ER visits are down 12% year-to-date versus 2019 pre-COVID Stars performance tracking to 4.5 Stars and NPS score of 90.
We will also continue to expand through inorganic growth completing seven acquisitions through the third quarter of this year bringing 21 newly, wholly owned centers to our portfolio.
We plan to continue this pace of acquisitions, focused on the markets where we have established presence to provide more access and high quality care to our patients.
Turning to the home, we completed the acquisition of Kindred at Home in the third quarter and now the largest home health and hospice organization in the nation.
As previously shared we will be migrating Kindred at Home to Humana's payor-agnostic healthcare service brand CenterWell.
Our efforts to transform home health to a value-based model come at a pivotal time for the industry.
As seniors increasingly choose Medicare Advantage, there is a meaningful opportunity for home health organizations to engage differently with patients and Medicare Advantage payers to more holistically address patient needs and improved health outcomes reduce the total cost of care for health plans and share appropriately in this value creation.
We've made substantial progress toward our goal of scaling and maturing a risk-bearing value-based model that manages the provision of home health, durable medical equipment and home infusion services.
With the acquisition of onehome earlier in 2021, a delegated post-acute management services organization for the home, we have the capabilities to be a value-based convener providing risk-based contracting and referral management and continue to develop technology enabling us to coordinate with other adjacent services.
These services include gap in care, closure, primary or emergent care in the home as well as coordination of meals, transportation and other services to positively support social determinants of health.
We currently care for approximately 270,000 Humana members under value-based home care models in South Florida and Southeast Texas where we have seen improved outcomes including emergency room usage being 100 basis points better than Humana's national average.
We now are focused on expanding to select markets in North Carolina and Virginia, which we've chose based on multiple criteria including market density, opportunity to significantly reduce home care expense and a robust Kindred at Home footprint.
We expect to begin the rollout in the second quarter of 2022 with the goal of covering nearly 50% of Humana Medicare Advantage members under this value-based home health model within the next five years.
We are excited about the continued progress of our strategy in the home, but consistent with our home health peers we recognize that the national nursing labor shortage poses a significant risk to the industry and we are taking proactive steps to address it as part of our well-developed integration process with Kindred at Home.
In some markets the nursing shortages resulting in inadequate capacity to meet demand, negatively impacting our ability to grow the top line.
We believe that Humana's CenterWell brand supported by our patient-centric culture will bolster recruiting and retention efforts for nurses.
We've seen increased nurse satisfaction and engagement in pilot markets where we have deployed value-based concepts, with voluntary nursing turnover improving nearly 10% among home health nurses in 2021.
In addition to unlock sufficient capacity to meet our growth goals, we are implementing broader operational improvements and benefit enhancements, while also making targeted investments in capacity constrained areas to enhance nurse recruiting and retention.
With respect to hospice, our intent remains to ultimately divest the majority interest in this portion of the asset.
As our experience has demonstrated, we can deliver desired experiences and outcomes for patients transitioning from restorative care to hospice through partnership models.
Since we closed the transaction in August we have continued to explore alternatives for the long-term ownership structure for the business and have initiated steps to reorganize the hospice business for stand-alone operations, while also ensuring business continuity and monitoring underlying trends.
We do not have a further update on the specific transaction structure or expected transaction timing, but we will provide additional updates as appropriate moving forward.
Given the continued expansion of an interest in our healthcare service platform we are committed to providing additional disclosure to give further transparency into the performance of these businesses beginning with our first quarter 2022 reporting.
Before closing, I want to touch on the current regulatory and legislative landscape.
As you know, last week, the White House and congressional leaders released their plan known as, Build Back Better, which includes several proposed changes to the Medicare program including establishing a hearing benefit starting in calendar year 2024, which will be included in the Medicare Advantage benchmark.
Given that today more than 40% of Medicare beneficiaries, over 27 million seniors and those with disabilities are enrolled in Medicare Advantage, we were encouraged to see that the package did not include any payment reductions to the program.
As this legislation continues to advance and likely be modified and as we look ahead to the annual CMS call letter and rate notice period, we will continue to work with policymakers and the Biden Administration to further improve Medicare Advantage building on the program's innovation and significant progress in areas like value-based care, social determinants of health, affordability and financial protection for beneficiaries, as well as reducing the total cost of care.
These attributes, along with a deep consumer popularity of Medicare Advantage are what have enabled it to have a strong bipartisan support with hundreds of members of Congress on record supporting the program.
With Medicare Advantage serving as a leading example of a successful private-public partnership, I am optimistic we can continue to lead on important healthcare issues facing both individuals and society, including addressing health and equities, improving health outcomes and expanding value-based care.
Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind resulting from our current view of utilization levels for the balance of the year.
I will now walk you through this detail starting with a reminder of our previous commentary.
As of our second quarter call, full year guidance assumed non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization was around 2.5% below baseline in the second half of the year, with a further assumption of minimal COVID testing and treatment costs for the same period.
In September 2021 as a result of the surge in COVID cases due to the Delta variant, we updated our commentary on full year guidance to indicate we expected non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization to be 5.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, while being partially offset by 3% of COVID costs, therefore, again assuming total utilization would be 2.5% below baseline in the back half of 2021.
What we've seen develop for the third quarter is that total utilization is running 1% below baseline versus the previously anticipated 2.5%.
COVID costs have been higher than initially anticipated as the Delta Variant resulted in hospitalization levels on par with what we experienced in January of 2021 and were overwhelmingly driven by the 20% of our Medicare Advantage members believed to be unvaccinated.
These higher-than-expected COVID costs were fully offset by non-COVID utilization in the quarter.
As COVID hospitalizations increased or decreased we continue to see an approximate 1-to-1 offset in non-COVID hospitalization levels.
We also continue to see significantly reduced non-inpatient utilization when surges occur, offsetting the higher average cost of COVID admission.
However, for the third quarter, in total we saw 1% incremental reduction in utilization beyond the level needed to offset COVID costs versus the 2.5% contemplated in our previous guide.
As a result, we have adjusted our full year guide to now reflect the fourth quarter running similarly with total Medicare Advantage utilization running 1% below baseline inclusive of estimated COVID costs, consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter.
We realized higher than expected positive current period claims development in Medicare Advantage in the third quarter as well as other operating outperformance largely mitigating the lower than anticipated depressed Medicare Advantage utilization allowing us to report results that were slightly favorable to The Street estimates.
Our revised guidance does not assume that the higher levels of favorable current period development seen in the third quarter will continue.
Taken together, our updated full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance takes a more conservative posture going into the final months of 2021, and it's important to note as we've consistently shared throughout the year the midpoint of our original guidance range of $21.50 remains the correct baseline for 2022 given our approach to pricing.
I will now briefly touch on operating results across our segments before sharing early thoughts on 2022 performance.
Our Medicare Advantage growth remains on track and consistent with previous expectations.
We have refined our full year individual Medicare Advantage membership guidance to up approximately 450,000 members consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance of up 425,000 to 475,000 members.
This outlook represents above market growth with an increase of 11.4% year-over-year.
Our Medicaid results continue to exceed initial expectations due to higher than anticipated membership increases, largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency.
We now expect to add 125,000 to 150,000 Medicaid members in 2021, up from our previous expectation of up 100,000 to 125,000 members.
Utilization trends continue to be favorable to initial expectations and the Medicaid team is working diligently toward a successful implementation in Ohio with Go Live anticipated in July.
In our Group and Specialty segment, fully insured medical results were impacted by higher than expected COVID costs in the quarter, while our Specialty business results continued to exceed expectations as utilization, particularly for dental services remained lower than previously anticipated.
Recall that our guidance as of second quarter did not contemplate significant COVID costs in the back half of the year and the Commercial business is not seeing the same level of utilization offset experienced in Medicare Advantage.
From a membership perspective, we have increased our expected Group medical membership losses from 100,00 to 125,000 reflecting the expectation of additional losses in the fourth quarter as a result of rating actions taken to account for the expected impact of COVID in 2022.
Finally, within our healthcare service of operations, the Pharmacy and Provider businesses continue to perform slightly better than expected with Pharmacy benefiting from increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and marketing campaigns and the Provider business seeing continued operating improvement at our more mature centers, which are now aligned under the same leadership in our de novo centers.
As Bruce mentioned in his remarks, we are actively integrating the Kindred at Home operations and results post integration have largely been in line with expectations.
Similar to Home Health and Hospice peers, the business is being impacted by COVID and labor shortages.
For the third quarter, home health admissions grew low single digits year-over-year, while hospice experienced a low single-digit decline year-over-year.
We will continue to closely monitor trends as we made targeted investments to sustainably improve the recruitment and retention of nurses.
Now, let me take a few moments to share an early outlook for 2022 starting with membership.
As you're aware, the overall PDP market continues to decline as more and more beneficiaries including dual eligibles choose Medicare Advantage.
In addition, as we've discussed previously, PDP plans have become a commodity with the low price leader capturing disproportionate growth.
Consistent with 2021 the Walmart Value Plan will offer competitive benefits but will not be the low premium leader in 2022.
As a result, we expect a net decline in PDP membership of a few hundred thousand members in 2022.
We continue to focus on creating enterprise value for our PDP plans by driving increased mail order penetration and conversions to Medicare Advantage.
With respect to Group Medicare Advantage, we expect membership to be generally flat for 2022 as we do not anticipate any large accounts will be gained or lost as we continue to maintain pricing discipline in a highly competitive market.
Moving to individual Medicare Advantage; as previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2020 bids, reflecting the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic.
We expect to grow our individual Medicare Advantage membership in a range of 325,000 to 375,000 members in 2022 or approximately 8% year-over-year reflective of our prudent approach we took to pricing for 2022 and the competitive nature of the market.
It is early in our AEP selling season and the outlook we are providing today could change depending on how sales and voluntary disenrollment ultimately commence.
And consistent with prior years we have very little member disenrollment data at this point in the AEP cycle.
I will now turn to our expected 2022 financial performance.
As previously mentioned, I want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original 2021 guide continues to be the appropriate jumping-off point for 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth given our approach to pricing.
In addition, we feel comfortable that the risk adjusted assumptions and our 2022 pricing are appropriate as providers have been actively engaging with our members to ensure their conditions are fully documented and that care plans are established to address gaps in care.
Provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnoses that we anticipate will impact 2022 revenue are approximately 92% complete to-date, in line with both our expectations for 2021 as well as the estimated completion rate for the same time period in 2019.
We also assumed medical costs will return to baseline levels reflecting a pre-COVID historical trending.
From an earnings perspective, we believe the conservative approach we took to 2020 pricing struck the appropriate balance between membership and earnings growth.
Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic we expect to enter the year with an appropriately conservative view of our initial 2022 financial outlook.
Accordingly, we anticipate that our initial earnings per share guidance will target the low end of our long-term growth range of 11% to 15%.
We expect that COVID will be net neutral to the Medicare business in 2022 as we do not anticipate a risk adjustment headwind and expect COVID utilization to be offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization.
However, our initial guide will allow for an explicit COVID-related headwinds that we can tolerate, should it emerge similar to the approach some of our peers took in 2021.
We believe entering the year with this more conservative approach is prudent in the current environment and sets the company up for success in 2022.
We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in early February.
In fairness to those waiting in the queue we ask that you limit yourself to one question.
Operator, please introduce the first caller.
","Humana reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for Q3 2021, surpassing consensus estimates. Despite strong underlying fundamentals, the company adjusted its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind of 1% below baseline in Q4. This adjustment is attributed to higher-than-anticipated COVID costs driven by hospitalizations, partially offset by favorable non-COVID utilization. The company also updated its individual Medicare Advantage membership growth guidance to 450,000 members for 2021, representing 11.4% growth. Looking ahead to 2022, Humana anticipates a conservative initial earnings per share guidance within the low end of its long-term growth range (11%-15%) and expects COVID to be net neutral to the Medicare business. The company remains committed to its healthcare service platform, including the ongoing integration of Kindred at Home, and plans to provide additional disclosure on the performance of these businesses in future reporting periods."
SWI_q3_2021.txt,"These statements are based on currently available information and assumptions, and we undertake no duty to update this information, except as required by law.
These statements are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the numerous risks related to the cyber incident and the recently completed spinoff of the N-able business.
Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website.
We completed the spin-off of the N-able business on July 19, 2021, and accordingly have included the results of the N-able business as discontinued operations for the current and historical periods.
Unless otherwise specified, when we refer to the financial measures, we will be referring to the non-GAAP financial measure.
We note also that because there was no impact of purchase accounting on revenue in the third quarter, our non-GAAP total revenue is equivalent to our GAAP total revenue in this period.
Going forward, we will begin to present certain financial measures on a GAAP basis only.
I hope you're doing well and staying safe.
As many of you know, we will hold our annual Analyst Day meeting on November 10, 2021.
During this virtual event, we look forward to then share our vision for SolarWinds and how we plan to retain, evolve, and grow to build an even more successful business.
As we move our discussion of financial and operational highlights for Q3, I've described our performance and continued progress.
I attribute the progress to the dedication of our Celerion, the relevance of our solutions to address our customer needs, and the commitment of our partners and customers to SolarWinds.
For the third quarter, we delivered revenue above the high end of the range of the outlook we provided with total revenue ending the quarter at $181.3 million.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $75.3 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, exceeding just the high end of our outlook.
As I outlined in the Q4 2020 earnings call, customer retention is a top priority in 2021, and we continue to make great progress toward this goal in Q3.
Our Q3 maintenance and annual rate of 88% was above the low to mid-80% renewal rate we noted we expected in 2021.
Customer retention remains a key priority.
And with our growing portfolio of offerings, we believe we have a great opportunity to continue to grow our LTV and net retention rates with our large customer base.
While we continue to be able to offer flexible pricing, purchasing options to our customers, we are increasing our focus on subscription bookings and we expect to continue to increase the mix of subscription in these upcoming quarters and years.
In Q3, our subscription revenue grew at a 20% year-over-year rate with subscription ARR growing 23% year over year.
Bart will provide more color on how this part of our business will trend in Q4 and beyond, given the skew that the SentryOne acquisition timing creates.
We have completed now the successful spin-off of the N-able business in July, and that has enabled us to plan and execute our stand-alone strategy, the details of which we look forward to sharing with you at Analyst Day.
Our global system integrator and enterprise motions are resulting in larger subscription deals.
Noteworthy here is that customers are investing in our entire solutions offering and taking advantage of our simplified packaging and the pricing.
We will also highlight our views on our [Inaudible] solutions potential to be a growth driver in the coming years through a comprehensive and differentiated approach to observability compared to the alternate.
Our product teams made significant progress in Q3, delivering these new elements within our solutions that are designed to drive additional value to our customers based on their evolving needs, including updates to our database and ITSM solutions as well as Secure by Design initiatives that impact our entire product portfolio.
We have also extended the breadth of our database monitoring portfolio's platform support, which now includes Google cloud extensions and added enhanced integration, including with Microsoft teams to our ITSM solutions.
Increasingly, our application, database, and ITSM offerings will become integral elements of SolarWinds' observability that -- as we create -- as we support customers of all sizes with their IT, Dev, and SecOps requirements.
We believe that this will help differentiate our offerings from all -- from those of the other vendors.
We are expanding our global partner engagement with events in various geographies.
The global partners, including GSIs, cloud service providers, and MSPs, are critical to expanding our GTM reach and to jointly deliver customer success.
Differentiated offerings with rich enablement, incentives, and a spirit of mutual accountability are the underpinnings of our partner strategy.
In September, we celebrated the Seventh Annual IT Professionals Day holiday, which was originally established by SolarWinds here in 2015.
IT Pro Day recognizes and celebrates all IT professionals and the contributions they make to their business every day.
As part of the celebration, we released findings from our IT Pro Day 2021 Survey, Bring It On, which then revealed IT [Inaudible] confidence and [Inaudible] in their roles.
We were also able to recognize four IT professionals nominated by their peers in our second annual IT Pro Day awards.
We also believe that IT professionals showed their true grit under challenging conditions this past year and deserve recognition and appreciation for their efforts, commitment, and resiliency.
We continue to attract excellent talent across all functions of our organization, and we are selectively adding our footprint in international regions, including most recently in South Korea and parts of our EMEA region.
I'll discuss our SolarWinds results on a stand-alone basis.
As most of you know, our spin of the N-able business happened earlier this quarter and was effective on July 19th.
Therefore, these results are reflected as discontinued operations in our third quarter financial results.
Also, a quick reminder that the guidance for the third quarter that I provided in August did not include any impact from N-able as the spin had been completed at that time.
Once again, our public filings will present N-able as discontinued operations in the third quarter as well as in prior periods for a much better comparability.
Our third quarter financial results reflect another quarter of improving execution while demonstrating the resiliency of our model.
That execution led to another quarter of better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter with total revenue ending at $181.3 million, above the high end of our total revenue outlook of about $176 million to $180 million.
For the third quarter of 2021, there was no impact of purchase accounting on revenue, so our non-GAAP total revenue is equivalent to our GAAP total revenue.
Total license and maintenance revenue was $149 million in the third quarter, which is a decrease of 6% from the prior year period.
The maintenance revenue was $120 million in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the prior year.
Our maintenance revenue has been impacted by a combination of year-over-year declines in license sales for the past eight quarters and a reduction in our renewal rate in 2021.
The trend of this lower license sales intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 and because of the introduction of subscriptions of our licensed products in Q2 of 2020 as well as the SUNBURST incident in December of 2020 as we focus more for our efforts on longer-term customer success and retention rather than maximizing near-term sales.
Although maintenance renewal rates have remained lower than historical levels since SUNBURST, we are encouraged by the fact that they have improved throughout the year.
Our expectation at the start of the year was that maintenance renewal rates this would be in the low to mid-80s.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our maintenance renewal rate is 89%.
Working with our customers had been a top priority this year.
Also consistent with recent quarters, we want to provide the in-quarter renewal rate for the third quarter, which currently stands at approximately 88%, which again is above our expectations at the start of the year.
For the third quarter, license revenue was $29.2 million, which represents a decline of approximately 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2020.
On-premises subscription sales resulted in an approximately 11-percentage-point headwind to license revenue for the quarter.
The remainder of the decline in license revenue reflects the combination of an impact of that cyber incident and the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
That said, our new license sales performance with commercial customers has improved sequentially each quarter during the year.
And while we have continued to sell to customers in the federal government and have had some key wins post-SUNBURST, new sales to customers in the federal space overall has been a challenge this year.
We have an incredibly committed federal team, who's now the primary focus has been on working with customers and maintaining the security and stability of their environment.
Moving to our subscription revenue.
Third quarter subscription revenue was $32.3 million, up the 20% year over year.
This increase is due to the additional subscription revenue from SentryOne products as well as increased sales of our on-premise subscriptions as part of our early efforts to shift more of our business to subscription.
Total ARR have reached approximately $624 million as of September 30, 2021, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9% and is up slightly from our ending Q2 2021 ARR balance of $621 million, which is the corrected amount included in our 8-K filing from earlier this month.
The growth in ARR is that primarily due to the incremental revenue of SentryOne, which we acquired late last year, and our efforts on sales of our products at on-premises subscription.
Our subscription ARR of $130.2 million increased 23% year over year and 9% sequentially from the second quarter.
So we finished the third quarter of 2021 with 786 customers that have spent more than $100,000 with us in the last 12 months, which is a 4% improvement over the previous year.
We are continuing our efforts will build larger relationships with our enterprise customers, which we will talk more about at our upcoming Analyst Day next month.
We delivered a solid quarter of our non-GAAP profitability.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $75.3 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, exceeding the high end of the outlook for the third quarter despite continuing to invest in our business.
Excluded from the adjusted EBITDA are onetime costs of approximately of the $2.9 million of cyber-related remediation, containment, investigation, and professional fees, net of insurance proceeds.
I do want to clarify that these cyber-related costs not included in adjusted EBITDA are onetime and nonrecurring.
They are separate and distinct from our Secure by Design initiatives, which are aimed at enhancing our IT security and supply chain process.
Costs related to our Secure by Design initiatives are and will remain part of the recurring cost structure as we go forward.
We expect onetime cyber-related cost to fluctuate in future quarters but to be less in future periods.
These onetime cyber costs are, however, difficult to predict.
They not only include the significant cost of the forensic investigation efforts we substantially in May but also costs associated with our ongoing litigation, government investigations, and any potential judgments or fines related and -- as well as related professional fees.
We expect our insurance coverage and offset a portion of these expenses and will be presented net of insurance proceeds.
Net leverage at September 30 was approximately 3.8 times our pro forma trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
We retained the full amount of the $1.9 billion in term debt that the company had at present.
During the third quarter, we completed a two for one reverse stock split and declared a dividend of $1.50 per share on this post-split basis, which was paid in August.
In addition, N-able repaid $325 million of inter-company debt.
As a result of this repayment, our cash balance is $709 million at the end of the third quarter, bringing our net debt to approximately $1.2 billion.
Our plan is to keep that cash of our balance sheet for the foreseeable future.
We believe we have favorable terms on our debt, so we intend to maintain flexibility as it relates to our cash on balance sheet.
Our debt matures in February of 2024 and we expect to revisit our level of gross debt as we get closer to that date.
I will then now walk you through our outlook before turning it back over to Sudhakar for some final thoughts.
We are providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share, and we will tell you what that means for a full year.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $180 million to $184 million, representing a year-over-year decline of negative 3% to negative 1%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million to $74 million, which also implies an approximately 40% adjusted EBITDA margin.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $0.25 to $0.26 per share, assuming an estimated 160.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding, which reflects the reverse stock split completed on July 30.
And finally, our outlook for the fourth quarter assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, and that we expect to pay approximately $8 million in cash taxes during the fourth quarter of 2021.
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $712 million to $716 million, representing a year-over-year decline of negative 1% to flat with prior year.
So our adjusted EBITDA for the full year is expected to be approximately $297 million to $299 million, which implies an approximately 42% adjusted EBITDA margin for the year.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $1.14 to $1.15 per share, assuming an estimated 160.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
As you think about the components of revenue in the fourth quarter, it is important to remember that we acquired SentryOne last year in late October.
We expect our subscription revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be in the high single digits.
However, looking ahead to 2022 and beyond, we intend to continue to expand our subscription offerings while turning new subscription sales a much higher priority with our sales team.
Based on what we've seen year-to-date, we expect that maintenance renewal rates will be in the high 80s for the fourth quarter and anticipate continued progress throughout 2022.
And in the near term, we expect the maintenance revenue will continue to be relatively flat to slightly down compared to prior year periods.
So as we think about EBITDA margins for the rest of the year and into 2022, the costs associated with our Secure by Design initiatives, investments in transitioning our product portfolio to a greater subscription mix and our continued investments in our sales and marketing initiatives are factored into the margins in the short term.
We anticipate that accelerating margins again in the future, but believe that these investments are now necessary.
We will talk more about these initiatives at the Analyst Day on November 10.
Our team's competence, commitment, and attitude continues to be on display as we delivered a strong Q3 performance, exceeding outlook in both total revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
We are executing our mission to help customers accelerate their business transformation via simple, powerful, and secure solutions for multi-cloud environments.
In Q3, we introduced an early adopter program of SolarWinds' observability to select customers.
These customers currently under maintenance has the great opportunity to make an early move to subscribe to our offerings and begin a journey to multi-cloud with SolarWinds as a strategic partner.
By eliminating customer complexity and meeting them where they currently are, we believe we are uniquely positioned to protect investments while increasing our relevance to them over time.
We expect this motion to become a mainstream activity in our upcoming quarters and a significant contributor to our subscription and ARR.
In Q4, we have continued to execute on the initiatives that I outlined during our Q4 2020 earnings call, focusing on customer retention and demonstrating ongoing progress in subscription, license, and maintenance growth across geographies and sectors.
We hope to see you all on November 10.
","In Q3, SolarWinds reported a revenue beat of $181.3 million, exceeding the high end of their outlook. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded expectations at $75.3 million, representing a 42% margin. Maintenance revenue remained a challenge, declining 6% year-over-year due to lower license sales and a reduced renewal rate. However, the renewal rate is improving, currently standing at 88%. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year, driven by SentryOne products and on-premise subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA margin reached 42%, despite ongoing investments in Secure by Design initiatives and sales and marketing. The company expects a high single-digit increase in subscription revenue in Q4. For the full year, SolarWinds estimates total revenue between $712 million and $716 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $297 million and $299 million. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $1.14 to $1.15 for the full year."
MTZ_q4_2020.txt,"Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of our underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual results may differ significantly from results expressed or implied in these communications.
In addition, when -- we may use certain non-GAAP financial measures in this conference call.
The format of the call will be open remarks and announcement by Jose followed by a financial review from George.
These discussions will be followed by a Q&A session and we expect the call to last about 60 minutes.
We had another great quarter and a lot of good things to talk about today.
Today I will be reviewing our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as providing my outlook for 2021 and the markets we serve.
And I hope in pray that you and your love ones are healthy and state.
The safety of our team members has been our top priority.
And as I reflect on the unprecedented challenges during 2020, I am incredibly proud of the men and women of MasTec.
Our operations have exhibited tremendous resiliency during the pandemic.
And as I look forward to 2021 and beyond, I am extremely excited about various significant growth opportunities as we provide critical power, communications and other infrastructure services to our customers.
I am honored and privileged to lead such a great group.
The men and women of MasTec are committed to the values of safety, environmental stewardship, integrity, honesty and in providing our customers a great quality project at the best value.
These traits have been recognized by our customers and it's because of our people's great work that we've been able to deliver these outstanding financial results in the challenging environment and position ourselves for continued growth and success.
Now some fourth quarter highlights.
Revenue was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $262 million, and fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.75.
For the full year, 2020 revenue was $6.3 billion, 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $810 million, and 2020 full year adjusted earnings per share was $5.11.
And finally, cash flow from operations for the year was $937 million a record level.
In summary, we had an excellent quarter and another great year.
On our third quarter call in October, we talked about our longer-term goals and our future business mix.
Considering the impacts of the pandemic on the oil and gas industries, we laid out a path to achieving an annual revenue target of $10 billion with double-digit margins.
One of our key highlights of 2020 and was our ability to grow non-oil and gas revenues by almost 12% and non-oil and gas adjusted EBITDA by over 40% despite the pandemic.
Our guidance that we provided today reflects continued diversification, as we expect our non-oil and gas business to grow approximately 20% in revenues and approximately 45% in EBITDA in 2021.
While we didn't lay out a time line for our $10 billion revenue target in the third quarter, the visibility within our end markets has continued to improve.
In just a matter of months since our last call, we believe the size and the scale of growth opportunities has significantly expanded.
I believe the recent events in Texas, demonstrates the need for significant investment in both infrastructure and continued power generation diversification.
We believe MasTec's diversification with capabilities in transmission grid and substation construction, power distribution maintenance, renewable construction including wind, solar, biofuels and battery storage coupled with our capabilities around gas-fired plant construction with its associated infrastructure uniquely positioned MasTec to benefit from continued and renewed investments in the power grid.
These opportunities coupled with the growing investments in communication networks from both large carriers and smaller rural focused operators provide MasTec with significant growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond.
In addition to our organic growth opportunities, we are seeing a growing number of potential acquisition targets.
Acquisitions over the years have been a source of significant growth for MasTec.
While we've been less active over the last few years, we believe the right companies can help us fully capture our current market opportunities.
Subsequent to year-end in the first quarter, we closed on two acquisitions.
The first company focuses on integrity work and maintenance work related to gas distribution and the second company is a fully integrated infrastructure contractor specializing in transportation projects.
Included in today's 2021 guidance, revenue contribution for these two companies is about $300 million.
In addition, we remain active and are focused primarily on clean energy, power grid services, telecommunications and infrastructure companies.
Now I'd like to cover some industry specifics.
Our communication revenue for the quarter was $569 million.
EBITDA margins came in better-than-expected at 11.1% and were up 300 basis points year-over-year.
For the year, revenues were $2.5 billion and margins were 10.7%, a 270 basis point improvement over last year.
Fourth quarter and second half of the year communication revenues were impacted by a slowdown of our largest two customers in this segment.
With the recent 5G spectrum auctions now complete, we expect revenue acceleration throughout 2021.
While the first quarter of 2021 will be sequentially similar, we are encouraged by our customers' capital plans discussed this earnings season.
A key highlight for us in 2020 was our ability to diversify our customer base within our Communications segment.
Comcast became MasTec's third largest customer in 2020 growing over 100% from 2019 and our T-Mobile business also grew significantly in 2020 with sequential growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 60%.
We're also very excited with recent developments with rural operators.
The rural digital opportunity fund or RDOF which is a follow-up to the Connect America Fund will provide $20 billion of funding over the next 10 years to build and connect gigabit broadband speeds in unserved rural areas.
Additionally in October of 2020, the FCC established the 5G fund for rural America which will provide up to $9 billion in funding over the next decade to bring 5G wireless broadband connectivity to rural America.
We entered the rural telecom space in 1997 through an acquisition and have been serving this customer base for nearly 25 years.
I believe we are entering one of the most exciting periods in the history of telecommunications and that the deployment of 5G wireless technologies and the associated networks is truly a game changer for the consumer, our customers and for MasTec.
Moving to our Electrical transmission segment, revenue was $126 million versus $116 million in last year's fourth quarter.
Margins decreased year-over-year and were impacted by poor performance on a particular project, which we expect to complete in the first quarter.
We have now begun one of the larger projects we had previously been awarded and expect a much better margin profile in 2021.
Backlog remained strong and improved both sequentially and year-over-year.
We are confident that we can deliver strong revenue growth this year.
Scale in this segment is important for us, as we strive to achieve double-digit margins.
We believe we are well positioned for 2021 and beyond as the drivers for this segment remain intact, which include aging infrastructure, reliability, renewable integration and system hardening.
Moving to our oil and gas pipeline segment, revenue was $600 million.
While we had nice sequential revenue growth, revenues were negatively impacted by the delayed start of some of our larger projects.
Margins for the quarter were again very strong and positively impacted by the reimbursement of delayed project idle equipment cost.
Without associated revenue, these reimbursements had a significant impact on margin.
Backlog in this segment is strong and we expect strong double-digit revenue growth in 2021.
On our third quarter call, we forecasted a longer-term recurring revenue target of $1.5 million to $2 billion a year, assuming a continued depressed oil and gas market.
As a reminder, over the last three years, less than 10% of our revenues have come from oil pipelines with the majority of our business being tied to natural gas.
We continue to see strong demand for integrity services, gas distribution and line replacement activity.
We are focused on continuing to diversify our revenues in this segment.
Moving to our Clean Energy and Infrastructure segment, revenue was $1.5 billion for the full year versus $1 billion in the prior year, a roughly 50% year-over-year increase.
More importantly, EBITDA margins for the year were 5.3%, a 140 basis point improvement over last year.
The size and scope of the opportunities we are seeing in this segment continues to grow.
While the segment has received a lot more attention over the last few quarters, I still think it's an underappreciated part of MasTec's portfolio.
With the new administration and a clear focus on clean energy, we have seen a significant increase in planned clean energy investments from both traditional customers as well as oil and gas companies that are trying to improve their carbon footprint.
For example, earlier this month, energy transfer announced the creation of an alternative energy group focused on renewable energy projects.
As a leading clean energy contractor and partner, MasTec is uniquely positioned to benefit from these investments.
I'd also like to highlight the diversification within our clean energy and infrastructure segment.
While we got our start and win, today we are capable of meeting any of our customers' demand.
While we've seen a significant demand uptick for solar and biofuels, we believe the recent Texas events will create even more demand for reliable baseload generation including gas-fired plants.
In the first quarter, unrelated to the events in Texas, we began construction on a gas-fired plant in Alabama that is replacing an existing coal plant.
This plant will be among the world's most fuel-efficient and lowest emission natural gas plants.
It is important to note that while this plant plans to run on natural gas, the turbine we are installing is capable of eventually burning a mixture of natural gas and green hydrogen, thereby establishing power generation flexibility.
This is another market that has tremendous potential for MasTec.
While George will cover 2021 guidance in detail, I'd like to highlight that our 2021 guidance reflects strong 24% revenue growth.
With all of our segments expected to approach double-digit top line increases when compared to last year.
We expect both revenues and EBITDA in 2021 to be at record levels.
To recap, we had another great year, while times can be challenging and uncertain, opportunities always arise from these challenges.
Our customers are looking for ways to change and improve their business models and are looking for strong partners to help them, in that lies our opportunity.
Our greatest strength has been to understand the trends in our industry and our customers' needs.
Our ability to provide services whether existing or new has always been a strength.
I'm excited for what the future holds for MasTec.
Keep up the good work.
Today I'll briefly cover our fourth quarter and annual 2020 financial results including cash flow, liquidity and capital structure as well as our initial guidance expectation for 2021.
As Mark indicated at the beginning of the call, our discussion of financial results and guidance will include non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA.
In summary, while fourth quarter 2020 revenue was slightly below our expectation at $1.63 billion, earnings margin exceeded our expectation with fourth quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA at $262 million or 16% of revenue, a 370 basis point increase when compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
This capped a strong year for MasTec, despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with annual 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $810 million and strong adjusted EBITDA margin rate of 12.8%, a 110 basis point improvement over last year.
It is worth noting, that 2020 results show significant strength and growth in our non-oil and gas segment results.
With 2020 revenue growing approximately $470 million or 12% and, 2020 adjusted EBITDA for these segments increasing $90 million or 43% when compared to 2019.
We expect this trend to continue and accelerate in 2021.
We ended 2020 with a new record level of cash flow from operations of $937 million this allowed us to reduce our net debt levels during 2020 by $481 million to approximately $880 million which equates to a book leverage ratio of just over one.
With this level representing one of the best leverage metrics ever recorded by MasTec.
In summary, our capital structure is in an extremely strong position, allowing us to fund any and all worthwhile future growth opportunities.
Now I will cover some detail regarding our 2020 segment results and guidance expectations for 2021.
Fourth quarter 2020 Communications segment revenue of $568 million decreased 16%, compared to the same period last year.
And this level was slightly below our expectation, primarily due to lower activity levels of Verizon One Fiber project activity.
Fourth quarter 2020 Communications segment adjusted EBITDA margin rate exceeded our expectation at 11.1% of revenue, a strong 310 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year.
Annual 2020 Communications segment revenue was approximately $2.5 billion with an adjusted EBITDA, at $270 million or 10.7% of revenue.
Annual 2020 adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased $61 million or 29%.
And adjusted EBITDA margin rate grew 270 basis points, when compared to 2019.
These increases were achieved despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which negatively impacted both, top line revenue and operating results.
Looking forward to 2021, we expect that annual Communications segment revenue will grow approaching a double-digit range and approximate $2.8 billion with continued 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin rate improvement approximating 75 basis points to 100 basis points over 2020 levels.
As Jose indicated in his remarks, the US Telecommunications market is rapidly evolving.
Trends include, multiple activities to support 5G development, including upcoming initial deployment of recently auctioned C band spectrum, expanding small cell deployments and necessary fiber backhaul investments.
It also includes, expanding fiber to the home deployments to support growing telecommuting and tele-learning initiatives that have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing 5G home deployments and upcoming high-speed Internet expansion into rural communities across the country to the rural digital opportunity fund.
We expect these trends will develop and accelerate over the course of 2021.
With a slow first quarter, in which, revenue will approximate our fourth quarter 2020 level, followed by increasing levels of year-over-year revenue growth each quarter thereafter.
Importantly, this ramping trend provides continued future revenue growth opportunities in 2022, as these trends are expressed over a full year period.
Fourth quarter 2020 clean energy and infrastructure or clean energy segment revenue was $345 million, generally in line with our expectation.
Annual 2020 clean energy revenue was $1.53 billion, an increase of $492 million or 48% compared to 2019.
Fourth quarter 2020 clean energy adjusted EBITDA was $11 million, or 3.2% of revenue and annual 2020 clean energy adjusted EBITDA was $80 million or 5.3% of revenue, generally in line with our expectation.
Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA rate fell slightly below the annual 2020 rate of 5.3%, primarily due to fixed costs on seasonally lower fourth quarter revenue.
At 5.3% of revenue annual, 2020 Clean Energy adjusted EBITDA margin rate increased 140 basis points compared to 2019.
Looking forward to 2021, we expect to continue to experience a very active bidding market in the Clean Energy and Infrastructure Space.
We anticipate that 2021 Clean Energy revenue will grow in the high 30% range and approach $2.1 billion in 2021, with continued 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin rate improvement of approximately 125 to 150 basis points over 2020 levels.
Fourth quarter 2020 oil and gas segment revenue was $600 million, a 30% sequential growth over the third quarter, representing the first 2020 quarterly period in which this segment exhibited revenue growth over 2019, as we initiated project activity on selected large projects that will extend into 2021.
That said, fourth quarter revenue was slightly below our expectation, as selected large project activity started later in the quarter due to regulatory delays.
Annual 2020 oil and gas segment revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion when compared to 2019, again due to regulatory delays in large project activity, as previously discussed.
Fourth quarter 2020 oil and gas adjusted EBITDA was $196 million or 33% of revenue and annual 2020 oil and gas adjusted EBITDA was $511 million, a $123 million decrease when compared to 2019.
Looking forward to 2021, we expect increased large project activity, continuing the project activity started in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We estimate that annual 2021 oil and gas segment revenue will grow in the 30% range and approach $2.4 billion, with virtually all this activity in backlog as of year-end 2020.
Given that a larger portion of 2021 oil and gas project activity is expected to be comprised of lower-margin cost-plus activity.
We are moderating our annual 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin rate expectation for this segment to the high teens range.
Fourth quarter 2020 electrical transmission segment revenue was $126 million, generally in line with our expectation.
And annual 2020 electrical transmission revenue was $506 million, a 22% increase over 2019.
Fourth quarter 2020 electrical transmission segment adjusted EBITDA margin rate was below our expectation at 0.6% of revenue, due to inefficiencies and delays on a project that is approximately 85% complete as of year-end 2020.
This project also impacted our annual 2020 electrical transmission segment adjusted EBITDA margin rate, which was 2.9% as compared to 7.1% in 2019.
Looking forward to 2021, we expect annual 2021 electrical transmission segment will show strong revenue growth, somewhere in the high-teens to low 20% range.
With 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin rate improving to the high-single-digits range.
We also believe end market trends in this segment will continue to develop and support future growth as clean energy power generation initiatives require significant transmission grid investment coupled with expanding storm and fire hardening grid needs.
Now I will discuss a summary of our top 10 largest customers for the annual 2020 period as a percentage of revenue.
AT&T revenue derived from wireless and wireline fiber services was approximately 14% and installed to the home services was approximately 4%.
On a combined basis, these three separate service offerings totaled approximately 18% of our total revenue.
As a reminder, it's important to note that these offerings while falling under one AT&T corporate umbrella are managed and budgeted independently within their organization, giving us diversification within that corporate universe.
Comcast, NextEra Energy, Crimean Highway pipeline and energy transfer affiliates were each at 5% of revenue.
Verizon, Xcel Energy, Duke Energy, Iberdrola Group and Enbridge were each at 4% of revenue.
Individual construction projects comprised 64% of our annual revenue with master service agreements comprising 36% and highlighting that we have a significant portion of our revenue derived on a recurring basis.
At year end 2020, our backlog was approximately $7.9 billion, a slight sequential increase compared to $7.7 billion as of the 2020 third quarter and a slight decrease compared to $8 billion as of year end 2019.
Lastly, as we've indicated for years, backlog can be lumpy as large contracts burn off each quarter and new large contract awards only come into backlog at a single point in time.
Now I will discuss our cash flow, liquidity, working capital usage, and capital investments.
For the year ended 2020, we generated a record level $937 million in cash flow from operations and ended the year with net debt of $880 million, which equates to a book leverage ratio of 1.1 times.
We ended 2020 with $423 million in cash on hand as well as record liquidity defined as cash plus borrowing availability of approximately $1.6 billion.
We are proud that annual 2020 cash flow from operations reached a new record level and that 2020 free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net cash capex, once again exceeded adjusted net income.
We believe this performance highlights the strength, resilience and consistency of MasTec's cash flow profile.
During 2020, we reduced our net debt levels by approximately $481 million while still investing approximately $170 million in share repurchases and strategic investments.
We ended 2020 with DSOs at 86 days down four days compared to 90 days last year and generally in line with our expected DSO range in the mid to high-80s.
As we begin 2021, our long-term capital structure is extremely solid with low interest rates, no significant near-term maturities and ample liquidity.
This combination gives us full flexibility to take advantage of any and all potential growth opportunities to maximize shareholder value.
Regarding our spending on equipment, annual 2020 net cash capex, defined as cash capex net of equipment disposals, was approximately $177 million and we incurred an additional $114 million in equipment purchase under finance leases.
We anticipate lower levels of capex spending in 2021 at approximately $100 million in net cash capex, with an additional $120 million to $140 million to be incurred under finance leases.
As we have previously indicated, as our end market operations shift, with non-oil and gas segments becoming a larger portion of our overall revenue, our capital spending profile should reduce as the Oil and gas segment has historically required the largest level of capital investment.
Moving on to our initial 2021 guidance.
We are projecting annual 2021 revenue of $7.8 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $875 million or 11.2% of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings of $5 per share.
As we have previously provided some color as to 2021 segment expectations, I will briefly cover some other guidance expectations as highlighted in our release yesterday.
We expect annual 2021 interest expense levels to approximate $58 million with this level including approximately $110 million of first quarter 2021 acquisitions, while excluding any potential additional M&A, strategic investments or share repurchase activity that may occur over the balance of 2021.
We expect to maintain a strong cash flow profile in 2021 with free cash flow once again exceeding 2021 adjusted net income despite expected working capital requirements related to our planned 24% revenue growth in 2021.
For modeling purposes, our estimate for 2021 share count is 74 million shares.
We expect annual 2021 depreciation expense to approximate 4.2% of revenue inclusive of first quarter 2021 M&A activity and capital additions.
Included in this expectation is an increased level of 2021 oil and gas segment depreciation expense when compared to 2020 as we are utilizing conservative depreciation life and salvage value estimates on recent capital additions to protect against potential market uncertainties.
We expect an annual 2021 other segment equity and earnings from our equity interest in Waha pipeline operations will approximate 2020's level.
We expect annual 2021 corporate segment adjusted EBITDA to be a net cost of approximately 1.1% of overall revenue.
We expect that net income attributable to non-controlling interest will approximate 2020 levels and cadence.
And lastly, we expect that annual 2021 adjusted income tax rate will approximate 25%.
Our first quarter 2021 revenue expectation is $1.65 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $172 million or 10.4% of revenue and earnings guidance at $0.80 per adjusted diluted share.
First quarter results typically represent our lowest earnings level of the year due to winter weather seasonality and a transition into new customer capital budgets.
Notable first quarter 2021 expectations include segment revenue levels expected to generally approximate fourth quarter 2020 levels with first quarter 2021 oil and gas segment revenue expected to significantly grow and approximate $600 million due to expanded cost plus project activity.
Our first quarter 2021 expectation also includes expected negative productivity impacts of recent winter weather storm disruptions across Texas and other parts of the country.
In terms of some additional color on the expected timing of 2021 consolidated revenue performance, we expect first half 2021 consolidated revenue to grow at a mid-teens growth rate with second half 2021 consolidated revenue growth rate accelerating to the high 20% to low 30% range and our annual 2021 revenue growth expectation is 24% over the prior year.
When modeling 2021 revenue, it is worth noting that oil and gas segment revenue after a strong 2021 first quarter will moderate during the 2021 second quarter and revenue during this period is expected to approximate second quarter 2020 levels as select large project activity slows due to spring season road frost bands before then accelerating again in the third quarter once work resumes.
Regarding our expected timing of 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin rate performance, we expect first half 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin rate will be in the high 10% range with second half 2021 adjusted EBIT margin rate in the high 11% range, with our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance at 11.2% of 2021 revenue.
","MasTec reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $262 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.75. Full-year 2020 revenue was $6.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA was $810 million, and adjusted earnings per share were $5.11. Notably, non-oil and gas revenues and EBITDA grew significantly in 2020, and this trend is expected to continue in 2021 with an estimated 20% revenue growth and 45% EBITDA growth. The company experienced strong performance in its Communications and Clean Energy segments, and expects double-digit revenue growth in all segments in 2021. MasTec has a record backlog of $7.9 billion and remains active in pursuing acquisitions to further drive growth. The guidance for 2021 reflects a strong 24% revenue growth, with revenues and EBITDA expected to reach record levels. The company also highlighted its commitment to clean energy investments and the opportunities arising from recent events in Texas."
SYK_q4_2020.txt,"For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Preston, with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions.
Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.
I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees as they work through the many challenges that we've faced during 2020.
Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world.
Our fourth quarter organic sales declined to roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections offset by a continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products.
We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership technique that we gain in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopaedics market.
Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly.
Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of a pandemic which combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019.
And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations which exceeded $3 billion for the full year.
In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities.
We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics, and enabling technology where we see a significant opportunity to create a companywide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako.
We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including neurovascular where we gained new product approvals across aspiration, stent retrievers, and flow-diverting stents, and in our MedSurg segment, where we continued product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention.
Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shifts to the outpatient setting.
Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides.
Turning to 2021, our people and culture of execution remain strong which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make healthcare better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leverage earnings.
My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts, and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and OrthoSensor.
During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in those regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December.
As a result, growth was uneven and correlated for the state of the pandemic in each region.
The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown.
Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China which grew double-digit over prior-year quarter.
Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence and they are working to bring back the procedures, but have been delayed.
But we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue during the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent.
This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales.
However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients while maintaining some level of elective surgeries.
In addition, the early trends on the launch of our new ProCuity bed are positive and expected to continue into 2021.
During the year, our Mako install base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter.
This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology, as well as our ongoing success selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs, and competitive accounts.
We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia, and Brazil which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies.
Turning to U.S. knee procedures.
In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees will make their knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase.
The shift toward cementless knees also continued and in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures.
During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products in businesses like joint replacement as surgeons worked to performing procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals.
However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021.
We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gain in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics, and enabling technology.
The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across to more than $3 billion extremities market.
The integration has been progressing well over the last few months.
The long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience.
To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization.
Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for trauma, upper extremities, and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer.
The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these three specialized business units has been announced and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned.
Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year.
Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business, and during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing in integration activities.
Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of OrthoSensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement.
Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopaedics and the addition of OrthoSensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology, including intraoperative sensors, wearables, and ultimately, smart implant.
As a release to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full-year guidance for sale, operating margin, and EPS.
Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year.
Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers.
Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter.
As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019.
Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales.
Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3.
However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, significantly impacted our sales momentum.
However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we have strong results in our Mako, medical beds, and emergency care products.
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products, and neurovascular products.
International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China, and Brazil.
Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8%, and an international decline of 2.1%.
2020 had one additional selling day compared to 2019 and for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales.
Our adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control, and a favorable operational tax rate.
Our fourth quarter earnings per share was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency.
Our full-year earnings per share was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year.
Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance.
Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S.
This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior-year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%.
Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement.
The Trauma and Extremities business also delivered positive growth led by our core trauma and shoulder products.
Internationally, orthopaedics declined 6% organically, which also reflects the COVID-19 related to procedural slowdown, especially in Europe.
This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada.
During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed.
For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis.
This included a positive performances other than U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle, as well as strong international growth led by Australia.
On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19 related slowdown in the second quarter.
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%.
In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management, and smoke evacuation products and its service business.
Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7% primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses offset by gains in the sports medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter.
The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7% reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care, and its Sage businesses.
Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in instruments and endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies.
Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%.
This growth reflects many strong performances within our neurotech product line including neuro-powered drills, SONOPET, and Neurovascular offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S.
Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2% as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter.
Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%.
This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan, and China.
Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter.
Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable approximately 120 basis points from the prior-year quarter.
Compared to the prior-year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix, and unabsorbed fixed cost, as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter.
This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange.
Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales.
Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior-year quarter by 200 basis points.
This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter.
These cover most of our discretionary spending including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings, and consultants.
In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis points improvement over the prior-year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed.
Related to other income and expense as compared to the prior-year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases, related to increases in our debt outstanding, related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition.
Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%.
Our full-year effective tax rate was 12.6%.
These rates reflect one-time operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity, combined with reduced U.S.-sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year.
For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year.
And we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $14 billion.
During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt.
Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion.
This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings.
Turning to cash flow for 2021.
We will not be repurchasing any shares and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million.
Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings, including the one -- excluding the one-time impacts from the Wright Medical integration, about 70% to 80%.
And now, I will provide 2021 guidance on a stand-alone legacy basis and further guidance including Wright Medical.
We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020.
As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on our organic sales growth and earnings and we'll update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls.
As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography, and will continue into the second quarter of 2021.
Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019.
As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical, there are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and one less when comparing to 2020.
Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%.
Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes two years of price reductions.
The foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and earnings per share will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019.
For the full year 2021, we do not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition.
However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019.
This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses, and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels.
Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year.
This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution, driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year.
While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022.
As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities, to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019.
This includes the integration of Stryker's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our Trauma and Extremities division.
This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by the synergies from the integration activities in 2021.
We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost-saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next three years.
And now, I will open up the call for Q&A.
","Stryker experienced a 1.1% organic sales decline in Q4 despite the impact of COVID-19. Mako installations grew 33% in 2020, highlighting strong demand for robotic technology. The Orthopaedics segment saw strong growth in Other Ortho (12.3%) and Neurotechnology and Spine (2.1%). The company's adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.81, a 12.9% increase year-over-year. Stryker also closed the Wright Medical acquisition, adding leadership in extremities and improving its product portfolio. Wright's comparable growth flatlined for the quarter, with a strong international performance. For 2021, Stryker projects organic sales growth of 8-10% compared to 2019, with adjusted EPS of $8.80-$9.20, including a $0.10 dilution from Wright Medical. Despite this dilution in 2021, Wright is expected to be accretive in 2022."
FCN_q1_2021.txt,"During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow.
To ensure our disclosures are consistent, these slides provide the same details as they have historically, and as I have said, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
With these formalities out of the way, I'm joined today by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer.
I was just checking to make sure I was on -- off mute for a change.
Let me start with a couple of words on COVID, even though I'm sure all of you, like I, are so sick of the topic and the issue.
For those of us in the U.S., I think we can sense at least the beginning of a change in mood.
At least for me, it's wonderful to see the rollout of vaccines, and no -- I don't know anybody who doesn't get incredibly excited when we see our friends or our family was getting vaccinated.
I think on the other hand, I think most of us know, the story is not as true every place around the world.
When I talk to colleagues on the continent of Europe, story feels somewhat aligned, but also somewhat different.
There's a lot of frustration about the slowness of the rollout of the vaccine, and it feels very different.
It felt very different last week when I talked with colleagues in Latin America and some colleagues in India.
If we look at the statistics, I think we see that global cases globally, total cases right now are actually at the highest levels we have ever seen -- the world has ever seen.
And of course, the rollout of the vaccine, though happening around the world, is happening at very different paces depending on where you sit.
So the good news, I think, is that we can all, at this point, see a light you can see that light at the end of the tunnel.
And I'm so excited for those of us for whom that light feels close.
I just want to also share -- say, mine and my colleagues, hearts and thoughts are also with all of those folks, within our firm and within yours for whom the light still feels further away.
Let me turn to a brighter subject, which is our quarter, our results.
It had some positive surprises in it and had some items that one can't count on recurring, which Ajay will talk about.
But even normalized for those, it was a terrific quarter.
I doubt very many people, 10 years ago or even a few years ago, would have thought that in a period where restructuring as an industry is down substantially, and our restructuring business is well off the peak that we saw last year that we would produce a halfway decent quarter but along a quarter like this.
But the quarter was spectacular.
Let me, however, say, something that we discussed many times, quarters are fickle.
Markets can fluctuate up and down.
Big jobs can come and go.
Cases can settle in continuously investments to drive future growth, although critical for the future can negatively impact quarters in the short term.
Quarters to me, as excited as you can be about a quarter are, in fact, never good measures of performance for this company, good quarter or bad quarters.
To me what is much more powerful than this quarter or any quarterly results is the strength of the longer-term trajectory that we have been on and that I believe we are on as well as the reasons for that grade trajectory.
Compared to 10 years ago -- forget the quarter.
Collectively, we have managed to build a business that is much more powerful, much more global, much more diverse than it ever has been.
And that's true for the company as a whole, but even within each segment.
Today, for example, our business, it's more powerful in restructuring than it ever has been, is also much broader, much more powerful, much breadth of experience and capabilities to serve our clients on a broader range of challenges and opportunities than ever.
Yes, it's powerful in restructuring but also in transactions, in the office of the CFO and so many other services, and you can say the same for all of our business segments.
The way we've gotten here is the basis for that, the terrific teams, reinvesting in our core, reinvesting behind our good businesses but also looking where our clients have needs and broadening our business, both our offerings and our geographical footprint.
Those actions and our collective commitment, the best behind great positions and great people, to me, have changed the fundamental trajectory and resilience for this company.
To me, we have shown over the past several years that if we do the right thing, if we do the right thing, if we commit to our -- position our business in a right way, if I support great people for long-term sustainable growth, though we can still have bad quarters, for any extended period of time, we control our destiny.
We control our destiny in a way that allows us to serve ever more our clients' most important needs across a wider range of circumstances, not just in things like restructuring but in antitrust, in major M&A and cybersecurity and SPACs and public affairs, in global cross-border investigations and it could go on.
And that to me, that growth and capabilities of our people, that ability to extend our firm to innovate is far more exciting and a much more durable basis for excitement and success than any, any given quarter's results.
So I'm not going to talk any more about the quarter, Ajay will.
It's been so frustrating to see that the light is there at the end of the tunnel, but see how slow it's been approaching in some places.
The emotional fortitude that our people have shown during this period that keep our company moving, to keep connected with each other, to remain supportive to each other, dedicated to our clients has been wonderful to see as the CEO but actually equally as much as just a human being.
I'm delighted to report year-over-year double-digit revenue growth this quarter.
On our last earnings call in February, we said that strong M&A activity would favorably impact our economic consulting, technology and strategic communications segments as well as our transactions business within our corporate finance and restructuring segment.
Conversely, we had also expected weakness in demand for our restructuring services.
Both trends occurred and were deeper than we anticipated.
And in Forensic and Litigation Consulting, or FLC, the segment which was most impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, we expected continued gradual improvement.
Instead in the quarter, results rebounded faster than we anticipated as we were able to resume work on many matters where trials were rescheduled or resumed, particularly in North America.
Obviously, we are very pleased with these results.
First quarter of 2021 revenues of $686.3 million were up $81.7 million or 13.5%.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.84, compared to $1.49 in the prior year quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included $2.3 million of noncash interest expense related to our convertible notes, which decreased earnings per share by $0.05.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.89, which excludes the noncash interest expense, compared to $1.53 in the prior year quarter.
Net income of $64.5 million, compared to $56.7 million in the prior year quarter.
This increase was due to higher operating profits in our economic consulting, FLC, and technology segments, which was partially offset by lower operating profits in corporate finance and restructuring.
SG&A of $126.5 million was 18.4% of revenues and compares to SG&A of $127 million or 21% of revenues in the first quarter of 2020.
SG&A was flat year over year, primarily because lower travel and entertainment expenses offset higher costs related to the increase in nonbillable headcount.
Double-digit revenue growth and flat SG&A expenses more than offset higher billable headcount-related costs, resulting in first-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $99.5 million, an increase of 19.5%, compared to $83.2 million in the prior year quarter.
Our first-quarter 2021 effective tax rate of 23.9%, compared to our tax rate of 22.5% in the first quarter of 2020.
For the balance of 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 23% and 26%.
Weighted average shares outstanding or WASO for Q1 of 35.1 million shares declined 3.1 million shares, compared to 38.2 million shares in the first-quarter 2020.
For the quarter, our convertible notes had a potential dilutive impact on earnings per share of approximately 450,000 shares in WASO, as our share price on average of $118.44 this past quarter was above the $101.38 conversion threshold.
Billable headcount at the end of the quarter increased by 562 professionals or 12.3%.
This increase is largely due to 34.9% billable headcount growth in corporate finance and restructuring, which includes both organic hiring as well as the addition of 151 billable professionals from the acquisition of Delta Partners in the third quarter of 2020.
Sequentially, billable headcount increased by 75 professionals or 1.5%.
Now turning to our performance at the segment level.
In corporate finance and restructuring, revenues of $226.2 million increased $18.5 million or 8.9% compared to the prior year quarter.
Acquisition-related revenues contributed $16 million in the quarter.
Excluding acquisition related, revenues were essentially flat, primarily because an increase in transaction-related revenues globally was offset by lower demand for restructuring services, particularly in North America.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $37.4 million or 16.6% of segment revenues, compared to $48.9 million or 23.6% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.
The year-over-year decrease in adjusted segment EBITDA was due to flat revenues with a 34.9% increase in billable headcount and related compensation expenses and a 10 percentage point decline in utilization.
Turning to forensic and litigation consulting, revenues of $150.8 million increased 2.2% compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand for health solutions and investigation services, which was partially offset by a $4.1 million decline in pass-through revenues and lower realized pricing for our data and analytics services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $29.4 million or 19.5% of segment revenues, compared to $21.2 million or 14.4% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.
The increase in adjusted segment EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues with higher utilization, coupled with a decline in SG&A expenses and direct costs, primarily related to the lower pass-through revenues.
Sequentially, FLC revenues increased $23.6 million or 18.6%, and adjusted segment EBITDA improved $21.8 million, reflecting increased demand across all of our core offerings, including previously backlogged work and a 9 percentage point increase in utilization.
Our economic consulting segment reported record revenues.
Revenues of $169.3 million were up 28.1%, compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues was due to higher demand for our non-M&A-related antitrust and M&A-related antitrust services, as well as higher realized pricing and demand for our international arbitration services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $26.6 million or 15.7% of segment revenues, compared to $12.7 million or 9.6% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.
The increase in adjusted segment EBITDA was due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by higher compensation related to an increase in variable compensation and a 9.9% increase in billable headcount.
In technology, we also had a record quarter.
Revenues increased 35.3% to $79.5 million compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues was due to a surge in demand for M&A-related second request services.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $21.6 million or 27.2% of segment revenues, compared to $14.5 million or 24.7% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.
The increase in adjusted segment EBITDA was due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in compensation.
Sequentially, Technology revenues increased $20.8 million or 35.5%, and adjusted segment EBITDA improved $11.4 million, primarily due to a large second request engagement.
Strategic communications revenues increased 3.7% to $60.5 million compared to the prior year quarter.
During the quarter, we experienced increased demand for our public affairs services, which was offset by a $2 million decline in pass-through revenues.
Adjusted segment EBITDA of $10.4 million or 17.2% of segment revenues, compared to $8.8 million or 15% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.
Increase in adjusted segment EBITDA was primarily due to lower SG&A expenses.
Let me now discuss a few cash flow -- few key cash flow and balance sheet items.
As is typical, we pay the bulk of our bonuses in the first quarter.
Net cash used in operating activities of $166.6 million, compared to $123.6 million in the prior year quarter.
The year-over-year increase in net cash used in operating activities was largely due to an increase in salaries related to headcount growth and higher annual bonus payments, which was partially offset by an increase in cash collected.
During the quarter, we spent $46.1 million to repurchase 421,725 shares at an average price per share of $109.37.
As of the end of the quarter, approximately $167.1 million remained available for stock repurchases under our current stock repurchase authorization.
Total debt net of cash of $252.8 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $143.2 million at March 31, 2020, and $21.3 million at December 31, 2020.
The sequential increase was primarily due to $170 million of net borrowings under our bank revolving credit facility to fund cash used in operating activities primarily for annual bonus payments.
Turning to guidance, first, let me remind you of the guidance for 2021 we provided in February.
Revenues of between $2.575 billion and $2.7 billion.
EPS of between $5.60 and $6.30.
And adjusted earnings per share of between $5.80 and $6.50.
I believe, at this juncture, it is important that I shared with you why we believe the exceptional strength we have demonstrated in Q1 may not necessarily repeat in subsequent quarters this year.
First, we are, for the most part, a fixed-cost business.
As people and real estate represent some of our largest expenditures, these costs are not variable in the short term.
So small shifts in revenues have a much larger impact positively or negatively on EPS.
Second, we are at our core a large job firm.
And when matters end, they may not immediately be replaced.
This quarter, for example, our results were boosted by several exceptionally large engagements that were driven by record levels of M&A activity that may not be sustained through the year.
In technology, for example, we had one engagement, which concluded during the quarter.
That represented over 20% of of total quarterly segment revenues.
In economic consulting as well, we have several large engagements that are expected to conclude during the year.
Even our restructuring revenue this quarter was boosted by revenue from large matters that began last year and have either now ended or will likely end this year.
Meanwhile, credit markets remain in an accommodative mode.
And hence, the number of stressed and distressed issues remain low.
Moody's now expects the trailing 12-month Speculative Grade Global Default Rate to fall to 3.2% by the end of the year, down from 6.8% forecast they provided in December.
And Fitch, which measures defaults by dollar volume now expects a high-yield default rate for the U.S. of 2% by year end.
These forecasts point to lower demand for our restructuring services for at least the balance of this year.
Third, this quarter, we were delighted by results in FLC, our business most negatively impacted by COVID in 2020.
That being said, with the continued uncertainty of the pandemic and certain geographies experiencing third and fourth waves of infections, we remain cautious as we may be impacted in certain locations by COVID-19 related court closures and travel restrictions, which can impact our ability to serve our clients.
Fourth, our nonbillable travel and entertainment expenses are typically around 1.5% of revenue.
At the moment, this expense is largely nonexistent as travel and entertainment is severely curtailed in most geographies.
Lastly, our fourth quarter is typically our weakest quarter with the holiday season and compensation true-ups at the end of the year.
In 2020, our fourth quarter results were exceptional, in part, because of the implementation of a cross-border tax strategy.
The more rational expectation would be for a seasonally weaker Q4 as many of our practitioners take well-earned vacations.
Now with all those risks considered, clearly, the great performance in Q1 gives us a very good headstart for achieving our guidance.
Once we have another quarter under our belt, at the end of the second quarter, we will revisit guidance, as is typical, to see if any changes are warranted.
Before I close, I want to reiterate a few key themes that underscore the attractiveness of our business.
First, we have demonstrated that we have a tremendous collection of businesses that make us a very resilient company.
We are uniquely positioned to support our clients as they navigate their most complex business challenges regardless of business cycle.
Second, more than ever, I am convinced that the key to our success is the strength of our people and their relationships, both of which are exceptionally strong.
Third, our leadership team is focused on driving growth through strong staff utilization.
And finally, our balance sheet is enviable.
And we have demonstrated the ability to boost shareholder value through share buybacks, debt reduction, organic growth, and acquisitions.
","Q1 2021 earnings saw a 13.5% increase in revenue to $686.3 million, with double-digit growth noted. Despite the expected decline in restructuring services, both forensic and litigation consulting (FLC) and economic consulting sectors saw notable rebounds. The adjusted earnings per share increased from $1.53 in Q1 2020 to $1.89 in Q1 2021, excluding noncash interest expenses related to convertible notes. Billable headcount grew by 12.3%, with a 34.9% increase in corporate finance and restructuring, and sequentially increased by 1.5%. While the strong performance in Q1 provides a positive start, the company cautions that such exceptional strength may not persist throughout the year due to factors such as fixed costs, the conclusion of large engagements, and ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19. Nevertheless, the company remains confident in its ability to meet its guidance and attributes its success to a diverse portfolio of businesses, a strong team, a focus on staff utilization, and a sound balance sheet."
TOL_q3_2021.txt,"I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter.
Demand continues to be very strong.
We are benefiting from our strategy of expanding our product lines, price points and geographies as we continue to grow the business, drive price, expand margins and improve our capital efficiency.
Home sales revenues of $2.23 billion were up 37% compared to the prior year period.
Adjusted gross margin of 25.6% was up 170 basis points compared to last year.
Both our pre-tax income of $303.4 million and our earnings per share of $1.87 more than doubled compared to last year.
We signed 3,154 net contracts for approximately $2.98 billion, up 11% in units and 35% in dollars compared to the prior year period.
These were third quarter records in both units and dollars.
In addition, our contracts per community at 10.2 were 20% above last year and our highest third quarter ever.
Our average selling price in the quarter was approximately $945,000, up $70,000 compared to the second quarter and up $163,000 year-over-year.
This increase in ASP shows the pricing power of our luxury business.
This strong demand has continued into our fourth quarter.
We've averaged over 300 non-binding deposits per week in the first three weeks of August, a pace that is consistent with May through July.
Not surprisingly, our deposits were down 15% compared to the same three weeks last August when demand surged following the lifting of COVID lockdowns.
However, compared to the same three weeks of August 2019, deposits were up 29%.
In some markets, demand still far outpaces supply, and we are limiting lot releases.
In other markets, we are seeing demand return to seasonal patterns.
I want to remind you that in summer and fall of 2020, we, along with the rest of the industry, experienced a historic surge in demand and sales.
From August 1 to September 15, 2020, the first half of our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, net signed contracts were up 110% in units, and for the full quarter, they were up 68%.
We knew these growth rates would be unsustainable, and as a result, we expect our fourth quarter contracts to be down compared to last year.
While year-over-year order declines may make headlines, they don't reflect the current state of this housing market, which remains very strong.
In the near term, our biggest challenge is managing industrywide supply and labor constraints that are extending delivery times.
In our third quarter, cycle times grew by about two weeks, pushing some anticipated third quarter deliveries into our fourth quarter.
This same pressure will apply to our fourth quarter.
During the third quarter and into the start of our fourth quarter, we raised prices in most of our communities.
Just this past Monday, we rolled out another nationwide price increase.
These increases have more than offset cost pressures we've experienced this year.
In light of the pricing embedded in our backlog and our focus on managing costs, we are confident that our gross margin in fiscal 2022 will significantly exceed the 25.6% margin we project for fiscal 2021's fourth quarter.
It is important to note that our customers are generally better positioned to absorb price increases due to their higher incomes, investment portfolios and the benefit of increased values in their existing homes.
In terms of demand across our markets, strength in the quarter was broad based across both geography and product type, with especially strong demand in our affordable luxury and active adult communities.
With our strategic expansion in the Sunbelt and Mountain states, we continue to benefit from migration out of higher-cost markets into more affordable markets, lessening the impact of affordability as prices have risen.
Our backlog at quarter-end was a record in both units and dollars.
Backlog was $9.4 billion on 10,661 units, up 55% in dollars and 40% in units compared to last year.
As we noted last quarter, we expect meaningful growth in revenue, gross margins, earnings and ROE in fiscal year 2022.
We reaffirm these expectations, including a return on beginning equity for fiscal 2022, well above 20%.
These expectations are driven not just by the strength of the housing market and our backlog, but also by the structural and permanent changes we have made to many aspects of our business, especially to how we acquire and develop land in a more capital-efficient manner.
We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for the housing market, which is supported by many factors, including the significant imbalance between the supply and demand of homes.
On the supply side, this imbalance is the result of a decade of underproduction of new homes.
On the demand side, millennials, who make up the largest generation of Americans, are forming families and entering their prime homebuying years.
We have also seen baby boomers and other active adults reenter the market.
Many older workers are accelerating their plans, moving now and working virtually in places they might have planned to move to a few years later.
Interest rates remain low, the resale market is tight, Americans have a much greater appreciation of home and the overall economy is improving.
We believe that all these factors will continue to contribute to strong and sustained demand for new homes in the years to come.
And we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities this market presents.
At quarter-end, we owned or optioned approximately 79,500 lots.
Our option lots represented 53% of our total lots controlled at third quarter end compared to 49% one quarter earlier and 43% one year ago.
We have already made significant progress in moving toward the 60% optioned and 40% owned goal we set last quarter.
This shift to more optioned land is a key part of our capital efficiency initiatives.
This land position provides the foundation for growth over the next several years, and we are currently benefiting from the significant percentage of our land that we acquired at lower pre-pandemic prices.
At quarter-end, we were selling from 314 active communities.
We continue to project growth to 340 communities at fiscal year-end and an additional 10% community count growth in fiscal 2022.
This guidance is based solely on land we already control today.
We also have the land under control today for meaningful further community count growth in fiscal year 2023.
Our strategic expansion into new markets, new product lines, new price points and especially the affordable luxury niche has positioned us well for growth and is contributing to improvements in both our gross margin and our ROE.
In fact, our affordable luxury homes are generating gross margins that are comparable to our luxury homes.
Affordable luxury comprised 44% of deliveries in the quarter ended July 31, up from 40% last year.
First-time homebuyers who are the primary buyers in our affordable luxury segment accounted for 29% of our deliveries this quarter compared to 27% one year ago.
Our affordable luxury product enables us to move into new markets and expand our presence in markets where we are already established.
These homes appeal to many millennials who are making their first home purchase and can be built up more quickly and efficiently and on less expensive land.
Just last week we announced the acquisition of StoryBook Homes in Las Vegas.
With about 550 owned and controlled lots, this acquisition allows us to quickly expand our affordable luxury offerings in the Las Vegas market.
StoryBook is a remarkably efficient builder, and we look forward to sharing lessons learned from its operations throughout the rest of our organization.
We continue to focus on additional ways to improve capital efficiency to bolster ROE.
Yesterday, we announced a new strategic partnership with Equity Residential, a world-class S&P 500 company focused on luxury apartment rentals to jointly acquire and develop sites into new rental apartment communities in key US markets of metro Boston, Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Orange County, Seattle and Dallas.
Over the next three years, we expect Equity Residential to invest 75% of the equity for each selected project with our apartment living unit investing the remaining 25%.
We expect these projects to be financed with approximately 60% leverage.
We are targeting an initial minimum co-investment of approximately $750 million in combined equity between the companies or nearly $1.9 billion in total capacity, assuming the 60% leverage.
We will act as managing member of each project, overseeing approvals, design and construction and will receive development, construction management and financing fees as well as a promoted interest upon the sale of each property.
Equity Residential receive fees for property management, leasing and marketing services, as well as construction oversight.
We've identified three land parcels that we already own to jump-start the venture.
The total anticipated cost of these three projects is approximately $242 million.
The ventures should allow us to develop more apartments with less capital, improving the capital efficiency of the apartment living business.
We also expect this venture to produce a more predictable stream of earnings from our apartment living business as we expect to sell each developed property at stabilization, in most cases to EQR.
We are very excited about this partnership with EQR and we hope we can expand on this relationship.
We are also looking at forming one or more additional programmatic relationships in markets and for products that are not covered by our agreement with EQR.
We expect that such a partnership would provide a similar capital efficient platform for the balance of the apartment living business.
Operationally, we had another great quarter.
Our production teams continued their solid performance as we managed through the labor and supply chain issues that have impacted homebuilders this year.
We delivered 2,597 homes at an average price of approximately $860,000, generating third quarter homebuilding revenue of $2.23 billion.
Deliveries were up 28% in units and 37% in dollars compared to one year ago.
We met our revenue projections due to a higher average price of deliveries than anticipated.
Our third quarter pre-tax income was $303.4 million compared to $151.9 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Net income was $234.9 million or $1.87 per share diluted compared to $114.8 million and $0.90 per share diluted one year ago.
Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 25.6% of revenues compared to 23.9% in fiscal year 2020's third quarter and 80 basis points better than projected.
The outperformance was due primarily to improved pricing power and favorable mix.
SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenue in the quarter was 10.5% or 110 basis points better than our guidance.
We attribute this primarily to lower than expected selling and marketing expenses as well as continuing and permanent overhead cost controls.
Joint venture, land sales and other income was $29 million in the third quarter compared to $3.6 million in the same quarter last year.
Our projection was approximately $20 million.
The outperformance was driven by better than expected results from our mortgage operations and our apartment living operations.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
We ended our third quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of liquidity, including $946 million of cash and approximately $1.8 billion available under our $1.9 billion revolving bank credit facility.
In the third quarter, we invested approximately $200 million in land acquisition and another $230 million in land development.
Due primarily to our focus on acquiring land more efficiently, our land and development spend is projected to be slightly lower in fiscal 2021 than what we spent two years ago in fiscal 2019 despite our significant growth since then.
These structural changes in how we acquire land are also permanent and are contributing to a significant increase in return on equity in 2022 and beyond.
We expect to generate $750 million in cash from operating activities in fiscal year 2021.
We will continue to use our cash to invest in the growth of our business, return cash to shareholders and further reduce our debt, including retiring $410 million of our 5.875% public notes that are due in February 2022.
We intend to call these bonds in our fourth quarter and retire them at par in mid-November 2021.
Our net debt to capital ratio stands at 33.1 at third quarter end, and we expect it to drop to the mid to upper 20% range at fiscal year-end.
During the quarter, we continued our program of returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
In our third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $57.66 for an aggregate amount of $95.4 million.
We expect to repurchase a similar amount in our fiscal fourth quarter.
In April we increased our quarterly dividend by 55% to $0.17 per share.
These actions reflect our confidence in our business and in the sustainability of our substantial cash flows moving forward.
Turning to fourth quarter and full year guidance.
Due to the production delays impacting our industry, we now we expect full year deliveries of approximately 10,100 homes compared to the midpoint of our previous guide of 10,300 homes.
These 200 deliveries, which are sold and have substantial deposits from our buyers, are now projected to settle in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
So we now project our fourth quarter deliveries to be approximately 3,450 homes.
We estimate an average delivered price for the fourth quarter of approximately $840,000 per home and approximately $830,000 for the full year.
This is an increase of $15,000 per home compared to our previous fiscal year guidance.
We are projecting a fourth quarter adjusted gross margin of 25.6% of revenues and a full fiscal year 2021 adjusted gross margin of 24.9%.
This is an increase of 30 basis points compared to our previous full year guidance.
Based on the composition of our backlog, we are confident that our full year fiscal 2022 adjusted gross margin will significantly exceed the 25.6% margin we are projecting for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Our confidence is based on several factors, the most significant of which is the higher prices that are embedded in our backlog, which is the result of the steady and significant price increases we've achieved over the year.
Demand is allowing us to continue to push price in most of our markets.
In addition, we are intensely focused on our construction budgets and managing building costs.
Like the entire industry, we are seeing cost pressures on material and labor.
We enjoy stronger relationships with our trade partners and have tremendous operating scale, which helps us to manage these costs.
We also continue to benefit from our long land position.
The land for most of the communities that we'll be delivering homes in fiscal 2022 was put under control prior to the pandemic at lower prices.
Turning back to guidance.
We expect interest and cost of sales to be approximately 2.3% of home sales revenues for the fourth quarter and full year.
This full year guidance is 20 basis points better year-over-year and reflects the impact of debt reductions made earlier this year.
We expect our interest expense to continue to decline in fiscal 2022 as we further reduce our leverage.
We expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 9.8% in the fourth quarter and 11.3% for the full year.
This full year guidance is 50 basis points better than previously projected.
As Doug mentioned, we expect community count to be 340 at fiscal year-end, with 10% growth from there by fiscal year 2022.
Our full year guidance for fiscal year 2021 other income, income from unconsolidated entities and land sales is now $140 million for the full year, with approximately $40 million projected for the fourth quarter.
This is a $30 million increase from our projection last quarter and is driven by more sales projected in our apartment living division.
Our third quarter tax rate was 22.6%, which includes approximately $12 million in energy tax credits.
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 26% and our full year guidance is 24.6%, 90 basis points better than our previous full year guidance.
Taking this all into account, we have increased our projected return on beginning equity for fiscal year 2021 to 15.9%, over 700 basis points better than fiscal 2020.
As Doug noted, we expected to exceed 20% in fiscal year 2022 and we believe our capital efficiency initiatives and the structural changes in our land acquisition strategy will keep it above 20% long-term.
They continue to demonstrate their dedication to taking care of each other and our customers, and for that, I am very grateful.
Now let me open it up to questions.
Andrea, ready to go.
","In the third quarter, the company experienced strong demand with home sales revenue of $2.23 billion, a 37% increase year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin rose to 25.6%, leading to a pre-tax income of $303.4 million and earnings per share of $1.87. Net contracts signed increased by 11% in units and 35% in dollars, setting third quarter records. The average selling price reached $945,000, a significant increase from the previous quarter and year. Demand has remained strong in the fourth quarter, with non-binding deposits averaging over 300 per week in the first three weeks of August. Despite anticipated order declines in the fourth quarter due to last year's surge in demand, the company remains bullish on the long-term housing market, citing factors such as supply-demand imbalance, low interest rates, and increasing demand from millennials and baby boomers. The company's backlog remains strong at $9.4 billion, up 55% year-over-year. Capital efficiency initiatives, including a shift to more optioned land, are contributing to improved margins. The company expects a return on beginning equity exceeding 15.9% in fiscal year 2021 and significantly above 20% in fiscal year 2022."
CMA_q1_2021.txt,"The year is off to a good start.
In the first quarter, we generated earnings of $2.43 per share, a 59% increase over the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong credit quality.
Our ROE grew to over 18% and our ROA was 1.68%.
I am pleased to report that we are hearing more optimism among our customers and colleagues across our markets.
Stimulus payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits, along with PPP loans to small- and medium-sized businesses have provided much needed relief to those that are struggling.
Also, the Infrastructure Bill that is being considered is expected to spread spending over many years.
This fiscal stimulus and the ramp up in the vaccine distribution, in combination with ample liquidity and low borrowing costs, has the potential to spur substantial activity.
The economic metrics are improving quickly and the outlook for the back half of the year is for strong economic growth.
As the economy continues to reopen and pre-pandemic conditions return, many businesses are beginning to experience accelerating activity.
I remain very proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and each other.
We've again stepped up our efforts to support those affected by the pandemic.
Last month, Comerica and the Comerica Charitable Foundation pledged approximately $16 million to support small businesses and communities impacted by COVID.
This support is in addition to the $11 million committed in 2020.
As you know, last year, we funded $3.9 billion in the first round of PPP loans.
Also, so far this year, through the hard work of colleagues across the Bank, we further assisted businesses by funding close to $1 billion in the second round of PPP.
In addition, in the first quarter, we processed over $600 million in PPP loan repayments, mainly through forgiveness.
Turning to our first quarter financial performance on Slide 4.
Compared to the fourth quarter, average loans decreased with seasonally lower home purchase volumes impacting our Mortgage Banker business.
Also, total line utilization across nearly all businesses have remained low.
However, our loan pipeline has continued to grow.
Average deposits increased over $1 billion to another all-time high as customers received additional stimulus payments.
Net interest income was impacted by $17 million in lease residual adjustments in an expiring legacy portfolio.
Excluding this impact, pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased 5% despite the shorter quarter and the decline in loan volume.
This increase in PPNR was due to continued robust fee generating activity in our expense discipline.
As far as credit, our conservative culture, diverse portfolio, as well as deep expertise has served us well.
Strong credit performance and an improvement in our economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of $182 million.
The credit reserve remains healthy at 1.59%.
Net charge-offs were only 3 basis points.
Through the cycles, our net charge-offs have typically been at or below our peer group average, including during the past year as we navigated the pandemic.
With more confidence in the economic recovery and an estimated CET1 ratio of 11.09%, we plan to restart share repurchases.
In the second quarter, we expect to make significant strides toward our 10% target, giving careful consideration to earnings generation, as well as capital needs to fund future loan growth.
Our ongoing goal is to provide an attractive return to our shareholders, which includes a dividend that currently has a yield of about 4%.
Turning to Slide 5, average loans decreased approximately $800 million.
As Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was Mortgage Banker, which declined from its record high in the fourth quarter due to lower purchase volumes.
Energy decreased as higher oil prices are resulting in improved cash flow and capital markets activity.
We had expected National Dealer loans would begin to rebound in the first quarter.
However, supply chain issues, most notably with computer chips have STIMI [Phonetic] production.
In addition, March auto sales were the second highest of all-time for that month, further depleting inventory.
Dealer loans were $1.5 billion below the first quarter of 2020.
We remain confident in the floor plan balances will eventually rebuild to historical levels.
Equity Fund Services was a bright spot, increasing over $200 million with strong fund formation.
Total period end loans reflected decreases of $900 million in Dealer and $700 million in Mortgage Banker.
Line utilization for the total portfolio declined to 47%.
We feel good about the pipeline, which now sits above pre-pandemic levels.
It increased to nearly every business line and loans in the last stage of the pipeline nearly doubled over the fourth quarter.
Ultimately, we would expect this to translate into loan growth.
As far as loan yields, there were $17 million in lease residual value adjustments, mostly on aircraft and an expiring legacy portfolio.
We have not done business in this segment for many years and no further adjustments are expected.
Excluding the 14 basis point impact from the residual adjustment, loan yields increased 3 basis points with the benefit of accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness.
Continued pricing actions, particularly adding rate floors when possible as loans renew, offset the decline in LIBOR.
Average deposits increased 2% or $1.1 billion to a new record as shown on Slide 6.
Consumer deposits increased nearly $1 billion, primarily due to seasonality and the additional stimulus received in January.
Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances.
With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 69%.
The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 8 basis points, a decrease of 3 basis points from the fourth quarter and our total funding cost fell to only 9 basis points.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio.
Period end balances are up modestly as we recently began to gradually deploy some of our excess liquidity by opportunistically increasing the size of the portfolio.
Lower rates on the replacement of about $1 billion in payments received during the quarter resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.89%.
Yields on repayments averaged approximately 235 basis points, while recent reinvestments have been in the low-180s.
We expect to mostly offset the yield pressure on MBS in the near term with a modestly larger portfolio.
However, maturing treasuries will likely be a slight headwind in the back half of the year, depending on the mix of MBS and treasuries we would likely replace them with, as well as market conditions.
Turning to Slide 8, excluding the impact of the lease residual adjustment and two fewer days in the quarter, net interest income was roughly stable and the net interest margin would have increased 2 basis points.
As far as the details, interest income on loans decreased $28 million and reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points.
This was primarily due to the $17 million of lease residual adjustments, which had a 9 basis point impact on the margin, as well as two fewer days in the quarter, which had a $7 million impact.
Lower loan balances had a $5 million impact and were partially offset by a $3 million increase in fees related to PPP loans.
Other portfolio dynamics had a $2 million unfavorable impact and included lower LIBOR, partially offset by pricing actions.
Lower securities yields, as I outlined in the previous slide, had a $2 million or 1 basis point negative impact.
Continued prudent management of deposit pricing added $3 million and 1 basis point to the margin and a reduction in wholesale funding added $1 million and 1 basis point.
Average balances of the Fed were relatively steady and remain extraordinarily high at $12.5 billion.
This continues to weigh heavily on the margin with the gross impact of approximately 41 basis points.
Credit quality was strong and metrics are moving in the right direction as shown on Slide 9.
Net charge-offs were only $3 million or 3 basis points.
Non-performing assets decreased $34 million and at 64 basis points of total loans, they are about only half of our 20-year average.
Inflows to non-accrual were also very low.
Criticized loans declined $366 million and comprised 5% of the total portfolio.
Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with growing confidence and improving economic forecast, resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses.
Of note, both the social distancing-related segments, as well as the Energy portfolio have performed better-than-expected.
However, we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to these areas.
Our total reserve ratio is very healthy at 1.59% or 1.72% excluding PPP loans and remains well above pre-pandemic levels.
Non-interest income increased $5 million as outlined in Slide 10, sustaining the positive trend we've seen for the past year.
Derivative income increased $11 million as volumes remain robust, particularly for energy hedges, combined with a $10 million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment.
Note that we have made a change in reporting, we have combined foreign exchange and customer derivative income, which was previously included in other non-interest income into a combined derivative income line item.
Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.
Warrants and investment banking fees moved higher and we had smaller increases in fiduciary and deposit service charges.
Partly offsetting this, commercial lending fees decreased $6 million with the seasonal decline in syndication activity.
Deferred comp asset returns were $3 million, a $6 million decrease from the fourth quarter and are offset in non-interest expenses.
Note, card fees remained elevated.
They were over 20% higher than a year ago due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment.
All in all, another strong quarter for fee income.
Turning to expenses on Slide 11, which decreased $18 million or 4%.
Starting with salaries and benefits, which were up $11 million due to seasonal factors.
This increase was driven by annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting.
Providing a partial offset was a decrease in deferred comp, as well as a reduction due to two fewer days in the quarter and seasonally lower staff insurance costs.
All other expenses decreased $29 million.
As discussed last quarter, strong investment performance in 2020 has resulted in an $8 million reduction in pension costs, which is included in other non-interest expense.
In addition, effective January 1, we adopted a change in the accounting method for our pension plan.
Previous quarters have been adjusted, specifically fourth quarter pension expense was reduced by $8 million.
This change also decreased AOCI and increased retained earnings at year-end by $104 million, which resulted in a 16 basis point increase to our CET1 ratio.
Finally, we realized seasonal decreases in advertising and occupancy, lower operating losses and FDIC expense, as well as smaller decreases in other categories.
Our strong expense discipline is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future.
Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 11.09% as shown on Slide 12.
As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders.
In this regard, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield.
As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital to shareholders.
With more confidence in the path of the economic recovery, we plan to resume share repurchases in the second quarter.
We expect to make significant strides toward our CET1 target of 10%.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter.
In addition, we have provided expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter outlook.
In the second quarter, excluding PPP loans, we expect loan volume to be stable.
We expect growth in several lines of business led by middle market as a result of increasing M&A, as well as working capital and capex needs.
However, this will be offset by continuing headwinds in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer and Energy.
In line with the MBA forecast, Mortgage Banker is expected to decline as refi volumes begin to cool with higher rates.
We expect National Dealer to continue to decrease as auto inventory levels are challenged by strong demand combined with supply issues.
Also, Energy loans are expected to remain on the current declining trend as higher oil prices are driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity.
As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict.
However, we believe loan forgiveness will pick up toward the end of the second quarter and the bulk should be repaid by year-end.
Excluding PPP loan activity, we believe loans should grow across nearly all business lines in the second half of the year.
This is based on our robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to strengthen.
We expect average deposits to remain strong with the second quarter benefiting from the latest federal stimulus.
These record levels are expected to wane in the back half of the year as customers start to put cash to work.
As far as net interest income, the $17 million lease residual adjustment we took in the first quarter will not recur.
That aside, all other factors, including PPP are expected to offset each other in the second quarter.
For example, headwinds from lower reinvestment yields on securities should be offset by a modestly larger portfolio.
As we move into the second half of the year, we expect pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be roughly offset by non-PPP loan growth.
In addition, lower PPP loan volume and accelerated fees are expected to be a headwind.
Of course, PPP activity is difficult to predict and may result in variability.
Credit quality is expected to remain strong.
Assuming the economy remains in the current path, we expect our allowance should move toward pre-pandemic levels.
We expect non-interest income in the second quarter to benefit from higher card fees driven by recent stimulus payments, as well as increased syndication fees following lower seasonal activity in the first quarter.
Also, we expect growth in fiduciary income reflecting annual tax-related activity and new business generation.
This growth is expected to be more than offset by a decline in derivatives and warrants income from elevated levels, as well as deferred comp, which is not assumed to repeat.
As we progress through the year, we believe customer-driven fee categories in general should grow with improving economic conditions.
However, card fees are expected to be a headwind as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity due to the absence of further individual stimulus payments.
We expect expenses to be stable in the second quarter.
Salary and benefit expenses are expected to decrease in the second quarter with lower stock comp, as well as lower payroll taxes, partly offset by annual merit and one additional day.
Offsetting this decrease, we expect a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees, as well as seasonally higher marketing and occupancy expenses.
As far as the second half of the year, by maintaining our focus on expenses, we expect to offset higher tech spend.
In addition, we expect increases in certain line items due to seasonality and revenue growth.
Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to restart share repurchases in the second quarter.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are off to a good start and we expect the economy will continue to improve throughout this year.
We believe firming manufacturing conditions, increasing business and consumer confidence, as well as pent-up demand will support strong economic growth.
It is hard to believe that just over a year ago we drastically changed the ways in which we work and live.
We have demonstrated the resilience of our business model as we embraced our core values and rose to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other.
Our success is anchored by our ability to provide our expertise and experience to build and solidify deep, enduring relationships, particularly during challenging times.
I'm extremely proud of the work our team has done to ensure we continue to deliver the same high-level of service.
We are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation, and our progress is demonstrated in our results as non-interest income has increased in each of the past four quarters.
Our robust card platform is a great example has helped position us for the recent and likely ongoing changes in customer behavior.
Also, our fiduciary business is growing with strong collaboration between Wealth Management, Commercial and Retail Bank divisions.
In February, we increased the breadth and scale of our Trust Alliance business through the acquisition of a small group with expertise in this area.
In addition, we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline.
Our technology investments are enhancing the customer and colleague experience, helping to attract and retain customers and improving colleague efficiency.
Finally, our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continue to serve us well.
These key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value.
","The company has generated strong earnings per share of $2.43 in the first quarter, primarily driven by improving credit quality. Strong credit performance and an improvement in the economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of $182 million. The economic metrics are improving quickly, and the outlook for the second half of the year is for strong economic growth. The company has a conservative culture, diverse portfolio, and deep expertise in credit, which has served them well. They have prudent management of deposit pricing, adding rate floors when possible as loans renew. The company also remains committed to maintaining strong expense discipline. Non-interest income has increased in each of the past four quarters, and the company has made technology investments to enhance the customer and colleague experience. The dividend yield is approximately 4%, and the company plans to restart share repurchases in the second quarter with a target of achieving 10% CET1."
VMI_q3_2021.txt,"Avner will review our financial performance and provide an outlook for the balance of 2021 with closing remarks from Steve.
This will be followed by Q&A.
A replay of today's call will be available for the next seven days.
It will also be read in full at the end of today's call.
Today, I would like to begin by sharing some opening comments and then provide a brief overview of the quarter.
Before I do that, I want to take a moment to recognize the contributions of Walter Scott, Jr., who served on our Board for more than 40 years and passed away late last month.
Walter was an incredible individual whose wisdom and leadership were critical to Valmont's success over the years.
His loss is felt deeply by those who knew him and the entire Omaha community.
Walter's counsel, kindness and mentorship will truly be missed by all of us at Valmont.
Moving on to the business.
Our strong performance this quarter, once again, demonstrated the solid demand across our businesses and the consistent execution of our growth strategies, even amid a challenging global environment.
Like most others, we have safety impacts of broad-based inflation, the COVID-19 Delta variant, and labor and supply chain disruptions.
Government mandated lockdowns in Australia and workforce quarantines in North America, including Mexico and the Southeast United States, impacted certain utility and coatings facilities.
Supply chain disruptions affect the timing of some shipments in our Irrigation and Solar businesses.
Despite this, we delivered a strong quarter of growth and profitability.
Our commercial and operations teams are managing exceptionally well through these unique dynamics of focus and perseverance, while continuing to prioritize employee safety and serve our customers.
I'm extremely proud of our team's execution throughout this year.
Record third quarter sales of $868.8 million increased more than 18% compared to last year.
Sales growth was realized in all segments led by higher pricing and strong broad-based market demand with particularly substantial sales growth in Irrigation.
Moving to the segments and starting with Utility.
Sales of $276.5 million grew slightly compared to last year.
A significantly higher pricing and higher volumes were mostly offset by renewable energy projects that did not repeat or that were pushed into future quarters due to customers' supply chain disruptions.
North American utilities have been increasing their planned investments in transmission and distribution projects, even exceeding recent years of higher capital spending.
Further, proposed capacity additions in the renewable energy sector are favorable demand drivers across our Utility business.
We see strong demand continuing, as both utilities and developers have been increasing their forecast of additional projects over the next several years to comply with mandates to increase renewable energy generation.
Moving to Engineered Support Structures.
Sales of $281.1 million increased 10% year-over-year, led by favorable pricing in all markets and sales growth of more than 25% in wireless communication products and components.
Pricing improvements across all product lines continued this quarter, and international markets are benefiting from higher stimulus and infrastructure investments, especially in Australia.
5G build-outs and significant investments by the major carriers are driving demand in our wireless communications business, providing a good line of sight into 2022.
Sales of $96.7 million grew 10% year-over-year, driven by higher pricing, improved general end market demand and sales from our greenfield facility in Pittsburgh.
Global sales of $240.3 million grew more than 72% year-over-year, with sales growth in all regions and higher sales of technology solutions.
In North America, sales grew nearly 55%, as strong market fundamentals and improved net farm income projections continue to positively impact farmer sentiment, generating very strong order flow.
International sales doubled year-over-year, led by solid demand in the Middle East and Africa, including the ongoing deliveries of the Egypt project and another record quarter of sales in Brazil.
Last quarter, we highlighted our acquisition of Prospera Technologies.
Integration is going well, and we are making substantial progress building on our new strategy to grow recurring revenue services.
We are on track to meet the financial targets that we shared last quarter and look forward to sharing progress toward these goals in the future.
In Irrigation, we have a unique market advantage due to our global footprint and highly differentiated AI solutions, both are critical components of our growth strategy.
Over the past year, we have been increasing opportunities for local manufacturing in the markets we serve, especially in light of the challenging supply chain environment, labor availability and higher freight costs.
For example, we recently localized some of our electronics assembly in Dubai facility and are increasing the total capacity in our Brazil factory by 50%, positioning us for long-term international market growth, while we continue enhancing service to our dealers and customers.
We are also very pleased that our Irrigation backlog at the end of the third quarter was $388 million, up 26% year-over-year.
Turning to slide five we've said before, ESG is embedded into the core of our company's purpose, and there are many ways of products and services to serve resources and improve life.
One recent example of this is using Solar solutions to transform the Sudan desert into a prosperous and sustainable region for agricultural production.
Sudan is the third largest country in the African continent.
Agriculture is quickly becoming its primary economic driver, accounting for 40% of the nation's GDP and employing close to 80% of the local workforce.
But arid conditions and a lack of direct access to electricity in the region are hindering its expansion.
To help overcome these challenges, our Valmont Solar team recently installed a PV plant to bring power to center pivots.
Sunlight is captured and transformed immediately into electricity, eliminating the need for a battery or secondary energy source.
We're proud to have initiated this project powering pivots by solar energy, 100% independent from the grid.
Our innovative solutions are leading the way, precision agriculture in Sudan, opening doors to other solutions that will enhance productivity, empower local communities to solve food security issues, and help build a more sustainable world.
Turning to slide seven, and third quarter results.
Operating income of $80.4 million or 9.3% of sales grew 20% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes in Irrigation and favorable pricing, notably in Engineered Support Structures.
Diluted earnings per share of $2.57 grew 30% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher operating income and a more favorable tax rate of 23.5%, which was realized through the execution of certain tax planning strategies.
Turning to the segments.
On slide eight, in Utility Support Structures, operating income of $24.6 million or 8.9% of sales decreased 170 basis points compared to last year.
Raw material costs continued to increase during the quarter, impacting our ability to fully recover cost to our pricing mechanism, leading to lower-than-expected margin.
Also the impact of workforce quarantine in a few North American facilities led to operational inefficiencies, which we do not expect to repeat.
Moving to slide nine.
In Engineered Support Structures, operating income increased to $34.4 million or 12.2% of sales, a third quarter record.
The benefits of proactive pricing actions have more than offset the impact of continued rapid cost inflation, better fixed cost leverage, including SG&A, also contributed to positive results.
Turning to slide 10.
In the Coatings segment, operating income of $12.5 million or 12.9% of sales decreased 270 basis points year-over-year.
Profitability was impacted by a lag in pricing to recover higher inflation costs, including raw material and labor and start-up costs at the Pittsburgh facility.
Moving to slide 11.
In the Irrigation segment, operating income of $32 million, more than doubled compared to last year, and operating margin of 13.3% of sales improved 270 basis points year-over-year.
Significantly higher volumes and favorable pricing were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses from the recent Prospera acquisition.
We're also extremely pleased with the profitability of our industrial tubing business and international margin improvement led by consistent and proactive pricing actions taken by our global team.
Turning to cash flow on slide 12.
Year-to-date, we have delivered operating cash flows of $62 million, with the use of cash this quarter of $8.4 million that reflects higher working capital levels to support strong sales growth.
As we stated in our prior quarters, rapid raw material inflation creates short-term impact on cash flow.
For the balance of the year, we expect inventory levels to remain elevated to help mitigate supply chain disruption and strategically secures raw material availability to support strong sales growth.
Accounts receivable will also increase in line with sales growth.
As our historical results have shown, we will see improvements in working capital as inflation subsides.
Turning to slide 13 for a summary of capital deployment.
Year-to-date capital spending of $81 million includes $33 million for strategic growth investments and $55 million of capital was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with approximately $170 million of cash.
Moving on to slide 14.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
Based on our recently amended revolving credit facility, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 1.85 times remains within our desired range of 1.5 to 2.5 times.
We're increasing our earnings expectations for fiscal 2021 by narrowing the earnings per share guidance range to $10.60 to $11.10.
This reflects strong market demand and our solid execution this year and our confidence in our ability to continue this performance.
Turning to our segment outlook on slide 16.
In Utility Support Structures, we expect operating margins to improve sequentially as pricing becomes more aligned with steel cost inflation.
Moving to Engineered Support Structures.
We expect continued stable market condition in North American transportation market and order rates are beginning to improve.
Demand for wireless communication products and components remains very strong, and we are on track to grow sales 15% to 20%, in line with expected market growth.
We remained focused on pricing actions and providing value to our customers.
We now expect sales to grow 50% to 53% this year based on strength in global underlying ag fundamentals and a strong global backlog.
Looking ahead to 2022, strong market demand across our businesses, the strength and flexibility of our global teams and our continued pricing strategies give us confidence in achieving sales growth of 7% to 12%, and earnings-per-share growth of 13% to 15% in line with the three- to five-year growth targets that we have communicated at our Investor Day in May.
Turning to slide 17.
The long-term drivers of our businesses remain solid as evidenced by our record global backlog of more than $1.5 billion, up 35% from year-end 2020.
These demand drivers are in place to sustain this momentum into 2022, and our business portfolio is well positioned for growth.
We also continue to take pricing actions across our businesses where needed.
Like others, we are closely monitoring inflation, supply chain disruptions and COVID.
We are ready to take additional appropriate actions to address these issues across all our businesses, as needed.
Meanwhile, our focus on following state and local regulations to keep our employees and customers safe is not wavered.
Turning to slide 18.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results and our team's ability to navigate through challenging market dynamics.
We've demonstrated our ability to grow sales through innovation and execution, while being flexible and responding quickly to meet customer needs.
We've improved operating margins by executing on our pricing strategies and advancing operational excellence across our footprint.
And we have invested in our employees and technology to drive new products and services and build upon the strength of our operations.
Throughout 2021, we have been disciplined in allocating capital to high-growth strategic investments, while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Looking ahead to 2022, we are confident in our plan to deliver the outlook that we have communicated and remain focused on execution and our ESG principles to build upon our success, while creating additional stakeholder value and improving a return on investor capital.
","Valmont delivered a strong third quarter with record sales of $868.8 million, marking an 18% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven by higher pricing and broad-based market demand, particularly in the Irrigation segment. Despite supply chain disruptions and labor challenges, the company's commercial and operations teams navigated the market dynamics effectively. Operating income increased by 20%, with sales growth in all segments. The Utility segment saw sales growth of 10%, driven by favorable pricing and surging demand for 5G products. International Irrigation sales doubled, led by strong demand in the Middle East and Africa. Adjusted earnings per share reached $2.57, representing a 30% growth. Valmont raised its fiscal 2021 earnings guidance to $10.60-$11.10 per share. The company remains confident in achieving sales growth of 7%-12% and earnings per share growth of 13%-15% in 2022, supported by a strong backlog of over $1.5 billion."
SKT_q3_2021.txt,"This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors.
We direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations or FFO, core FFO, same-center net operating income, adjusted EBITDA and net debt.
As such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, November 2, 2021.
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.
We request that everyone ask only one question and one follow-up to allow as many of you as possible to ask questions.
If time permits, we are happy for you to requeue for additional questions.
On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We had a great quarter as a result of improvements in occupancy, rent spreads and sales.
These all contributed to earnings, which exceeded our expectations, and an increase in our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Our proactive capital market success has also positioned us well with low leverage, ample liquidity and exciting potential growth opportunities.
I'm proud of the tireless efforts of the entire Tanger team who are successfully delivering our strategic objectives.
We delivered strong performance in the third quarter and the continued momentum we are demonstrating across our portfolio supports our decision to increase our guidance for the year.
The successful execution of our strategic plan is evident across all of our key metrics, including occupancy, rent spreads, tenant sales and our focus on driving non-rental revenues, all of which continue to contribute to core FFO growth.
Our portfolio occupancy has returned to pre-pandemic levels, despite having recaptured over 1 million square feet due to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings since the beginning of 2020.
This includes 55,000 square feet recaptured in the third quarter as anticipated.
As of September 30, occupancy was 94.3%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 130 basis points since the end of the second quarter.
With regard to rent spreads, we continue to see positive momentum for leases that commenced in the 12 months ended September 30.
Blended average rates improved by 240 basis points on a cash basis compared to the 12 months ended June 30.
Spreads have improved each quarter this year and we believe that the continued improvement we are seeing in traffic and sales will help sustain this trend.
We also benefited from significant percentage rental growth this quarter, which was more than 2.5 times the comparable 2019 period.
During the height of the pandemic, we renegotiated select leases with an aim to trade value for value, in some cases, trading base rent for a larger variable rent component.
In many cases, reducing break points and increasing variable rent pay rates are now producing total rents that exceed the prior contractual fixed rents.
Our rent spreads don't capture percentage rent contributions as spreads measure the change in base rent and common area charges only, but the strong variable rent component has contributed to our core FFO growth.
Additionally, as we continue to negotiate renewals on these leases, we are focused on converting some of the variable upside into base rents, which provide longer term certainty.
In light of the improving trends, we are being strategic in our renewal and permanent leasing activity.
Renewals executed or in process represented 68% of the space scheduled to expire during the year compared to 72% at this time last year.
Traffic for the quarter was approximately 99% of the same period in 2019.
We saw a slight downturn in August, in part, due to concerns over the Delta variant and the timing of Labor Day, but September traffic returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Tenant sales accelerated in the quarter, reaching an all-time high of $448 per square foot for the consolidated portfolio for the 12 months ended September 30, representing an increase of more than 13% over the comparable 2019 period.
The key objective underlying our leasing strategy is to maximize NOI.
While shorter-term leasing will continue to be a strategy, our goal is to convert this space to permanent deals over time as conditions improve, retaining the current tenant with higher rent or repopulating the space.
We also continue to focus on growing our non-apparel and footwear tenant base and have added multiple new brands and categories to our portfolio this quarter.
Key categories include furniture and home goods and wellness and beauty.
We have also focused on growing our food offerings, adding numerous sit-down, quick serve and grab-and-go concepts across our portfolio and we are growing the presence of entertainment stores, kiosks and amenities aimed to driving shopper visits, frequency, dwell time and ultimately larger spend.
These new uses are presenting both on-center and in our outparcel and peripheral real estate.
We are seeing traction with non-rental revenues.
This is an area with growth opportunity as it is still in the early stages as a focus for Tanger.
Marketing partnerships in the form of sponsored onsite events, activations and advertising provide an opportunity for retailers to interact and communicate with the tens of millions of customers that shop at our centers annually.
And our Labor Day Block Party activations, for example, was sponsored by international brands such as Unilever, Tesla and Heineken, and we are planning similar events in the fourth quarter around holiday themes and tree lightings.
Events like these not only improve traffic and dwell time, but also generate revenue.
This revenue is captured in the other revenues line, which for the third quarter has doubled the contribution from 2020 and increased 38% over 2019.
This has proven to be a profitable initiative with plenty of additional opportunity and we plan to grow this program across our portfolio.
Our digital channels, including our website app and social channels, complement our on-center experience and help to attract new customers, particularly in young demographics.
Activations and shopper amenities such as Virtual Shopper and our web-hosted flash sales continue to engage and draw a younger consumer, while providing an omnichannel experience for our core shopper base and important Tanger Club members.
Our Tanger Fashion Director is leading these programs and will continue to do so for us through the holiday season.
As we look ahead to holiday shopping, we are encouraged.
In partnership with our retailers, we are starting early.
Holidays began at Tanger on November 1 and we are underway running campaigns, programs and events to encourage early shopping.
Many retailers across the country are facing potential logistics and staffing issues but are proactively navigating the situation.
Although the impact of labor and supply chain is unknown, we are optimistic with regard to our ability to deliver an exciting and fulfilling holiday experience to our customers and guests.
In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic plan, focus on our core business, and create value by unlocking new revenue opportunities across our portfolio.
We are enthusiastic with our positive leasing momentum and are encouraged by the new brands and categories we are adding to our centers.
We are innovating and reaching our shoppers where they want to be, offering additional ways to engage and interact with new products and to shop.
We continue to see traffic, sales, leasing and business development results improve.
We're on a clear path to sustained same-center NOI growth and, along with our new long-term growth initiatives and operational efficiencies, we believe we have a compelling opportunity to create value over time.
We delivered strong third quarter results showing continued positive momentum.
Third quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.47 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
Core FFO for the third quarter of 2021 excludes a charge of $34 million or $0.31 per share for the early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of our 2023 and 2024 bonds.
Same-center NOI for the consolidated portfolio increased 11.5% for the quarter to $73.8 million, driven by better than expected rebound in variable rents and other revenues.
We remain on track with rent collections and, through October 29, had collected approximately 98% of 2020 deferred rents due by the end of the third quarter.
The strategy we employed during the pandemic of deferring rent has proven to be effective.
With regard to our ATM program, we did not sell any additional equity during the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we have sold 10 million shares generating proceeds of approximately $187 million and $60 million remains available under our current authorization.
As previously announced, in July, we amended our unsecured lines of credit and extended the maturity date to July 2026, including extension options.
The lines have a borrowing capacity of $520 million with an accordion feature to increase borrowing capacity to $1.2 billion.
Additionally, in August, we completed a public offering of $400 million of senior notes at a rate of 2.75%, the lowest coupon in Tanger history.
We used the proceeds from the sale to redeem the $100 million that was outstanding on our 3.875% notes due in 2023 and the $250 million that was outstanding on our 3.75% notes due in 2024.
We also incurred a $31.9 million make-whole premium in September related to these redemptions.
As of quarter end, we had no significant debt maturities until April 2024.
Our leverage position has continued to improve in conjunction with our capital markets activity and earnings growth.
As of September 30, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.3 times for the trailing 12 months compared to 7.2 times for the comparable 12-month period of the prior year.
We have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position and a disciplined and prudent approach to capital allocation.
Our Board will continue to evaluate dividend distributions alongside earnings growth and taxable income distribution requirements.
Our priority uses of capital are investing in our portfolio to grow in a way and evaluating selective external growth opportunities.
Turning to guidance for the remainder of the year.
We are increasing our core FFO to a range of $1.67 to $1.71 per share from the prior range of $1.52 and $1.59, an increase of 9% at the midpoint.
This guidance reflects continued sequential improvement in our business, particularly higher variable rents achieved in the third quarter.
Our guidance also includes up to 50,000 [Phonetic] square feet related to the potential additional bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings that could occur for the remainder of the year.
For additional details on our key assumptions, please see our release issued last night.
Operator, can we take our first question?
","During Q3 2021, Tanger Outlets performed well, with occupancy returning to pre-pandemic levels (94.3%) and rent spreads improving on a cash basis by 240 basis points year-over-year. Tenant sales reached a new high of $448 per square foot, an increase of 13% over the same period in 2019. The company's focus on non-apparel and footwear tenant diversification and non-rental revenue growth is paying off, with categories like furniture, home goods, wellness, and beauty adding to the portfolio. Marketing partnerships and onsite events have doubled revenue from 2020 and increased by 38% compared to 2019. Core FFO per share for the quarter was $0.47, excluding a charge for debt extinguishment, and the company raised its guidance for the year to a range of $1.67 to $1.71 per share, reflecting improved variable rents and a potential for additional bankruptcies or brandwide restructurings."
MAS_q3_2021.txt,"Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions.
Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.
We describe these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics.
I'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times.
In the third quarter, sales increased to 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth.
This was against a strong 16% comp from last year.
This growth came as we continue to face significant supply chain challenges.
Certain raw materials were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets.
Freight congestion in ports and lack of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages, continue to be a challenge.
They have kept our plants running, and our customers supplied, resulting an outstanding top line performance.
Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products.
Moving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing.
Sales increased 15% excluding currency, led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business.
These results highlight the strength of our plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels.
To support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia.
This additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen Hansgrohe's capabilities to serve its customers.
We plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project over the next three years.
And our Decorative Architectural segment sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter of 2020.
Propane had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in DIY paint.
DIY paint declined mid single-digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of 2020.
We continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent throughout the quarter.
When compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals.
Lastly, Behr Paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department.
This recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot on stock during the DIY surge last year.
Our continued investment in our joint effort to grow the PRO paint category, and our commitment to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched Behr Dynasty to The Home Depot, each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr Paint and the Home Depot.
And this recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership.
Moving on to capital allocation.
We continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million.
In addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year.
Now let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation.
The second half of 2021 is largely unfolding as anticipated.
We experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter and we expect mid teens inflation in the fourth quarter.
We have taken pricing actions across both segments, and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end.
It has been an extremely dynamic year and our supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges.
Because of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full-year earnings per share in the range of $3.67 to $3.73.
This report demonstrates our commitment to environmental, social and governance responsibility.
During a year of unparalleled change, our team members remained committed to maintaining our strong reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I efforts.
I'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense of inclusion, belonging and support.
Our progress in ESG is a priority for our Board and our executive leadership team.
I hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community.
As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.
Turning to slide seven.
Demand for our industry-leading brands remains strong and our teams executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment.
This resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top line growth.
Sales increased to 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year.
Net acquisitions contributed 2% growth and currency had a minimal impact.
In local currency, North American sales increased 9% or 6% excluding acquisitions.
The strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in propane, faucets, showers and spas, and by increased selling prices.
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18% excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the healthy 9% comp.
Gross margin of 34.2% is impacted by higher commodity and logistics cost in the quarter.
We expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter.
We will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives.
We expect the exit this year price cost neutral.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%.
As planned during the quarter, we increased certain expenses such as headcount, advertising and marketing to a more normalized level to support our brands.
We expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter and these costs continue to normalize.
Operating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%, our earnings per share was $0.99.
Turning to slide eight.
Plumbing growth continued to be strong with sales up 16% against the 13% comp in the third quarter of last year.
Net acquisitions contributed 2% to its growth and currency contributed another 1%.
North American sales increased 16% or 10%, excluding acquisitions.
Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength in e-commerce and trade channels.
With strong brand recognition and channel relationships, Delta continues to drive consumer demand for its products.
Watkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter with both demand and our backlog remained strong.
International plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions.
Hansgrohe delivered strong growth and demand continue to improve across Europe and numerous other countries.
Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the UK, all grew double-digits in the quarter.
Segment operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million and operating margin was 18.7%.
Operating profit was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier, as well as an unfavorable price/cost relationship.
This was partially offset by strong incremental volume.
We anticipate additional SG&A increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the fourth quarter.
We will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity actions, we expect to be price cost neutral as we enter 2022.
For full-year 2021, we continue to expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be in 22% to 24% and operating margins of approximately 18.5%.
Turning to slide nine.
Decorative Architectural sales increased 4% for the third quarter and 3% excluding acquisitions.
Our DIY paint business declined mid single-digits in the quarter against more than 25% comp in the third quarter of last year.
Despite this decline, DIY paint demand appears to be stabilizing, as we have seen relatively consistent demand since July.
When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter DIY sales are up over 20%.
Our propane business delivered exceptional growth of more than 45% in the quarter, as paint contractors are applying top rated Behr paint to more commercial and residential projects.
We expect demand in this channel to remain strong as propane contractors report growing demand for their services.
When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter PRO sales are up over 35%.
Segment operating margin in the third quarter was 19% and operating profit was $166 million.
Operating profit was impacted by lower volume, with increased commodity costs and higher marketing expense to support the new Behr Dynasty product launch, partially offset by higher net selling prices.
For full-year 2021, we continue to expect Decorative Architectural sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%, and operating margin to be approximately 19%.
Turning to slide 10.
Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3 times.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver.
Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 17%.
Finally, we repurchased more than 15.2 million shares in 2021 for $878 [Phonetic] million.
This is approximately 6% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year.
We expect to deploy approximately $150 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the fourth quarter as we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders.
And turning to our full year guidance, we have summarized our expectations for 2021 on slide 11.
We continue to anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to $16, and operating margin of approximately 17.5%.
Lastly, we are maintaining our 2021 earnings per share estimate midpoint, but narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.73 growth at the midpoint of the range.
This assumes the 252 million average diluted share count for the year.
Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on slide 14 of our earnings deck.
Demand for our products and home renovation remained strong at at a much higher levels than experienced in 2019.
When you compare our third quarter performance to Q3 2019, revenue is 28% higher, operating profit is 29% higher, operating margin is 10 basis points higher and adjusted earnings per share is an outstanding 62% higher.
With our demonstrated supply chain excellence and our ability to offset inflation with price, we believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum into 2022 and deliver margin expansion and double-digit growth consistent with our long-term outlook.
We look forward to sharing our details for 2022 outlook on our fourth quarter call in February.
I'll now open the call up to questions.
","In Q3, the company experienced its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales increasing by 11%, despite facing supply chain challenges. Operating margin was 17.5% due to planned increases in SG&A expenses. Plumbing sales grew by 15%, driven by strong demand in North America and international markets, and the company plans to invest $100 million in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia to support further growth. Decorative Architectural segment saw a 4% increase in sales, with propane experiencing over 45% growth. The company anticipates achieving price-cost neutrality by year-end, following mid-teens inflation in Q4. Adjusted EPS for the full year is estimated to range between $3.67 and $3.73, with sales growth between 14% and 16% and an operating margin of approximately 17.5%."
MAS_q2_2021.txt,"Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions.
Please limit yourself to one question with one follow up.
We describe these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics.
I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong.
This resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double digit earnings-per-share growth.
I'm extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth.
For the quarter, sales increased 24%.
Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased 18%.
Operating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to strong volume leverage.
Earnings per share increased an outstanding 34%.
Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the professional.
Turning to our plumbing segment, sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business.
International plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency, as Hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets.
Strong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets.
New product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR One collection in the second half of the year.
This collection was designed by Barber Osgerby, an award-winning internationally acclaimed London-based industrial design studio.
This continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality.
North American plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency, in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double digit growth at Delta.
Delta faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels, and particularly strength in the professionally oriented trade channel.
We continue to invest in new products in North American plumbing as well.
And two days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd Wright collection by Brizo that furthers the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.
Lastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steamist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta.
Steamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.
In our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against the healthy 8% comp for the second quarter of 2020.
While bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and propane grew in the quarter, demand moderated for DIY paint.
Material availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter.
Because of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter.
Due to lower than expected second quarter sales and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low-single digits for the full year.
However, with the acceleration we saw in our propane business in the quarter, we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low-double digit growth from high-single digit for the full year for our propane business.
For the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year.
With respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high end line of paint in the third quarter at the Home Depot called Behr Dynasty for both DIY and pro painters.
Dynasty is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff resistant, one-coat hide paint ever.
It's low VOC, Greenguard and LEED certified, fast drying and has an anti-microbial mildew-resistant paint finish.
This is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional.
Moving on to capital allocation.
We continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million.
As part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million.
This is approximately 5% of our outstanding share account at the beginning of the year.
Underscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately $1 billion.
Finally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness.
We continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging.
Inbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter.
We now expect our all-in cost inflation to be in the high-single digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low-double digit inflation in the second half of the year.
Inflation in coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later in the fourth quarter.
To mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments, and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations.
We're also working with our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs.
Despite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end.
While cost inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business.
Our teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions, and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers.
However, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products and the channels that we serve.
We anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over time.
The demand for our products remains strong.
And with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70.
As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.
Turning to Slide 7.
We delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs.
As a result, sales increased 24% with currency and net acquisitions, each contributing 3% to growth.
In local currency, North American sales increased 15% or 12%, excluding acquisitions.
Strong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas led this outstanding performance.
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 50% or 49%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures.
Gross margin was 36.3% in the quarter, up 50 basis points as we leverage the strong volume growth.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage.
During the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing, and travel and entertainment increased as planned.
We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters, as these costs normalize.
We delivered strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, up $94 million or 27% from last year, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20.1%.
Our earnings per share was $1.14 in the quarter, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020, due to volume leverage, lower interest expense and lower share count.
Turning to Slide 8.
Plumbing growth accelerated in the quarter with sales up 53%.
Currency contributed 5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed another 4%.
North American sales increased 47% in local currency or 41%, excluding acquisitions.
Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double digit growth.
With a strong brand recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.
Watkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter with both demand and our backlog remained strong.
International plumbing sales increased 50% in local currency or 49%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures.
Hansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and numerous other countries.
Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, UK and France, all grew strong double digits in the quarter.
Segment operating margins expanded 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of $274 million, up $115 million or 72%.
The strong performance was driven by incremental volume, favorable mix and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing and growth initiatives.
During the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of HUPPE, a small shower enclosure business based in Germany.
HUPPE sales were approximately EUR70 million in 2020.
This transaction closed on May 31, and net proceeds were not material.
Given our second quarter results and current demand trends, we now expect plumbing segment's sales growth for 2021 to be in the 22% to 24% range, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%.
Finally, due to our improved sales outlook, we are increasing our full year margin expectations to approximately 18.5%, up from our previous guide of approximately 18%.
Turning to Slide 9.
Decorative architectural declined 5% for the second quarter and was 6%, excluding the benefit from acquisitions.
DIY paint business declined double digits in the quarter against the healthy high-teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in the first quarter continued to face production challenges.
We expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter and now anticipate our DIY paint business to be down low-single digits for the full year.
To help mitigate these challenges, we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources for materials to meet the demand of our customers which remains strong.
Our PRO paint business delivered strong double digits growth in the quarter, as consumers are increasingly willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes.
We expect demand in this channel to remain strong and now anticipate low-double digit growth for the PRO paint business for the full year, up from our previous expectation of high-single digits as PRO paint contractors' order books continue to grow.
Our builders' hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter, as they continue to capitalize on increased consumer demand.
Segment operating margins were 22.1% and operating profit in the quarter was $188 million due to lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity initiatives.
For full year 2021, we now expect decorative architectural segment's sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%, down from 4% to 9% due to lower than expected second quarter sales and persistent raw material constraints.
We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19% as productivity initiatives in pricing help offset higher input costs.
Turning to Side 10.
Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.3x.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver.
Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over prior year.
As we discussed last quarter, we terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the second quarter and had an approximate $100 million final cash contribution to the plans to complete this activity.
This removes approximately $140 million of pension liabilities from our balance sheet, and it will benefit our free cash flow by approximately $50 million through reduced cash contributions, starting in 2022.
Also, we received approximately $166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business.
Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, as of today, we repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750 million.
We expect to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions for the remainder of this year.
Collectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet, while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders.
Turning to our full year guidance, we have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 11.
Based on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14% with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from 17%.
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 earnings per share estimate range of $3.65 to $3.75 represents 19% earnings per share growth at the midpoint of the range.
This assumes the 252 million average diluted share count for the full year.
Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 in earnings deck.
We had an outstanding second quarter driven by our strong brands, our innovation pipelines and most of all, our people, as demonstrated by outstanding execution by our supply chain teams.
Our strong performance demonstrates the strength of Masco's balanced and diversified business.
Masco is a broad portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel-oriented home improvement products.
Our products are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals.
Additionally, our markets remain strong, and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in 2022.
The fundamentals of our repair and remodel business are strong, with year-over-year home price appreciation of over 15% in May and existing home sales up over 23%.
Both metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis.
And the consumer is strong, with nearly $2 trillion in savings and an increased desire to invest in their homes.
Lastly, we continue to invest in our business and are well positioned for long-term growth.
We are bringing new, innovative products to market, fueling our growth and expanding our leading market share.
And with our leading margins and strong free cash flow, we will continue to deploy capital to reinvesting in our business, acquiring complementary bolt-on companies and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases all to drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll now open up the call to questions.
","Masco Corporation achieved a strong second quarter with 24% sales growth, showcasing the resilience of its diversified repair and remodel product portfolio. Sales increased across all segments, led by a 48% growth in plumbing, driven by strong demand for North American and international faucets and showers. Decorative architectural sales declined 5% due to supply chain constraints. Despite rising inflation, the company secured price increases and implemented productivity measures, targeting price/cost neutrality by year-end. Notably, the company repurchased 13.1 million shares for $750 million to date, with plans to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the second half of the year. Based on robust demand, Masco has increased its full-year sales growth expectations to 14-16%, with earnings per share estimated to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75, representing a 19% growth. The company's strong brands, innovation pipeline, and its well-positioned business indicate long-term growth potential, especially considering the correlation between home price appreciation and remodeling expenditures."

We caution you that such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
Leading our discussion today are Maria Pope, President and CEO; and Jim Ajello, Senior Vice President of Finance, CFO and Treasurer.
Our financial results this quarter were strong.
We reported net income of $96 million or $1.07 per share compared to net income of $81 million or $0.91 per share in the first quarter of last year.
In light of the strong quarter and positive outlook, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.70 per share, as well as our long-term earnings and dividend growth rates.
Jim will cover first-quarter results in more detail, provide regulatory and capital updates, as well as discuss the outlook for the rest of the year.
This quarter, again, presented significant weather-driven operational challenges.
And I'm proud of how our teams came together, responding to the most severe, ice, wind and snowstorms in our history, improving our operations and achieving important customer-focused results.
In February, we restored over 750,000 customer outages, as nearly half of our customers were without power, many of whom experienced multiple outages over a more -- more than 2.5-week period.
I want to recognize the hard work of our coworkers, mutual aid crews and assistance from as far away as Southern California, Utah, Montana to Alberta, British Columbia, all of whom in the midst of a pandemic went above and beyond to restore power quickly and most importantly, safely.
Even as we speak, crews continue to repair equipment and clear down trees, as damage is still extensive.
As of March 31, the cost of the February storm were $87 million, which Jim will discuss in detail.
The recent storms and wildfires last fall on top of the pandemic with so many people living, working and learning remotely underscore the importance of our ongoing system hardening and reinvestment programs, combined with the deployment of digital capabilities, AI and smart grid technologies.
Today versus a year ago, customers are experiencing about 16% less planned outages.
Average outage restoration times are about 7% faster and outage text notifications and digital payment options are making a difference in customer satisfaction.
And equally important to note is what did not happen during the February weather events, our generation plants, as well as wind and hydro facilities operated seamlessly.
And power was generated across the region throughout the harsh conditions.
Turning to load growth and the economy.
For the last couple of years, we've discussed the strength of our service territory.
Overall, year-over-year, customer count increased more than 1%, and load growth was up 1.2% on a weather-adjusted basis and 2.3% after accounting for the harsh winter conditions.
Residential usage was up 3% weather-adjusted, offsetting commercial declines of 5%.
Industrial usage grew an impressive 8%, powered by the strength of the tech and digital sectors.
Expansion within our region of several digital companies and the global semiconductor shortage are expected to continue and solidify our positive outlook.
Overall, Oregon's economy is recovering, with nearly two-thirds of the state's pandemic-driven job loss recovered.
Unemployment currently stands at 5.7% across our service territory.
ESG, Portland General has long been an ESG leader.
And this quarter, we join the Amazon Climate Pledge in keeping with our commitment to reduce carbon by 80% by 2030 over 2010 levels and our aspirational goal of net zero by 2040.
We also know that to make real progress on climate, we need to partner in addressing the admissions from transportation and other sectors.
Last week in partnership with Daimler Trucks North America, we celebrated the opening of the first of its kind heavy-duty electric truck charging site.
This site aligns with the West Coast clean transit corridor initiative to electrify along the I-5 Corridor from the borders with British Columbia to Mexico.
And finally, I'd like to address the ongoing social unrest and importance of our diversity, equity and inclusion work.
In these tumultuous times, corporations have an opportunity for change.
At Portland General, our DE&I priorities are focused on recruiting, retaining, training and promoting from our front lines to our Board of Directors.
We are committed to transparency and have published for three years running our workforce and pay equity statistics.
We've made good progress, but we know that there is still much work to do.
As we look to the year ahead, we're excited to lead a clean energy transformation and humbled by the challenges as we work seamlessly to integrate ever-increasing amounts of renewable and distributed energy resources into a growing, reliant and resilient grid, meeting customers' needs for safe, affordable, clean energy.
I too was impressed with the efforts of our teams across the company to restore power safely to customers during the February storms.
As we turn to economic conditions, it's clear that we're beginning to see recovery take hold.
Approximately 40% of Oregonians have had at least one vaccine shot and as of mid-April, K-12 public schools reopened for in-person education, either hybrid or full time.
As of March 2021, the unemployment rate in PGE's service territory was 5.7% compared to a 14% peak in April 2020.
In the first quarter, Oregon saw accelerated job growth and as of March, had recovered over half of the jobs lost last spring.
Harder hit segments such as leisure and hospitality have posted a noteworthy gains after experiencing a second wave of job losses in late 2020.
While there are greenshoots of recovery, we appreciate that many of our customers are still facing challenges, and we embrace our role as an essential service provider and partner to Oregon communities.
Turning to slide 5, I'll cover our financial performance.
As Maria said, we reported $1.07 per share compared to $0.91 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
First, we saw a $0.06 increase in total revenue.
This is composed of $0.04 due to higher loads, which increased 1.2% year-over-year weather-adjusted and a $0.02 positive impact from weather.
Additionally, there was $0.02 from the earnings power associated with the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Next, a $0.03 decrease in net variable power costs driven by lower hydro wind production in 2021.
While our wind production exceeded our expectations, it was still less than the unusually high levels of production experienced in 2020.
A $0.07 decrease was associated with higher operating and maintenance administrative expense, which consists of $0.05 of favorable fixed plant O&M primarily due to lower maintenance expense at our generation facilities.
This was offset by $0.12 of unfavorable administrative expenses, which included $0.03 of higher employee benefit expenses, $0.03 of higher legal and professional expense and $0.03 from the timing of bad debt recognition under our COVID deferral, and $0.03 from other items.
A $0.05 increase was associated with lower depreciation and amortization expense, largely as a result of asset retirements, which were partially offset by capital addition.
There was a $0.04 increase in other income, primarily attributed to market returns on the non-qualified benefit trust.
It was an $0.11 increase from lower tax expense, primarily driven by a one-time recognition of a benefit from a local flow through tax.
Turning to the regulatory update, we are continuing to evaluate our cost structure to ensure that we're providing safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers, while making investments that leverage the use of technology and advance our strategy.
We are still assessing our need and the appropriate timing to file a general rate case with the Oregon Public Service Utilities Commission for a 2022 test year.
This last week, we requested a docket to be open to select an independent evaluator with stakeholders for our upcoming RFP.
This is the first step toward the RFP, the process of which is expected to continue into 2022, before finalizing potential selections.
The RFP will seek both renewable energy and dispatchable resource fits.
PGE has identified a roughly 500-megawatt capacity need that will seek to fill as part of this 2021 all source RFP.
We plan to file a benchmark resource into this competitive process.
Additionally, as it relates to capacity, we are continuing to pursue cost competitive agreements for existing capacity in the region.
If PGE is successful in these negotiations, it might reduce the size of the 2021 RFP, depending on the contracting dates for an existing capacity resource.
Regarding the deferral related to our storm costs, detailed on Slide 6 through March 31, 2021, we've incurred an estimated $87 million in incremental cost due to the February storm, of which $33 million were capital expenditures and $54 million were operating expenditures associated with our transmission and distribution system.
We have a storm deferral mechanism that collects $4 million annually from retail customers to cover incremental expenses related to storm damages, and we defer any amount not utilized in the current year.
In response to the February storms, we exhausted our storm collection balance for 2021 of $9 million to offset operating expenses.
This brings the cumulative incurred cost from the February storm to be estimated at $45 million net as of March 31, 2021.
We have filed an application for authorization to defer emergency restoration costs for the February storms.
We expect a decision from the PUC on this in 2022.
We are confident these costs were incurred prudently in response to this unique and unprecedented storm, although there are comparable storms of similar size and duration in other regions at a similar expense, the OPUC has significant discretion in making the final determination of recovery and their conclusion of the overall prudence.
Turning to Slide 7, which shows our updated capital forecast through 2025, we've increased our 2021 capital expenditures by $45 million this year, the majority of which relates to the capital expenditures from the recent storm restoration.
Our capital plan remains on track, and we continue to invest primarily in projects that enhance the resiliency and reliability of our system for the benefit of customers, while maintaining affordability.
Given our guidance today, we raised our O&M guidance by $20 million.
This is in response to several factors.
$12 million of this increase is associated with the February storm response expense, which is ultimately offsetting revenue and the remaining $8 million is associated with additional initiatives to address wildfire risk, improve our outage restoration estimation and outage response processes.
On to Slide 8, we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet, including strong liquidity and investment-grade ratings, accompanied by a stable outlook.
Based on our strong financial condition, we do not expect to issue additional equity in 2021.
We expect to fund 2021 capital expenditures and long-term debt maturities with cash from operations during 2021, which is expected to range from $600 million to $650 million.
We've also increased a long-term debt issuance later this year up to $350 million, which will refinance the short-term notes closed earlier this year and satisfy our 2022 requirements.
Total liquidity of $780 million, all of which is available.
Earlier this week, our Board approved a dividend increase of $0.09 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 5.5% increase.
This increase is consistent with our long-term dividend growth guidance of 5% to 7%, while observing a dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.
Turning to our 2021 outlook, our first-quarter performance was strong.
We are on track to achieve our guided range and finished within the long-term growth guidance of 46% from the 2019 base year.
We expect continued impacts from the pandemic on the economy and regional power picture through the second quarter.
We anticipate a similar load composition to the trends that we've experienced over the last two quarters.
Our commercial customers face risks associated with economic impact of the pandemic in Oregon, but the strength of our residential and industrial energy deliveries has mitigated this decline.
Right now, we are still under the cap of our decoupling mechanism.
Residential customer usage on a weather-adjusted basis is above the established threshold and is expected to be refunded to customers.
As I settle in, I can see excellent fundamentals of the business, load growth is strong, and we continue to see opportunities to drive efficiency in our operations, mostly through investment in technology and developing a smarter more resilient grid, all of which will result in better outcomes for our customers.
","Portland General reported a strong first quarter with net income rising to $96 million or $1.07 per share, up from $81 million or $0.91 per share last year. The company maintained its 2021 guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70 per share and its long-term earnings and dividend growth rates. February storms resulted in $87 million in incremental costs, $45 million of which is being deferred for later recovery through a deferral mechanism and regulatory approval. The company's financial performance was driven by increased revenue, lower operating and maintenance costs, and lower depreciation and amortization expenses. As a responsible ESG leader, Portland General emphasized its commitment to reducing carbon emissions, investing in digital capabilities, and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the organization."

We would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum!
Investor events and the following.
Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of the Form 10-Q filing.
Third quarter earnings will be released on October 28, 2021, with the conference call on the same day.
I'm excited to share our strong second quarter results as we delivered record second quarter unit development and 23% same-store sales growth.
Importantly, each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a two-year basis, a step up from first quarter trends.
This sustained momentum was underpinned by our investments in digital and off-premise and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of consumers in an ever-changing environment.
Though COVID obviously creates a more challenged operating environment, our confidence is stronger than ever in our ability to navigate the resulting uncertainties and in the long-term growth potential of Yum!
As a result, we are reinstating our long-term growth algorithm with one important change.
We are raising our previous guidance of 4% unit growth to between 4% and 5% unit growth.
As a reminder, our long-term growth algorithm includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and mid to high single-digit system sales growth leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth.
The diversification of our global portfolio, the resilience of our business model, and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID.
Looking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale, in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees, and above-store leaders, have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth.
Now we'll discuss our Recipe for Growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it.
To start, I'll cover two growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short, and unrivaled culture and talent.
Then Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our unmatched operating capability, and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.
First, a few highlights from the quarter.
system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth.
Importantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021.
This was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the U.K., and Australia, with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and show signs of recovery.
As I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive two-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the two-year trend from Q1.
This is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery.
Even more exciting is the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad-based and record-setting.
Looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall global trend is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country to country nor linear within a country.
This insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on and off-premise channels.
We've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets.
A key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, geared toward providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands.
Even as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority.
We delivered a second quarter record with over $5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year.
Even more exciting, for the first time, on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in digital sales.
We believe these sales are highly incremental and result from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience.
To bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points.
The Taco Bell U.S. launch of our Taco Bell rewards program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives and early access to crave-worthy promotions.
We're incredibly excited by the early results from the program and the future growth opportunity that remains.
We're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visit, leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell rewards program compared to their pre-loyalty behavior.
As another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021, replacing our previous third-party solution.
As a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full-year digital sales amount.
Now let's talk about our RED Brands.
Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 35%, driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.
For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter.
Same-store sales declined 1% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.
We had truly outstanding results in March, leading the recovery with double-digit two-year same-store sales growth in the U.K., Australia, Canada, and the Middle East.
Our strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength, and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally.
Next, at KFC U.S., we continued to see strong momentum, with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2.
Importantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a two-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier, and our new chicken sandwich.
Our chicken sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future.
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit.
The division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10%, driven by 10% same-store sales growth.
While the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevated COVID-related dislocations and closures of 2020, it has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1.
Global Q2 same-store sales grew 1% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.
Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 16%.
Same-store sales declined 6% on a two-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.
Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 21% same-store sales growth on a two-year basis for the quarter and delivery continued to be the primary driver of growth as the shift toward an off-premise model continues in most of our Pizza Hut markets.
The top line results from our Australia, Canada, Malaysia, and our U.K. delivery business are shining examples of what it means to nail the RED Brand strategy.
These markets continue to unlock off-premise growth opportunities through a focus on value and innovation, a digital-first customer experience, and distinctive communications with the help of our magnetic ambassadors, spokespeople who bring our brand to life across the world.
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 4% overall same-store sales growth.
On a two-year basis, the off-premise channel grew 18% and overall same-store sales grew 9%, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021.
Pizza Hut also delivered strong product news with the continued success of our iconic stuffed crust pizza and the successful return of a consumer favorite, the Edge Pizza during the quarter.
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 31% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 24%, driven by a 21% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth.
For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 12% on a two-year basis.
The quarter kicked off with the return of the Quesalupa as part of the fan-favorite $5 Chalupa Cravings Box, followed by the relaunch of the iconic Naked Chicken Chalupa.
In May, we launched our first-ever global brand campaign, #ISeeATaco, in which fans could score a free taco when the moon looked like a taco.
We generated over 2 billion impressions and step-change brand awareness, especially in our international markets where we have a tremendous run rate for growth.
And finally, the Habit Burger Grill delivered 31% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth.
Q2 same-store sales grew 7% on a two-year basis.
Importantly, digital sales continued to mix over 35%, only a modest pullback from Q1, even as dining rooms continued reopening and dine-in sales saw a steady improvement throughout the quarter.
On the innovation front, we introduced the Brunch Charburger during the quarter, a unique all-day breakfast offering that included crisp golden tots, house-made secret sauce and a freshly cracked egg.
In addition to providing customers with a seamless experience to access our brands, we continue to invest in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate and run a restaurant.
As previously announced in the quarter, we've agreed to acquire Dragontail Technologies, a cutting-edge restaurant technology company, whose platform is focused on optimizing and managing the entire food preparation process from order through delivery, including automating the kitchen flow, driver dispatch, and customer order tracking.
The acquisition is subject to various approvals and we expect to close by the end of the third quarter.
An important factor of RED Brands is having a positive impact and the desire to make good easy for customers.
Our Recipe for Good framework focuses on our commitment to investing in the right recipe today.
We were proud to publish our 2020 Recipe for Good report this week, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet.
The report includes updates on our key commitments on critical issues like climate change and equity and inclusion.
I'm confident that our plans in these areas have the right ingredients for us to succeed and make a positive impact for our people, franchisees, customers, and communities.
Now to unrivaled culture and talent.
Two of our key assets are our iconic brands and the people that bring our brands to life around the world every day.
As I've mentioned in previous quarters, COVID has further strengthened the collaboration partnership across our entire system.
A great example of this is our relationship with our independent supply chain purchasing co-op in the U.S., RSCS.
Many of you probably saw the recent announcement that the CEO of RSCS, Steve McCormick has made the decision to retire in early 2022 and that RSCS Chief Operating Officer, Todd Imhoff, was unanimously selected to succeed Steve in the role of CEO.
Steve has had a tremendous and positive impact on our business for nearly a decade and our entire system is grateful for his leadership.
At the same time, Todd is the right leader to step into this role and lead the RSCS moving forward as it continues to provide a true competitive advantage for our entire U.S. business.
Our unrivaled culture and talent has always been a towering strength of Yum!
and I'm incredibly proud of our ability to bring our brands and people together in ways we haven't in the past.
During the quarter, we hosted several virtual meetings where we fostered collaborations on a global scale for our franchisees and teams, including marketing, planning meetings, ops, development programs, a global finance summit, leaning with leaders sessions, and companywide chats just to name a few.
It's during these meetings that we realize we are all more alike than we are different and the power that our brands and our culture have to bring people together.
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the sustained momentum in our business and the agility we've shown in the last year and I'm optimistic that we are set up to win.
Our results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified global business and confidence in our strategies, which are fueled by the underlying health of our franchise system.
We are poised to accelerate growth and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come.
With that, Chris, over to you.
Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our unmatched operating capability, and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers, and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.
To begin, let's discuss Q2.
system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth.
On a two-year basis, same-store sales grew 4%, which includes the negative impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021.
We delivered 2% unit growth year-over-year, which included a Q2 record of 603 net new units.
EPS, excluding special items, was $1.16, representing a 41% increase compared to ex-special earnings per share of $0.82 in Q2 2020.
Core operating profit grew 53% in the second quarter, driven by accelerated same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable.
At Taco Bell, company restaurant margins were 25.9%, 1.4 points higher than prior year.
Favorable sales flow-through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation, as well as increasing semi-variable costs as we return to normal operations.
As mentioned on our previous call, we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-COVID levels later this year given inflationary pressures, along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical daypart mix.
During Q2, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due, primarily led by KFC International.
These recoveries resulted in a $4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $17 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $13 million of expense in Q2 2020.
As a reminder, we ended 2020 with $12 million of full-year bad debt expense with large quarterly swings due to COVID.
As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to be negatively impacted in the second half as we lap bad debt recoveries of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively.
While difficult to forecast, at this point, we still don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full-year basis.
General and administrative expenses were $230 million.
Full-year 2021 G&A is expected to be back-end weighted, as it has been historically.
We now estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be approximately $1 billion for the full year 2021, a slight increase from our Q1 estimate attributable to increased incentive-based compensation.
Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged and we expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back toward our historic ratio as sustained growth continues.
Reported interest expense was $159 million, an increase of 21% compared to Q2 2020, driven by a special item charge of $34 million related to early redemption of restricted group bonds during the quarter.
Interest expense, ex-special, was approximately $125 million, a decrease of 5%, driven by recent refinancing actions and the elimination of revolver balances held in the prior year.
We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, excluding the previously mentioned $34 million special item charge similar to 2020.
We plan to continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance debt at attractive rates.
As a reminder, this will result in higher one-time expenses that will be favorable to interest expense going forward.
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $16 million for the quarter.
As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross capex appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business, with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores.
We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments.
Now on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver.
Our restaurants are operated by world-class franchisees who are experienced and competing and winning in any environment.
It's well known that the U.S. is facing a competitive labor market, which is more pronounced relative to other markets across our diverse global footprint.
We and our franchisees are leaning into our unrivaled culture, which differentiates our brands to compete in a tight labor market with a focus on retention and recruiting.
I'll add some color by sharing examples from our Taco Bell company restaurants.
I'll start first with recruitment.
We posted hiring parties, which have led to a significant uptick in employee hires.
We also launched a fast apply option to make the application process easier and more efficient by reducing the application time from eight minutes to two minutes.
On the retention front, we've supported and rewarded our team members by offering a variety of incentives, including paid time off, free family meals, and increased employee development activities to name a few.
We've always prioritized investing in our people and we recognize the importance now more than ever to ensure we maintain focus on our unmatched operating capability to deliver a RED customer experience.
At the same time, our system is well positioned to sustain strong unit economics while managing the inflationary environment related to labor market dynamics and commodity cost trends.
On the commodity front, there is no one better equipped to navigate this environment, given our massive cross-brand purchasing scale through our domestic supply chain co-op RSCS, that gives our franchisees many benefits, including advantaged end to end sourcing and supply chain costs.
We are also confident in the pricing power of our brands and partner closely with our franchisees as they make strategic pricing decisions in their respective markets to deal with cost pressures while still providing customers with relevant value and distinctive products.
As David mentioned earlier, we are also prioritizing investments in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate a restaurant while also providing an enhanced customer experience.
As an example, Pizza Hut International continues to demonstrate significant momentum on this front, as evidenced by increased customer satisfaction metrics.
Their improvements are fueled by continued adoption of frictionless restaurant technology, including our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot that launched at the end of 2020 and is now live in 40 markets, covering 4,000 restaurants.
HutBot eases the daily management of our stores with the RTM, leading to a better customer experience.
At Taco Bell, we've continued excelling at serving more customers through our drive-thrus.
We had our sixth consecutive quarter of under four-minute drive-thru order to delivery time.
Speed for Q2 was six seconds faster than Q2 2020 and our teams served 4 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year.
A huge shout out to our operators and team members for continuing to break records in speed with the increased demand in off-premise.
The drive-thru experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands.
So these improvements position us well to win going forward.
That's a perfect segue to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver, which I'm particularly thrilled to speak about today.
Our net new unit growth of 603 during the quarter was broad based across brands and geographies, making this not only a record quarter, but also capping a record first half.
These results speak to the strength of our iconic brands in growing food categories supported by a healthy, well capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth.
Most notably, KFC opened 428 net new units during the quarter with significant builds in China, Russia, India, Latin America, and Thailand, contributing to 5% unit growth year-over-year.
As many of you know, KFC has the first-mover advantage in several emerging markets with a strong domestic footprint upon which to grow.
This impressive development quarter from KFC speaks to the power of this global brand and the unit economics that underpin it.
Pizza Hut has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1, underpinned by the strength in gross openings and moderating store closures.
Pizza Hut opened 99 net new units during the quarter, led by strong development in China, India, and Asia.
Taco Bell opened 74 net new units and we're excited to share that Taco Bell International had its best development quarter ever, opening 30 net new units led by Spain and the U.K. In the U.S., we opened our flagship Taco Bell Cantina in Times Square, with a digital forward footprint and personalized experience.
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the first half of the year and we're extremely proud to announce 4% to 5% unit growth guidance, led by development from all four brands across our footprint.
Next I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position and priorities for capital allocation.
We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million, excluding restricted cash.
The strong recovery in EBITDA during Q2 drove our consolidated net leverage down to approximately 4.5 times, temporarily below our target of approximately 5 times.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares, totaling $255 million at an average price per share of $119.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased $530 million of shares at an average price of $112.
Finally, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend, and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases.
Overall, I'm extremely proud of our Q2 results, the resilience of our business model, and the agility of our teams.
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions.
","Yum! Brands delivered a strong second quarter with record unit development and 23% same-store sales growth. The growth was driven by increased customer mobility, digital sales, and the adaptability of its brands. Key highlights include a 26% increase in system sales, 4% two-year same-store sales growth, and a reinstatement of the long-term growth algorithm with a revised unit growth guidance of 4% to 5%. Each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a two-year basis. The company also achieved significant digital sales of over $5 billion, surpassing $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. KFC led the quarter with 35% system sales growth, primarily due to its strong international performance. Taco Bell followed with 24% growth, driven by new product launches and its global brand campaign. Pizza Hut posted a 10% increase, highlighted by its off-premise growth and menu innovations. Habit Burger Grill experienced 31% same-store sales growth. Yum! Brands remains optimistic about its growth potential, with plans to accelerate its expansion and maximize value creation for stakeholders."
UNF_q1_2022.txt,"I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst's president and chief executive officer.
Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors.
Overall, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Our team continues to focus on providing industry-leading services to our customers as well as selling prospective customers on the value that UniFirst can bring to their businesses.
The results for our first quarter were largely as we anticipated, with consolidated revenues growing 8.8% and an overall adjusted operating margin for our core laundry operations of approximately 10%.
The team continues to execute well, producing solid performances in both new account sales as well as customer retention during the quarter.
In addition, wearer additions versus reductions during the quarter were positive, indicating the continued growth and recovery of our customer base.
This is a favorable comparison to a year ago when many customer wearer levels remained depressed due to the impact of the pandemic.
The strong year-over-year growth in the quarter was also impacted by adjustments to customer pricing as we continue to work with our customers through this inflationary environment.
As a reminder, from a profitability perspective, we discussed during our year-end earnings call that going forward over the next few years, we are going to be reporting adjusted results, which exclude the impact of costs that we are expending on three discrete strategic initiatives that are critical in our efforts to transform the company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning.
As a reminder, these three initiatives are the rollout of our new CRM system, investments in the UniFirst brand, and a corporatewide ERP system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology.
As we have talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructure, and our technologies.
All of the investments designed to deliver solid long-term returns for UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components of our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry.
After excluding our costs in our quarter related to these investments, our adjusted operating margin is showing an anticipated decline compared to a year ago.
The comparison of adjusted margin is being impacted by increases in costs we've been highlighting for a couple of quarters now.
Some are simply bouncing back from depressed levels during the pandemic and others are being impacted by the inflationary environment and some are being impacted by both.
As a reminder, these costs include merchandise amortization, costs related to raw materials and the overall supply chain disruption, the cost to hire and retain labor, energy, and travel.
Our solid balance sheet positions us well to meet these ongoing challenges while continuing to make investments in growth and strengthen our business.
Along those lines, during December, we closed on two small acquisitions, which will improve our footprint in key markets.
As we have highlighted before, acquisitions continue to be part of our overall growth strategy.
Despite the challenges in the overall operating environment, we continue to be confident in our ability to manage and execute through these obstacles.
We maintain a sharp focus on taking care of our employees, our customers, and bringing new customers into the UniFirst family.
As we have discussed previously, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and services and we feel the company is positioned well to support the evolving economic landscape.
In our first quarter of 2022, consolidated revenues were $486.2 million, up 8.8% from $446.9 million a year ago, and consolidated operating income decreased to $44.8 million from $56 million in -- or 20.1%.
Net income for the quarter decreased to $33.7 million or $1.77 per diluted share from $41.9 million or $2.20 per diluted share.
Our financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 included $5.9 million of costs directly attributable to the three key initiatives that Steve discussed.
Excluding these initiative costs, adjusted operating income was $50.7 million, adjusted net income was $38.1 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.
Although our financial results in the prior year may have included direct costs related to these key initiatives, which in our first quarter of 2021 would have primarily been for our CRM initiative, the company did not specifically track the amounts that were being expensed.
This is because the amount was less significant in value and a large number of the costs were still being capitalized.
As a result, we will not be providing adjusted amounts for the prior year comparable period.
Our core laundry operations revenues for the quarter were $428.8 million, up 9.1% from the first quarter of 2021.
Core laundry organic growth, which adjusts for the estimated effect of acquisitions as well as fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, was 8.6%.
This strong organic growth rate was primarily the result of customer reopenings, solid sales performance, and improved customer retention in fiscal 2021 as well as efforts to share with our customers the cost increases that we are seeing in our business due to the current inflationary environment.
Core laundry operating margin decreased to 8.5% for the quarter or $36.5 million from 12.4% in the prior year or $48.9 million.
Costs we incurred during the quarter related to our key initiatives were recorded to our core laundry operations segment.
And excluding these costs, the segment's adjusted operating margin was 9.9%.
The decrease from prior year's operating margin was primarily due to higher merchandise amortization, which continues to normalize from depressed levels during the pandemic, as well as the effect of large national account installations, which are providing additional merchandise amortization headwinds.
Also, inflationary pressures and the overall supply chain disruption continued to impact our other merchandise costs.
During the quarter, the adjusted operating margin was also impacted by higher travel and energy costs as a percentage of revenues as well as wage inflation we are experiencing, responding to the very challenging employment environment.
Energy costs increased to 4.3% of revenues in the first quarter of 2022, up from 3.6% in prior year.
Revenues from our specialty garments segment, which delivers specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services, increased to $39.5 million from $38.1 million in prior year or 3.5%.
This increase was primarily due to growth in our cleanroom and European nuclear operations.
The segment's operating margin increased to 21.9% from 18.8%, primarily due to lower merchandise costs as a percentage of revenues.
As we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services.
Our first aid segment's revenues increased to $17.8 million from $15.5 million in prior year or 14.8%.
This increase was due to improved top line performance in both our wholesale distribution as well as our first aid van business.
However, the segment had an operating loss of $0.3 million during the quarter primarily due to continued investment in the company's initiative to expand its first aid van business into new geographies.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $478.1 million at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2022.
During the quarter, our net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by our reduced profitability as well as heavier than normal working capital needs of the business.
Contributing to these higher working capital needs were elevated supply inventory balances related to the ongoing supply chain disruption as well as increases to rental merchandise and service as our balance sheet position continues to normalize coming out of the pandemic-impacted period.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $31.1 million as we continued to invest in our future with new facility additions, expansions, updates, and automation systems that will help us meet our long-term strategic objectives.
Now that our CRM project has transitioned from a development phase to deployment, the majority of the costs are now being expensed.
As a result, the capitalization of costs related to our CRM project in the quarter totaled only $1.7 million.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we repurchased 22,750 common shares for a total of $4.8 million under our previously announced stock repurchase program.
I'd like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our outlook.
At this time, we now expect our full-year revenues for fiscal 2022 will be between $1.94 billion and $1.955 billion.
This revised top-line guidance includes the anticipated impact of the two small acquisitions we closed in December that Steve discussed.
These acquisitions are expected to add approximately $10 million to our fiscal 2022 revenues.
We further expect that our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 will now be between $5.50 and $5.80.
This earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 24% and continues to include an estimate of $38 million worth of costs directly attributable to our key initiatives that will be expensed during the year.
Please also note the following assumptions regarding our guidance.
Core laundry operations adjusted operating margin at the midpoint of the range is now 9.2%, which reflects continued pressure from costs that trended lower during the pandemic and the current inflationary environment.
Our assumed adjusted tax -- our assumed adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2022 is 24.25%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $7 and $7.30.
Guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks or potential tax reform, and guidance assumes a stable economic environment with no pandemic-related headwinds, including potential expenses related to government COVID-19 mandates.
","UniFirst's Q1 performance exhibited overall growth, with an 8.8% increase in consolidated revenues to $486.2 million. Notably, new account sales and customer retention improved, despite inflationary pressures impacting costs. Adjusted operating margin was impacted by investments in strategic initiatives, excluding which the margin was 9.9%. The core laundry operations contributed the majority of revenues, with 9.1% growth primarily due to customer reopenings, strong sales, and cost adjustments. The specialty garments segment also saw growth, with increased cleanroom and European nuclear operations, while the first aid segment expanded its van business. Despite challenges in the operating environment, UniFirst remains confident in executing through obstacles, expecting full-year revenues between $1.94 billion and $1.955 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected within the range of $7.00 to $7.30, reflecting the exclusion of $38 million in costs related to key strategic initiatives."
BHE_q2_2020.txt,"For today's call, Jeff will begin by covering a summary of our second quarter results and by providing a current status of our global operations.
Roop will then discuss the second quarter results in more detail, including a cash and balance sheet summary and our third quarter guidance.
Jeff will wrap up with an outlook by market sector and an update on our strategic initiatives before we conclude the call with Q&A.
Our second quarter results were achieved against the backdrop of mandatory facility shutdowns, component constraints, and extra processes required to keep everyone safe.
During Q2, we achieved revenue of $491 million, which was down sequentially from Q1, but supported by strong demand in our Medical and Semi-Cap sectors.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.07.
Our non-GAAP earnings include $4 million or $0.10 per share of COVID related costs that we could not fully anticipate as we entered the quarter.
In addition to these COVID costs, we experienced other production inefficiencies as a result of the current pandemic environment.
Our overall performance was helped by the aggressive cost reduction actions taken earlier in the quarter.
Our cash conversion cycle for the quarter was 84 days.
Despite operating challenges, we generated $23 million in cash flow from operations and returned $6 million of cash to shareholders as part of our recurring quarterly dividend payment.
As we look forward, I wanted to step back and offer a few perspectives.
I'll do that on Slide 4.
Since I joined Benchmark last year, we've made a lot of positive changes and all of these have been supported by an amazing team.
From the hard work required to execute on our strategic initiatives and goals that we outlined last year, to overcoming unique challenges presented by the unprecedented global pandemic of today, let me simply say our team has risen to the occasion.
Before I arrived, the company had embarked on a strategy to diversify the markets we serve and drive our portfolio mix with a greater concentration in higher value markets.
In the past year, we have worked further to align the customers where we can add the most value and these efforts have paid off.
Today we enjoy a diverse portfolio of products across many high growth and high value sectors.
That being said, we are not immune to the current recession that this disease has caused and we have an unprecedented amount of demand changes in our portfolio that's required a lot of the team's attention to ensure we capitalize on new opportunities while mitigating any risks.
We believe this diverse portfolio and exposure to high value segments will allow us to expand our quarterly revenue through the balance of the year.
Supply chain in our complex high mixed environment is a constant focus, and our recent results have been supported by the strong performance of our supply chain team.
During the second quarter and due to the team's efforts, we were not significantly impacted by component shortages, but they did in some places contribute to operational inefficiencies.
Further, our revamped go-to-market organization has grown the manufacturing and engineering services opportunity pipeline by over 30% in the past 12 months, and have delivered three quarters of sequential growth in bookings, which bodes well for our long-term growth potential.
As we look out to the end of the year, we are still on track to exit 2020 with at least 9% gross margin and we expect to build on this momentum into 2021.
As the global pandemic continues to evolve, we have expanded protocols focused on keeping a safe work environment for our employees.
Our actions are informed by the best practices published by the CDC, the WHO and local authorities, and we've completed a Company Employee Survey to solicit direct feedback on our actions to date and ensure our employees agree that we are maintaining a safe work environment.
Where possible we are continuing to permit about 20% of our employees to work from home.
We have shifted our customer engagements to a virtual environment with real time video supported factory tours as we limit travel to protect our teams.
We even hosted a virtual grand opening of our new Phoenix operation with Governor Ducey and Mayor Gallego.
Our teams have adapted well to the new reality, and we are finding creative ways to stay close to our customers and continuing to collaborate with them on solving new challenges.
In Asia, China and Thailand we are fully operational through the second quarter.
As we entered Q2, our Penang, Malaysia operations, which includes our largest precision machining facility operated at 50% capacity based on local restrictions, which were subsequently lifted at the end of April.
From the 1st of May, Malaysia has been fully operational.
Our European sites in the Netherlands and Romania were fully operational in the second quarter and remains so today.
Across the US, our five operations in California were impacted by shelter-in-place orders through April.
Since early May and to the present all California locations as well as our other US sites are fully operational.
In Mexico, we have two operations in Tijuana and one in Guadalajara.
The 100% shutdown that impacted our Tijuana operations was lifted in mid-May after we passed some inspection and were given authorization to operate by the Baja's state.
There has been a phase return to work since this time and the Tier 1 sites are now operating at approximately 75%.
Our Guadalajara facility has been essentially operating at 75% productivity due to at-risk employees being required to stay home for the Jalisco state government restrictions.
We are staggering shifts and other protocols in our Mexican operations to keep our employees safe and optimize output.
This has been and remains a highly dynamic environment.
As shelter-in-place orders were lifted in the US, we had hoped the country could maintain the declining infection curve.
Unfortunately this has not happened.
As the incident rate domestically increases, there could be temporary shutdowns of one of our facilities at any given time.
And we stand ready to execute decontamination protocols beyond our normal safe work in cleaning procedures.
Our operation teams will continue to maintain our safety first approach, while managing schedules to ensure we meet delivery obligations to our customers.
Over to you, Roop.
I hope everyone and their families are staying healthy and safe.
Let me start by echoing Jeff's sentiment on the incredible efforts of our teams to support our customers through a very dynamic environment.
As we manage through the COVID crisis, our priorities remain centered on one, the health and safety of our employees.
Two, delivering for our customers.
Three, maintaining a healthy balance sheet and four, ensuring the financial flexibility to run our operations through uncertainty.
Total Benchmark revenue was $491 million.
Medical revenues for the second quarter increased 14% sequentially and were up 18% year-over-year from continued new product ramps, strength throughout our medical customers and increasing demand for critical devices necessary to support the COVID-19 fight, including X-ray and ultrasound devices, ventilators and diagnostic equipment, which we estimate is approximately a third of our sequential growth.
Semi-Cap revenues were up 5% in the second quarter and up 39% year-over-year from continued strong demand across our Semi-Cap customers.
A&D revenues for the second quarter decreased 26% sequentially due to approximately $15 million lower revenue from our commercial aerospace programs, which is approximately 30% of the sectors revenue.
The remaining decline in the sector is related to defense program timing changes, whether that is the end of certain programs or transitions to new programs.
Demand from our defense customers for security solutions, aircraft, munitions and satellites remained strong.
We expect continued strong demand in Q3 and Q4 2020 including new programs ramping which should result in sequential revenue growth.
Industrial revenues for the second quarter decreased 15% sequentially.
Demand for products in the oil and gas industry, which is approximately 20% of our revenue, continued to be generally soft and will likely stay soft for the remainder of the year.
In addition demand decreased for goods that support the commercial building and transportation infrastructure markets.
Overall, the higher value markets represented 81% of our second quarter revenue.
In the traditional markets, computing was up 20% quarter-over-quarter from new program ramps and two engineering and manufacturing programs in high-performance computing.
Telco was down 10% sequentially.
We saw pockets of strength in demand for network infrastructure, which was offset by lower demand for broadband and commercial satellite applications.
Our traditional markets represented 19% of second quarter revenues.
Our top 10 customers represented 44% of sales for the second quarter.
Our revenue of $491 million reflects a decrease on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Our GAAP loss per share for the quarter was $0.09.
Our GAAP results include restructuring and other one-time costs totaling $5.7 million.
$3.3 million is related to the severance and other items for the announced closure of our Angleton site which Jeff will cover in more detail in his initiatives update.
$1.2 million is related to the completion of our San Jose closure and the remaining is due to other various restructuring activities around our network.
Our previously announced San Jose site closure has been completed on schedule and within our original cost estimates.
Turning to Slide 10.
For Q2, our non-GAAP gross margin was 7%, a 140 basis points sequential decline.
As Jeff stated earlier, our results were negatively impacted by $4 million of costs related to COVID-19 including site shutdown days pursuant to government orders, idle and not fully productive labor costs, personal protective equipment and incremental freight charges.
The majority of these costs impacted our gross profit.
We expect the second quarter to be the lowest quarterly gross margin in fiscal year 2020, and we still believe that we can exit 2020 at, at least 9% of gross margin.
Our SG&A was $28.5 million, a decrease of $3.1 million sequentially and $3 million year-over-year due to the cost containment measures, which we have continued, including salary reductions for certain management personnel, including the executive team, freezing travel, reducing discretionary spending and delaying hiring in addition to our reduction in variable compensation expense.
Operating margin was 1.2%, a decrease from 2.3% in Q1 due to lower revenue, reduced gross margin offset by the lower SG&A.
In Q2 2020, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 29%, which was higher than expected for the quarter due to the distribution of income across our network and certain discrete tax items.
The higher tax impact was approximately $0.01 per share.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 for the quarter and non-GAAP ROIC was 5.9%.
Our cash balance was $356 million at June 30, with $194 million available in the US.
We did repatriate cash in Q2.
We will continue to repatriate future quarters when appropriate, while also balancing our foreign site's cash flow requirements.
Our cash balances include $30 million of proceeds from borrowings under our revolving line of credit.
At June 30, we were at a positive net of debt cash position of approximately $183 million which was higher than the end of Q1 by approximately $12 million.
We believe we've got -- we have a strong capital structure and our liquidity position provides flexibility to manage our business through the current environment.
We generated $23 million in cash flow from operations and $13 million free cash flow after netting $10 million of capital expenditures.
Our accounts receivable balance was $302 million, a decrease of $16 million from the prior quarter.
Contract assets were $154 million at June 30 and $160 million at March 31.
Payables were down $11 million quarter-over-quarter.
Inventory at June 30 was $364 million, up $26 million quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to Slide 12 to review our cash conversion cycle performance.
Our cash conversion cycle days was 84.
The primary driver for the slightly higher cycle days was the effect from the increase in inventory.
Inventory days increased due to mix changes from customers late in the quarter and advanced inventory purchases to support long production cycles for products in our Semi-Cap and Medical sectors.
Along with the inventory increase, we did see a corresponding increase in customer cash deposits, which is used to offset advanced inventory purchases.
Now turning to Slide 13 for a capital allocation update.
In Q2, we continued to pay a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $5.8 million.
As a reminder, we increased our recurring quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share on February 3, 2020.
We expect to continue the recurring quarterly cash dividend.
We suspended our share repurchase program in Q2, and we are not planning any share repurchases in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 14 for a review of our third quarter 2020 guidance.
We expect revenue to range from $490 million to $530 million.
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range from $0.26 to $0.30 or a midpoint of $0.28.
We expect to generate cash flow from operations for the full year even considering the challenging COVID-19 environment.
Capex for the year will be approximately $30 million to $35 million as we prioritize investments to support new customers and expand our production capacity for future growth.
Implied in our guidance is a 2.9% to 3.1% operating margin range for modeling purposes.
The guidance provided does exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and estimated restructuring and other costs.
We expect to incur restructuring and other non-recurring costs in Q3 of approximately $800,000 to $1.2 million.
Other expenses net is expected to be $2.4 million, which is primarily interest expense related to our outstanding debt.
We expect that for Q3, our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 20% to 22%, because of the distribution of income around our global network.
The expected weighted average shares for Q3 are 36.7 million.
This guidance takes into consideration all known constraints for the third quarter and assumes no further significant interruptions to our supply base, operations or customers.
The guidance also assumes no material changes to end market conditions due to COVID-19.
Following Roop's guidance for the third quarter, I wanted to provide additional color on our view of demand by sector for the second half of 2020 on Slide 16.
As I stated earlier in the call, our global operations are at or near our planned staffing levels with the exception of Mexico.
Given our current operational state, our ability to fulfill demand remains high.
Through the second quarter and early in July, we have gained a better picture of the demand outlook from customers in each of our market verticals, and have a current snapshot of what our revenue trends could look like in the second half.
I want to reinforce, this is just a snapshot because there will likely be puts and takes across our sub sectors as we move forward.
I will start with the Medical sector where demand grew almost 14% sequentially from Q1 and is forecasted to remain strong throughout the rest of the year from new program ramps in imaging systems and for critical care and diagnostic devices supporting COVID-19.
On the flip side, our core medical products that supports cardiac, renal and orthopedic therapies have seen demand reductions in the second half that have offset some of the increases as hospitals and clinics are deferring planned procedures and elective surgeries based on hospital capacity.
We expect demand for these products to increase when the COVID crisis lessens.
But the end result for our portfolio, is that we believe it will remain at the Q2 level for the balance of 2020, which still represents double-digit year-over-year growth.
In Semi-Cap, the demand recovery for semiconductor capital equipment continues based on the current forecast from our customers.
On the strength of this demand, we expect sequential quarterly revenue growth for the rest of the year further supported by some new program ramps as well.
Our competitive position remains very strong and we look forward to increasing our industry leading precision machining position in this sector.
Our A&D sector is comprised of approximately 70% defense related products and 30% aerospace.
Demand for radar, missiles, military aircraft and satellite communication devices remains strong, and we expect continued strength in the second half.
However as Roop referenced earlier in our Q2 results, demand for commercial aircraft programs are not showing any signs of recovery in the second half of this year.
Moving to the Industrial sector.
We see limited recovery for customers supporting oil and gas through 2020, which represents approximately 20% of sector revenue.
We are also seeing softer demand for commercial and transportation infrastructure markets, as many of our customers' projects have been deferred.
As a bright spot, we are seeing strength in testing instrumentation and IoT related products.
Similar to Industrials, the traditional markets of Computing and Telco will remain mixed.
We see strength in Computing as we saw in Q2 with very complex high performance computing projects landing in the second half.
However, these programs tend to be project orientated.
So it's important that the end customer scheduled supports installing these machines in the year.
Demand from customers we support in security computing and enterprise data centers will remain muted given the lockdown on enterprise IT capital spending.
On the Telco side, we've seen increases in network infrastructure products, supporting greater work from home bandwidth demand, but this has been offset by declines for next generation network build out and in some commercial satellite applications.
Despite a challenging global backdrop that is most of our business development team grounded, we had our third sequential growth quarter of bookings growth.
Our marketing team has been instrumental in working with our operation and sales teams on virtual tours and capability demonstration that is becoming a part of the new norm in our business.
Fortunately, the demand environment remains favorable for outsourcing, as many companies continue to pivot to more variable design and manufacturing cost models.
In the Medical sector, we were awarded programs for a fall detection system and a new drug delivery device, which have both coupled with front-end engineering projects.
Also, as we stated last quarter, we were awarded new ventilator programs that are being rapidly transferred into manufacturing revenue for Benchmark.
In Defense, we were awarded a number of new programs including design and manufacturing for space module electronics, and for optical sensors for military applications.
In Industrials, we were awarded a new product that will come to market for microbial cleaning in commercial venues, which has become a critical application in the new normal of living with COVID and beyond.
I'm also pleased to announce that we have partnered with CoreKinect to provide IoT ecosystem hardware from our new Phoenix EMS operations.
Our new business pipeline is strong across our targeted sectors and we remain very encouraged about the prospects for continued outsourcing wins in the coming quarters.
During the first half of 2020, even with the significant challenges brought on by the pandemic, we've continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives, and I wanted to share a few updates as we close the call today.
Benchmark is in the services business, and one of our top priorities is to deepen our relationship with customers as a strategic partner and trusted innovation collaborator.
I can report that customer satisfaction which I review with the team weekly remains very high.
During the crisis, there is a heightened level of communication and coordination required in serving customers and as I noted last quarter, I have personally received multiple inputs on the discipline and excellence of our teams.
In fact, in Q2, we received three service excellence awards from our top customers recognizing our performance during this pandemic.
As I stated earlier in the call, I couldn't be prouder of our organization.
In addition, we are partnering with Applied Materials on their SuCCESS2030 Sustainability Initiative and participated in their announcement at SEMICON West earlier this month.
Benchmark is committed to supporting ESG initiative and are excited when we can further these actions working closely with a valued customer.
Turning now to growing our business, with our revamped go-to-market organization, we have had our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in new program wins.
We have the right team on the field and we'll continue to reap benefits from the investment in this area.
We are making progress in our Medical, Semi-Cap and Defense accounts and starting to see early results with new engineering and EMS wins in our Industrial sector.
We continue to drive enterprise efficiencies.
Against a very challenging macro backdrop, our teams have maintained focus on meeting the needs of our customers and our operating performance is improving.
We have also continued our global footprint optimization program, which we started almost a year ago.
The objective of this program is to utilize ongoing voice of the customer feedback to align our geographic capabilities and footprint to meet customer needs.
The outcome of our most recent round strategic reviews, is that we decided to close our Angleton Texas operations.
We plan to consolidate many of the programs into other Benchmark manufacturing operations, which will improve utilization and efficiencies.
This initiative isn't just about closing factories.
As we are also looking at where we want to expand our investment and footprint.
In support of that in June, we announced our newest facility with the virtual grand opening of Benchmark Phoenix.
This new state-of-the-art facility in Phoenix features RF design in manufacturing circuit fabrication Micro-E, SMT, systems integration and testing all under one roof.
This enables us to provide the proverbial one-stop shop for sophisticated customers, looking for extremely densed hybrid circuit designs, who might also have a need for Micro-E or SMT assembly on the same design.
And with our new facility, they don't need to look any further.
The customer response for this type of advanced manufacturing operation has been very positive and we look forward to the growth from this operation.
Finally, I want to close with our initiative on engaging talent and shift in culture.
First, Benchmark has a great cultural foundation and the work we've completed over the past year, since I joined, is a testament to the support we provide each other in this organization.
At Benchmark, we are committed to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at all levels in the company.
In this endeavor, we are committed to more transparency, education and diversity training, and talent recruitment to improve our pipeline of diverse future leaders.
We look forward to sharing details on our progress in the future as part of our increasing focus on environmental, social and governance affairs.
Now, let me wrap up.
The senior leadership team is engaged in driving these initiatives and the level of collaboration throughout our organization is energized.
We remain committed to our long-term strategy and we'll use this unprecedented time of change to hone our skills, rightsize our operations and expand our technical capabilities, so that we will emerge with a stronger organization and business in the years to come.
","Benchmark reported mixed yet encouraging financial results for the second quarter, amidst challenges posed by COVID-19. Total revenue reached $491 million, supported by demand in Medical and Semi-Cap sectors. Non-GAAP gross margin was 7%, impacted by $4 million of COVID-related costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.07, despite $5.7 million in restructuring charges. The company anticipates gross margin to improve, aiming to exit 2020 with at least 9%. They believe a diverse portfolio and exposure to high-value segments will bolster revenue growth in the second half of the year. Despite operational challenges, they generated $23 million in cash flow from operations and returned $6 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends. Their strategic initiatives remain on track, including footprint optimization, new facility openings, and a focus on diversity and inclusion. The company remains confident in its long-term strategy and expects to emerge from the pandemic with a stronger organization and business."
RS_q1_2021.txt,"I will begin today with a high-level overview of our first quarter performance and capital allocation priorities.
Karla will then speak to our operating results and demand trends by end market, and Arthur will conclude with a review of our first quarter 2021 financials.
Our resilient business model, coupled with outstanding execution in a favorable market, resulted in record financial performance during the first quarter of 2021.
We experienced ongoing strength in metals pricing during the first quarter, led by multiple price increases for carbon steel products, along with improving demand in many markets, and leveraged our decentralized operating structure, small order sizes and diversification of products, end markets and geographies to achieve record gross profit margin for the third consecutive quarter of 33.6%, up 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 330 basis points from the first quarter of 2020.
Our record quarterly gross profit margin, combined with average selling prices well above our expectations and our continued focus on expense control, contributed to record pre-tax income of $359 million in the first quarter of 2021, up over 100% from the prior quarter and up over 300% from the prior year period.
Our quarterly earnings per diluted share of $4.12 were also a record and substantially exceeded our outlook.
Our strong earnings and effective working capital management resulted in cash flow from operations of $161.8 million in the first quarter of 2021 despite $182.8 million of working capital investment.
This is a significant result as we typically use cash in the first quarter as we rebuild working capital from seasonal low fourth quarter levels, compounded by the significant increases in metals costs we are experiencing.
We improved our inventory turn rate to 5.4 times, surpassing our 2020 annual rate and companywide turn goal of 4.7 times.
Our ability to cross-sell inventory among our family of companies, which we believe is the key advantage and differentiator of our model and scale, was a significant contributor to our improved inventory management.
Despite extended mill lead times and inventory shortages, collaboration among our family of companies and strong long-standing relationships with our domestic mills enabled us to source the metal needed by our customers.
Our managers in the field effectively supported our valued customers by ensuring inventory availability while maximizing margin on opportunistic orders.
Our strong cash flow generation and significantly enhanced liquidity position enables us to maintain a flexible capital allocation strategy focused on both growth and stockholder returns.
Our 2021 capital expenditure budget of $245 million includes new buildings and other projects to expand, upgrade and maintain many of our existing operating facilities.
However, when factoring in project delays and extended lead times for equipment due to COVID-19, we believe our potential cash flow outlays for our capital expenditure will be closer to $300 million in 2021 due to the prior year holdover spending.
During the first quarter of 2021, we invested $43.7 million back into our business through capital expenditures, including several growth opportunities to address and exceed our customers' and suppliers' needs.
For instance, we've invested in toll processing expansions in Texas and Kentucky given the significant demand we've experienced in our toll processing capabilities throughout our footprint.
Operations at our Kentucky facility commenced in November 2020 and have been steadily ramping ever since.
Construction continues in Texas on our new greenfield facility focused on carbon steel tolling, which will support increased capacity of our toll processing customers who are primarily metals producers and their end customers.
We're very excited about these opportunities to expand our toll processing service offerings and see many more possibilities in the future for our toll processing capabilities moving forward.
As mentioned on our last call, we are installing energy-efficient lighting and solar panels in certain of our facilities as well as investing in additional innovative processing equipment to continue providing our customers with the highest quality products and services.
We continue to see a healthy pipeline of prospective opportunities, including in adjacent businesses in addition to traditional metals service center businesses as we've broadened our universe of potential acquisition candidates.
Nevertheless, we will maintain our strict transaction criteria, including our focus on quality of earnings when we evaluate any prospective targets to ensure a strong fit within our family of companies.
I will now turn to our stockholder return activity.
During the first quarter of 2021, we paid $44.8 million in dividends to our stockholders.
We've maintained our payment of regular quarterly dividends for 62 consecutive years without ever suspending payments or reducing our dividend rate.
In fact, we've increased our dividend 28 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 10% in the first quarter of 2021.
At March 31, 2021, approximately 2.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.
We expect to remain a prudent allocator of capital by maintaining our flexible approach focused on both growth, which remains our top priority; and stockholder return activities, including opportunistic repurchases of our common stock.
In summary, I am inspired by the strong operational execution demonstrated by the entire Reliance team during the first quarter of 2021.
Our unwavering focus on the core elements of the Reliance business model, including health and safety, pricing discipline, diligent expense control when needed, inventory management, organic growth and innovation, enables us to perform from a position of strength in both good times and bad.
In the current environment characterized by extremely high metal pricing, strong demand from many of our customers and limited metal availability, we believe Reliance remains well positioned to continue generating strong earnings.
Given our strong liquidity position, we look forward to continuing to support the growth and needs of our customers and suppliers while also returning value to our stockholders.
We will continue to support our colleagues, customers, suppliers and communities in a sustainable manner through both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
We remain confident that America is going to need Reliance to rebuild.
Strong demand conditions in the majority of our end markets resulted in our tons sold increasing 11.3% compared to the fourth quarter, which was within our guidance range of up 10% to 12% and above the typical seasonal improvement in shipping volumes we experienced in the first quarter.
While demand is healthy and continues to improve in most markets, our first quarter shipments did not reach pre-pandemic levels and were down 4% from the first quarter of 2020.
However, on a per day basis, our tons sold were down only 2.5%.
We believe underlying demand is stronger than our shipment levels reflect, given many factors holding back economic activity for us, our customers and our suppliers, including metal supply constraints, supply chain disruptions for various components and materials and labor and trucking shortages.
The good news is we expect to fill this demand in future periods and these factors support increased metal pricing.
This strengthened demand, coupled with rising input costs and limited metal availability, resulted in metal prices accelerating throughout the first quarter for many of the products we sell, most notably carbon steel products.
Our average selling price increased 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, exceeding our guidance of up 12% to 14% by a significant margin.
These robust demand and pricing conditions contributed to an all-time high quarterly gross profit margin of 33.6%.
On a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe is the best measure of our day-to-day operating performance, we achieved a record gross profit margin of 37.1%, an increase of 350 basis points compared to the prior quarter and up 600 basis points from the first quarter of 2020.
Way to go, team Reliance.
Our record gross profit margin was the result of outstanding execution by our managers in the field who once again effectively implemented price increases at the time of mill announcement prior to receiving the higher-cost metal into inventory, maintained their focus on higher-margin orders and were very selective given limited metal supply, which enabled us to capture an incremental margin benefit in excess of already strong levels.
I'll now turn to a high-level overview of our key end markets.
Demand for nonresidential construction, which includes infrastructure and is the largest end market we serve, continue to improve with first quarter shipments approaching pre-pandemic levels.
We continue to experience strong quoting activity for projects for big-box retailers, healthcare facilities, schools, large warehouses and data processing centers, among others.
And given our healthy backlogs, quoting activity and positive customer sentiment, we believe demand will remain steady at current solid levels.
We saw continued strength in demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market, surpassing activity levels in both the fourth and first quarters of 2020 with automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills continuing to ramp production.
Importantly, our tolling operations serving the automotive market saw only minimal impacts to date as a result of the global microchip shortage, and we expect tool processing volumes to remain strong.
Demand in heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment continued to improve in the first quarter as our customers increased production levels to meet customer demand and replenish dealer inventories.
Demand for industrial machinery used in manufacturing processes was also strong in the first quarter of 2021.
Absent disruptions for our customers that impact their production, we expect demand to continue at strong levels.
Semiconductor demand during the first quarter continued to strengthen from the fourth quarter, and we expect this to continue.
The semiconductor space continues to be one of our strongest end markets.
Demand in commercial aerospace began to experience limited signs of improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which we believe was the trough of the current cycle.
We expect limited improvement throughout 2021.
On the other hand, demand in the military, defense and space portions of our aerospace business remains strong with backlog improving during the quarter.
We anticipate strong demand continuing in the noncommercial aerospace market for the balance of the year.
Finally, demand in the energy sector, which is mainly oil and natural gas, saw a modest recovery toward the end of the first quarter of 2021.
We anticipate a slight improvement in the second quarter given current oil prices and customers needing to replenish inventory for certain products.
We entered the second quarter of 2021 with strong demand and pricing momentum that creates an environment for us to optimize our model and deliver strong results.
We remain dedicated to partnering with our key customers and suppliers during these extraordinary times, and we can only do this with the continued commitment to health and safety and operational excellence that our Reliance colleagues have demonstrated every day throughout very challenging times.
I'll start with a recap of our quarterly results.
Strong pricing, healthy demand and record gross profit margin contributed to record gross profit dollars, which in turn drove record pre-tax income and record earnings per share.
Turning to our sales.
The significant increase in metal pricing and healthy demand resulted in our first quarter sales increasing 33% over the fourth quarter of 2020.
Compared to the prior year period, our first quarter sales were up over 10%, supported by the strong pricing momentum for most carbon steel products.
As Jim and Karla mentioned, the strong pricing environment, along with our focus on higher-margin orders and continued investments in value-added processing capabilities, collectively resulted in record quarterly gross profit of $953.7 million and a record gross profit margin of 33.6% in the first quarter of 2021.
We incurred LIFO expense of $100 million in the first quarter of 2021.
This compares to LIFO income of $20 million in the first quarter of 2020 and LIFO expense of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
At the end of the first quarter, our LIFO reserve on our balance sheet was $215.6 million.
We revised our annual LIFO expense estimate to $400 million from $340 million primarily due to higher-than-anticipated costs for certain carbon steel products.
Consistent with our accounting policy, we allocate our annual estimate on a pro rata basis in each quarter.
As such, our current projected LIFO expense for the second quarter of 2021 is $100 million.
As in prior years, we will update our expectations each quarter based upon our inventory cost and metal pricing trends.
Now turning to our expenses.
Our SG&A expense was generally consistent with traditional seasonal trends, increasing $54.9 million or 11.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to strong volume and pricing momentum.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly a result of higher incentive-based compensation given our record gross profit and pre-tax income.
Overall, our head count remained relatively consistent with year-end levels.
In comparison to the prior year period, SG&A expense was roughly flat due to lower wages as a result of reduced head count, which was down approximately 8% year-over-year, and was offset by higher incentive compensation due to record earnings levels in the first quarter of 2021 and to a lesser extent, inflationary increases.
We will maintain our disciplined approach to expense management and continue to monitor our expense structure as we progress further into 2021.
Our non-GAAP pre-tax income of $357.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 was the highest in our company's history and represents an increase of $136.5 million or 61.9% from the first quarter of 2020 due to favorable demand and pricing conditions, strong execution and diligent expense management.
Our non-GAAP pre-tax income margin of 12.6% was also a record and exceeded the prior year period by 400 basis points.
Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 25.3%, up from 24.3% in the first quarter of 2020 mainly due to higher profitability.
We currently anticipate a full year 2021 effective income tax rate of 25%.
As a result of all these factors, we generated record quarterly earnings per share of $4.12 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.92 in the first quarter of 2020.
On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter earnings of $4.10 per share significantly exceeded our outlook and were up 104% from $2.01 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 67.3% from $2.45 in the first quarter of 2020.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our operations continue to generate cash despite significantly higher working capital needs.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $161.8 million during the first quarter of 2021 due to our profitable operations and effective working capital management, including our focus on inventory turns.
As of the end of the first quarter, our total debt outstanding was $1.66 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 0.85.
We had no borrowings outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, providing us with ample liquidity to continue executing on all areas of our capital allocation strategy while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.
I'll now turn to our outlook.
While macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we remain optimistic about business conditions with strong underlying demand in the majority of the end markets we serve.
However, factors impacting shipment levels in the first quarter of 2021 such as metal supply constraints and supply chain disruptions for many of our customers will continue to persist in the second quarter of 2021.
Despite these factors, we estimate tons sold will be flat to up 2% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021.
We expect metal pricing will remain near current levels with the potential for further upside in certain products.
Since current metal prices are substantially higher than the average selling price in the first quarter of 2021, we estimate our average selling price per ton sold for the second quarter of 2021 will be up 5% to 7%.
Given the strong demand and pricing fundamentals, we anticipate continued strength in our gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2021.
Based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.20 and to $4.40 for the second quarter of 2021.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record first quarter 2021 operational and financial performance, supported by strong pricing and demand trends as well as excellent execution by all of our colleagues in the field.
These factors collectively resulted in yet another quarter of robust profitability and cash flow, enabling us to continue executing on our capital allocation priorities of investing in the growth of our business and returning value to our stockholders.
","Reliance Steel & Aluminum's first quarter performance was record-setting, marked by a 20% increase in average selling prices, a 33% jump in sales over the fourth quarter of 2020, and a 11.3% increase in tons sold compared to the fourth quarter. The company's resilient business model and strong execution in a favorable market resulted in record gross profit margins, contributing to record pre-tax income of $359 million, up 100% from the prior quarter. The demand in nonresidential construction is improving, and despite disruptions, the demand for toll processing services in the automotive market remains strong. Reliance anticipates strong demand continuing in the noncommercial aerospace market for the rest of the year. The company's gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2021 is expected to remain strong, with average selling prices estimated to be up 5% to 7%. Reliance anticipates non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.20 and $4.40 in the second quarter of 2021. The company remains optimistic about business conditions and is investing in its growth and returning value to stockholders."
LW_q2_2021.txt,"These statements are based on how we see things today.
Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.
Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be -- should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results.
Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment, while Rob will provide some details on our second quarter results as well as some shipment trends for the third quarter.
We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment.
That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities.
Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter.
Overall restaurant traffic in the US was resilient by holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter.
However, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continued to vary widely by channel.
Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats.
Traffic at full service restaurants was 70% to 80% of the prior year levels for much of the quarter.
However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets.
Traffic and demand at non-commercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, healthcare, schools and universities, sports and entertainment, and workplace environment was fairly steady at around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter.
In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year.
Outside the US, restaurant traffic in fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter.
In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture, fry demand during much of the quarter was similar to last year, but softened the 75% to 85% of prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turn colder.
As you may recall, unlike in the US, QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities.
Demand in our other key international markets was mixed.
In China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels.
In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter, but remained well below prior year levels.
Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carryover into our fiscal third quarter.
The sharp resurgence in COVID in the US and Europe has led government to imposed even more rigid social restrictions, In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the northern hemisphere.
Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected.
Major QSR chains in the US should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery.
Retail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home.
And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view.
So on one the hand in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year.
On the other hand, we believe this COVID induced shock to demand is temporary.
We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long term.
As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually less social restrictions.
This should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses.
We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021.
In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemics impacts on our manufacturing operations.
Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend in the planned resumption of our share repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category, as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders.
In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment.
We expect frozen potato demand has softened in the near term due to reduced traffic, following government reimposed, social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather, and we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021.
As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter, as our teams continued to manage through an ever changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks.
For the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million.
Sales volume was down 14% largely due to fry demand at restaurants and foodservice being negatively impacted following government imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID, as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets.
Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the US stabilized at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel.
International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter.
Price mix increased 2% driven by improved price in our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail.
Gross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price mix and productivity savings.
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expect that our manufacturing cost to increase in the quarter.
This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual.
We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemics impact on fry demand.
Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant -- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates.
Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realize the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory.
We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients.
Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low-single digits.
Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations.
As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other cost to shutdown, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID.
Cost associated with modifying production schedules reducing run-times and manufacturing retail products on lines primarily designed for foodservice products and cost per enhancing employee safety and sanitation protocols, as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs.
Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho, as well as lesser ones in some other facilities.
We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder of fiscal 2021.
As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and are no longer disclosing these costs separately.
SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense.
The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT infrastructure, which included about $5 million of non-recurring consulting and training expenses associated with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system.
Equity method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year.
Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better performance by our European joint venture.
However, like in the US, our shipments softened during the latter part of the quarter reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing, social restrictions, as well as colder weather on outdoor dining.
EBITDA, including joint ventures was $213 million which is down $48 million.
The decline was driven by lower income from operations and it was partially offset by higher equity method earnings.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29 largely due to lower income from operations.
EPS was also down due to higher interest expense reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of some debt issuance costs as we paid off the term loan, a year early.
The decline was partially offset by higher equity earnings.
Moving to our segments.
Sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American based QSR and full service restaurant chains, as well as all sales outside of North America were down 12% in the quarter.
Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home, especially in our international markets.
Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the US of which approximately 85% are to QSRs approach prior year levels as QSRs leveraged drive-through and delivery formats.
However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and limited time offering products from the third quarter.
International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, we're at about 80% of prior year levels in the aggregate, but vary by market.
Shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels.
Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America, improved sequentially as customers and distributors in many of these markets were able to right-size inventories, however, they remained well below prior year levels.
Price mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix.
Price alone was flat.
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense declined 28% to $93 million.
Lower sales volume, higher manufacturing costs, and unfavorable mix drove the decline.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter.
Segments to smaller chain and independent full service and quick service restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October, but slowed to 60% to 70% in November, following government's reimposing, social restrictions and as colder weather tempered restaurant traffic in some of our markets.
Shipments to non-commercial customers improved modestly since summer but remain at around 50% of prior year levels, with strength in healthcare more than offset by continued weakness in the other channels.
Price mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020.
Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium Lamb Weston branded ones.
While we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring on a year-over-year basis, it remains a mix headwind.
Foodservices product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million.
Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price.
Sales for our Retail segment increased 7% in the quarter.
Price mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher margin branded portfolio of Alexia, Grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks.
Sales of our branded products were up about 30% which is well above category growth rates, which ranged between 15% and 20%.
The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low margin, private label volume that began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as well as an additional amount that began a couple of months ago.
As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind.
Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million.
The increase was driven by favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position.
We are comfortable with our liquidity positioned and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash.
In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year, due to lower sales and earnings.
We spent $54 million in capex, including expenditures for our new ERP system.
We paid $67 million in dividends and a few weeks ago, announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend.
In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program this quarter.
As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic.
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new three-year $750 million revolver.
At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we prepaid the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November of 2021.
At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver was undrawn.
Our total debt was $2.75 billion and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.1 times.
Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter.
Broadly speaking, in the US, demand at QSRs and at retail are holding up well, while traffic at full service restaurants continues to soften.
Specifically, US shipments in the four weeks ending December 27, were approximately 85% of prior year levels.
In our Global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the US, were more than 95% of prior year levels.
We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter.
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants regional and small QSRs and non-commercial customers in aggregate were 60% to 65% of prior year levels.
That is largely in line with what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter.
We anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining.
Shipments to non-commercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter.
In our Retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded products, partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products.
We believe that this rate will largely continue for the remainder of the quarter.
Outside the US, overall demand has slowed, but it's varied by market.
In Europe, shipments by our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter.
We believe that shipments will continue to soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather.
Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America were mixed.
In aggregate, international shipments so far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter.
As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our Global results.
In short, other than at US QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter, following government's reimposing restrictions to combat the resurgence of COVID, as well as colder weather in our Northern Hemisphere markets limits outdoor dining opportunities.
With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior year.
Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts, on balance, domestic pricing is holding up well.
However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-added oriented products in some international markets and to a lesser extent in some value tiered domestic market segments.
With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate.
We don't see any notable impact on cost outside of inflation.
Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help ease cost pressures there versus last year.
However, we do expect to continue to incur additional cost as a result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations and we expect that we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained.
Now here's Tom for some closing comments.
Let me just quickly sum up by saying while the near-term environment will be volatile.
We believe that the restaurant traffic will gradually recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021.
We'll continue to focus on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers and build upon the long-term health of the category in order to create value for our stakeholders.
","Lamb Weston delivered solid Q2 financial results, with net sales of $896 million despite challenging operating conditions due to COVID-19 restrictions and weather. The decline in sales was primarily attributed to reduced restaurant traffic, impacting fry demand. Gross profit decreased due to higher manufacturing costs from processing older crops and input cost inflation but was partially offset by favorable price mix. Shipments to major QSR chains in the US remained strong, approaching prior year levels. However, demand in Europe softened as governments reimposed restrictions. The company expects softer demand in the near term due to social restrictions and weather but remains optimistic that restaurant traffic will gradually recover by the end of calendar 2021. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 2% and plans to resume its share repurchase program. Lamb Weston is confident in its fundamentals and ability to manage through pandemic impacts, anticipating demand will approach pre-pandemic levels as vaccines become widely available."
TDY_q3_2021.txt,"This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne.
And of course, actual results may differ materially.
I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter.
We achieved record revenue, 75.2% greater than last year, driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 62.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR.
Revenue increased organically in every major business group but was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter.
Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with the third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1 GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year, and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019.
However, excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020.
Cash flow was a third quarter record allowing repayment of $300 million of debt while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3 from 3.7 at the end of the second quarter.
Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter.
Integration efforts have been swift and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne.
We continue to accelerate the pace of plant synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022 as we described in our July earnings call, and compared with 2024 as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021.
Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues, inflation, and other operational challenges.
However, to-date, we have been successfully navigating and managing these issues, and today, we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin, and earnings outlook compared with the outlook we presented in July.
On a full year basis, we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5%, led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in digital imaging, which excludes Teledyne FLIR.
This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from digital imaging, including FLIR.
I will now further comment on the performance of the four business segments.
In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3% largely due to the FLIR acquisition but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%.
Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record and healthcare sales return to pre-pandemic levels.
GAAP segment operating margin was 12.5%, but adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting segment margin was 23.9%.
In our Instrumentation segment overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year.
Sales of test and electronic test and measurement systems, which includes oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels.
Sales of environmental instruments increased 7.6% from last year with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter.
Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter.
In addition, orders were the strongest in the last six quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13.
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3% with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7% driven by 8.4% growth in defense, space, and industrial sales combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter.
GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year.
Finally in the Engineered System segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4% but operating profit and margin declined slightly since we exited the higher margin turbine engine business earlier this year.
But before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook.
For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low-teens to over 20%.
Over the last 2.5 years, we made tremendous progress with it -- with stand -- notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures.
To date, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full-year 2021 forecasted operating margin which excluding acquisition-related charges is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July.
And now to Sue.
I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook.
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million including all acquisition-related costs.
Excluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax, cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020.
Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $29.2 million in 2020.
In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt that is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $551.8 million.
Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020.
Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021.
Turning to our outlook.
Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17.
And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29 and on a non-GAAP basis $16.35 to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50.
The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.9%.
In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.
I'll now pass the call back to Robert.
","Teledyne Technologies achieved remarkable financial performance in the third quarter, driven by organic growth and the integration of Teledyne FLIR. Revenue surged by 75.2%, with organic growth contributing 11.9%. The Digital Imaging segment saw a significant increase in sales, particularly in commercial and government imaging. The Instrumentation segment experienced strong demand in electronic test and measurement instrumentation and environmental instruments. The Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment benefited from improved defense sales. Excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings per share increased by 61.9% to $4.34. Despite supply chain and inflationary challenges, Teledyne has successfully navigated these issues and increased its full-year sales, margin, and earnings outlook. The company expects organic sales growth of approximately 7.0% to 7.5%, with total sales reaching $4.59 billion. Teledyne's ongoing margin improvement journey has resulted in a forecasted 2021 operating margin of 21%, with full-year GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share expected to range from $9.13 to $9.29 and $16.35 to $16.45, respectively."
WSM_q4_2021.txt,"Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimates and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations.
The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.
Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results.
We're thrilled to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2021, driving record results with a Q4 comp of 10.8% and operating margin expansion of 310 basis points.
These results reflect the resilience in our business model as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges within the supply chain, material and labor shortage and capacity limitations from our incredible consumer demand.
This resilience, coupled with continued execution in our growth initiatives, fueled an annual comp of 22%, operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, and earnings per share growth of 64% to $14.85 per share.
Our three key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy, and our values, continue to provide the framework for execution both in our core business and in our growth areas like B2B, marketplace, cross-brands, and our global business, which excitingly have all gained traction faster than predicted and demonstrate to us that we are well-positioned to continue to take share in this industry.
First, let's spend some time on our top-line performance in the fourth quarter.
Throughout fiscal 2021, we continued a deliberate reduction in our sitewide promotional cadence in all of our brands.
Instead, we shifted our focus on delivering aspirational and inspirational content, and our customers clearly responded.
This pricing power is entirely a function of our differentiated and sustainable product offering that our customers know and love.
And further, despite the highly promotional environment in the fourth quarter, we made a conscious decision to maintain this pricing integrity and not pursue incremental top line at the cost of our merchandise margins.
In fact, we delivered gross margin expansion of 290 basis points in the quarter.
Further, this pricing power has allowed us the flexibility to absorb supply chain costs and aggressively fund marketing efforts.
Our bottom-line performance in the fourth quarter speaks for itself.
We drove operating margin of 21% and a 37% increase in EPS, both of which demonstrate the durability of our earnings power through execution in our core and growth initiatives, which I'm excited to update you on now.
Our B2B business continues to outperform, building its book of business to $753 million in 2021.
B2B is an underserved and fractured industry as we continue to take share in this white space, servicing businesses that need high-quality, sustainable furnishings at good price points.
Furthermore, our in-house design capabilities offering the wide breadth of aesthetics across our brands, coupled with our industry-leading global sourcing and supply chain operations, allows us to take this service to the next level.
Our B2B business has tremendous potential to contribute to our results.
Our growth targets continue to climb as we unlock new opportunities.
And not only is our B2B business model accretive to our gross margin but even more accretive to op margin as a result of the fixed operating costs.
We continue to exceed our own expectations for this business.
And longer term, we believe this is one of our biggest opportunities.
Another contributor to our success has been our global strategy.
We're franchise first with strong retail and digital execution.
During 2021, global achieved record revenue up 23% over last year with strong earnings growth.
Core company-owned markets of Canada and U.K. achieved record results for the year and the quarter.
Franchise continues to be a growth vehicle with the critical markets of the Middle East, Mexico, and India providing a large diverse growth base.
With our systems investment in our new digital platform and large cost reductions in warehousing, transportation, and delivery, we expect to exceed our record results in 2022.
Marketing is another component that sets us apart and drove results in FY '21.
Customers who shop across our brands generate three to four times more revenue than the single brand customer.
And we've seen incredible results this past year due to our continued marketing efforts.
In fiscal '21, approximately 60% of our sales came from cross-brand customers, a record high in terms of percent to total.
And our cross-brand customer counts grew faster than those of the single-brand customer.
While new customer acquisition is always a priority and continues to grow, we believe we have even more upside by increasing our share of wallet with our existing customer base.
Core to this strategy are three things.
First, our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key.
We continue to see record levels of customer engagement and an all-time high membership.
Second, our recently launched cross-brand credit card.
This card reached its six-month anniversary, producing cardholder spend and cross-brand activity that has exceeded our expectations.
And third, we are focused on personalization efforts in our digital marketing.
We continue to leverage our in-house managed first-party data across our brands, which positions us for the cookieless future that is rapidly approaching.
Remember, our multifaceted loyalty program generates benefits across our portfolio and is a clear competitive advantage a few of our peers offer.
As a digital-first company, we are in constant pursuit of incremental improvement to our customers' shopping journey online.
We've improved several product finding and purchasing experiences on our website, from improved room styling, native registry applications, and the removal of friction in the checkout process.
Additionally, we relentlessly focus on continued optimization and automation in our DCs and logistics networks to improve our service time.
On the sustainability front, we take great pride in the progress we are making with our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishings industry.
Notable accomplishments in this quarter included our second annual inclusion in Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index, being recognized as No.
21 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and receiving an A rating from CDP for leadership in supplier engagement and our work with suppliers on tackling climate change.
These commitments are reflected in the high-quality sustainable products that we offer our customers and continue to distinguish our company and our brands.
Our values are both central in our actions and embedded in our products.
We always want to provide our customers with transparency.
And each day, we commit ourselves to maintaining the highest level of integrity and ethical standards.
We are deeply saddened by the war in Ukraine, and we stand with Ukrainians and all people who oppose war and its atrocities on family and the home.
Related to product and business with Russia, we have no operations in Russia.
And as the situation between Russia and Ukraine escalated, our team identified a handful of products of Russian origin, which we are no longer selling.
And now let's turn to the performance of our brands.
West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp in the fourth quarter with all categories driving strong growth.
Customers responded well to new products, including best-sellers in bedroom, dining, storage, and occasional categories.
Additionally, new categories such as bath, kids, and kitchen also contributed to incremental growth.
On the full year, West Elm delivered a comp of 33.1%, building to a 48.3% on a two-year basis and continuing to build velocity in its mission to become a $3 billion brand.
Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a 16.2% comp, driven by strong core franchises in key categories.
Q4 results were enhanced by a strong seasonal decorating business and inspiring seasonal bedding and entertaining.
On the full year, Pottery Barn celebrated a record year with a comp of 23.9%, building to a 39.1% on a two-year basis.
Also, we're delighted to report that Pottery Barn has surpassed the halfway mark on its commitment to plant 3 million trees in three years to restore vulnerable forests.
Our partner, Arbor Foundation, follows the best practices and the latest science to ensure maximum impact and promote biodiversity.
And even better, based on the tremendous success of this program, our other brands have joined the effort, doubling our commitment to planting 6 million trees by 2023.
We couple this with commitments to responsibly harvest wood and a robust sustainability story.
Now I'd like to talk about Pottery Barn Kids and Teen.
As we indicated during our third quarter call, we were not entirely immune to the ripple effect from delays resulting from the supply chain disruption around the world.
In particular, the shutdown in related backlogs from Vietnam had a larger impact on our children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 6.1% comp for the quarter.
Unfortunately, we expect to feel this impact at least through the second quarter this year.
Despite the supply chain pressure, strength in the business includes our baby business, which is delivering growth through our offering of GREENGUARD Gold furniture, along with additional volume from our in-store and online baby registry.
Also, we delivered record results in our seasonal trim business as customers enjoy the holidays.
Pottery Barn Kids and Teen delivered a full year comp of 11.6%, building to a 28.2% on a two-year basis.
Our Williams-Sonoma business drove a fourth quarter comp of 4.5% on top of a 26.2% comp last year, with growth driven by demand for entertaining at home and gift-giving.
We continue to focus our strategy on expanding our exclusive product and Williams-Sonoma branded product to drive growth.
We are pleased with improvements in the digital experience on the website that are driving conversion, and our store optimization strategy is working.
Our high-impact store remodels and our market consolidation efforts are driving improved operating margins.
On the full year, Williams-Sonoma delivered a comp of 10.5%, building to a 34.3% on a two-year basis.
One of our key components of growth is our Williams-Sonoma Home business.
Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category, and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is one of our biggest growth opportunities.
In summary, we're immensely proud of our accomplishments and record results this fiscal year.
I am confident that we will continue to raise the bar and extend this momentum in fiscal 2022.
So far, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales and margins.
We have a robust lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for this year.
And as we look further, we are confident in our long-term outlook, driving at least mid- to high single-digit comps with top-line growth to $10 billion by 2024 and operating margins relatively in line with fiscal 2021.
I'm endlessly grateful for their outstanding work, their creative energy, and their relentless focus.
I am privileged to work alongside this talented group of people.
We are pleased to report another quarter and fiscal year of outstanding financial results with revenues and profits at the highest levels we have seen.
The demand for our proprietary products remains strong.
Our growth strategies continue to thrive.
Our operating model, which is difficult to replicate, continues to set us apart from the competition.
And all of these, plus our proven ability to dynamically operate in a complex macro environment, continues to demonstrate that we are well-positioned to succeed long term in this industry.
Moving to our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Net revenues surpassed $2.5 billion with another quarter of double-digit comparable brand revenue growth at 10.8%.
These strong top-line results were across both channels, including retail at a 20% comp and e-commerce at a 7.2% comp on top of last year's 47.9% for a 55.1% two-year stack.
By brand, West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp on top of 25.2% last year.
Pottery Barn accelerated from the third quarter to a 16.2% comp.
Williams-Sonoma drove a 4.5% comp on top of last year's 26.2%.
And our emerging brands accelerated to a 30.3% comp.
In the children's home furnishings businesses, Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, comps were a negative 6.1%.
This is below their third quarter year-to-date trend of approximately 20% as these brands were the most impacted during the fourth quarter by the supply chain issues from the COVID-related closure of Vietnam.
Moving down the income statement.
Gross margin came in at a record 45%, a 290-basis-point expansion over last year.
The strength of our merchandise margins drove almost all or 270 basis points of this expansion.
Our strategic decision to preserve our pricing integrity by eliminating sitewide promotions was once again a clear success.
This pricing power enabled us to absorb increased freight and product costs while still delivering strong, profitable merchandise sales.
Occupancy costs at 7.7% of net revenues leveraged approximately 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth.
Occupancy dollars increased 6.7% to approximately $193 million, which includes a full quarter of incremental costs from our new East Coast distribution center to further support our customer demand, partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization efforts from additional store closures and reduced rent.
In fiscal year '21, we closed an additional 37 stores and are on track to close approximately 25% of our total retail fleet.
SG&A also leveraged 20 basis points to a historical low of 24% despite absorbing higher year-over-year advertising costs from our reduced spend last year.
Leverage was driven by employment and general expenses, which includes lower incentive compensation during the quarter due to timing and the year-over-year benefit from our ongoing retail recovery, various operational efficiencies during the holiday season, and overall strong financial discipline throughout.
As a result, we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 28% to $525 million and our highest ever operating margin at 21%, expanding 310 basis points over last year and approximately 500 basis points higher than our last three quarters this year.
This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $5.42, up 37% from last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $3.95.
These fourth quarter results, combined with our outperformance we have seen throughout 2021, allowed us to deliver another year of substantial growth and outperformance.
On the top line, these full year highlights include an additional $1.5 billion in net revenues, growing to over $8.2 billion, including comparable brand revenue growth of 22% on top of last year's 17% or a 39% two-year stack; e-commerce growing to a 14.3% comp and a 58.8% two-year comp with our e-commerce mix at 66% of total revenues; retail growing at a 43.2% comp despite traffic levels at negative 16% to 2019; a second consecutive year of double-digit growth across all brands with significant acceleration across our two largest brands, with West Elm at a 33.1% comp, Pottery Barn at a 23.9% comp, Williams-Sonoma at a 10.5% comp on top of last year's 23.8%; our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivering another year of accelerating double-digit growth; our global business growing 23% to over $425 million; and our cross-brand initiatives outperforming with our business-to-business division growing 109% to over $750 million in demand and contributing approximately 500 basis points to our total company comp.
On the bottom line, this top-line strength and strong financial discipline throughout enabled us to grow 2021 operating income to $1.5 billion, over $0.5 billion and 52% higher than last year.
Operating margin at 17.7% on the year expanded 350 basis points over last year and was more than two times higher than our 2019 and prior operating margin levels.
This was driven by gross margins expanding to record levels or 500 basis points above last year to 44% despite increased costs associated with supply chain disruptions throughout the year.
This operating income strength resulted in earnings per share of $14.85, which was $5.81 or 64% above last year and drove our return on invested capital to an all-time high at 57.9%.
On the balance sheet, we ended the year with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $850 million and no debt or amounts outstanding on our line of credit.
The strength of our business generated operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2021, which has allowed us to fund the operations of the business, to invest over $225 million in capital expenditures primarily in technology and supply chain, and to return nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders in the form of $188 million in dividends and 900 million in share repurchases.
These decisions reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our growth and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.
Moving down the balance sheet.
Merchandise inventories were $1.246 billion, increasing 24% over last year, which includes inventory in transit.
Inventory on hand increased 14.8% but was still negative 13% on a two-year basis.
Given the significant macro supply chain disruptions throughout the year and the ongoing strong customer demand, we are still below optimal levels.
As a result, we expect to see elevated back-order levels continue until the back half of 2022.
Now let me turn to our expectations for the future.
As Laura said, we remain very optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business.
Our business remains strong as we enter Q1 with momentum in our core businesses and our growth initiatives continuing.
As a result, for both fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we are reiterating our previously provided financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit comp growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021.
We estimate revenues will reach $10 billion by fiscal year 2024, with our brands accelerating or reaching our prior committed targets faster, including Pottery Barn expanding to $3.5 billion in revenues; West Elm adding $1 billion in revenues to over $3.3 billion; Williams-Sonoma will reach almost $1.6 billion in revenues, and our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen businesses will grow to $1.4 billion.
This expected top-line growth will also be fueled by growth across our strategic initiatives, such as our B2B business doubling to $1.5 billion in revenues, our marketplace business growing 20% annually to nearly $700 million, our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over $600 million, and our global operations continuing to expand in size to $700 million.
And we are confident we can drive this top-line growth profitably due to leverage across the P&L from ongoing higher sales growth; additional accretion from our accelerating growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin profile; an accelerating shift online where the operating margin is higher; strong merchandise margins from the pricing power our proprietary and vertically integrated products provide; continued occupancy leverage from further store closures and reduced rents; various long-term supply chain efficiencies, such as automation and better in-stock inventory levels; and leverage from overall strong financial discipline throughout, keeping expense growth below sales growth.
Our capital-allocation plans for 2022 will continue to first prioritize investments into the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders.
We expect to invest approximately $350 million in the business, with over 80% of the spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives primarily to support e-commerce, including the addition of a new automated distribution center in Arizona.
We also expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and elevated share repurchases.
For dividends, we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend, up 10% or $0.07 to $0.78 per share.
We also announced our Board has approved a new share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, which will replace the remaining amount outstanding under our prior authorization.
We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability.
This new authorization will allow us the flexibility to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term financial returns.
As we begin our next fiscal year, our focus remains on executing against our opportunities to drive long-term elevated top and bottom-line growth.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably.
Long-term macro trends should continue to favor our business, including a strong housing market driving ongoing investment in the home, an accelerating shift to e-commerce, and the increasing importance to the consumer of sustainability and being a values-driven company.
And this, combined with our accelerating growth initiatives, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders.
It is their ongoing commitment that has enabled us to deliver another year of financial outperformance and to reward all of our stakeholders.
","The company reported a strong finish to fiscal 2021, with a record-breaking Q4 revenue of $2.5 billion and a 10.8% increase in comparable brand revenue. Cross-brand customer sales contributed significantly to this growth, accounting for approximately 60% of total sales. The company maintained pricing integrity despite promotional activity in the quarter, expanding gross margin by 290 basis points. Operating margin expanded to 21% and diluted earnings per share increased by 37% to $5.42. The full year also saw impressive performance, with annual comparable brand revenue growth of 22%, operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, and earnings per share growth of 64% to $14.85 per share. The company's growth initiatives, including its B2B and global strategies, continue to gain traction and are expected to drive future growth. The company remains optimistic about its long-term outlook, reiterating its guidance of mid- to high single-digit comp growth and operating margins in line with fiscal 2021 levels. Capital allocation will continue to prioritize investments in technology, the supply chain, and dividends, along with elevated share repurchases."
FLR_q4_2020.txt,"There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially.
You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in our Form 10-K filed earlier today.
My first two official months back at Fluor have been extremely busy.
The immediate priority was to reset and communicate our longer-term strategy and the corresponding organizational structure.
As you know, we announced the new Fluor management team in January.
Our collective focus is on the end markets where we have the right technical expertise to add value for our clients, while earning a suitable return for our shareholders.
The recent changes that have been implemented align our business around the strategic priorities identified for Fluor in the near term.
As a reminder, our four strategic priorities are to: number one, drive growth across the portfolio; two, pursue contracts with fair and balanced terms; three, foster a high-performance culture with purpose; and four, reinforce financial discipline.
For a longer-term view of Fluor's opportunities and key focus areas, please tune in to our Strategy Day from last month if you haven't had a chance to view it yet.
Strategy Day kicked off one of the more exciting eras of change and growth in Fluor's long history.
And we are confident that the strategic plan as outlined will deliver a directional earnings range between $3 and $3.50 per share by 2024.
We ended the year with a backlog of $25.6 billion and full year new awards of $9 billion.
New awards clearly reflected the impact of the pandemic and its pressure on our clients.
They also reflect our stringent pursuit criteria and strategy to reduce risk.
Across our end markets, we saw clients delay capital spending plans while they waited for uncertainty from the pandemic to subside.
Based on conversations with our clients, we are starting to see positive momentum and expect to see new awards pick up in the second half of 2021.
We continue to see good prospects across our portfolio and are completing front-end work scopes to populate our future backlog.
However, lower awards in 2020 will create a headwind for 2021 earnings.
Before talking about what we are seeing for 2021, I want to reinforce that the people of Fluor have tackled the challenges of 2020 with a resilience and energy that was unmatched.
These challenges have made us all more adaptive, and I believe that the organization is truly motivated to successfully take the company forward into its next chapter.
Now let's turn to our business lines and how we are aligning our priorities with the opportunities ahead.
Turning to Slide 4.
As we move into 2021, our urban solutions end markets are gaining momentum, specifically, in mining.
We are seeing high demand for metals such as copper and iron ore.
Last year, we booked a significant North American steel project as well as several front-end studies that we expect will convert to follow-on EPCM awards in late 2021 and beyond.
Late last year, we achieved patent completion for the BHP Spence copper project in Chile.
We've had a long-term relationship supporting BHP's capital efforts, and we are proud to be completing another successful project for them.
We are also encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in our advanced technologies and life sciences end markets.
Here, we are pursuing data centers and semiconductor opportunities in North America and major life sciences prospects in Europe.
In addition, Fluor has just been selected for a large biotech project in Europe, and we are finalizing contract details now.
This confirms our strategy to leverage front-end technical solutions into full EPC awards.
Contract signature is expected by the end of Q1 2021, and we look forward to sharing more specifics at that time.
Advanced technologies and life sciences is well positioned to support our clients for advanced manufacturing projects.
This includes opportunities arising from the U.S. government's executive order that is focused on the domestic supply chain for critical materials, including semiconductors, batteries, pharmaceuticals and rare earth elements.
Moving to Slide 5.
In Infrastructure, we are well positioned for select opportunities in the U.S. due to urbanization and an aging infrastructure system.
Furthermore, we believe these opportunities could be enhanced with the introduction of a federal infrastructure spending bill.
As a reminder and as messaged previously, infrastructure margins will be under pressure as legacy zero-margin projects are worked down through the year.
Approximately 35% of our infrastructure revenue will come from zero-margin work in 2021.
As we discussed during Strategy Day, we will be very selective in the infrastructure projects we pursue in the future.
Each pursuit must have the right scope, the right client, the right location, the right contract terms, the right size and, importantly, the right execution team and resources.
Our goal is to deliver predictable earnings and not chase top line growth.
This will be especially apparent in our infrastructure pursuits going forward.
Turning to Slide 6.
The management team is very excited about the work we are doing in Mission Solutions and the opportunities we see in supporting our government clients going forward.
As you know, we are keenly focused on growing our presence in the intelligence, cyber and mission-critical infrastructure and operations markets.
Furthermore, we continue to support the DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration with its nuclear security, environmental remediation and energy projects and operations.
We expect that work to be a strong baseload for Fluor in the coming years.
While we are optimistic about our prospects in Energy Solutions in 2021, we don't expect our clients to resume capital spending at a meaningful pace until later in 2021 and beyond.
We are having productive conversations with our energy clients and are well positioned to meet their growing needs.
Importantly here, we are living in an ever-changing world, and Fluor continues to enhance its capabilities in the energy transition space.
We fully expect this market to begin a larger part of our prospect pipeline as clients pivot themselves toward a lower carbon economy.
Next, our chemicals clients see recovery in key sectors of the market, which are anticipated to translate into additional capital expenditures.
This includes the specialty chemicals market, where we continue to see positive signs of investment with our existing clients and significant activity with ongoing pursuits.
Also, future consumer demand in the battery market is translating into additional client investments associated with lithium and related battery chemicals.
Now let me give you a brief update on some of our key projects, starting with LNG Canada.
Moving to Slide 8.
At our Strategy Day, Project Director Phil Park gave a full update on the good progress at LNG Canada and Kitimat.
Earlier this month, the project received approval for its construction ramp-up plan from the Office of the Public Health Officer and Northern Health.
We are coordinating with government and health authorities as our workforce on site increases, and we focus on our spring and summer construction program.
Moving on to the Purple Line project.
As mentioned on the third quarter call, a settlement was reached between our Purple Line JV and the Maryland Transit Authority.
We received the first payment in the fourth quarter and expect a second payment in the second half of 2021.
This month, the design-build team for the Tappan Zee bridge filed a lawsuit against the New York State Throughway Authority for unapproved change orders.
As a team, we agreed we had exhausted all other options for resolution and believe we are owed compensation.
While we don't have a timeline for the resolution of these legal actions, we will keep you updated as the situation proceeds.
With respect to our two challenged government projects, I'm pleased to report that on the Radford project, we have turned overall 113 systems to our clients, and we are essentially complete.
The F.E. Warren project continues to make steady progress.
Finally, we remain confident in the viability of our NuScale initiatives.
And as stated last month, we are currently evaluating new investors and looking to reduce our ownership stake and capitalize on this clean energy investment.
I'm very encouraged by the levels of interest we are seeing and believe that NuScale can provide sizable returns for Fluor over time.
The main topic I'll discuss today are: One, an overview of our 2020 financial performance; Two, an update on our liquidity and financial position; Three, an update on our initiatives; and Four, our outlook for 2021.
You'll see that today's results are presented in alignment with our old reporting segments and includes Stork as part of continuing operations.
Starting with our Q1 2021 results, we will be presenting our financials aligned with our three new business segments: Urban Solutions, Mission Solutions and Energy Solutions.
At that time, we also expect to report Stork as discontinued operations.
We will maintain another segment which will principally represent NuScale.
Our Radford and F.E. Warren projects will move back into Mission Solutions.
As David said, Radford is essentially complete with all 113 systems turned over to BAE, while Warren will flow through at zero margin until its completion.
Turning to Slide 10.
For 2020, Fluor reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Fluor of $294 million or a loss of $2.09 per diluted share.
During the year, we recognized the following significant charges, most of which were recorded in quarter one: $298 million for impairments of goodwill and tangible assets, investments and other assets; $60 million for current expected credit losses associated with Energy & Chemicals clients; $146 million for impairments of assets held for sale included in discontinued operations, of which $12 million related to goodwill; as well as significant forecast revisions for project positions due to COVID-19-related schedule delay and associated cost growth.
Corporate G&A expenses for 2020 was $241 million, up from $166 million a year ago.
For the full year, $47 million was due to foreign exchange currency losses predominantly driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar, and $42 million was attributable to the professional fees associated with the 2020 internal review.
Our increased compensation expense of 2020 was primarily due to the impact of a higher price on stock-based compensation as our share price increased from the date of the grant to the end of the year.
We achieved an estimated run rate savings of $140 million annually in our overhead expenses due to actions taken in 2020.
It's important to note that these savings are spread across the business lines and in corporate overhead.
As I mentioned last month, we expect to achieve an additional $100 million of annual savings over the next three years as we rationalize overhead to the new shape of our business.
During the fourth quarter, we exited two of our European infrastructure P3 investments and received cash of approximately $20 million.
We also have two North American joint ventures that we expect to exit later in 2021.
Moving to Slide 11.
Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion, up from 2019.
Domestic available cash represented 32% of this total.
We expect to see our cash holding steady around $2 billion through the year, with debt retirement being offset by divestitures and the liquidity improvement measures we have discussed in the past.
Operating cash flow for the full year was $186 million, which included approximately $375 million of cash to fund our legacy projects.
Additionally, our debt-to-capitalization requirement on this amendment facility was expanded to 0.65 times, which gives us more flexibility in current borrowing capacity as we assess our capital needs moving forward.
We believe this is the appropriate size facility we need to support our business given the shift in our strategy as well as another good example of our efforts we are making around the organization to make Fluor fit for purpose.
In 2020, we continued the process of monetizing our investment in AMECO, an equipment rental business; earlier in the year, we sold our operations in Jamaica, closed our operations in Mexico and sold the equipment rental business owned by Stork.
We announced on our Strategy Day call that we have received a letter of intent for our AMECO North America business and are now reviewing options for the remaining South America business.
Our two main financial priorities in 2021 are further stabilizing our capital structure, which we plan to primarily do with debt retirement and divestitures, and booking a pipeline of work that fits our revised pursuit criteria and our strategies.
We are introducing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.50 to $0.80 per diluted share for continuing operations.
This excludes NuScale-related expenses and any impact from foreign currency gains or losses, restructuring or impairments.
This also reflects Stork being a discontinued operation.
As David said, we expect to see new awards begin to pick up in the back half of 2021 with significant earnings per share growth in 2022 as we begin to work these projects.
Though we do not give quarterly guidance, Q1 results have historically reflected higher G&A expenses.
While we are seeing green shoots around the business, the lingering effects of the pandemic will continue to keep awards depressed for the next few months.
Furthermore, our existing backlog is still being impacted by the pandemic.
Though our projects are back online for the most part, government restrictions have slowed down our progress and the rate at which we are able to grow our clients.
Turning to Slide 13.
Our assumptions for 2021 include: a slight decline in revenue as compared to 2020, adjusted G&A expense of approximately $40 million to $50 million per quarter and a tax rate of approximately 28%.
We anticipate average full year margins of 2% to 3% in Urban Solutions, 2.5% to 3% in Mission Solutions and margins of 2.5% to 3.5% in Energy Solutions and improving as the year progresses.
These margins include the remaining impact of zero-margin work flowing through the business.
We also anticipate 2021 capital expenditures to be below $100 million as we divest our AMECO business this year.
As David reaffirmed, we maintain our long-term guidance of $3 to $3.50 of earnings per share by 2024.
We are taking the necessary first steps by strengthening our balance sheet and focusing our growth on end markets where we see the best opportunities for revenue and margin expansion.
With the COVID headwinds starting to subside, we will see a resumption of project awards to drive our profits over the next several years.
Operator, we're ready for our first question.
","Fluor Corporation reported a 2020 net loss of $294 million, reflecting impairments and COVID-19 impacts. Moving forward, the company is prioritizing balance sheet stability through debt retirement and divestitures. For 2021, Fluor anticipates booking a pipeline of projects that align with its revised pursuit criteria, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.80. This guidance excludes NuScale expenses, foreign currency fluctuations, restructuring, or impairments. Despite lower awards in 2020 creating a headwind for 2021 earnings, Fluor remains optimistic about growth in the second half of the year. The company is well-positioned in end markets such as urban solutions (e.g., mining, advanced technologies, life sciences), infrastructure, mission solutions (e.g., intelligence, cyber), and energy solutions. Fluor expects NuScale initiatives to provide significant returns over time and is evaluating new investors to capitalize on its clean energy investment. The company anticipates average full-year margins of 2-3% in Urban Solutions, 2.5-3% in Mission Solutions, and 2.5-3.5% in Energy Solutions, improving as the year progresses. Fluor maintains its long-term guidance of earnings per share between $3 and $3.50 by 2024, as COVID headwinds gradually subside and project awards resume to drive profitability."
CIR_q4_2020.txt,"I'm joined today by Scott Buckhout, CIRCOR's president and CEO; and Abhi Khandelwal, the company's chief financial officer.
These expectations are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by today's remarks.
You can find a full discussion of these factors in CIRCOR's Form 10-K, 10-Qs and other SEC filings also located on our website.
2020 was another transformational year for CIRCOR.
And despite the continued challenges presented by COVID-19, our team made significant progress on executing our strategic plan.
I'm proud of the resilience and efforts of the entire CIRCOR team in navigating such a challenging year while continuing to deliver for our customers and shareholders.
s we saw throughout the year, our diversified product portfolio across multiple end markets and geographies helped mitigate the impact of a weaker macro environment.
Our defense business delivered strong results for the year, which mostly offset lower demand for our commercial products.
Our differentiated technology and market positions enabled us to increase prices across the portfolio.
We executed well throughout this year's downturn and exited the year with positive momentum.
With the health and safety of our employees as our foundation, we focus on the things we control.
We achieved decremental margins of 25% for the year through value-based pricing and difficult but necessary cost actions of $45 million.
Aerospace and defense improved their margins by 290 basis points despite lower volume.
Notably, aerospace and defense won 20 new programs, including 60 defense and four in commercial.
We continue to implement the CIRCOR operating system across the company, resulting in improved operational performance.
CIRCOR is well positioned to take advantage of an eventual market recovery in 2021 and beyond.
With the sale of instrumentation and sampling and distributed valves earlier in the year, our exit from upstream oil and gas is complete.
We continue to invest in innovation, launching 49 new products in 2020 versus 33 in 2019.
We delivered on our free cash flow commitments throughout the year and ended with strong free cash flow of $20 million in the fourth quarter.
And finally, we reduced our debt by $126 million or 22%.
I want to highlight some new mission-critical technology we introduced in 2020.
On the defense side, our new missile arming switches are designed to operate in more severe environments with respect to temperature, radiation and G-force.
We launched self arming switches in support of various missile programs, including hypersonic applications.
On the commercial side, we introduced a switch, which activates the aircraft's location transmitter in case of an in-flight emergency.
In industrial, we launched a series of new gas pressure reduction systems to help our customers in Marine, Medical and public utility industries.
These systems help our customers transport and manage high-pressure industrial gas, LNG and CNG, biomethane fuels and medical oxygen.
Now, I'd like to provide some financial highlights from the fourth quarter.
We booked orders of $168 million in the quarter, which was flat sequentially and down 25% organically.
Sequentially, industrial was up 12% in the quarter.
A&D had lower orders sequentially, down 21% and due to the timing of large naval program orders that pushed into 2021.
Revenue in the quarter was $208 million, up 10% sequentially, driven by strong defense deliveries, mainly on U.S. Naval programs and moderate growth across most end markets in industrial.
Adjusted operating income was $23 million, representing a margin of 11.2%, up 200 basis points from the prior quarter.
Margin improvement was driven by sequential volume recovery, pricing, cost actions and productivity.
As a result of improved operating income, the company delivered $0.66 of adjusted earnings per share.
Finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $20 million during the fourth quarter, as we exited the year with operational cash flow unencumbered by transformation disbursements.
We are providing both comparisons due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on our end markets and year-over-year comparison.
Starting with industrial on Slide 4.
In Q4, industrial segment orders were up 12% sequentially, down 22% organically.
The industrial segment saw a sequential recovery in all major end markets, driven by opening economies.
Revenue in the quarter was $131 million, up 4% from prior quarter and down 13% organically.
Sequential improvement was primarily driven by strength in aftermarket sales across the portfolio.
We exited the year with an operating margin of 9%, a sequential improvement of 160 basis points, driven by price increases and cost actions taken throughout the year.
Lower sales volume continued to drive a lower operating margin versus prior year.
Turning to Slide 5.
Our aerospace and defense segment booked orders of $47 million in the quarter, down 21% sequentially and down 33% versus prior year.
Both declines are primarily driven by timing of large defense program orders and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our commercial business.
We remain confident in the segment's growth outlook in 2021.
Revenue in the quarter was $78 million, up 25% from prior quarter.
Strong defense deliveries mostly offset the COVID-19 impact, on commercial Aerospace, resulting in only 3% lower revenues versus by year.
Finally, operating margin was 24% in the quarter, roughly flat sequentially and year over year.
Pricing, up 3%, combined with factory and cost actions drove strong margins in line with prior year despite lower revenue.
Moving to Slide 6.
For Q4, the effective tax rate was approximately 14%.
The company took a non-cash charge of approximately $15 million to record a valuation allowance against its remaining deferred tax assets in Germany.
This non-cash charge is acquired under GAAP accounting rules.
This charge does not impact our non-GAAP after tax results for the quarter and is not expected to have an impact on our future non-GAAP after tax results.
Looking at special items and restructuring charges, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of $13.4 million in the quarter.
The acquisition-related amortization and depreciation was a charge of $12 million with the remaining charges associated with restructuring activities in the quarter.
Interest expense for the quarter was $8.5 million, down $2.3 million compared to last year as a result of lower debt balances.
Other income was approximately $1 million, primarily driven by pension income.
Finally, corporate costs were $7.8 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7.
As Scott mentioned previously, our free cash flow was $20 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% compared to 2019.
Free cash flow was positively impacted by improved operating income and lower working capital, particularly inventory.
Reducing working capital remains one of our top priorities, and we expect further improvement in 2021.
We used the proceeds from the sale of our instrumentation and sampling business to reduce our net debt to $443 million, a reduction of $126 million or 22% year over year.
Free cash flow generated in 2021 will be used to further pay down debt and we continue to target leverage ratio of two to two and a half tiems net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
Now, I will hand it back over to Scott to provide some color on our end markets.
Let's start with our industrial outlook on Slide 8.
As Abhi mentioned, signs of order recovery were evident in the fourth quarter across most major industrial end markets after hitting the bottom in Q3.
Geographically, we continue to see growth in China and India, and we started to see signs of recovery in Europe and North America in the quarter.
Downstream orders were up sequentially, driven by an increase in aftermarket orders, but down significantly versus last year due to a difficult compare.
We're expecting Q1 industrial revenue to come in between down 1% and up 4% year over year.
We expect to see a normal seasonal dip in revenue sequentially in Q1 versus Q4.
We're starting to see improvement in our short-cycle end markets, including machinery manufacturing, chemical processing and wastewater as consumer demand starts to improve.
We're also expecting a mid-single-digit increase in aftermarket as global economies open up and consumption increases.
Downstream oil and gas revenue is expected to be down as refiners continue to manage capex.
We're seeing a similar customer capex dynamic across midstream oil and gas, power generation and building construction, but to a lesser degree.
We expect these end markets to improve further as the year unfolds.
Pricing is expected to be a benefit of roughly 1%, consistent with prior quarters.
Moving to aerospace and defense.
aerospace and defense orders in Q4 were down sequentially and versus prior year.
Both declines were primarily driven by the timing of large defense program orders and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our commercial businesses.
We expect order strength across our defense programs to continue through 2021, driven largely by the joint strike fighter and multiple missile and drone programs.
We expect a modest improvement in commercial orders as aircraft utilization improves and OEM production rates increased through the year.
We remain confident in this segment's growth outlook in 2021.
Revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down 7% to 12% versus prior year.
defense revenue is expected to be down 1% to 5% due to the timing of large defense shipments and lower U.S. defense spares orders leading into the quarter.
We anticipate growth of 5% to 10% from our other OEM group, which includes products for drones, missiles and helicopters.
in the Rafal fighter and jet in Europe.
Commercial revenue is expected to be down between 35% and 40%, in line with the broader commercial aerospace market.
Our market position on both Boeing and Airbus aircraft is strong, and we expect revenue to improve throughout the year in line with aircraft utilization and production rates.
Pricing is expected to be a benefit of 1% in the quarter, but in line with 2020 for the full year.
Now, I'll hand it over to Abhi to discuss our guidance.
Before jumping into full-year guidance, I'd like to share a few more expectations for the first quarter.
In addition to the revenue guidance that Scott provided, we're expecting incremental margins of 30% to 35% in industrial and decremental margins of 30% to 35% in aerospace and defense.
Decremental margins in aerospace and defense are slightly higher than our full-year 2020 decrementals due to the expected mix of OEM and aftermarket revenue.
We're also planning for corporate cost of $8.5 million, higher than our expected full-year run rate, due to the timing of certain expenses, such as RFPs.
Interest expense is expected to be roughly $8.5 million in Q1.
Finally, free cash flow for Q1 will be negative due to seasonality of annual disbursements.
Now, moving to full-year 2021 guidance.
We are expecting organic revenue growth of 0% to 4%, and with aerospace and defense expected to grow at low to mid-single digits and industrial at low single digits.
We are planning for a continued slow recovery in commercial Aerospace, where we expect to be better than 2020, but remain significantly lower than pre pandemic levels.
Our defense business remains healthy as we continue to win new business and deliver on growing U.S. defense programs.
In our industrial end markets, we expect to see modest recovery with downstream activity improving in the back half of 2021.
We're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20, a 40% to 54% increase versus 2020.
This improvement is driven by top-line growth and improved margins from price increases, structural cost out in 2020 and ongoing productivity.
Finally, we're planning to deliver free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income of 85% to 95%.
We feel that this guidance reflects what we are seeing in our end markets and the operational improvements that we can control within the four walls of CIRCOR.
We're confident in our ability to deliver these results, not only for our shareholders but for our customers, suppliers and employees.
Now I'll hand back to Scott to wrap up.
To summarize, we remain focused on delivering our strategic priorities.
In 2021, we're taking actions to further improve our customers' experience and our operational and financial performance.
We remain focused on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent while fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.
We continue to invest in growth through innovative new products, aftermarket support technology to enhance our customers' experience and regional expansion.
Value-based pricing continues to be a top priority, leveraging our differentiated technology and our strong market positions in the niches where we compete.
The CIRCOR operating system will continue to drive operational improvement and margin expansion.
And by enhancing free cash flow through efficient working capital management, we'll continue to delever the balance sheet.
","CIRCOR continues to make progress in executing its strategic plan, with revenue in Q4 2020 reaching $208 million, up 10% sequentially. The defense business remains strong, with margins improving by 290 basis points year-over-year. Notably, aerospace and defense won 20 new programs in 2020, including 60 in defense and four in commercial. CIRCOR is also well-positioned for growth in 2021, with expectations of organic revenue growth of 0%-4% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.00 to $2.20. The company's focus on value-based pricing, cost reduction, and operational improvement continues to drive margin expansion and free cash flow generation, which will be used to further delever the balance sheet."
ABC_q3_2021.txt,"I'm Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
You have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by the management.
Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. state attorneys generals and political subdivisions in participating states.
Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to address the normalcy of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table.
If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support.
Clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time.
We take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to close with stakeholders concerning these complex matters.
AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and, alongside partners, combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve.
Turning now to our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
AmerisourceBergen delivered yet another quarter of exceptional results driven by a high level of execution, purpose-minded team members and continued focus on delivering differentiated value.
These results reflect continued strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses as we capitalize on our differentiated pharmaceutical-centric value proposition and as our team successfully executes on our key strategic initiatives.
This strength and execution continue to create value for our shareholders.
And today, we are again raising our fiscal 2021 full year guidance, which Jim will discuss later in greater detail.
I will focus my remarks today on the key strategic pillars that are driving our strong performance, as well as how, with the addition of Alliance Healthcare, AmerisourceBergen continues to be well positioned to create value for all our stakeholders.
AmerisourceBergen remains next-minded, and we are focused on continuing to enhance our ability to provide global healthcare solutions as we support pharmaceutical innovation and access, both in the United States and internationally.
In the United States, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to benefit from our industry-leading customer relationships, our leadership in specialty distribution and commercialization services and strong end market trends, including an earlier than expected return to pre-COVID prescription utilization trends in the June quarter.
Our leading customer base includes our Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate Provider Network members.
They are proving daily that community pharmacies are at the forefront of providing quality and equitable care and maintaining deep levels of trust with their patients and communities.
In fact, for the fifth year in a row, Good Neighbor Pharmacy was ranked highest among brick-and-mortar chain drug store pharmacies by J.D. Power.
This is the tenth time we have received that honor in the past 12 years, and it is a testament to community awareness of the value of the quality care and experience patients receive at GNP member pharmacies.
We held our annual Thoughtspot Conference last week, and I was touched and inspired by the stories that our members shared through the entrepreneurship, expertise and deep community roots, community pharmacies prove that they do more than just [draw] prescriptions.
They are critical promoters of health equity across the U.S., often driving above and beyond to provide holistic care and health education at the local level, particularly in under-resourced communities.
Since beginning of the pandemic, community pharmacies have stepped up fearlessly to meet the unprecedented challenges of a global health crisis and show the world why community pharmacies are integral to our communities.
The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer.
Another relevant example is on the animal side.
The growth in pet ownership has increased demand for our veterinarian customers as pets are a cherished part of the family and the care a veterinarian provides is valued.
This positive trend over the last year has long-term benefits for our business as MWI is well positioned with key anchor customers and services.
On the human health side, access to local trusted expertise care remains vital, particularly for those dealing with complex health challenges that bring them into the care of specialty physician providers.
As I've said from the onset of the pandemic, we are conscious of the negative impact that restricted measures have on patients when they have less access to screenings and tests that help doctors identify serious health issues.
This has particularly impacted patients who are used to a doctor or healthcare facility.
But now our customers have begun to see a normalization in new patient trends.
And as a result, patients are more effectively being diagnosed and gaining access to treatment.
This is a clear positive for patient care.
As the leading provider of specialty distribution and commercialization services, we will continue to play our role in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access as patients visit volumes continues to normalize.
Our specialty physician services business had strong performance this quarter and continues to differentiate AmerisourceBergen with leading value-added services, such as those through our physician GPOs.
Additionally, bio centers continue to be a positive for our customers, our business and the healthcare system overall as they provide room for new innovative products to come to market.
The innovations in CAR T and cell and gene therapies and the potential applications of the new mRNA technology offers the medical community new potential tools in the treatment of serious diseases that previously alluded truly effective care.
AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support all these innovations through our specialty distribution and manufacturer services offerings.
Our unique ability to provide value-added expertise in conjunction with innovative solutions and quality service enhance our partnerships and grow our business.
With strong partnerships, relationships and a leading portfolio of solutions to support a wide pipeline of practices and products, AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities provided by global pharmaceutical innovation as we drive growth in our business and help our partners tackle some of the most critical challenges based in healthcare.
We have a strong foundation in place across our businesses.
And in June, we took another significant step forward by closing the Alliance Healthcare transaction and welcoming their talented team to the AmerisourceBergen family.
The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare is the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions and is a critical component to our future success.
Alliance Healthcare is a strong and diversified pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer services company with leading market positions across an attractive portfolio of both established European markets and high-growth emerging markets.
In addition to their traditional wholesale business, Alliance Healthcare operates a range of leading higher-margin innovation businesses serving both upstream partners and downstream customers.
The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare extends our distribution reach built by our market-leading services capabilities and expands on our key differentiators.
Specifically, AmerisourceBergen's leading portfolio of key anchor customers now includes a long-term relationship with Boots in the U.K. and a network of independent pharmacies across Europe through the Alphega pharmacy network.
Since the completion of the transaction, we have gotten the chance to know about the business and the people and Alliance Healthcare better, and we remain very positive about the opportunity that this landmark achievement provides AmerisourceBergen as we are positioned for a differentiated global growth platform.
This includes our dedication to further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships to lead with market leaders in every segment and to supporting patient access wherever a prescription is needed.
Second, AmerisourceBergen's leadership in specialty is further enhanced with key commercialization services in new markets.
By leveraging the expertise and capabilities of our World Courier business, along with Alliance's Alloga and Alcura, we elevate our ability to be a differentiated solution provider for global manufacturers as they develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals around the world.
This is complementary to the solutions that we provide at World Courier, which continues to play a key role of providing global specialty logistics through growth traditional commercial offerings and direct-to-patient clinical trial capabilities.
We remain dedicated to expanding on our leadership in specialty and to enhancing our capabilities to support global pharmaceutical innovation.
Third, AmerisourceBergen focuses on delivering best-in-class services and efficiency, and this transaction enhances our ability to develop innovation solutions that are fundamental to our success operationally and commercially.
Our innovative mindset means that we embrace the advanced technologies, data and analytics, and now we can further support positive outcomes through our expanded global platform.
This fiscal quarter, we were selected as the industry leader award winner at the 2021 SAP Innovation Awards for our work in developing SAP Advanced Track and Trace for Pharmaceuticals.

With Alliance Healthcare, we are now an even more global [Indecipherable] company, and we are committed more than ever to advancing the value of our talent and culture.
Over the past year, we have invested in enhancing our talent and diversity and inclusion strategies to enable more growth opportunities within our increasingly inclusive workplace.
In the future, we plan to provide dedicated development opportunities for high-potential employees of additional underrepresented groups.
Investing in our leadership development and talent and culture is important to our long-term sustainable growth, which is supported by diverse and inclusive teams.
This focus is important to ensuring we capture the value of our collective differences and reflect our social commitment as we continue to strategically focus on delivering on all elements of ESG.
Our ESG strategy is foundational to AmerisourceBergen, our leadership, our Board and our people.
Recently, AmerisourceBergen joined the Science-based Targets initiative as we continue to line our business with best practice organizations around the world.
At the local level, we continue to be deeply committed to our communities.
This past year, we launched myCommunityImpact, Matching Gifts and Dollars for Doers Program, and we recently made it available to all global employees.
Our philanthropic efforts have been recognized by DiversityInc, ranking us 8th in their annual 50 [list] in philanthropy rankings.
With their unwavering passion and support, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to capitalize on our global footprint to provide leading pharmaceutical distribution services and to leverage our expertise as an innovative commercialization services provider internationally.
We remain confident in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, our capabilities as partner of choice with market-leading manufacturer services and our role in continuing the acceleration of pharmaceutical innovation.
By providing differentiated value to our stakeholders, focusing on our customers, expanding on our leadership in specialty and executing, innovating and supporting pharmaceutical innovation globally, we are well positioned to create long-term stakeholder value as we remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
Before I discuss our third quarter results, I want to comment on the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry's continued progress toward reaching a negotiated resolution to substantially address the nationwide opioid litigation.
The proposed settlement agreement represents an important step toward achieving a broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and aligns with the legal accrual the company recorded in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
AmerisourceBergen appreciates the enormity of the opioid epidemic, and this broad industry resolution is an important step toward delivering a meaningful relief to communities across the United States.
Turning now to our business.
AmerisourceBergen remains focused on our differentiated and innovative value proposition to deliver long-term growth and value creation to our stakeholders.
Powered by our purpose-driven team members, we will continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy on an enhanced global platform to serve both upstream partners and downstream customers.
Having joined AmerisourceBergen myself through an acquisition and experience several acquisitions during my tenure, I have seen firsthand a thoughtful and strategic approach AmerisourceBergen takes to successfully integrate acquired companies.
We enjoy working with our incredibly talented new team members and learning more not only about their businesses, but also about how much we culturally have in common.
As we have said since announcing the acquisition, Alliance Healthcare is a strong and efficient business, and we look forward to working together to continue to provide innovative solutions to our customers and stakeholders.
My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated.
Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter.
First, I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance.
Second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance.
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results.
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.16, an increase of 17%, which was driven by the continued strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses and also benefited from the one month contribution from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
Our consolidated revenue was $53.4 billion, up 18%, driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare and our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health businesses.
Consolidated gross profit increased 32% to $1.6 billion, driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment.
In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 33 basis points from the prior year quarter to 3.05%.
This was primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which has a higher gross profit margin and increase in sales of specialty products in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and growth in some of our higher-margin businesses.
Regarding consolidated operating expenses, operating expenses were $996 million, up 38% year-over-year due to the addition of the Alliance Healthcare business and also includes the internal investments we are making across our business with a focus on continuing to offer innovative services and solutions to our partners.
These investments are important as they ensure we continue to create differentiated value and support our long-term growth.
Turning now to consolidated operating income.
Our operating income was $631 million, up 24% compared to the prior year quarter.
This increase was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment-level performance.
Operating income margin grew six basis points to 1.18% as a result of the contribution from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and growth in higher-margin businesses.
Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter.
The net interest expense was $51 million, up 36% due to debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
Our effective income tax rate was 21%, up from 18.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which benefited from a discrete tax item.
Our diluted share count was 208.9 million shares, a 1.6% increase due to the dilution related to employee stock comp and the weighted average saving impact of the June issuance of two million shares delivered to Walgreens as a part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
Turning now to adjusted free cash flow and cash.
Our adjusted free cash flow was strong in our fiscal third quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow number to $1.2 billion, while our cash balance was $2.6 billion.
This completes the review of our consolidated results.
Now I'll turn to our segment results.
Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $49.3 billion, up 13% for the quarter driven by increased sales of specialty products and solid performance broadly across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses.
Across our distribution businesses, we are seeing better and earlier-than-expected utilization trends as there have been more normalized physician interaction patterns leading to new patient starts.
Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment's operating income increased about 13% to $484 million.
AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit in the quarter from our leadership in specialty, where there has been a notable return to pre-COVID strength and continued positive biosimilar trends.
I will now turn to Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting.
Alliance Healthcare is in our results for the month of June and had strong performance out of the gate.
In the quarter, Other segment's revenue was $4.1 billion, up 128%, driven by the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and growth across the remaining operating segments.
Excluding the impact of Alliance Healthcare, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health revenue was up 22%.
Other segment's operating income was $147 million, up 77% primarily due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and strong performance at both MWI and World Courier.
Excluding the impact of Alliance Healthcare, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health operating income was up 21%, reflecting the solid fundamentals of the businesses.
World Courier has continued its exceptional performance, providing high- specialty logistics around the globe.
Despite challenges in global logistics due to limited international cargo space, the team has delivered industry-leading solutions and expertise to support our customers and partners.
Looking ahead, the business is highly complementary to Alliance Healthcare's Alloga and Alcura businesses, and we are excited to offer an integrated suite of solutions on our enhanced global platform to serve our manufacturer customers.
Turning now to MWI.
The pandemic has truly encouraged all of us to focus on the health and wellbeing of our communities and families.
And this includes our animal companions.
Over 12 million families in the U.S. have gained pets since the pandemic began, and since pet owners view their pets as family members, the focus on health and wellbeing is a positive market trend for our MWI companion business.
In the production animal market, our investments in technology solutions and the unique offering of value-added services position the business to support long-term global demand for protein.
MWI's strong execution and customer relationships have allowed the business to remain a best-in-class provider that is well positioned to capture these positive market trends.
That concludes our segment-level discussion, and I will now turn to our 2021 guidance.
Following the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition back in June, we updated our 2021 guidance for revenue, adjusted diluted earnings per share and weighted average shares to reflect the expected contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the weighted average share count impacted the two million shares of stock that we delivered to Walgreens.
Given the continued strong performance of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, we are again raising our earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.90 to $9.10, up to a range of $9.15 to $9.30, reflecting growth of 16% to 18% from the previous fiscal year.
We are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021, including a meaningful increase to our expectations for consolidated and segment adjusted operating income.
First, I'll begin with operating expenses.
Operating expenses are now expected to be approximately $3.9 billion due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
As a reminder, when you consider your models, Alliance Healthcare has higher margins for gross profit, operating expenses and operating income as evidenced by the update to our fiscal 2021 guidance for consolidated operating expenses to reflect the four months of Alliance Healthcare.
Next, turning to operating income.
We now expect operating income to be approximately $2.6 billion.
This is a result of raising our Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income guidance to the low double-digit growth range given the strong trends we have continued to see in our business, including specialty, which was further bolstered by patient referral activity this quarter.
This rate also reflects our expectation for operating income in Other of approximately $610 million to $620 million.
Excluding the contribution from Alliance Healthcare, operating income growth for Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group is expected to be in the low double-digit range for fiscal 2021, driven by the strong performance of the World Courier and MWI.
Finally, turning to free cash flow, we have raised our free cash flow guidance to be approximately $1.7 billion, up from approximately $1.5 billion.
As it pertains to fiscal 2022, our corporate planning process remains unchanged.
We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of our current fiscal year.
This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process.
That being said, we want to remind you three important items from fiscal 2021 as you consider your models.
First, through the end of June, the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies has declined in line with the expectations we have shared since the first quarter.
COVID therapy distribution contributes roughly $0.25 to our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance, and the benefit from that exclusivity is not expected to repeat in fiscal 2022.
Second, we will have higher interest expense in fiscal 2022 driven by the debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
Third, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect our weighted average shares to be almost 211 million shares due primarily to the fully planned impact of the two million shares of our stock delivered to Walgreens at the close of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
Our share count will continue to tick higher in 2022 due to normal employee stock comp-related solution and the fact that we have committed to prioritize paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next two years and [lower] shareholder purchases.
Moving past these modeling reminders.
The strength of AmerisourceBergen is undeniable and is exemplified by our continued exceptional results quarter-after-quarter.
This is the sixth quarter since the pandemic began and our results demonstrate the resilience and strength of our company.
I am thoroughly impressed by the execution and performance across our businesses that has positioned us for continued success.
Our pharmaceutical-centric foundation, market-leading talent and competitive positioning enable us to capitalize on market trends and continue to deliver strong results.
AmerisourceBergen remains focused on creating long-term financial value, and we continue to work diligently to build our corporate stewardship initiatives to ensure the work we are doing benefits all stakeholders.
We are focused on continuing to build robust talent development programs so that all our team members feel they have opportunities to grow and learn.
In our communities, we're supporting nonprofit partners through our foundation to expand access to quality healthcare, promote health equity and provide resources to ensure prescription drug safety.
In addition, we aim to be environmental stewards in the communities where we live and work through initiatives like our commitment to using sustainable packaging to reduce the use of single-use plastics and working closely with our partners to optimize delivery routes to minimize our greenhouse gas emission footprint.
We look forward to providing further updates on our ESG progress as we continue to find ways to make a positive impact on the people, planet and communities where we live and work.
As we focus in on the end of our fiscal year with strong momentum and continued outperformance across our business, it is important to take a moment to reflect on the important accomplishments we have already had this year.
First, our teams continue to execute and leverage our capabilities to create differentiated value for our stakeholders.
Second, our future growth has been further solidified by our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare.
Third, our purpose-driven culture continues to empower our team members that think, plan and act decisively to do what is right for our people, partners and communities.
And finally, we continue our long-term commitment to strategically invest in our businesses and talent to ensure that AmerisourceBergen will continue to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
As we look to the future, I'm proud of the resilient foundation we have built while we facilitate pharmaceutical innovation and remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
","AmerisourceBergen delivered strong results in its third quarter, driven by continued execution, customer relationships, and specialty distribution leadership.

Overall, AmerisourceBergen remains well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities and deliver long-term value to stakeholders."
RPT_q3_2021.txt,"Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made.
We had another very strong quarter, resulting in another raise in our 2021 operating FFO guidance.
We experienced balanced success across all our disciplines as we continue to refresh our portfolio, tenant mix, liquidity and balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on future earnings growth.
We closed on several high-quality acquisitions across all three of our strategic investment platforms, bringing our gross acquisition volume to $500 million in 2021.
We continue to see strong demand for space in our centers and signed a number of key leases with well-capitalized tenants, driving our accelerated signed not opened balance to almost $4 million.
And lastly, we raised or received commitments on $670 million of capital from our equity, debt and joint venture partners, strengthening our liquidity profile and balance sheet.
Starting off with our capital-raising efforts.
I am very pleased with GIC's recent commitment of an additional $500 million to our core grocery-anchored R2G platform, positioning that platform to scale up to $1.7 billion.
We believe this is an endorsement of RPT and our ability to create value.
We are grateful to be in the company of top-tier REITs, like Ventas, Boston Properties, Equinix and others, that have partnered with GIC.
The new commitment provides us with the firepower to further accelerate our portfolio transformation while enhancing our management fee income stream.
We also recently obtained commitments for $130 million in the debt private placement market and received another $40 million through our ATM, demonstrating our ability to access multiple sources of capital to accretively fund our growth plans.
The size of our portfolio is an advantage as it allows us to rapidly reshape our geographic exposures toward higher-growth and more durable markets like Boston, which is now our third-largest market.
We also increased our exposure to Atlanta and Tampa while reducing our concentrations in Detroit, Cincy and Chicago.
This real-time shift in our mix not only improves our geographic diversification but also increases our visibility with retailers, brokers and other stakeholders, which is leading to increased deal flow on both the leasing and acquisition fronts.
To support our data-driven investment decisions, we have an in-house data scientist who developed a proprietary asset scoring model that combines advanced data analytics with a collective knowledge and experience of our investments, leasing, property management and portfolio management teams.
With this dynamic tool, we can continually assess our existing and potential future properties in real time to inform our capital allocation decisions.
Our scoring model was a key advantage for us as we underwrote our recent acquisitions and will continue to be used as we assess our future acquisitions and dispositions through the lens of quality, balance sheet and earnings accretion.
Regarding the acquisition environment, we are currently experiencing a very competitive landscape to acquire high-quality shopping centers, where cap rates for grocery-anchored centers in top U.S. metros are down approximately 50 basis points over the past few months.
As a result, we believe the $500 million of acquisitions that we closed on so far could be up as much as 10% relative to our transacted prices.
Despite the recent cap rate compression, our three investment platforms provide us a competitive advantage to acquire at higher returns, allowing us to remain active on the acquisition front in our target markets.
We continue to work tirelessly, sourcing additional acquisitions, focusing primarily on off-market, relationship-driven opportunities and expect 2022 to be another active year.
We continue to see a healthy pipeline of deals for grocery-anchored centers, smaller strips and wealthy infill suburbs in our core communities and larger high-quality centers over $70 million, where we can allocate the real estate between our platforms.
We also see unique opportunities to acquire value-add or opportunistic centers, where we can utilize our tenant relationships to create significant value after the purchase.
For example, we are currently under negotiation to buy an asset in the Southeast that has an empty anchor box related to a recent tenant bankruptcy.
We are in lease negotiation with a premier investment-grade grocer to take that space, which will drive the occupancy to about 99%, resulting in an estimated stabilized yield on cost of 7% in a 5% cap rate market.
On the other side of the coin, current market demand is also creating opportunities for us to monetize assets at attractive yields in non-core markets.
Earlier this week, we closed on the sale of Market Plaza in the Chicago market for $30 million.
We received 11 offers and sold the property at a high 5% buyer's cap rate.
Chicago is not a market that we are looking to expand in due to the less-than-business-friendly political environment.
We are also exploring other opportunities to further reduce our exposure to nonstrategic markets and take advantage of the current frothiness in the private markets.
Now turning to operations.
We continue to drive rent and sign leases with high-credit essential tenancy.
This quarter, we signed a lease with a new investment-grade grocer at our Crofton Centre in Baltimore, which is replacing a Shoppers Food Warehouse.
In October, we signed an expansion lease with Publix at The Crossroads in Palm Beach.
This will be a brand-new flagship prototype store, demonstrating Publix' commitment to the center and cementing the anchor tenancy for years to come.
In both cases, we locked in strong credit anchors, thereby enhancing the durability of the cash flows at these centers.
We also signed a new medical tenant, Piedmont Urgent Care, that replaces a sit-down restaurant at Promenade at Pleasant Hill just outside of Atlanta, swapping a high-COVID-risk tenant for an essential tenant at a mid-20% spread to the old brand.
Not only were we able to reduce tenant risk, but we were able to do so at attractive economics.
Lastly, we signed a new deal for a Ferguson gallery showroom at Providence Marketplace in the Nashville market.
This will be Ferguson's first showroom in Nashville, which we think will be a premier destination for residents to access the latest concepts in quality home fixtures and appliances.
With only five to six Ferguson showroom openings in a typical year, we think this deal is a testament to the strength of our center.
For those of you that are not familiar with Ferguson, they are a $34 billion market cap, BBB+-rated credit and the largest U.S. distributor of plumbing and second-largest distributor of industrial products.
We think they will be an attractive regional draw for the property based on the strong demographic match between the center and the Ferguson customer profile.
Looking forward, our leasing team remains active with a solid pipeline of deals lined up for the fourth quarter.
Notably, we are seeing strong demand in Florida, Boston and Detroit, where we are in negotiations on a number of major box deals, ranging from grocer to off-price retail as well as several national small shop deals.
Notably, we have seen a major pickup in demand in Detroit over the past few quarters and are in negotiations on over half a dozen grocery deals and another eight to 10 box leases with discount apparel, pet, outdoor recreation and homegood retailers.
Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results, provide an update on our balance sheet and end with commentary on our increased guidance.
Third quarter operating FFO per share of $0.27 was up $0.05 over last quarter primarily due to about $0.04 of higher NOI from acquisitions, $0.01 from lower rent not probable of collection and about $0.01 from higher lease termination fees, partially offset by lower straight-line rent.
The better-than-expected rent not probable of collection was primarily driven by the reversal of a prior period reserve following an unplanned payment from a theater tenant.
As we look ahead, we expect bad debt to continue to moderate as our collection rate tracks toward pre-COVID levels.
Notably, our collection rate for the third quarter was 98% as of the end of October.
As Brian mentioned, our operational performance in the quarter remained strong.
We signed 52 leases totaling 280,000 square feet at a blended comparable releasing spread of 8.2%, including a 5.2% renewal and 16% new lease spread.
Our renewal spread is the highest level it's been in over a year, and along with the continued strength of our new leasing spreads, is reflective of the increasing demand for our centers and the embedded mark-to-market opportunity within our portfolio.
These spreads are on a cash basis.
They don't capture future contractual rent steps, which were 160 basis points for the leases signed during the quarter.
Leasing activity in the third quarter pushed our signed not opened balance to $3.8 million, up 19% over last quarter's $3.2 million backlog, which we expect to open over the next 15 months.
On the remerchandising and outlet front, we delivered two projects totaling $3.3 million during the quarter at almost a 12% yield, which was ahead of budget.
We also added one new project, Ferguson gallery showroom at Providence Marketplace in Nashville, totaling $1.3 million at an expected yield in the 20% to 22% range.
This brings the active remerchandising and outlet project total to $14 million with expected yields in the 10% to 12% range.
We are in active negotiations on a number of other pipeline deals totaling about $30 million with strong box demand in Boston, Florida and Detroit.
Turning to the balance sheet.
We ended the third quarter with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6.8 times, down from seven times last quarter.
This is a bit better than expected as a result of the $40 million raised through our ATM and due to better NOI performance.
We continue to expect our leverage to fall toward our target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times as bad debt and occupancy normalize to pre-COVID levels.
Despite the heavy level of acquisition activity in the quarter, our liquidity remains strong.
We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of approximately $10 million and have $295 million available on our unsecured line of credit.
We expect to repay the vast majority of the outstanding balance on the line of credit by the end of the year or shortly thereafter.
One of the core tenets of our balance sheet strategy, in addition to managing overall leverage, is to proactively address our pending debt maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to refinance $177 million of debt.
Included in this amount are all of our private placement notes that mature in 2023 and 2024 and our Bridgewater mortgage that matures in 2022.
We expect to use proceeds from our recent private placement of unsecured notes totaling $130 million, our share of expected proceeds from mortgages placed on R2G assets that we locked rate on totaling $15 million and proceeds from the sale of Market Plaza totaling $30 million to fund these debt repayments.
Following all this activity, we will have reduced debt maturities through 2024 to just 16% of our debt stack.
Over the next two quarters, we also expect to generate $96 million in disposition proceeds from parcel sales to RGMZ, including sales from our recently acquired Northborough and Newnan Pavilion assets and the remaining seed portfolio sales.
These proceeds will effectively be used to fund our share of the debt of acquisition of $68 million and to repay amounts outstanding on our revolving line of credit.
Moving to our increased guidance for 2021.
We initiated a new range for operating FFO of $0.90 to $0.94 per share, which is up $0.02 or 2% over prior guidance.
The primary drivers of the upside were $0.01 from a prior period bad debt reversal and about another $0.01 of lease termination fees recognized in the third quarter.
The key factors that would drive results to the high or low end of the range are the timing of closing of the net lease parcel sales and bad debt reserves.
In addition, our incentive compensation is not finalized until the fourth quarter, which could result in an uptick in G-and-A expense, similar to what we experienced in late 2019.
But I wanted to provide insight into a couple of items as you start to establish your quarterly run rate for 2022.
Our third quarter operating FFO per share of $0.27 benefited from $0.02 related to nonrecurring items, including a prior period favorable bad debt adjustment and a one-time lease termination fee.
In addition, relative to our third quarter results, 2022 G-and-A is expected to increase by approximately $0.01 per quarter related to an uptick in travel-related expenses, similar to 2019 levels, and continued investments in talent to support our growth platforms.
Our framework can be summarized with three questions.
Does the property improve our overall portfolio quality?
How much future value-creation potential is there?
And can we fund the acquisition in a way that's both accretive to earnings and pushes us closer to our target leverage range of 5.5 to 6.5 times?
No deal is as simple as this.
And each has its own unique set of circumstances.
But we think it is important to understand our framework as you build out your own forecast.
Also, as a reminder, it is our normal practice not to include speculative acquisitions unless we have a strong line of sight on a potential close.
","The company had another strong quarter, resulting in another raise in their 2021 operating FFO guidance. They experienced balanced success across all disciplines while continuing to refresh their portfolio, tenant mix, liquidity, and balance sheet, positioning them for future earnings growth. They closed on several high-quality acquisitions and signed key leases with well-capitalized tenants, driving their accelerated signed not opened balance to almost $4 million.

DRI_q2_2021.txt,"Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.
We plan to release fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings on March 25 before the market opens followed by a conference call.
Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the third quarter.
And then Gene will share some closing comments.
As -- we continue to operate in a very fluid environment, and I was pleased with our ability to once again deliver strong profitability in an unpredictable sales environment.
Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.
The last two weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter.
During the quarter, we remain focused on four key priorities.
The health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in the complex operating environment, deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model.
The health and safety of our team members and guest has always been our top priority.
We continue to follow latest guidance from the CDC as well as our own enhanced safety protocols to create a safe environment for everyone.
This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring mask for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols.
I'm proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe.
Second, our restaurant teams remain focused on our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that results in great guest experiences whether our guests are dining with us or ordering curbside to-go.
Our teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it's still not easy.
That's why we remain committed to our simplified operations, including streamline menus, processes and procedures which continue to strengthen our execution and our guest satisfaction metrics confirm that our restaurant teams are doing a great job delivering exceptional guest experience in this challenging environment.
Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience.
Our brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database.
During the quarter, Olive Garden LongHorn Steakhouse launched refresh websites and all our brands continue to use their digital storefronts effectively.
More than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online.
And at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital.
During the quarter, we also rolled out Curbside I'm Here, which allows our guests to easily notify the restaurant that they've arrived to pick up their curbside to-go order by simply tapping on a link embedded in a text message.
As a result, our operators are spending less time on the phone and more time focused on ensuring orders are accurate and on-time, which is leading to improved guest satisfaction scores.
We also introduced Wait List Visibility, allowing guest to see their place on the waiting list using their phone regardless of whether they've checked in online or in person.
And we're working on several other initiatives, including streamlining our online checkout process and adding additional mobile payment options to provide even more convenience for our guest.
We continue to accelerate our digital journey, and I'm encouraged by the progress we are making.
Finally, we continue to view this environment as a rare opportunity to transform our business model for long-term growth.
We continue to make investments in our team members, product quality and portion sizes to ensure we emerge even stronger and better positioned to grow share.
Olive Garden same-restaurant sales declined 19.9% as capacity restrictions continue to limit their top-line sales.
Olive Garden began November with 56 dining rooms closed, and that number accelerated to 208 by the end of the month.
However, they were able to deliver strong average weekly sales during the quarter of more than 73,000 per restaurant, retaining 80% of last year's sales.
Olive Garden also continue to realize operational efficiencies and strengthened margin as a result of their simplified menu and the elimination of promotional activity, including discounts.
In the current limited capacity environment, their reduced marketing spend was focused on showcasing the convenience of their off-premise experience, while featuring compelling core menu items rather than limited time promotions.
This led to increased segment profit margin, while making additional investments in abundance and value.
Additionally, off-premise sales grew 83% in the quarter, representing 39% of total sales.
Enabled by the technology investments I mentioned earlier, Olive Garden improved their to-go experience and achieved another all-time high in guest satisfaction for having orders ready to pick up at the time promised.
Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter.
LongHorn Steakhouse had another solid quarter.
Same-restaurant sales declined 11.1%.
Almost 20% of their restaurants grew same-restaurant sales in the quarter.
They also successfully opened three new restaurants during the quarter.
The LongHorn team remains laser focused on their strategy of increasing the quality of their guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement.
During the quarter, the team did a great job of managing controllable costs while their simplified menu drove improved labor productivity.
Finally, LongHorn grew off-premise sales by more than 175%, representing 22% of total sales.
For the second quarter, total sales were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%.
Same-restaurant sales declined 20.6%, EBITDA was $206 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.
Our second quarter start was encouraging with weekly sales building on results from the first quarter.
However, as COVID-19 cases began increasing in November and many state and local governments reimposed dining room restrictions, the last two weeks of the quarter trended down significantly.
We estimate that this downward shift in sales over the last two weeks negatively impacted operating income by approximately $15 million.
Turning to the P&L.
Food and beverage expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and increased to-go packaging.
Restaurant labor was 140 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor improving by over 310 basis points, driven by operational simplification.
This was partially offset by deleverage and management labor due to sales declines and $3 million of emergency pay net of retention credits as we reinstated our emergency pay program for our team members impacted by dining room closures.
Restaurant expense per operating week was 13% lower than last year, driven by lower repairs, maintenance and utilities expenses.
However, sales deleverage resulted in restaurant expense as a percent of sales coming in 170 basis points higher than last year.
We reduced marketing spend by almost $50 million this quarter with total marketing 210 basis points favorable to last year.
Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.9%, 140 basis points above last year despite the sales decline of 19%.
General and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by $8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation.
This is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity markets this quarter.
As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset in the tax line.
Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $6.4 million, resulting in a net mark-to-market reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.7 million.
The effective tax rate of 8.3% this quarter was lower by 5.1 percentage points due to the tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned.
After adjusting for this, the normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter would have been 13.4%.
Looking at our segment performance this quarter.
Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and our Other segment, all saw a segment profit margin increase despite sales declines.
This was driven by our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor and lower marketing expenses.
Our Fine Dining segment profit margin of 18.8% was impressive, although below last year, driven by a 30% sales decline.
We ended the second quarter with $770 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.5 billion of available liquidity.
We generated over $150 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 58% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of 75%.
The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share, 50% of our Q2 diluted earnings per share within our long-term framework for value creation.
We will continue to have regular discussions with the board on our future dividends.
As I mentioned earlier, the quarter started with sales building upon first quarter results.
As dining room closures increased, these improving sales trends reversed.
As of today, we have approximately 77% of our restaurants operating with at least partial dining room capacity versus a peak of 97% in the middle of the second quarter.
Moving forward, we may experience further dining room closures and increasing capacity restrictions in the third quarter.
As you may recall, in our last earnings call, we mentioned that the third quarter is historically our peak seasonal sales quarter, driven by the Christmas, New Year's and Valentine's Day holidays as well as travel time during this time of year.
At that time, we also stated that it will be more difficult to increase on-premise average unit volumes if capacity restrictions do not ease.
Current dining room closures, capacity restrictions and reductions in travel will exacerbate our same-restaurant sales comparison to last year due to the higher sales -- seasonal sales from last year.
Additionally, there are still uncertainties surrounding further capacity limitations and dining room closures and the duration of these impacts.
Given all these factors, we are providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter.
We expect total sales to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, resulting in total sales of between $1.53 billion and $1.65 billion, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.50 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares.
With dining rooms closures increasing, we are focusing on our playbook of expense management and off-premise sales.
While there is encouraging news on the broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in the spring, we currently don't anticipate meaningful sales trend improvements until some time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Despite the short-term headwinds we faced with sales trends, operational complexity and impacts to our team members, I'm confident we are making the right decisions for the long-term to create a better guest experience and strengthen our business.
And consistent with our messaging last quarter, we continue to believe we can achieve 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID EBITDA -- pre-COVID sales, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business.
Rick's career represents what our industry is all about.
He joined Darden as a Buster at Red Lobster 1984 and has worked extremely hard mastering many functions.
On January 4, he will become the President of the world's largest full service restaurant company.
He's been a great partner to me over the last five years, and I look forward to working side-by-side with him in his new role.
Additionally, we announced that Raj Vennam will become our Chief Financial Officer.
Raj began his career at Darden in 2003, and has done an exceptional job in every role he has held.
His promotion recognizes the significant contributions he has made to our individual brands as well as the greater organization.
With a brilliant mind and a keen understanding of our industry, Raj is the perfect person to take over for Rick.
I'm excited to see him expand his role in the company as CFO.
Rick and Raj are here with me in the room today, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate both of them.
I want to close by recognizing our team members in the restaurants and at the support center.
I can't say enough about the dedication they've demonstrated throughout the year.
Their focus, commitment and determination is exceptional.
With multiple jurisdictions implementing dining room closures, we know many team members will not get the hours they needed during this holiday season.
That is why we have reintroduced our emergency pay program that will provide three weeks of emergency pay to team members who are furloughed from their restaurant when dining rooms are closed.
Our [Technical Issue] our greatest competitive advantage, and we are committed to taking care of them.
I wish you all a safe and a happy holiday season.
","Darden Restaurants reported a $1.7 billion quarterly revenue, a 19.4% decrease attributed to negative same-restaurant sales of 20.6%. Despite this decline, diluted net earnings per share remained strong at $0.74. The company has focused on prioritizing four key areas: employee and guest safety, restaurant execution, technology deployment for an enhanced guest experience, and long-term business model transformation. Olive Garden experienced a 19.9% dip in same-restaurant sales but maintained 80% of sales compared to last year. LongHorn Steakhouse also performed well, with almost 20% of restaurants reporting sales growth. The company's digital efforts have been crucial, with over 55% of off-premise sales being fully digital transactions and Olive Garden achieving a 20% digital sales share. Darden remains optimistic, with CEO Gene Lee expressing confidence in the company's long-term prospects despite short-term headwinds. The company is providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter, with total sales projected to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels."
DRI_q3_2021.txt,"Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.
We plan to release fiscal 2021 fourth quarter earnings on June 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.
It's hard to believe it's been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business.
When I reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty.
Our portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our Back to Basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results oriented culture.
And while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger.
Our significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment.
The depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions.
We have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators.
Our scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively.
The robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest.
Finally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of COVID-19.
As soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models.
As our Founder Bill Darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our Company has is the quality of our employees, evidenced by the excellent job they do every day.
Throughout this past year, Darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences.
That is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year.
Since March of 2020, we have invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave, COVID-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed.
These investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
In addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today, totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members.
Beginning Monday, every hourly team member, tipped and non-tipped, will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income.
Additionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in January 2022 and to $12 per hour in January 2023.
These investments further strengthen our industry-leading employment proposition.
Lastly, I continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year.
You are the heart and soul of our Company and on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you.
As Gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year.
In addition to executing our Back to Basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage through this situation by remaining focused on the four key priorities we established at the onset of the pandemic: one, ensuring the health and safety of our team members and guests; two, simplifying operations and strengthening execution; three, deploying technology to improve the guest experience; and four, transforming our business model.
The health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority.
Throughout the past year, our team members have done a fantastic job of upholding our safety protocols while taking great care of our guests.
Today, even as restrictions are easing in some parts of the country, we continue to follow our enhanced safety measures.
This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring masks for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols.
Our second priority has been to continue finding ways to simplify our operations and drive in-restaurant execution at each of our brands.
This environment gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to evaluate every aspect of how we operate and make decisions we would not have been able to do in a normal operating environment.
A good example of this work all of our brands have done to streamline menus and remove low preference or low satisfaction items.
This focus makes it easier for our restaurant teams to consistently execute our highest preference items which means we are serving our most popular dishes to more guests.
In fact, a year ago, the top 10 entrees at Olive Garden accounted for about 48% of guest preference, and today they account for approximately 55%.
Reducing the bottom selling items eliminates distractions and allows us to execute at a high level.
We have dramatically reduced low volume items which reduces the need to prepare them, saving time and reducing food waste.
For example, at LongHorn Steakhouse, the number of total items with less than 1% preference is down to eight from more than 25 pre-COVID.
Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience and build on the progress we have made over the last 12 months.
When the pandemic began and our dining rooms were closed, we were able to quickly roll out online ordering at our brands that had yet to deploy it.
We also streamlined the curbside to-go pickup process by rolling out the Curbside I'm Here text message notification feature so guests can easily alert us when they arrive.
These technology enhancements and other process improvements helped Olive Garden achieve new all-time high guest satisfaction ratings for delivering on time and accurate off-premise experiences during a quarter that included three busy off-premise days: Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day.
In fact, Valentine's Day was our highest sales day since the start of the pandemic.
Also during the quarter, several brands, including Olive Garden LongHorn implemented enhancements to their websites to streamline the online checkout process.
This resulted in a meaningful reduction in order abandonment rates.
Our continuous digital transformation is resonating with our guests.
In fact, during the quarter, nearly 19% of total sales were digital transactions.
Further, 50% of all guest checks were settled digitally, either online or on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay.
We have made great strides in our digital journey over the past year and we will continue to strengthen our digital platform and provide our brands with the tools to compete more effectively.
And finally, the investments we've made to simplify our business through menu and process simplification have resulted in significant transformation of our business model.
For example, across Darden, our hourly labor productivity has improved by over 20%, with some brands improving by well over 30% such as Cheddar's.
We thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more insight into what the business model transformation has done to Cheddar's P&L.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, Cheddar's has grown the restaurant level margins by over 300 basis points on a year-to-date sales retention of 75%.
When Cheddar's reaches 100% of the pre-COVID sales, we expect their restaurant level margins to be well in the high teens.
While we don't intend to continue to provide this level of detail in the future, this illustration helps to highlight the business model improvements our brands are making.
As we have mentioned previously, the simplifications across all of our businesses are expected to result in a 150 basis points of margin improvement with 90% of pre-COVID sales.
Our business model transformation also strengthens our belief in our ability to open value creating new restaurants across all of our brands.
Due to this transformation, the sales required to exceed our return expectations are much lower today.
In fact, we opened six new restaurants during the quarter and each is exceeding our expectations.
As Gene said, our success is a direct result of their hard work.
Being of service is at the heart of our business and our team members demonstrate that every day through their commitment to our guests and each other.
For the third quarter, total sales were $1.73 billion, a decrease of 26.1%.
Same restaurant sales decreased 26.7%.
EBITDA was $236 million, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.98.
Turning to this quarter's P&L.
Food and beverage expenses were 80 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and mix.
Restaurant labor was 20 basis points higher.
As Gene mentioned, we invested approximately $17 million in team member bonuses this quarter.
Excluding the team member bonuses, restaurant labor would have been 80 basis points favorable to last year.
The favorability to last year was driven by hourly labor improvement of 280 basis points due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications Rick discussed.
The hourly labor improvement was partially offset by deleverage in management labor due to sales declines.
Restaurant expense per operating week was 16% lower than last year, driven by lower workers' compensation, utilities, repairs and maintenance expense.
Restaurant expense as a percent of sales was 250 basis points higher than last year due to sales deleverage.
Marketing spend was $52 million lower than last year, with total marketing 200 basis points favorable to last year.
This all resulted in restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.4%, only 150 basis points below last year.
Excluding the one-time hourly team member bonus, restaurant level EBITDA margin would have been even stronger at 19.4%.
We impaired one Yard House restaurant this quarter, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million.
This location was in Portland, Oregon, and had been temporarily closed since April.
We finalized the legal recovery during the quarter, resulting in favorability of $16 million.
This favorability was partially offset by $8.8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation.
Excluding these two items, G&A would have been $86 million this quarter.
As a reminder, the mark-to-market expense is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity market this quarter, and due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset on an after-tax basis.
Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.2 million, resulting in a net reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.6 million.
Our effective tax rate of 2.3% this quarter was unusually low due to two factors.
First, the tax benefit from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduced the tax rate by 5 percentage points.
Second, the stock option exercises this quarter drove approximately $7 million of excess tax benefit, reducing the tax rate by 4.8 percentage points.
After adjusting for these factors, our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter would have been 12.1%.
Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden saw segment profit margin increase versus last year despite sales declines.
Our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor, combined with lower marketing expenses, drove this margin improvement.
Segment profit margin declined for LongHorn as higher than average beef inflation and other investments drove higher food and beverage expense.
In addition, both labor and restaurant expenses were higher as a percent of sales due to sales deleverage.
Segment profit margin declined for Fine Dining and Other segments due to deleverage across the P&L from the significant sales decline year-over-year.
We generated over $240 million of free cash flow this quarter, ending the third quarter with over $990 million in cash.
Our recent performance has given us better visibility into the durability of our cash flows.
Therefore, we will return to our 50% to 60% dividend payout target applied to future earnings to determine our dividend.
To that end, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share, matching our pre-COVID dividend level.
The ability to resume pre-COVID dividend levels just 12 months after suspending it is a testament to the strength of our business model and the durability of our cash flows.
And finally, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $500 million which replaces all previous authorizations.
Turning to the fourth quarter.
As of today we have 99% of our dining rooms open with some capacity.
Taking that all into consideration, we currently expect, for the fourth quarter, total sales of approximately $2.1 billion, EBITDA between $345 million and $360 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $1.60 and $1.70 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares.
We've also updated our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be between $285 million and $295 million, and we anticipate opening 33 net new restaurants for the year.
We continue to believe we can achieve pre-COVID EBITDA dollars on 90% of pre-COVID sales, resulting in 150 basis points of EBITDA margin growth, and our Q4 outlook falls within this framework.
As we move beyond the fourth quarter, there are additional costs such as training, travel, growth cost, incremental marketing and other investments that we expect will need to come back into the P&L.
And while it's too early to provide insights into fiscal '22 sales and earnings, we did want to provide some preliminary guidance for a few items.
We expect total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million and open approximately 35 new restaurants in fiscal '22.
We also anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13% for fiscal '22.
","Darden reported a decline in total sales and same-restaurant sales for Q3 due to the pandemic's impact. Despite this, the company highlighted its robust business model, driven by significant scale, extensive data, strategic planning, and a results-oriented culture. These advantages enabled Darden to execute its Back to Basics strategy, streamline menus, simplify operations, and deploy technology to improve the guest experience. As a result, hourly labor productivity improved by over 20%, and restaurant-level EBITDA margins increased. Darden's investment in team members included bonuses and hourly wage increases, strengthening its industry-leading employment proposition. Despite the challenges, Darden's financial performance was bolstered by cost reductions and operational simplifications, with restaurant-level EBITDA margin only 150 basis points below last year's figure. The company declared a pre-COVID quarterly dividend and authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Looking ahead, Darden estimates Q4 sales of $2.1 billion and earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates capital spending between $350 million and $400 million, opening 35 new restaurants, and an effective tax rate ranging from 12% to 13%."

Also note that the content of this conference call contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of today.
The company does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
Finally, today's call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website later today.
After restored first half of the year, our team continued on our path toward transformative growth.
After having communicated an ambitious second half of 2021 forecast, our third quarter results still managed to exceed our expectations.
The entire organization has been energized to see the durability of our business model as we produce strong financial results and risk adjusted portfolio returns.
Our GAAP earnings were $0.65 per diluted share for the third quarter, and our GAAP book value increased 4.7% in the quarter to $12 per share at September 30th.
This contributes to an overall year-to-date increase in our GAAP book value of 21% despite having raised our dividend each quarter of the year thus far.
When combined our GAAP book value growth in dividends paid resulted in a 27% economic return to shareholders year-to-date.
Operationally speaking, you'll hear more from Dash and Brooke on our third quarter results.
But suffice it to say it was a very strong quarter, several in-house records broken.
I'm particularly proud of a series of strategic and innovative transactions across our firm that were both accretive to earnings and foundational for future operating progress.
This included the first private label RMBS securitization to leverage blockchain technology, completed in collaboration with liquid mortgage and early horizons investment partner.
We also completed our first ever bridge loan securitization through our BPL platform, which provides a meaningful new distribution alternative to us.
Next, our investment portfolio team co-sponsored the first ever securitization backed entirely by residential home equity investments.
Finally, these deals are rounded out by six new venture investments by RWT Horizons in the third quarter.
I'm also pleased that after following strict health and safety protocols, we're able to successfully host our third Investor Day in September, the first since the onset of the pandemic.
During the event, we affirmed our commitment to our corporate mission to make quality housing, whether rented or owned accessible to all American households.
We also unveiled a much bolder strategic vision, become the leading operator and strategic capital provider driving sustainable innovation and housing finance.
As we showed in New York, opportunities for transformative scale are clear and now attainable, based on the strategic progress we've made in recent years.
Our vision is built upon an immense multi-trillion dollar addressable market that transcends the traditional mortgage lending space.
We're already attacking antiquated processes in our markets with technology enabled solutions, and over time, we plan to completely reimagine how the non-agency housing finance market works.
Across the Redwood enterprise, we've cultivated a talented and engaged workforce that as you might expect, believes in our mission, and is inspired to innovate and help us realize our strategic vision and goals.
Our role is not a typical one for REIT, much less one, one of the longest tenured publicly traded REITs in the country.
But that should not come as a surprise as we never defined our business by way of our Federal tax election.
Those who do, risk missing the growth potential of our platform, particularly as we continue to analyze our optimal long-term corporate structure.
Run into bend toward the end of the year, we remain very optimistic about our business, but we are proceeding cautiously.
We see several macro and market risks ahead, COVID-19 variants, rising inflation, Central Bank tapering, and Federal debt ceiling stripe to name a few.
More fundamentally, recent trends and unemployment claims suggest that we're still in a recovery phase, and the current economic situation is far from stable, notwithstanding the consistent upward pressure on home prices and rents that we've all observed in recent quarters.
Our interest rate capital and broader risk management posture reflects this view.
While we've generated strong earnings thus far this year, we've done so with record amounts of cash on hand, putting $557 million at September 30.
Going forward, our stakeholders should expect that we will continue to work to fulfill our broadly conceived mission focused on the significant addressable market in front of us and run a business grounded in fundamentals and sound analysis.
All while nurturing and diverse and talented bench team members were engaged and aligned with our values.
As Chris describe, the third quarter was another prolific one across our platform with increases in purchase and origination volumes complemented by innovative work across technology and capital markets.
Our teams are operating at a highly productive and sustainable level, as the foundation we have laid drives efficiency gains and demand for our products remains robust.
Notwithstanding the recent uptick in benchmark rates, excess capital in the market is still in search of yield.
We remain the partner of choice for whole loan and securities investors alike and continue to expand our distribution channels creatively to our capital efficiency and bottom line.
Our third quarter results reflect continued execution of the strategic goals we laid out at the beginning of the year.
As Chris referenced, we are seeing meaningful progress in a number of the initiatives that we presented at our recent Investor Day, both organically and through new investments and partnerships already bearing fruit.
In this vein, we strive to innovate daily in addressing the issues facing the housing market, but also look to take advantage of our strategic positioning in the markets we serve, to continue to grow profitably and sustainably.
Our progress also underscores important realities about housing affordability and accessibility, themes we focused on at Investor day.
Housing finance needs more creative solutions, driven by technology, a common sense approach to underwriting and most importantly, leadership and bringing market constituents together in pursuit of common goals.
During the third quarter, we took important steps in this direction.
Our results reinforce this broader backdrop and the opportunity across our platforms to continue serving growing areas in housing.
And the recent path of home prices, coupled with the evolution in consumer demand and important trends in industry regulation has created ample room for other creative solutions to help consumers monetize equity in their homes.
Our third quarter results represent another step in the path toward transformative growth that we laid out at Investor Day, with our core operating businesses leading the way and notable strategic progress across the enterprise.
The durability and diversification of our business model, coupled with our crisp execution and technological innovation, puts us in a unique position to drive change that benefits all stakeholders.
With this in mind, it's important to unpack the key drivers of profitability across our platforms.
Our residential business continued executing in the third quarter, and we believe is well positioned heading into year end, facing several market headwinds, including renewed inflation fears and meaningful rate volatility.
The team drove margins and volumes higher and once again broke new ground in our Sequoia securitization program.
We generated a record $4.7 billion of lock volume during the quarter, making quick work of our prior record of $4.6 million two quarters earlier.
Overall, locks were up 22% versus the second quarter, 59% of which were on purchase money loans, an important statement about the quality of our pipeline and our sellers, given the benchmark rates during the quarter hit lows not seen since February.
The volume of choice locks remained steady versus the second quarter.
And now the current mortgage rates are approximately 30 basis points higher versus the lows of Q3.
It is a helpful reminder that we have locked choice loans with over 100 different sellers thus far this year, important groundwork that we believe will bear fruit as we head into next year.
The depth of our distribution channels was another highlight during the quarter, as we sold $2.4 billion of loans alongside our securitization activities.
RMBS issuance remained elevated in the third quarter, with September a particularly crowded month.
As expected during any substantial uptick in supply, we witnessed more noticeable price tearing from investors across transactions, differentiation that we once again benefited from during the quarter.
Our third quarter issuance, Sequoia 2021-6 was $449 million in size and executed well inside competing transactions marketed during a similar period.
At time of securitization, the loans underpinning the deal were on average just one month old, compared to three to four months for our competitors, a testament to our efficiency and turning inventory.
A key hallmark of the transaction was the first of its kind use of blockchain based technology within private label RMBS for enhanced remittance reporting for bond investors.
Liquid Mortgage, an early partner through Redwood Horizons, is acting as distributed ledger agent, or DLA, on the transaction, providing an added and more real time remittance reporting option for investors who choose to leverage it.
Liquid Mortgage has integrated with Redwood subservicer to receive payment information that will be published on the blockchain daily.
This is a significant first step toward applying technological advancements and transparency to an area of the mortgage industry that has historically been less advanced.
We are excited to be leading the market in this effort and expect to implement this enhanced functionality going forward.
In fact, liquid mortgages also acting as DLA on our most recent Sequoia securitization, which closed in October and is backed by $407 million of jumbo residential loans.
Leveraging technology remains a major organizational focus and we continue to achieve milestones on our organic technology roadmap.
Rapid funding through which we provide accelerated settlement timelines for sellers, recently eclipsed $1 billion in purchases since program inception one year ago.
Our Redwood Live app has also gained significant traction recently, and we expect seller adoption to increase and allow us to continue growing wallet share with our seller base.
The third quarter was also another high point for CoreVest our business purpose lending platform, the third quarter $639 million in fundings were the highest since late 2019 and reflected a consistent balance between single family rental and bridge SFR fundings totaled $394 million, up 26% from the second quarter.
Production deposition does the price and SFR securitization in early October, backed by approximately $304 million in loans and CoreVests 19th securitization overall.
CoreVest continues to deepen its operational moat.
And during the third quarter we achieved a T capital markets milestone as well when completing our inaugural transaction backed by bridge loans.
CoreVests has long been an industry leading bridge lender and we expect structures like this to further drive our competitive advantage.
The transaction creates $300 million of financing capacity of which we sold liabilities representing 90% of the capital structure.
Procuring additional leverage on a non-recourse, non-marginal basis at a cost of funds of less than 2.5% on the issued bonds.
Importantly, the transaction was structured with a 30 month reinvestment period for loan payoffs.
The longest of its kind to date for this type of transaction, making it another important liquidity management tool for the business as we expand originations.
Operating momentum in the Bridge business means we will likely use these types of structures and others likely going forward.
As third quarter fundings total $245 million, an increase of 14% from the second quarter.
As competition ramps up across the BPL market, product development remains a key priority.
We continue to expand our channels and BPL through a combination of direct lending and sourcing loans from third party originators.
To that end, during the third quarter, we made key progress in our correspondent loan business and further capitalize on our strategic investment in Churchill.
Our technology initiatives also continued to advance in the quarter furthering this expansion.
We launched an initial release of our refresh client portal with strong initial feedback and remain focused on creating more efficiencies at the front end of the underwriting process.
The fourth quarter has traditionally been our most prolific for BPL originations and we feel confident about our capacity to manage higher volumes entering 2022.
Our investment portfolio remained in step with our operating progress and continue to generate strong returns with our securities book appreciating in value by approximately 15 % [Phonetic] during the third quarter, and our bridge portfolio helping to drive net interest income higher.
As Brooke will discuss in more detail, we believe there remains significant value to be unlocked from our investments based on the remaining discount in the book, coupled with continued execution of our call ride strategy.
As Chris noted, our portfolio team delivered its own first of its kind transaction during the third quarter cosponsoring a securitization backed entirely by residential home equity investments.
Completed in partnership with Point Digital, a fintech originator.
The hallmark transaction is backed by a product that enables consumers to monetize equity in their homes, without having to sell or incur additional debt.
Of the $34 trillion in total estimated US home value that we mapped out and invest today, approximately $23 trillion is in home equity, either backing existing debt or held for cash by a growing cohort of zero LTV borrowers, while Point and others have made progress and unlocking a small portion of this value.
The opportunity demands additional product creativity and flexible capital.
In parallel with a securitization, we reupped our flow purchase arrangement with Point, providing us with a continued acquisition source and the opportunity to explore adjacent products.
Point and Liquid Mortgage were too early Redwood Horizons investments and are now part of a growing suite of portfolio companies that we believe will be a driver of long-term value creation for Redwood.
Horizons continued it's strong investment pace during the third quarter completing six investments in total.
The go forward pipeline is highlighted by an array of technology solutions, including several opportunities and climate analytics, particularly busy areas, firms attempt to evolve traditional methods of predicting how climate change impacts property valuation, insurability and overall credit performance.
With a direct nexus to our firmwide ESG work, we expect to continue dedicating focus to this area.
Our efforts to drive scale in our current businesses while executing on initiatives to innovate and reimagine the industry, drove another strong quarter financial results.
We report a GAAP earnings of $0.65 per diluted share, representing a 27% annualized return on equity for the quarter, which significantly outpaced our dividends.
As a result, book value increased $0.54 or 4.7% to $12 per share on the quarter.
We've had an outstanding 2021 today and are pleased to have built on the momentum from the first half of the year.
We delivered our third consecutive dividend increase of 17% to $0.21 per share ahead of market expectations.
We have consistently generated annualized economic returns in excess of 20% over the last five quarters.
Our economic return spotlights not only the evolution of our dividends, but more importantly, the expansion in our book value.
Our results reflect the operating leverage of the platform.
In the first nine months of the year, transaction volumes and our mortgage banking businesses have already surpassed the average annual volumes of the past several years.
On a combined basis, our operating businesses generated an annualized after-tax operating return of 31% in Q3.
They utilized roughly 450 million of average capital or 30% of our total allocated capital that produced two-thirds of our adjusted revenue for the quarter.
As a reminder, these earnings can be retained in the business, driving the differential between the nearly 5% increase in book value and 2% increase contributed from the investment portfolio.
This underscores our ability to create organic capital, which we've been continuing to convey to the market.
The residential mortgage banking team generated a 26% after tax operating return on capital during the quarter.
Income from mortgage banking activities net was 12 million higher than the second quarter as loan purchase commitments of $3.3 billion increased 20% from the second quarter, and our gross margins improved approximately 25 basis points, which is above the high end of our historical range.
Margin expansion was attributable to improved execution on securitization during the quarter and hedge outperformance into a rising rate environment.
We saw continued strength from our business purpose mortgage banking operations, which delivered a 43% after-tax operating return on capital.
Spreads continued to tighten in Q3, but the pace moderated, resulting in a lower increase in the price of loans and inventory at the beginning of the quarter relative to second quarters change.
Aside from this, BPL mortgage banking results benefited from a 22% increase in funding volume, as well as strong execution on the securitizations completed in the quarter.
Next, I'll turn to the investment portfolio, which has been a consistent source of value creation in 2021.
Following the $95 million of investment fair value changes we booked through the second quarter.
We had another $26 million in Q3 from further improvement in credit performance and spread tightening, particularly in our third-party reperforming loan and retain for best securities.
Additional positive fair value changes were realized through the first ever securitization of home equity investments.
Separately, during the quarter, we settled call rights on to Sequoia securitization, acquiring 66 million of season jumbo loans at par, which had a small benefit to book value.
Portfolio net interest income increased by roughly nine million, driven by lower interest expense on bridge loan financing and increased discount accretion income on our available-for-sale securities.
The increase in accretion was driven by expectations for certain of our retains Sequoia securities to be called over the next several quarters, benefiting our cash flow forecasts and effective yields for those investments.
But it is important to note that there is no impact book value from these changes.
Looking ahead, net of our third quarter gains, there remains potential upside of roughly $3 per share in our portfolio through a combination of accretable market discount and call REITs that we control.
We estimate $1.2 billion of loans can become callable across capital and Sequoia through the end of 2022.
Should current market conditions persist, these callable loans can generally be sold or resecuritized well above their par value.
REIT taxable income increased to $0.14 per share from $0.11 in the second quarter due to higher net interest income.
Our taxable REIT subsidiaries earned $0.32 per share in Q3 up from $0.27 in Q2.
We recognized a lower income tax provision compared to the second quarter from the release of valuation allowance on a portion of our deferred tax assets, partially offset by an increase in state taxes.
Our balance sheet and funding profile remain in excellent shape with unrestricted cash of $557 million, which equates to over 75% of our outstanding marginable debt.
We also had investable capital of $350 million to deploy into new investments.
During the quarter, we added $350 million of financing capacity to support growth of our operating platform.
We also completed the bridge securitization and a new $100 million non-marketable term financing collateralized by retain capital securities in our investment portfolio, each of those which contributed roughly -- to a roughly 20 basis point reduction in the cost of funds of our business purpose lending segment.
Our recourse leverage was unchanged at 2.2 times, as we incurred additional warehouse borrowings to finance higher loan inventories, while rotating certain financings into non-recourse debt and experiencing appreciation of our equity base.
One central tenet of our strategic plan is to continue enhancing our capital and operating efficiencies.
During the third quarter, we maintain cost per loan for our residential mortgage banking operations of 28 basis points, compared with our historical average of 35 basis points during 2013 to 2019.
Our business purpose mortgage banking operations also delivered improved efficiencies, with a lower net cost to originate relative to the second quarter.
Even with higher general and administrative expenses on the quarter, due to increased variable compensation tied to our strong year to date financial performance, various efficiency ratios, such as pre-tax margin or operating expense as a percentage of GAAP net income, demonstrate very positive trend lines and our efficiency gains.
And finally, we are embedding sustainability across our operations and investment strategy.
We are committed to transparency and further integrating ESG into our financial reporting going forward.
We recently provided a comprehensive ESG review at our Investor Day event in September, including new disclosure of human capital metrics, and programs and an overview of our key priorities and top commitments over the near to intermediate term.
As Dash mentioned, we are analyzing opportunities within horizon, which will aid our evaluation of various environmental and social impacts and risks within the portfolio.
It has the potential to further evolve our risk management policies and build our upper regional resilience.
","In Q3 2021, Redwood Trust continued its transformative growth, exceeding expectations and delivering strong financial results. GAAP earnings were $0.65 per diluted share, contributing to a 4.7% quarterly increase in GAAP book value to $12 per share and an overall 21% year-to-date increase despite dividend increases. The company witnessed record-breaking performance across multiple operating verticals, reinforcing the durability of its business model. Notable achievements included innovative transactions such as the first private label RMBS securitization leveraging blockchain technology, the first ever bridge loan securitization, and the first securitization entirely backed by home equity investments. The company also unveiled a bolder strategic vision to become a leading operator and capital provider in sustainable housing finance. Despite ongoing macro and market risks, Redwood Trust remains optimistic about its business while maintaining a cautious approach. The key drivers of profitability across its platforms continue to be strong execution, technological innovation, and diversification. The residential mortgage banking business generated a 26% after-tax operating return on capital, while business purpose mortgage banking delivered a 43% return. The investment portfolio provided value creation through credit performance and spread tightening, with potential for further upside. Redwood Trust's balance sheet and funding profile remain robust, with significant cash and investable capital. The company is also focused on enhancing its capital and operating efficiencies, while integrating sustainability into its operations and investment strategy."
WSO_q1_2021.txt,"And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who's the President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan.
Before we start, our usual cautionary statement.
Now on to our financial report.
Watsco achieved record first quarter results.
Earnings per share grew 93% to a record $1.39 per share.
Records were set for sales, gross profits, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share.
Now these results were driven by strong sales growth made at higher selling margins, along with improved operating efficiencies.
When we look at our product offering, we achieved double-digit sales growth in equipment, non-equipment, and commercial refrigeration.
And in terms of geography, growth rates during the quarter were similar for U.S. markets and international markets as a whole.
For HVAC equipment, residential sales increased 18%, and commercial equipment sales stabilize and are now trending more positively.
But more important, this is not just about one quarter.
Over the last 12 months, residential equipment sales in our U.S. markets have increased 15%, and we believe meaningful market share gains have been achieved.
Looking forward, we expect business to be strong and that 2021 will be another record year of performance for our company.
Adding more color, Watsco's industry-leading technology continues to gain adoption.
That leads to new customer acquisition and we believe development of greater market share.
Now a few important trends are also continuing.
Active technology users continue to outpace growth rates of nonusers.
Customer attrition among active technology users is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers, and our platforms used by contractors to make sales to homeowners gain more users.
We are happy with our progress, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments.
We, once again, invite you to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its impact.
Moving along financially, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt.
We're excited to have closed two weeks ago on the acquisition of Temperature Equipment Corporation, also known as TEC.
This is a long-established, generationally owned company headquartered in Chicago.
TEC adds 32 locations and approximately $300 million in revenue and establishes Watsco's first major presence in the Midwest United States.
I must say that TEC is a great company with a long and proud history.
They are led by a wonderful team of entrepreneurs, and we are honored to be part of their family.
They are also off to a strong start this year, and we expect their results to be accretive to 2021 results.
We continue to look for other transactions with great businesses like TEC.
While doing our search, we offer our well-known culture -- that is to say, again, when we search, we offer our well-known culture that respects and continues a company's distinct legacy, and we support their plans for growth.
We think that Watsco is a great next step for family owned companies in our industry.
Lastly, a reminder that we raised our dividends by 10% in April 2021 to $7.80, a follow-up to the record cash flow achieved in 2020.
We believe our dividend is a good reason to watch Watsco over the long term.
2021 marks our 47th consecutive year of paying dividends, and yet, we have increased our dividends 19 over the last 20 years, from $0.10 per share in '20 -- in the year 2000 -- let me say that again.
From $0.10 per share in '20 -- in the year 2000 to today's annual rate of $7.80.
","Watsco reported record first-quarter results, driven by robust sales increases and enhanced operational efficiency. Earnings per share surged 93% to $1.39, hitting record highs in sales, gross profits, and net income. Double-digit growth was achieved in equipment, non-equipment, and commercial refrigeration product categories. Notably, residential HVAC equipment sales grew 18% over both the quarter and the past year. This performance is projected to continue with the company expecting a solid year, anticipating 2021 as another record-breaking year. Watsco's technology initiatives continue to drive growth, leading to new customer acquisition and increased market share. Moreover, the company's balance sheet remains robust, and it recently closed the acquisition of Temperature Equipment Corporation (TEC), marking its debut in the Midwest. With dividend payments having been increased by 10% in April 2021, Watsco's commitment to shareholders continues, and the company seeks further growth and acquisition opportunities in the industry."
FR_q4_2019.txt,"These statements are based on management's expectations, plans, and estimates of our prospects.
Today's statements may be time sensitive and accurate only as of today's date, Thursday, February 13, 2020.
We assume no obligation to update our statements or the other information we provide.
Also on the call today are Jojo Yap, our Chief Investment Officer; Peter Schultz, Executive Vice President; Chris Schneider, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Bob Walter, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Asset Management.
We finished 2019 with an excellent fourth quarter to cap up another successful year.
For 2020, we expect more of the same, leveraging our platform to generate more cash flow growth and value creation.
Occupancy at year end was a very strong 97.6% and full year cash rental rate growth was 13.9%, a Company record.
Both of these metrics reflect continued strong tenant demand for logistics space, and the great work of our leasing and operations professionals.
We developed a number of high quality facilities at strong margins, and replenished our pipeline with the acquisition of several exciting new sites and target markets, particularly Miami.
In addition, we continue to shape our portfolio to drive long-term growth as we further increase our capital allocation to higher barrier markets.
Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, let me provide you with a quick overview of the national industrial market.
According to CBRE Econometric Advisors, new supply for 2019 was 224 million square feet compared to net absorption of 183 million.
This marks the first time since 2009 that new supply exceeded net absorption.
Despite this, our outlook for 2020 is similar to that of 2019.
Vacancies remain low and excess new construction continues to be concentrated primarily in larger format buildings in certain sub-markets, most notably Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston.
We continue to see new tenant requirements from a range of industries across all of our markets.
So the overall environment remains very favorable for strong demand and rent growth.
That's also the case for our portfolio.
We've signed leases for approximately 60% of our 2020 rollovers at a cash rental rate increase of more than 9%.
Included in these results is the long-term renewal of our largest rollover, a 675,000 square foot single tenant building in Central Pennsylvania.
Our expirations for the balance of 2020 are fairly granular.
For the full year, we expect cash rental rate growth of approximately 10% to 14% on our new and renewal leasing.
Turning now to a few highlights from our development program.
In the fourth quarter, we placed in-service seven developments totaling 2.1 million square feet with a total investment of $165 million.
Included in this total is our 556,000 square footer at First Aurora Commerce Center in Denver.
As evidence of the strength of this market, we signed a long-term lease for 100% of the space, which commenced shortly after completion of construction.
In total for 2019, we placed in service 13 buildings totaling 4.4 million square feet with an estimated investment of $325 million.
These assets are 91% leased with an estimated cash yield of 6.7%.
This represents an expected margin of 42% to 52%.
At the mid-point, that would translate to a little over $1 per share in NAV accretion.
At year end, our pipeline of completed developments in lease-up and under construction totaled 3 million square feet with a total estimated investment of $277 million and a projected cash yield of 6.9%.
They are 36% leased and have an expected margin of approximately 40% to 50%.
This pipeline includes a few new starts in the fourth quarter on both Coast and in Dallas.
Starting on the West Coast, First Redwood Logistics Center II is a 72,000 square foot building in the Inland Empire West, with an estimated total investment of $12.6 million.
Completion is set for the third quarter with a cash yield of 5.2%.
In Los Angeles, one mile north of the Port of Long Beach, we acquired a 1.8 acre site for $6 million.
It's leased as a surface lot with an in-place yield of 5.4%.
In Northwest Dallas, we broke ground on our 435,000 square foot multi-tenant building at Phase 2 of our First Park 121 with an estimated investment of $31.2 million and a targeted cash yield of 6.7%.
This building is 77% pre-leased.
We expect to complete this development in Q3.
Moving across the country to South Florida, we've been very active in expanding our development pipeline there.
We broke ground on our First Cypress Creek Commerce Center, a three building park totaling 374,000 square feet on land for which we have a 50-year ground lease.
Our estimated total investment for the building is $35.6 million, with a targeted cash yield of 7.1% and completion is slated for Q4.
We also acquired seven acres of land and broke ground on First Sawgrass Commerce Center, a 104,000 square footer in Broward County, estimated investment is $15.3 million, with a targeted yield of 5.8%, completion is expected in Q3.
On our last call, we discussed our 19.6 acre covered land investment in South Florida for $19.8 million.
Recall this site has three below market ground leases that are currently yielding 3.5%.
We also added another 9 acre site in the Miami market for $8.6 million on which we can develop 131,000 square feet.
Thus far, in the first quarter of 2020, we're very pleased to announce the acquisition of a new land site we call First Park Miami.
We acquired 63 developable acres in Medley, a great infill location where land is difficult to come by.
Our acquisition price was $48.9 million and we can build 1.2 million square feet in total on the site.
We will begin the first phase of development this summer, with three multi-tenant buildings totaling approximately 600,000 square feet.
Total estimated investment for these three buildings is approximately $90 million reflecting land, pre-development and construction costs.
Our target stabilized yield is in the mid-5s.
For the year, building acquisitions totaled 542,000 square feet for $67 million with an expected stabilized cap rate of 5.4%.
So far in the first quarter of 2020, we've acquired our first building in the East Bay market of Northern California.
The property is a 23,000 square footer in the I-880 Hayward submarket, purchase price was $4.9 million, and our expected yield is 5.3%.
We completed $155 million of sales in the fourth quarter, comprising 3.6 million square feet and one land parcel.
These sales were consistent with our ongoing portfolio management efforts that support better long-term cash flow growth.
With these sales, our market footprint has significantly changed.
The largest portion of these dispositions came from the sale of substantially all of our Indianapolis portfolio which totaled $98 million and 2.7 million square feet.
Other notable sales included two buildings in St. Louis totaling $13 million and 245,000 square feet.
With just one building remaining in each of these markets, we've moved those properties to the other category in the portfolio reporting section of our supplemental.
Thus far, in the first quarter, we sold 226,000 square feet in Tampa for $26.5 million.
With this sale, we've now effectively exited the Tampa market with just leased land remaining there.
Our efforts in Florida are now focused in the South Florida and Orlando markets.
Given the leasing progress and rollover status of our portfolios in each of these three markets, we felt the time was right to further simplify our market exposure and redeploy these proceeds into higher rental growth opportunities.
For 2019, dispositions totaled $261 million and comprised 5.2 million square feet and four land parcels.
These figures exclude the sale on Phoenix recognized for accounting purposes in the third quarter of 2019 that is scheduled to close in the third quarter.
For 2020, our guidance for sales is $125 million to $175 million.
As is typical, we expect the majority of 2020 sales to be back-end loaded.
Note this guidance does not include the sale of the Phoenix asset I just mentioned.
Based on our strong 2019 performance and outlook, which Scott will discuss shortly, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per share for the first quarter of 2020.
This is $1 per share annualized, which equates to an 8.7% increase from 2019.
This dividend level represents a payout ratio of approximately 64% of our anticipated AFFO for 2020 as defined in our supplemental.
Another note on AFFO.
At our last Investor Day in November of 2017, we discussed our opportunity to achieve adjusted funds from operations of $200 million in 2020.
If we achieve the mid-point of our overall guidance for the year, we will deliver on that opportunity.
This would represent compound annual growth of 9% over the period.
In the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.76 versus $0.40 one year ago.
And for the full year, diluted earnings per share was $1.88 versus $1.31 for the prior year.
NAREIT funds from operations were $0.45 per fully diluted share compared to $0.42 per share in 4Q 2018.
Excluding a $0.01 of income related to insurance settlements for damaged properties, 4Q 2018 FFO was $0.41 per share.
For the full year, NAREIT FFO per share was $1.74 versus $1.60 in 2018.
As Peter noted, occupancy was 97.6% down 10 basis points for the prior quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we commenced approximately 4.1 million square feet of leases, 757,000 square feet were new, 1.3 million were renewals, and 2.1 million square feet were for developments in acquisitions with lease-up.
Tenant retention by square footage was 81.4%.
Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis excluding termination fees was 2.1% and for the full year 2019, cash same-store growth before lease termination fees was 3.1%.
Cash rental rates were up 9.7% overall, with renewals up 8.2% and new leasing 12.4%.
On a straight line basis, overall rental rates were up 20.4% with renewals increasing 18.5% and new leasing up 23.8%.
For the year, cash rental rates were up 13.9% overall which is a Company record and on a straight line basis, they were up 26%.
Moving on to a few balance sheet metrics.
At the end of 4Q, our net debt plus preferred stocks to adjusted EBITDA is 4.6 times and at December 31st, the weighted average maturity of our unsecured notes, term loans, and secured financings was 5.8 years with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%.
These figures exclude our credit facility.
Our NAREIT FFO guidance is $1.77 to $1.87 per share with a mid-point of $1.82.
Excluding a $0.01 per share of costs related to severance from the closure of our Indianapolis office and costs related to projected vestings of equity awards for retirement eligible employees, FFO guidance is $1.78 to $1.88 per share with a mid-point of $1.83.
The key assumptions for guidance are as follows.
Quarter-end average in-service occupancy for the year of 97% to 98%, we anticipate first quarter occupancy will have a typical seasonal dip, which could be as much as 75 basis points to 100 basis points.
Our bad debt expense assumption for 2020 is $2 million consistent with last year's assumption.
One of our largest tenants, Pier 1 Imports has been in the news lately.
Our guidance assumes that Pier 1 will continue to occupy our 644,000 square foot facility in Baltimore for the entire year, as this facility is a critical part of their supply chain and I note that they are current on their rent.
Also for your information, the expected FFO from the lease to Pier 1 for the period of March through year end is approximately $2.5 million.
Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees is expected to be 4% to 5.5%.
And our cash, same-store metric for the first two quarters is expected to be higher than the remainder of the year due to the benefit of burn off free rent related to developments.
Our G&A guidance range is $31 million to $32 million which excludes a $0.01 per share of severance costs from the closure of our Indianapolis office and costs related to projected vesting of equity awards for retirement eligible employees.
Please also note that besides the normal annual increase in expenses, G&A also includes incremental costs related to a new compensation plan, the compensation committee put in place in 2020, which is more tilted toward total stock return than the prior-plan.
Guidance also includes the anticipated 2020 costs related to our completed and under construction developments at December 31st, plus the planned start of First Park Miami.
In total, for the full year of 2020, we expect to capitalize about $0.03 per share of interest related to our developments.
The impact of any future gains related to the final settlement, two insurance claims from damaged properties and guidance also excludes the potential issuance of equity.
We're excited about our new developments through which we can serve the logistics needs of our customers while expanding our portfolio in key markets and creating value for shareholders.
","First Industrial Realty Trust reported strong performance in 2019, with record-high occupancy of 97.6% and a 13.9% increase in cash rental rates. The company developed and acquired high-quality properties, expanding its portfolio in key markets. For 2020, the company expects continued growth with occupancy projected between 97% and 98%, and cash rental rate growth of 10% to 14%. Developments in progress are expected to add 3 million square feet, with an estimated margin of 40% to 50% and an expected yield of 6.9%. The company also plans to begin construction on the first phase of its First Park Miami project, which will add 1.2 million square feet to its portfolio. Despite concerns about Pier 1 Imports, the company anticipates Pier 1 will continue to occupy its Baltimore facility for the year, and expects AFFO of $1.77 to $1.87 per share in 2020, representing an increase from 2019."
CBT_q4_2021.txt,"Last night,we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica will review the business segment and corporate financial details.
At this time last year.
I talked about being prepared to win as the recovery takes hold and I think 2021 is evidence that we were prepared.
Fiscal 2021 was a remarkable year for Cabot as the business recovered from the 2020 COVID lows to deliver record results.
We accomplished this through a combination of extraordinary execution and our commitment to driving growth through differentiated investments.
I would like to spend a little time now recapping the accomplishments of the year.
The Cabot operating model is built on the foundations of commercial and operational excellence and our strength in these disciplines drove our outstanding results in fiscal year 2021.
We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and total segment EBIT of $550 million.
And our focus on cash, resulted in a record discretionary free cash flow of $353 million.
The macro environment in 2021 required resilience and agility and I'm very proud of the Cabot team in how they work tirelessly to support our customers' evolving needs.
Serving our customers and innovating to grow with them is what motivates our team.
This was made more challenging in 2021 given the myriad global supply chain disruptions that companies face and the fact that necessary COVID safety protocols continue to evolve and adjust our normal ways of working.
Additionally, companies experienced sharply rising input costs, which required dynamic commercial management.
Our teams worked closely with our customers to manage through this environment and we were successful in our pricing efforts to ensure our margins remained robust and we could invest to support our customers long-term supply needs.
Fiscal year 2021 mark the sixth year of our advancing the core strategy and I'm very pleased with our record of execution and the growth prospects for our company.
Adjusted earnings per share has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% since the inception of our strategy, ahead of our 7% to 10% target.
A growth focus built around our core segments and disciplined execution have been the hallmarks of our approach.
As pleased as we are with the results since 2015, I'm even more excited about the growth opportunities that lie in front of us and the progress we made in 2021.
Our growth strategy is built on a philosophy of investing from positions of strength and where we have what we call a right to win.
A few highlights from 2021 are particularly noteworthy.
Our unmatched portfolio of conductive carbon additives in our strong customer focus model resulted in a doubling of revenue in our battery materials business year-over-year.
We are progressing with the specialty carbons conversion of our plants in Xuzhou, China and this investment will provide growth across our broad range of specialty carbon applications and will free up additional capacity to support battery materials.
Our inkjet business is well positioned to capitalize on the shift in the commercial and packaging segments from analog to digital printing and we achieved multiple OEM qualifications in 2021 that set us up well for growth as inkjet presses penetrate these markets.
And finally, we continue to the execution of a project to build a specialty compounds production line in Cilegon, Indonesia, which will allow us to meet customer demand for black masterbatch in this high growth region.
While growth and execution are highlights from 2021, these accomplishments have been achieved with sustainability at the core.
We continued our sustainability journey in 2021 with several noteworthy accomplishments.
First and foremost, we committed to align our disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosure or TCFD and we engaged a third party to help us evaluate climate risks and opportunities following the TCFD guidelines.
We intend to share the results of this work in the coming months.
While the operating rhythm of 2021 was challenging, I'm very proud of our performance in employee safety.
Our total recordable incident rates of 0.34 keeps us firmly in the upper echelon of chemical and industrial companies.
We also completed a major air emissions control project at our carbon black manufacturing facility located in Louisiana.
This investment in control technology will result in improved air quality through the substantial elimination of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions and will ensure that we can support our customer supply needs in a sustainable fashion over the long term.
In addition, waste heat from the plant is being recovered and used to generate up to 50MW of cogen power without creating any additional emissions.
In August, we announced a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that has pricing that is based on the company's credit ratings, as well as our performance against annual intensity reduction targets for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.
The transaction reinforces our commitment to sustainability and was one of the first sustainability-linked revolving credit agreements in the U.S. chemical industry.
Lastly, as a chemical industry, we need to attract the next generation of talented and diverse candidates into our field of chemistry.
In support of this aim, Cabot is taking part in an industry effort to support the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative or FOSSI, which focuses on creating pathways for students at historically black colleges and universities to enter and succeed in STEM careers within the chemical industry.
This initiative will have a lasting and transformational impact on the students and our industry and we are proud to be an inaugural sponsor.
Overall, we had a very successful 2021 in terms of financial performance and progress against our strategic objectives.
This well-rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team.
Now a few comments on the fourth quarter.
I am pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.11.
This performance was 63% above the same quarter last year despite the effects of the semiconductor chip shortage and ongoing global supply chain disruptions, as well as a higher level of maintenance spending due to the timing of turnarounds.
We also continue the momentum of battery materials and ended the year with EBITDA in our previously communicated range of $15 million to $20 million.
Cash flow from operations was strong at $100 million in the quarter despite the impact of higher raw material prices.
I will start with discussing results in the Reinforcement Materials segment.
During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021, EBIT for Reinforcement Materials increased by $8 million and $167 million respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.
The increases were principally due to higher unit margins and higher volumes.
Higher margins were driven by higher spot pricing, particularly in Asia.
The higher volumes in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021 were due to a strong recovery in all regions from the COVID related impacts in fiscal 2020.
The fourth quarter results were also impacted by higher costs associated with the plant maintenance.
Globally, volumes were up 6% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period of the prior year due to 6% growth in the Americas, 5% increase in Europe and up 7% in Asia.
Higher volumes were driven by strong demand in all regions as the replacement tire market remain robust.
Looking at the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect a sequential increase in EBIT from a decrease in fixed costs with lower plant maintenance spend and as volumes are expected to increase modestly sequentially as demand for replacement tire remains solid.
Now turning to Performance Chemicals.
EBIT increased by $20 million in the fourth quarter and $93 million for the full year as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2020, primarily due to improved product mix, stronger volumes and higher customer pricing.
The stronger product mix was driven by an increase in sales into automotive and conductive carbon applications in our specialty carbons and compounds product line.
Pricing improved year-over-year in our fumed silica product lines, particularly in China.
Year-over-year volumes in the fourth fiscal quarter increased by 2% in performance additives and decreased by 8% in formulated solutions.
Volumes were impacted during the quarter, largely due to two plant outages as we discussed on last quarter's call.
This segment experienced increased maintenance costs in the fourth fiscal quarter as expected, but these higher costs were offset by $7 million of insurance proceeds related to a claim from earlier in fiscal 2021.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect sequential volume growth as one of the impacted plants came back online and a positive benefit from growth in our battery materials product line.
We anticipate higher input costs in the first quarter that will temporarily impact results until our latest round of announced price increases and surcharges can be fully implemented to recoup the rising costs.
Moving to Purification Solutions.
EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and full year EBIT increased $7 million.
The increases were driven by lower fixed costs from the sale of the mine in Texas and the related long-term activated carbon supply agreement and the favorable impact from improved pricing in our specialty applications.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect EBIT to decline sequentially due to seasonally lower volumes and higher maintenance costs due to planned turnaround activities.
I will now turn to corporate items.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $168 million and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.3 billion.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $100 million, which included a working capital decrease of $4 million.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were $80 million and additional uses of cash during the fourth quarter were $20 million for dividends.
During fiscal 2021, we generated $257 million of cash flow from operations, including an increase in net working capital of $222 million.
The working capital increase was largely driven by the impact of higher raw material costs on our inventory balances and accounts receivable balances as we passed higher costs onto our customers in our pricing.
The increase was also partially driven by the growth in our business year-over-year.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 were $195 million dollars, which included both our targeted growth investments and the spend related to U.S. EPA compliance projects.
We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $225 million and $250 million.
This estimate includes continued U.S. EPA related capital compliance spend and increased spending on growth projects related to high confidence, high return areas of the portfolio.
The growth related capital includes completing the conversion of upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty carbons, which is planned to come online in the second half of 2022.
In addition, we are executing on a new specialty compounds unit in Indonesia and have planned growth capital related to capacity expansions in battery materials and inkjet.
Additional uses of cash during the fiscal year included $80 million for dividends.
The operating tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 27% and we anticipate our operating tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of 27% to 29%.
As we look ahead to 2022, I'm excited about the growth opportunities in front of us.
Let me take a couple of minutes to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.
First, we will finalize our 2022 tire customer agreements and we remain positive about the outcome as security of supply remains the top priority for customers.
Demand continues to be strong and is projected to be robust in all regions.
Inventories levels are low across the value chain and global transportation flows remain challenging, all of which are placing a greater premium on local supply.
Second, we'll continue to advance a broad portfolio of strategic growth investments across the company.
In battery materials, we plan to expand capacity at our carbon nanotube facility in Zhuhai, China.
Additionally, the aforementioned specialty carbons conversion of our Suzhou plant will provide 50,000 metric tons of growth capacity across specialty carbons and will free up our network to support growth of battery materials.
We also expect to complete our new specialty compounds production unit in Indonesia later in the calendar year 2022, which will enable us to build on our strong position in the high growth ASEAN region.
And finally, we intend to build on our track record of execution by delivering earnings growth and strong cash flow, while maintaining our investment grade rating and industry-leading dividend.
I hope this gives you some color on our priorities for 2022.
I'll close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook for the year.
Clearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of fiscal 2021 and we feel very good about how the new year is shaping up.
We expect a step-up in Reinforcement Materials starting in the second quarter based on an expected positive outcome from our 2022 customer agreements.
We anticipate improved results across all product lines in the Performance Chemicals segment with above-market growth in our battery materials and inkjet product lines.
Based on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60.
The first quarter results are expected to be generally in line with the fourth quarter with results accelerating as we move through the year.
On the cash side, we anticipate strong free cash flow from year-over-year earnings growth, partially offset by an increase in working capital to support growth.
Cash flow will be used to fund advantage growth investments, dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
Overall, I'm very excited about where we are as a company and where we're going.
The growth opportunities we have in front of us are better than they have been at any point during my time as CEO.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are strong.
Our end markets remain robust and we continue to execute at a high level.
Looking ahead, we believe we have a winning formula, a talented team, an excellent portfolio of businesses that for growth and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on our strategic objectives and continue to grow and lead in our industry.
","In fiscal year 2021, Cabot achieved record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02, total segment EBIT of $550 million, and discretionary free cash flow of $353 million, marking six years of successful execution. The company's key growth initiatives include doubling revenue in its battery materials business, progressing the specialty carbon conversion in China, capitalizing on the digital printing shift in inkjet, and building a specialty compounds production line in Indonesia. Despite supply chain disruptions and rising input costs, Cabot delivered strong fourth-quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.11, boosted by increased volumes and higher margins in the Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals segments. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022, Cabot expects earnings per share between $5.20 and $5.60, driven by anticipated growth in battery materials and inkjet, as well as benefits from customer agreements in Reinforcement Materials. The company's capital investments will support growth in high-confidence areas and maintain its investment-grade rating."
HZO_q4_2021.txt,"Mr. Brett McGill President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Mike McLamb, Chief Financial Officer of the company.
These risks include, but are not limited to, the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, and the level of consumer spending, the company's ability to capitalize on opportunities or grow its market share, and numerous other factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I'm very proud of the extraordinary achievements of our team in fiscal 2021; record revenue of more than $2 billion record gross margin of over 30%, record earnings per share, all while achieving record net promoter customer satisfaction scores.
Given the extremely lean inventory and well documented supply chain issues, this is a great achievement in 2021.
Today, I'd like to share highlights from our fourth quarter and full year, followed by a discussion of the results of our strategic growth plan, which will continue to create shareholder value in 2022 and beyond.
Then, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide color on our 2022 financial outlook.
Let me start by touching on our fourth quarter and full year performance.
For the quarter, we generated 16% revenue growth, record gross margin of almost 38%, and record earnings per share of $1.45.
I'm extremely pleased that our strategic acquisitions are exceeding expectations and diversifying our model resulting in robust margins and earnings growth.
Our same-store sales for the quarter were down 7% versus 33% growth a year ago.
As supply chain challenges and lean inventory environment worsened and impacted us as we move through the later part of the quarter.
However, demand remained strong and we see no softening as consumers are still actively seeking the boating lifestyle.
This strong demand environment is highlighted by our customer deposits, which jumped more than 3 times last year's level to over 100 million.
Last year was elevated with increased demand, so this increase, this year, is a significant sign of strong and growing demand.
For the full-year, same-store sales growth was over 13%, on top of 25% a year ago.
Our significant geographic and product diversification along with the effective utilization of our digital platform are driving profitability and growth.
The marine industry is continuing to experience an influx of new boaters.
Given our scale, and global presence, we are benefiting from our growing share of the market.
And based on available industry data, we believe we continue to gain market share.
From a cadence perspective, the supply chain headwinds deteriorated as we moved through the quarter.
I want to emphasize that we are not seeing a demand issue, rather the timing of shipments is impacting our ability to fulfill some customer orders and therefore recognize revenue.
Simply put, if we had the boats, they would be delivered and we'd have even higher revenue.
We are working closely with our manufacturing partners to satisfy the strong demand.
But as many experts in the industry are forecasting it, we'll likely not improve materially until later in fiscal 2022.
It's a unique environment and one that is challenging to predict, but our team will continue to perform.
I also want to underscore our strategic growth plan, and how it is not only driving market share and revenue growth, but expanding company wide margins.
This quarter, we increased our operating margin by 130 basis points over last year's record to 9.5%.
We also finished the fiscal year with an operating margin increase of more than 300 basis points to over 10%.
This performance is directly attributable to our ability to execute our strategy, focusing on higher gross margin businesses, including charter, finance, insurance, marina, storage, parts, service and brokerage.
The gross margin strength we produced in the first nine months of the year accelerated in the September quarter.
Additionally, as we integrate our acquisitions, they continue to outperform and are aligned with our strategy of attributing to MarineMax's record margin expansion.
Specifically, each company we have acquired has outperformed their best year, or is on pace to outperform their best year.
Earlier this month, we shared that we have entered into an agreement to buy Intrepid Powerboats.
Many of you know that Intrepid is an iconic brand led by one of the best management teams in the industry.
We are very excited about having Ken Clinton and the Intrepid team join the MarineMax family.
We plan to support them with their innovative plans, provide them capital, and arm them with the tools to better serve the Intrepid nation.
Now, let me discuss our confidence we have that our strategy will continue to create sustained growth and long-term shareholder value in 2022 and beyond.
We continue to make significant progress on our vision of creating exceptional customer experiences through best services, products, and technology.
Our team remains focused on these initiatives, resulting in strong demand and margin.
We will accomplish this through our global market presence, premium brand, valuable real estate locations, exceptional customer service, technology investments, strategic acquisitions, industry-leading inventory management, and finally, a continued commitment to build on our strong company culture.
Supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, we will continue to make strategic accretive acquisitions in a disciplined manner.
The combination of being well capitalized and having a broad global geographic presence, has allowed, and will allow us to grow in many ways by adding additional dealers, marinas, storage, service related offerings, manufacturing an asset-light business such as our superyacht services business.
We continue to have strong demand and are ready to keep serving our loyal customers.
As supply constraints are resolved by manufacturers, we expect to ramp sales in the future.
Our scale continues to be a competitive advantage as we leverage our deep manufacturing relationships, our nationwide shared inventory, and our strong balance sheet to support the growing demand.
We believe the combination of driving operating leverage and generating significant cash flow, coupled with strong consumer demand, will result in sustained growth well into fiscal 2022 and beyond.
And with that update, I will ask Mike to provide more detailed comments on the quarter.
For the quarter, revenue grew 16% to over $462 million, even with the lean inventory environment, as we benefited from the accretive acquisitions we completed during the year.
Overall, our growth has been demand driven across generally all segments of products and across every global market.
We expected inventory to remain low through the quarter, but with the increased supply chain challenges, retail deliveries grew more challenging, which impacted revenue in excess of 50 million.
This led to decline in same-store sales growth.
Our units declined in the quarter, double digits, while our average unit selling price continued to expand.
However, with increasingly strong customer deposit visibility, coupled with our broad product portfolio and production insight from our manufacturing partners, we believe we are better positioned than most in our industry, resulting in market share gains in all our major segments.
Gross profit dollars increased over $58 million, while our gross margin rose 860 basis points to almost 38%.
Our initiatives to drive margin growth over the last several years continue to generate solid results.
Margins rose with contributions from multiple segments and businesses, including new and used boats, storage, parts and service, higher margin, finance, insurance, and brokerage businesses, as well as our global superyacht services businesses Northrop & Johnson and Fraser Yachts.
As expected, with Europe reopening, we did see improved sales and charter revenue in August and September this year.
About half of our margin improvement came from the growth in our superyacht services businesses.
Regarding SG&A, the majority of the increase was again due to rising sales and related commissions, combined with the recent acquisitions.
SG&A rose as a percentage for a few reasons.
We did expect significantly more sales, which are not lost, but delayed.
Additionally, as our higher margin businesses grow, the compensation related to those businesses are higher.
We had elevated acquisition costs in a smaller quarter, not to mention some cost inflation.
We believe SG&A overall is generally on track on an annual basis, but we will watch the inflationary pressures carefully.
Our operating leverage in the quarter was about 15%, which drove very strong earnings growth, setting another quarterly record with pre-tax earnings of over $43 million.
Our record September quarter saw both net income and earnings per share rise over 21%, generating $1.45 in earnings per share versus an adjusted $1.19 a year ago.
For the full year, I will make a few comments.
The acquisitions we completed were all successfully integrated, resulting in record setting results for each.
Additionally, the acquisitions we completed over the last few years are all contributing greatly to our results.
The management teams of each acquired company also are contributing to our overall success.
Our ability to acquire and integrate companies is greater today than at any point in our history.
During the year, we added significantly to the strength of our balance sheet while continuing to make significant long-term investments in our real estate portfolio, our digital capabilities, and our team.
Lastly, for the full year, our earnings per share was close to double the midpoint of our initial guidance.
And I would add that $6.78 is a pretty strong year.
Moving on to our industry-leading balance sheet.
We continue to build cash with over $220 million.
Our inventory at quarter end was $231 million, down 22%, excluding SkipperBuds and Cruiser Yachts, inventory declined about double that percentage.
Looking at our liabilities, short-term borrowings decreased sharply due to lower inventory and related financing, as well as an increase in cash generation.
Due to the demand we are seeing, customer deposits, as Brett said, more than tripled to over $100 million, setting another new record.
Our current ratio is over 2, and our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is at 1; both of these are very impressive balance sheet metrics.
Our tangible net worth is about 400 million.
Our balance sheet has always been a formidable strategic advantage, and now more than ever, it provides the capital for growth and expansion as opportunities arise in good or bad times.
Turning to our guidance for fiscal year 2022.
Fiscal 2021 and the September quarter generated significant operating leverage and demand remains strong.
The challenge with projecting 2022, are the assumptions around the supply chain.
Today, given what we're being told from our various manufacturing partners, we do expect retail unit growth in 2022.
However, until we see more stabilization in the supply chain, our guidance assumes basically flat units.
This, combined with increases in our average unit selling price, should provide annual same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits.
Including the remainder of the Cruisers and Nisswa acquisitions, we expect total annual revenue growth in the high single digits to 10%.
Given the inflationary pressures in the marketplace, we do expect modest margin pressure.
We have levers to mitigate these pressures but believe it's prudent to include it in our expectations for now.
Our guidance is also, before any other acquisitions that we may complete, including Intrepid, using the low end of our historical leverage range, plus a modest share increase and a tax rate of 20%, results in our earnings per share guidance range of $7.20 to $7.50.
Obviously, we expect to update you throughout the year as our visibility increases on the supply chain.
Turning to current trends, October is forecasted to end with positive same-store sales growth and our backlog is at record levels.
As we have said, industry demand remains strong and we are generally outperforming these elevated levels.
2021 generated landmark metrics for MarineMax and I am very proud of our team's ability to execute on our strategy and to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions, driving superior operating leverage.
We are pleased to see our business continue to build strength and are confident in our strategy for 2022 and beyond.
Our operating margin ended the fiscal year at over 10%, almost double 2019.
This is the result of our team's commitment to capitalize on the strong industry demand.
While we know we will face a few challenges related to the supply chain and inventory as we start fiscal 2022, beyond our organic growth, we will pursue additional brand expansions and higher margin businesses to support our strategy to create long-term shareholder value.
","MarineMax achieved record revenue and gross margins in fiscal 2021, with strong performance in Q4 despite supply chain challenges. Same-store sales decreased 7% in Q4 and 13% for the full year, attributed to inventory shortages. However, demand remained robust, as evidenced by a surge in customer deposits. The company's strategic acquisitions continue to exceed expectations and contribute to margin expansion, with each acquired company outperforming its previous record. MarineMax's focus on high-margin businesses has driven operating margin growth to over 10%, nearly double the 2019 level. Despite supply chain headwinds, revenue is expected to grow 10% in fiscal 2022, with earnings per share guidance of $7.20 to $7.50. The company's strong balance sheet and global presence position it well for sustained growth and shareholder value creation."
MFA_q1_2020.txt,"These types of statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those described in MFA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other reports that it may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Little did I know that I would have to compete for airtime with Chairman Powell who is testifying in the Senate at 10:00 AM.
I apologize for those of you who drew the short straw and get stuck on our call.
Before we begin, I want to give a shout out to our entire MFA team.
The last three months have obviously been extremely challenging and made exponentially more so by the fact that all of our efforts have been remote.
The Company fully implemented our business continuity plan during the third week of March and successfully completely transitioned to our remote work environment to address the operating risks associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The effort and commitment displayed by our entire team over the last three months has been extraordinary and I've been humbled by their dedication.
Before we discuss the first quarter of 2020 financial results, which frankly at this point seems like ancient history, I'd like to spend some time discussing what other important work streams have been taking place at MFA since March 23 and I think it will be obvious why we've been silent on so many of these activities.
These critical efforts have been comprised primarily of three things.
One, forbearance; two, balance sheet and liquidity management; and three, sourcing third-party capital.
As arduous that these forbearance agreements have been to negotiate and operate through, they have provided us with the time to manage our balance sheet and liquidity while also working to source third-party capital and we are grateful to our lending counterparties that stuck with us through three versions of forbearance plans.
During April and May, we significantly reduced our balance sheet in an effort to raise liquidity and delever.
Importantly, because we entered into these forbearance plans, we were able to manage our balance sheet in a more judicious fashion, given the time allowed through forbearance.
Many of our asset sales, particularly on mortgage-backed securities, were at prices significantly higher than the price levels that existed in late-March.
Our sales during the month of April alone of legacy non-agencies, CRTs, and MSR-related assets generated over $150 million of realized gains versus March 31 marks.
Now, while still down significantly from values at the end of February, the patience permitted through forbearance enabled us to work hard to lessen book value erosion.
We were also able to manage the sale of a large non-QM whole loan portfolio that traded in late-April and closed in mid-May.
While we realized a significant loss on the sale, we are confident that we achieved a much better execution by controlling and managing the trade than we would have realized had the lender just liquidated the pool.
In the end, all of our lenders will have been fully repaid with no deficiencies, which is another of the design goals of the forbearance plan.
It was clear to us in late March that our situation was not due to bad assets, but the fragile funding and the path forward would require more durable forms of financing.
We also recognize that term financing, margin holiday and/or non-mark-to-market financing would necessarily require higher haircuts and therefore more capital.
Our method for seeking third-party capital began somewhat passively during the last week of March with fielding incoming indications of interest.
As this process intensified with more and more parties together with negotiating NDAs and then responding to voluminous data requests, all the while with our hair on fire negotiating a forbearance agreement while managing our balance sheet and liquidity and we engaged Houlihan Lokey at the end of March to manage this process for us.
Initial indications of interest from a number of capital providers came back in mid-April, but as we continue to delever and raise liquidity, it became evident that our third-party capital needs have already changed.
We extended our initial forbearance agreement at the end of April to June 1 and as we entered May, we began to obtain better price discovery, particularly on our loan portfolio, which gave us more clarity as to our path forward.
We started a second round of proposals from third-party capital providers in mid-May.
And as we held due diligence and informational calls with many of these institutions, we found that there was a competitive dynamic at work and a keen interest in pursuing a transaction with MFA.
We signed a term sheet over Memorial Day weekend and have been working since to negotiate and document this agreement.
For obvious reasons, we could not communicate publicly about these activities and it was frustrating not to be able to provide the public disclosure and transparency on which we pride ourselves.
We signed these agreements last night and we're happy to announce today that we have entered into an agreement with Apollo and Athene, an insurance company affiliate of Apollo, to raise $500 million in the form of a senior secured note.
But this $500 million note is only part of a holistic solution for MFA and a very strategic partnership with Apollo and Athene.
Apollo and Athene together have arranged a committed term borrowing facility with Barclays of approximately $1.65 billion that includes over $500 million for participation from Athene.
This term non-mark-to-market facility will provide us with durable financing for a large portion of our loan portfolio.
In addition, Athene has committed to purchase, subject to certain pricing conditions, a portion of our first securitization of non-QM loans.
And finally, Apollo and Athene are engaged with another of our lenders to structure an additional similar lending facility for our fix and flip portfolio in which Athene also intends to participate.
Pro forma for these facilities, approximately 60% of the Company's financing will be in the form of non-mark-to-market funding, providing shareholders with significant downside protection in the event of future market volatility.
We expect that upon closing and funding of these transactions, we'll be able to satisfy remaining margin calls, which were only $32 million as of June 12 and exit from the current forbearance agreement on or before June 26.
We also anticipate using some of the proceeds to pay accumulated unpaid dividends on our Series B and C preferred stock issues.
And finally, we expect that this transaction will provide us with substantial capital to once again begin to pursue attractive investment opportunities.
As part of this transaction, Apollo and Athene will receive warrants to purchase MFA common stock at varying prices over a five-year period and will appoint a non-voting observer to our Board of Directors.
Apollo and Athene have also committed to purchase the lesser of 4.9% or $50 million of MFA stock in the open market over the next 12 months.
We are extremely excited about this transaction, which we consider to be much more than a capital raise and very much a strategic alliance.
Moving on to the financial results for the first quarter of 2020.
As others have described before us, the first quarter of 2020 was literally a tale of two distinct and utterly different periods in time.
January, February and the first two weeks of March were very normal and a good start to the new year.
And in only a few days, the financial markets and the mortgage market in particular completely collapsed.
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, pricing dislocations for markets and residential mortgage assets was so extreme that liquidity evaporated.
Prices of legacy non-agencies, which had not changed by more than 3 points in the last two to three years, were suddenly lower by 20 points.
CRT securities dropped as much as 20 points to 50 points and MSR-related asset prices were lower by 20 points to 30 points, all in a few days.
MFA received almost $800 million in margin calls during the weeks of March 16 and March 23 and over $600 million of these were on mortgage-backed securities.
In contrast, we received $7 million of margin calls on these portfolios during the entire week of March 2 and $37 million during the week of March 9.
And during the months of December, January, and February, we received a total of six margin calls, all related to factor changes with a total aggregate amount of $4 million.
During those same three months, we initiated 10 reverse margin calls totaling $14 million, meaning we received net $10 million more from our lenders due to price increases.
While we began selling assets during the week of March 16, the dearth of liquidity made this difficult.
We announced on March 24 that we had not met margin calls on March 23 and that we had initiated forbearance discussions with our financing counterparties.
As we began these negotiations, we continued to sell assets to raise liquidity and reduce leverage.
Our first quarter financial results were profoundly affected by realized losses, impairment losses, unrealized losses on loans accounted for at fair value, provisions for credit losses under the new CECL standard and valuation adjustments on assets designated and held-for-sale and resulted in a loss of $914 million or $2.02 per share.
Book value decreased to $4.34 per share at March 31 and economic book value decreased to $4.09 per share.
Steve Yarad will be available to discuss the financial results from the first quarter during the question-and-answer session.
I would now like to spend some time discussing balance sheet changes since March 31 and provide some perspective on what we envision after funding of the Apollo and Athene transaction and exit from forbearance.
Page 7 of the earnings deck shows portfolio activity from December 31 to March 31 and then again from March 31 to May 31.
As you can see from the pie charts, we have sold substantially all of our mortgage-backed securities and our $6.6 billion portfolio is approximately 94% whole loans.
This should not be a surprise as almost all of our portfolio growth and new acquisitions over the last two to three years has been in whole loans.
Mortgage-backed securities are admittedly more liquid and were therefore easier to sell, but we saw improvement in securities pricing through April and May whereas loan pricing changes were less defined and slower to occur, both on the way down and on the way back up.
More importantly, it is more difficult to get non-market -- non-mark-to-market financing on mortgage-backed securities than it is on loans due to certain regulatory issues.
So, the decision was relatively easy.
We view loans as generally more attractive assets and -- than securities and loans are more conducive to more durable financing arrangements.
In rough numbers, our whole loan portfolio today is comprised of non-QM loans, $2.4 billion, loans at fair value, $1.2 billion, fix and flip loans, $850 million, purchase credit impaired or reperforming loans, $660 million, single family rental, $500 million, season performing loans, $150 million, and REO or real estate owned of $375 million.
Looking forward, we will finance a significant portion of this portfolio through term non-mark-to-market financing, including securitization.
With the committed $1.65 billion in our existing securitizations of approximately $500 million, we will have over $2 billion of such financing.
And as mentioned previously, we are working on a similar committed line with Athene and another dealer for our fix and flip portfolio.
We will continue to pursue securitization, particularly for non-QM loans.
Spreads for AAA securities widened out from the 100 area, that's 100 over swaps in early March to as wide as plus 400 at the depth of the crisis, but they've been slowly grinding tighter and are now back to mid-100 levels.
We expect that following the closing and funding of these transactions, we will be able to declare and pay the accumulated dividends on our Series B and Series C preferred stock issues.
As we have disclosed previously, the terms of the forbearance agreement prohibited payments of dividends on any equity interests, including preferred stock.
Once the preferred stock dividends are current, we will no longer be prohibited from paying a common dividend.
As far as the dividend on MFA's common stock, the Board of Directors will determine our dividend policy going forward.
While we do not provide guidance as to expected future dividends, I will share several pertinent facts that will clearly be given consideration in framing dividend discussions with the Board.
One, at present we have undistributed REIT taxable income from 2019 of $0.05 per share.
In order to avoid paying corporate income tax, we are required to declare a dividend for this income prior to filing of our 2019 REIT tax return, which we do in October of this year and pay such dividend before the end of the year.
Two, estimated REIT taxable income or ordinary income for the first quarter of 2020, is approximately $0.10 per share.
In order to avoid paying a 4% excise tax on this amount, we are required to declare dividends in 2020 for at least 85% of our estimated 2020 REIT taxable income.
And three, capital losses, again for tax purposes, generated from sales of residential mortgage assets to date in 2020 are carried forward and offset future capital gains.
However, these capital losses do not offset ordinary REIT taxable income.
While we cannot forecast ordinary REIT taxable income for the balance of 2020, any such income generated will be added to the $0.10 in the first quarter in determining the threshold necessary to avoid the 4% excise tax.
Our other brief update.
At June 12, our unrestricted cash was $242 million.
Book value as of May 31 -- GAAP book value is estimated to have increased by approximately 2% to 3% versus March 31.
Economic book value is estimated to be flat versus March 31.
This is primarily because carrying value loan marks were lower in April than in March and while we have seen some appreciation from April to May, the May loan marks for carrying value loans, which is what determines economic book value for the difference between GAAP and economic book value, those marks are still below the March marks.
","MFA experienced a significant first-quarter loss of $914 million due to asset impairments and margin calls amid the market turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the company has focused on balance sheet management, liquidity improvement, and third-party capital sourcing. Through negotiations with Apollo and Athene, MFA has secured $500 million in senior secured notes and a committed term borrowing facility of approximately $1.65 billion, providing non-mark-to-market financing for its loan portfolio. This strategic partnership also includes the acquisition of MFA common stock by Apollo and Athene and the appointment of an observer to the Board of Directors. With these transactions, MFA expects to satisfy margin calls, exit its forbearance agreement, and resume dividend payments on preferred stock. The company's portfolio has transitioned to primarily whole loans, which will be financed through term non-mark-to-market arrangements. Book value as of May 31 is estimated to have increased slightly, driven by loan mark appreciation, while economic book value remains flat. MFA is optimistic about its capital raise and strategic partnership, enabling them to pursue investment opportunities and enhance downside protection."
HCA_q1_2021.txt,"The table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable -- attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. is included in today's release.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter.
The results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins.
Revenues grew over $1.1 billion, or 8.7% as compared to the prior year.
This growth was generated by highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in March.
Generally speaking, March trends are continuing into April.
Inpatient revenues increased by 12%.
The acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both the case mix index, which increased 7% and length of stay which grew by 6%.
Additionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits, compared to 26.5% last year.
The commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past four quarters.
These two factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admissions.
The total -- the total admits were down 4.2% year over year.
In comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%, which was -- which was in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total admissions.
Throughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined.
January with 17%, February was 8%, and March was down to almost 5%.
Outpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to the prior year.
This result is better performance than the previous two quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%.
Outpatient revenues declined in January and February, consistent with that trend.
But March, which had one additional weekday this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly.
Same facility outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year.
As compared to 2019, they declined 3%.
E.R. visits declined 18%.
This decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the previous two quarters.
visits were down 19% compared to 2019.
Our teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda.
The adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales as well as losses on debt retirement, increase 78% to $4.14.
During the quarter, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home health and hospitals business of Brookdale Senior Living.
This business provides us with a large platform that complements our local provider systems.
It will expand the services we offer across our networks and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their experiences.
Additionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for healthcare in the future with continuing growth and demand.
We anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter and we look forward to our new partnership with Brookdale.
Also during the quarter, we opened two new hospitals.
One in Denver and one in Orlando.
Each of these hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities.
In the second quarter, we expect to close on the acquisitions of two small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and Savannah.
And lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access, and value for patients by developing more outpatient facilities.
The pipeline for development and acquisition in this category remains strong.
As we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors.
Mainly, governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets including uninsured assumptions.
Bill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments.
The first corps is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by our teams were on display.
We could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our patients and the communities we serve.
As we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda, we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all our stakeholders.
Sam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results so I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter and then review our updated 2021 guidance.
As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
Capital spending for the quarter was $654 million and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter.
We have approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization and consistent with our year-end discussion.
We are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021 subject to market conditions.
Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85 times and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.
We expect revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion.
We expect full-year EBITDA to range between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion.
We expect full-year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30 and $14.30.
And our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion.
Our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first quarter, and also considers the extension of the public health emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year.
In summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the balance of the year, but we are confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles and we are well-positioned to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if they become available.
Please remind everyone to limit their questions to one so that we may keep trying and get in the queue as possible.
","HCA Healthcare reported strong first-quarter results, driven by higher revenue and improved margins.

IDA_q4_2019.txt,"The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website.
We'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call.
This cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We also have other company representatives available to help answer any questions you may have after Steve, Lisa and Darrel provide updates.
On Slide 4, we present our quarterly and annual financial results.
IDACORP's 2019 fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of $0.41 per share over last year's fourth quarter.
IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the full-year 2019 were $4.61, an increase of $0.12 per share over 2018.
These full-year results represent the 12th straight year of earnings growth for IDACORP and are the highest achieved in its history.
IDACORP's cumulative average growth rate in diluted earnings per share is 7.9% since 2007.
Today, we also initiated our full-year 2020 IDACORP earnings guidance estimate to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize any of the tax credits in 2020 that are available to support earnings in Idaho under its settlement stipulation with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.
Last week, we announced that after 24 years with the company that I would retire effective June 1 of this year.
In connection with this decision, our board of directors selected Lisa Grow to succeed me as president and CEO of IDACORP and Idaho Power effective June 1 and also appointed her to the boards of directors of both companies effective last week.
She's an electrical engineer by training and she's got over 32 years of experience at Idaho Power.
Not only does she have a long tenure at the company, she also has a long history with Idaho Power as her grandfather was a lineman with the company for 30 years prior to Lisa joining the company.
She has contributed significantly to the operational and financial success of Idaho Power since becoming an officer in 2005.
She has earned the opportunity to take over the reins as we move forward into 2020 and beyond.
I look forward to continuing to serve as a member of the board of directors once I step away from my executive roles.
With that short introduction, I will now turn the time over to Lisa for some updates on the company, as well as ongoing economic activities.
I am honored by the opportunity to succeed you, and I look forward to the exciting times ahead.
In addition to the financial success noted by Justin, Idaho Power set records across several of our important metrics: safety, customer satisfaction and reliability.
On Slide 5, we see details of the company's record employee safety results in 2019.
We are very excited and proud to see injuries at an all-time low as we continue to spend significant time on our safety culture and to emphasize the importance of safety at work and at home.
Our record-setting results in residential and business customer satisfaction are shown on Slide 6.
As the population within our service area continues to grow, Idaho Power is working hard to meet our customers' evolving needs.
Most Idaho Power customers experienced -- most Idaho customers experienced an overall price decrease for the second consecutive year in 2019 with business customers' rates going down by at least 5%.
Idaho Power's efforts to keep prices affordable, provide personal service and improve the customer experience are paying off as overall customer satisfaction metrics continue to rank near the top of the list among our peer utilities.
Reliability is a key piece of the customer satisfaction puzzle and is also included on Slide 6, which shows another outstanding year.
Idaho Power kept customers' lights on 99.975% of the time in 2019, and overall system reliability was among the best in company history, finishing very close to 2018's record results.
As noted on Slide 7, Idaho Power service area continues to experience substantial customer growth.
For the third year in a row, Idaho remains the fastest-growing state in the nation, and Idaho Power's customer base grew 2.5% in 2019, including a 2.7% growth rate for our residential customer segment.
Idaho Power now has more than 570,000 customers, and we view the reliable, affordable, clean energy that our company provides as a key driver for continuing to attract new customers.
The economy is thriving within Idaho Power's service area, and Moody's GDP forecast calls for sustained economic growth.
In 2019, Idaho Power experienced sales growth in its commercial and industrial sectors through a balanced mix of new business and expansion projects across the food processing, manufacturing, distribution and technology sectors.
Moody's current forecast of GDP in Idaho Power's service area predicts growth of 4.4% in 2020 and another 4.4% in 2021.
Meanwhile, employment increased 3.2%, and the unemployment rate was 2.8% at the end of 2019, compared with 3.5% nationally.
Turning to Slide 8.
Idaho Power's most recent integrated resource plan calls for continued work toward a unit-by-unit early exit from the Jim Bridger plant located in Wyoming by 2030.
In 2019, the company ended its participation in Unit 1 of the North Valmy plant in Nevada, which was a significant milestone in our path away from coal.
We also have an agreement to exit Unit 2 by 2025.
The Boardman plant in Oregon is also scheduled to cease operations this year.
In both cases, Idaho Power has State Public Utility Commission's support for a cost recovery framework to be applied through the end of their useful life, which we believe could provide a blueprint for a similar approach for Bridger.
We are continuing to explore options with PacifiCorp, the co-owner of Bridger, as we plan the end-of-life for the entire Jim Bridger plant.
PacifiCorp's IRP, as published last fall, showed early shutdown dates for two Bridger units as well.
Idaho Power's overall coal-fired generation has decreased for six consecutive years.
As recently as 2013, coal was our largest energy source at 47% of our total energy mix.
Today, that number is around 16%.
Our path away from coal, which is driven by the economics of the plant, aligns with our Clean Today, Cleaner Tomorrow plan to provide 100% clean energy by 2045.
Another key project in our Cleaner Tomorrow plan is the Boardman to Hemingway transmission project or B2H, which made solid progress in 2019.
The Oregon Department of Energy recommended approval of the 300-mile line.
The department is expected to release a proposed order, which is the next step in the permitting process, authorizing the transmission line this year.
If the permitting process remains on track, we expect the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council to issue a final order and site certificate in 2021.
Following preconstruction activities, construction is expected to begin as early as 2023, with the line expected to be in service in 2026 or sometime thereafter.
The IRP we amended and filed at the end of last month also plans for us to include 120 megawatts of solar from the Jackpot Solar power purchase agreement.
Idaho Power evaluated purchasing the project and elected not to pursue it.
We do not expect Idaho Power to file a general rate case in Idaho or Oregon in the next 12 months.
The influx of new customers, constructive regulatory outcomes and effective cost management all play significant roles in this decision.
With that, I will turn the time to Steve, who will go through the 2019 financial results.
We had excellent 2019 results.
Weather challenges through the year were more than offset by a very good final quarter.
I'll walk you through the drivers year over year on Slide 9.
Strong net customer growth of 2.5% added $18.8 million to operating income in 2019.
A decline in usage per customer, mostly related to lower irrigation sales, decreased operating income by $21.4 million.
Greater precipitation and more moderate spring and summer temperatures led to 11% less use per customer for those in the agricultural irrigation class this year.
Further down the table, net retail revenues per megawatt hour decreased operating income by $2.8 million.
As anticipated, the settlement stipulations associated with income tax reform reduced revenues more significantly in 2019.
Idaho Power's open access transmission tariff rates declined by 10% in October of 2018 and again by 13% in October 2019, lowering transmission wheeling-related revenues by $5.3 million.
These rates reset each year to align revenues with the cost of the transmission system.
To a lesser extent, lower transmission volumes also contributed to an overall reduced wheeling revenue this year.
Next on the table, other operating and maintenance expenses decreased $8.7 million as our team's continued focus on cost management resulted in lower expenses across several areas.
Contributing to this decrease was lower bad debt expense of $1.1 million due to a strong economy and the nonrecurrence of a 2018 O&M expense of $4 million for a noncash amortization of regulatory deferrals related to tax reform.
Idaho Power's 2019 return on year-end equity in Idaho landed between the 9.5% tax credit support level and the 10% customer sharing line under the Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation.
So we did not record any additional tax credit amortization or provision against revenues for sharing with Idaho customers this year.
Last year, we recorded a $5 million provision against revenues for sharing, which did not recur.
Idaho Power has the full $45 million of approved credits available to support earnings in future years.
As a reminder, the tax credit support line will be at 9.4% for 2020.
These items collectively resulted in a year-over-year increase to Idaho Power's operating income of $2.3 million.
Nonoperating income and expenses netted to a $9.9 million improvement to pre-tax earnings due to several items.
A $4.2 million charge in 2018 related to Idaho Power's post-retirement plan did not recur.
This was anticipated and reflected in our prior earnings guidance ranges.
Next, our allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $2.7 million as the average construction work in progress balance was higher throughout 2019.
Finally, stronger asset returns this year led to $2.1 million of higher investment income from the Rabbi Trust associated with Idaho Power's nonqualified defined benefit pension plans.
On the next line, you will see income taxes were higher by $10.1 million.
Remember that 2018 included $5.7 million of benefits from remeasurement of deferred taxes at Idaho Power due to income tax reform, as well as $1.3 million of tax-deductible bond redemption costs incurred last year.
There was no such remeasurement or bond redemption in 2019.
Amortization of newly funded vintage investment tax credits helped lower tax expense in the current year, while higher pre-tax income primarily contributed to the remainder of the increases.
Finally, at IDACORP Financial Services, distributions from the sale of low-income housing properties led to approximately $3 million higher net income at that subsidiary.
While the nature, timing and amount of the underlying property sales at IFS are difficult to predict and are controlled by third parties, we do not expect them to be as significant in 2020.
Overall, Idaho Power's and IDACORP's net income were $2.1 million and $6.1 million higher than last year, respectively.
IDACORP and Idaho Power continue to maintain strong balance sheets, including investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, which enable us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and dividend payments.
Regarding dividends, you'll note that in addition to the latest dividend increase of 6.3% announced by the board of directors last September, the board also increased IDACORP's target dividend payout ratio to 60% to 70% of sustainable earnings.
This reflects several years of our steady upward trajectory of dividend increases.
We expect to recommend an annual dividend increase of 5% or more to the board of directors in the coming year.
On Slide 10, we show IDACORP's operating cash flows along with our liquidity positions as of the end of 2019.
Cash flows from operations were $125 million lower than 2018.
These were mostly related to changes in regulatory assets and liabilities like those resulting from the power cost adjustment mechanism and the timing of working capital receipts and payments.
The liquidity available under IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities is shown on the bottom of Slide 10.
At this time, we do not anticipate issuing additional equity in 2020 other than relatively nominal amounts under the compensation plans.
Slide 11 shows our first look at full-year 2020 earnings guidance and our key financial and operating metrics estimates.
We are initiating IDACORP's 2020 earnings guidance in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share, which is up roughly 4% over prior-year guidance range and assumes no use of additional tax credits under normal weather conditions.
Our record 12 years of earnings growth is something that sets us apart from our peers.
We expect O&M expenses to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million, which would keep O&M relatively flat for the ninth straight year.
We expect capital expenditures will lift somewhat to the range of $300 million to $310 million.
You'll note that our updated five-year forecast of capital expenditures is also higher than our previous plan, now forecasted to range from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion over that time.
This forecast still does not include the majority of costs to build the major infrastructure projects, such as Boardman to Hemingway or increased compliance costs associated with the new Hells Canyon license due to the uncertainty and the exact timing of that spend.
Finally, our current reservoir storage and stream flow forecast suggests that hydropower generation should be in the range of 6.5 million to 8.5 million megawatt hours.
With that, I'll turn the time back to Darrel.
There is much to be proud of as we look back on the outstanding results of 2019.
While the energy industry is rapidly evolving, IDACORP continues to meet challenges and opportunities while delivering unparalleled results for customers and investors alike.
From meeting financial targets to striving for a cleaner energy future, we believe that our employees and our ongoing business strategy will help sustain our success into the future.
I will close with a look at weather on Slide 12.
The latest projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggests an equal chance of above or below normal precipitation levels and a 40% to 50% chance of above normal temperatures from March to May.
We have seen a lot of snow and rain in recent weeks.
As a reminder, our power cost adjustment mechanisms in Idaho and Oregon significantly reduced earnings volatility related to changes in our resource mix and associated power supply costs that can fluctuate greatly due to weather.
With that, Steve, Lisa and I and others here today will be happy to answer questions you may have.
","IDACORP's financial performance in 2019 was strong, with quarterly earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of $0.41 from the previous year. For the full year, earnings per share were $4.61, up $0.12 from 2018, marking 12 consecutive years of earnings growth. Employee safety, customer satisfaction, and reliability all set records. Idaho Power's customer base grew 2.5% in 2019, with 2.7% growth in the residential segment. Idaho's GDP is forecast to grow 4.4% in both 2020 and 2021. The Boardman to Hemingway transmission project made progress, with a proposed order for the 300-mile line expected this year. Idaho Power plans to invest 120 megawatts of solar from the Jackpot Solar power purchase agreement. No general rate case is expected in Idaho or Oregon in the next 12 months. For 2020, IDACORP anticipates earnings per share in the range of $4.45 to $4.65, assuming no use of additional tax credits. O&M expenses are expected to remain flat at $350 million to $360 million, while capital expenditures are forecast to increase slightly to $300 million to $310 million."
CUZ_q3_2021.txt,"If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available through the quarterly disclosures and supplemental SEC information links on the Investor Relations page of our website, cousins.com.
In particular, there are significant risks and uncertainties related to the severity and duration as the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing and strength of the recovery there from.
We began the third quarter with the expectation that our customers will begin bringing their teams back to the office post Labor Day.
Since then, the delta variant hit the Sun Belt hard and created delays.
However, as cases have now significantly declined, we're increasingly hearing from our customers that they plan to return toward the end of this year or early next year.
Our team delivered strong financial results during the third quarter.
Here are a few highlights.
On the earnings front, the team delivered $0.69 per share in FFO.
Same-property NOI on a cash basis increased 3.6%, and importantly, we leased over 597,000 square feet, including over 500,000 square feet of new and extension leases with 7.7 years of weighted average lease term and a net effective rent of $24.06 per square foot, which is higher than our 2019 average.
Second-generation cash rents increased 23.1%, our strongest rollout since 2015.
And we ended the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 4.54 times.
While the macro narrative around office remains ambiguous, our leasing performance highlights three office sector trends that are becoming quite clear.
First, innovative and growing companies recognize that they are stronger in person at least most of the time.
In this persistent remote environment, employee attrition is at an all-time high.
Contrary to many of the media headlines, forward-thinking business leaders are connecting the dots between the great resignation and eroding corporate cultures.
Thus, companies are firming up plans for their return strategy and making long-term real estate decisions that they were not prepared to make just a few quarters ago.
Second, the migration of the Sun Belt has accelerated.
Cisco, Visa, Ark Invest and Tesla are just the latest examples.
There are more in the pipeline.
The rapid urbanization is places like Downtown Austin, Midtown Atlanta, in the south end of Charlotte, have changed the equation for companies previously located in more dense, larger cities in the Northeast and West Coast.
Sunbelt cities now offer a dynamic urban experience in addition to an attractive climate and a lower cost of living and doing business.
It's the best of both worlds.
Lastly, the flight to quality is intensifying.
Earlier this week, I've toured our recently completed Norfolk Southern headquarters project with a local business leader.
His feedback, much better than working at home, he said.
It was simple and spot on.
The development includes innovative collaboration space, neighborhoods for private working, state-of-the-art technology and countless amenities, all in the heart of Midtown Atlanta.
Our customers recognize that interesting and inspiring space will be a competitive advantage in retaining and recruiting talent as well as rebuilding culture and connectivity.
At Cousins, we have a unique and compelling strategy that positions us at the intersection of these trends.
As the market moves faster, we are responding.
Most recently, we acquired Heights Union, a 294,000 square foot office property in Tampa for a gross price of $144.8 million.
The Heights neighborhood has emerged as one of Tampa's signature gathering spots providing a unique live, work, play experience.
The two 6-story buildings, which were completed in 2020 are highly amenitized, authentic and efficient.
Including Heights Union, we have invested approximately $1.1 billion in new acquisitions and development since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are excited about the RailYard in Charlotte, 725 Ponce in Atlanta, Domain nine in Austin and New Hawk in Nashville.
They are representative of the Office of the Future in our all differentiated products in their respective markets.
During the same period, we have sold approximately $1 billion of noncore properties, including Hearst Tower and one South in Charlotte, and Burnett Plaza in Fort Worth.
The net result of these strategic transactions are value-add returns on a blended basis and a trophy portfolio positioned to capture outsized customer demand and a reduced capex profile.
As I mentioned earlier, we have completed the Norfolk Southern headquarters project.
The development was a highly profitable development for Cousins and a great outcome for our customer, a true win-win.
Nonetheless, we are excited to transition to the other side of this unconventional transaction.
The declining development fee stream has created challenging year-over-year earnings comps and the 370,000 square foot lease expiration on December 31 at 1,200 Peachtree created uncertainty.
Looking forward to 2022 and beyond, our story simplified, and we are already making great early progress on our releasing efforts at 1,200 Peachtree as we are approximately 40% committed including LOIs.
Richard will touch on this more in a moment.
In closing, Cousins is well-positioned for the future.
We have assembled a trophy portfolio in fast-growing Sun Belt markets.
We have organic growth opportunities within the portfolio as we drive occupancy gains and rental rate increases.
We have external growth opportunities in our $663 million development pipeline.
In addition, we have a well-located land bank that can support another $2.6 billion in development, including over three million square feet of trophy office and over 1,500 multifamily units.
Importantly, we have a rock-solid balance sheet that provides financial flexibility and a highly capable team to execute on the strategy.
They are the cornerstone of the company's success.
This quarter, we continue to see economic recovery in our core markets and along with it, an increase in leasing and transaction activity.
In short, our third quarter operational performance was strong.
While the pandemic still remains and the delta variant delay the return to the office for some, we are encouraged by the demand for high-quality office space across our markets.
Due to the delta variant, portfolio level utilization, as we measure it, did not significantly increase this quarter.
With that said, there is noticeably more activity and energy at most of our properties compared to last quarter.
This is evidenced by a 27% increase in transient parking revenue quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to third quarter results.
our total office portfolio lease percentage and weighted average occupancy came in at 91.3% and 89.8%, respectively.
Our lease percentage increased 30 basis points this quarter driven by new and expansion leasing activity at Terminus and 3350 Peachtree in Buckhead and at Domain Point in Austin.
Conversely, weighted average occupancy declined 120 basis points with the impact of the previously disclosed move out of Anthem at 3350 Peachtree in Buckhead.
As for general leasing activity this quarter, our team and portfolio produced fantastic results.
We executed 43 leases totaling 597,000 square feet in the quarter, and new and expansion leases were accounted for 84% of total activity.
Net effective rents were $24.06 this quarter, an improvement over the second quarter and $0.24 higher than our reported net effective rents for the full year of 2019.
The rent growth was outstanding this quarter as well with second-generation net rents increasing 23.1% on a cash basis.
Similar to this time last quarter, we are still seeing encouraging activity in our leasing pipeline, both for our existing portfolio and new development.
Tour volume in our portfolio was on a clear upswing in the second quarter, and it has held at a consistent level since then.
We are also optimistic about our Sun Belt markets' continued recovery as compared to the U.S. economy in the aggregate.
According to the Urban Land Institute, every market lost jobs during the pandemic, but the recovery has been much quicker in Sun Belt markets.
ULI projects that by the end of the year, those markets will collectively regain nearly all of their lost jobs in comparison to the greater United States, which is expected to still be down almost 2%.
Now I'll speak to some specifics about current conditions and activity in our markets.
I'll begin with Atlanta.
According to JLL, Atlanta saw positive net absorption this past quarter for the first time since the pandemic began at 756,000 square feet.
This is an encouraging milestone.
In our nearly eight million square foot Atlanta portfolio, we signed an impressive 299,000 square feet of leases in the third quarter.
That includes the previously disclosed 123,000 square foot lease with Visa at 1200 Peachtree in Midtown, serving as Visa's new Atlanta office hub.
We also have a final LOI in hand with another potential customer at that property for 31,000 square feet.
We view this activity at 1200 Peachtree as a strong validation of a truly irreplaceable location and quality of the to-be-repositioned assets.
Another example of demand for high-quality and well-amenitized properties is our redeveloped Buckhead Plaza project, producing 121,000 square feet of leasing activity year-to-date at record rental rates.
Our overall Buckhead portfolio also produced great activity this quarter, accounting for 43% of our Atlanta leasing activity.
This includes 29,000 and 50,000 square feet of new and expansion leasing at 3350 Peachtree and Terminus, respectively.
At one of our newest Atlanta assets located in Alpharetta, 10,000 Avalon, we signed a 51,000 square foot new lease after quarter end with [Indecipherable], a newly public financial technology company, taking the building to 99% leased.
In Austin, population growth continued to be strong as ever this quarter.
Further, CoStar showed a 496,000 square foot decline this quarter and Class A total sublease space available for lease.
The unemployment rate in Austin this quarter was at its lowest since March of 2020 with average asking rents and the market climbing.
Our Austin portfolio is currently 95% leased, with our 1.9 million foot -- square-foot operating portfolio and the core of the domain at 100% leased.
With regard to leasing activity in Austin, we signed 236,000 square feet of leases in the quarter, including a 73,000 square foot new lease with a growing technology company at Colorado Tower, which will entirely backfill the expiration of Atlassian at the end of January 2022.
In Charlotte, our now 1.4 million square-foot uptown and South end operating portfolio is well-ositioned at a solid 96.1% leased with very little existing space available.
Like in Austin, CoStar showed that Charlotte had a meaningful 139,000 square foot decline this quarter and Class A total sublease space available for lease.
According to JLL, third quarter activity was robust in Tampa, where we recently acquired Heights Union in the downtown submarket.
According to CBRE's 2021 Tech Talent report, Tampa ranks tenth among the 50 largest tech talent markets with its millennial population increasing by 14.5% since 2014.
While average direct asking rents are down 2.5% year-over-year overall, many Class A buildings in the Westshore submarket, where the bulk of our portfolio is located, have increased asking rates to at or above pre-pandemic levels.
We signed 41,000 square feet of leases in Tampa this past quarter.
The Greater Phoenix area is one of the few places in the country that now has more jobs than before the pandemic, recovering 102.6% of jobs since April of 2020.
When comparing year-to-date data versus 2019, Phoenix is also the second fastest growing metro in the country behind Austin, according to the Greater Phoenix Chambers annual economic outlook.
While our completed activity in Phoenix was light this quarter, the recovery is reflected in our pipeline as we are currently in lease negotiations for 95,000 square feet of new and extension leases at our $100 million new development.
They continue to produce great results and deliver excellent customer service.
I am grateful for all that you do.
I'll begin my remarks by providing a brief overview of our quarterly financial results, including some detail on our same-property performance, our development pipeline and our transaction activity followed by a quick discussion of our leverage position, before closing my remarks with updated information on our outlook for the balance of 2021.
As you can tell from Colin's remarks, we've been extremely busy.
However, we don't want all that positive transaction activity to take attention away from our very solid operating performance during the quarter.
Leasing velocity in particular, was outstanding, while second-generation cash leasing spreads were up the most since the fourth quarter of 2015.
Over the past two quarters, we've signed almost 1.1 million square feet of leases with almost 2/3 of that total representing new leases.
The ability to attract so many new customers to our properties is a powerful indication of our Class A Sun Belt strategy.
However, it's a big decision for a company to open a new office, especially if they're coming from out of market.
It's not easy from space planning to construction management, to the endless logistical details surrounding moving existing employees, hiring new employees and establishing a new address, it all takes a lot of time, which means the typical period between lease signing and revenue recognition is extended compared to a simple renewal.
A significant portion of the new leases we have signed over the last six months do not begin revenue recognition until late 2022 or early 2023.
Attracting new customers, the Sun Belt is our competitive advantage.
It often just takes time for this to turn into revenue.
Turning back to the third quarter results.
Our same-property performance continued to generate a significant and constructive change in trend.
NOI on a cash basis increased a very healthy 3.6% over the last year and excluding the single large move-out that Richard talked about, Athem's departure from our 3350 Peachtree property in Buckhead to a new consolidated campus in Midtown Atlanta, NOI on a cash basis would have increased 5.3%.
The largest variable in our same-property performance remains parking revenues.
After bottoming during the fourth quarter of 2020, same-property parking revenues are up over 20% in the last three quarters, but still remain 20% below pre-COVID levels.
Focusing on our development efforts, one asset, Domain 10 an office property primarily leased to Amazon in the Domain submarket of Austin was moved off our development pipeline schedule and into our portfolio statistics, while another asset, Neuhoff, a mixed-use property in the Germantown submarket of Nashville was added to our schedule.
Total development costs for Neuhoff are estimated to be $563 million with our joint venture interest representing 50% of that amount.
The current development pipeline represents a total Cousins' investment of $663 million across 1.9 million square feet in four assets.
On the transaction front, as Colin laid out at the top of the call, we've been very active.
As this series of transactions has unfolded, we've maintained our net debt-to-EBITDA around 4.5 times, as we've done with very few exceptions since 2014.
We believe this leverage profile provides both defensive support during challenging times as well as offensive firepower to execute compelling transactions when the opportunity presents itself.
If and when we commence additional developments and/or acquire additional properties, you should expect us to continue to fund these investments on a leverage-neutral basis over time.
On the Capital Markets front, we closed a $312 million construction loan for our new house development joint venture during the third quarter.
This new loan matures in September 2025 and includes a potential one year extension option.
I'll close by updating our 2021 earnings guidance.
We currently anticipate a full year 2021 FFO between $2.73 and $2.77 per share.
This is up $0.01 at the midpoint from our previous guidance.
There are no other dispositions, acquisitions or development starts included in our guidance.
The most significant variable behind our guidance remains parking revenue.
Our customers continue returning to the office during the third quarter, and we anticipate maintaining this trend into the year-end.
Our current parking revenue assumptions reflect this outlook.
","Cousins Properties delivered strong financial results for Q3, including FFO of $0.69 per share. Same-property NOI rose 3.6% on a cash basis, and leasing activity was robust with over 597,000 square feet leased, 84% of which were new or expansion leases. Net effective rents reached $24.06 per square foot, higher than the 2019 average. Second-generation cash rents increased 23.1%, the strongest growth since 2015. The company's Sun Belt strategy continues to prove advantageous, with innovative companies recognizing the importance of in-person work and opting for quality office spaces in growing cities like Austin and Atlanta. The flight to quality is intensifying, with customers valuing amenity-rich environments for talent retention and culture-building. Cousins has assembled a trophy portfolio in fast-growing Sun Belt markets and has invested $1.1 billion in new acquisitions and development since the pandemic's onset, including Heights Union in Tampa. The company's solid balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.54 times provides financial flexibility for future growth. Despite the ongoing pandemic and the Delta variant's impact on office utilization, the company remains optimistic about the future, relying on strong leasing activity and the expected recovery of its Sun Belt markets. The updated 2021 FFO guidance ranges from $2.73 to $2.77 per share, reflecting the continued return of customers to the office and the company's positive outlook."
CF_q4_2020.txt,"I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.
More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.
Before I jump into our financial results, I want to highlight the entire CF team for amazing execution across all areas of our business.
We set all-time company best records for safety, ammonia production and sales volumes, despite the challenges that 2020 hurled at us.
There was no playbook for how to manage through a global pandemic, yet this team developed and implemented plans to keep our people safe along with everyone who came on to our sites.
To date, we have no known transmissions of COVID-19 within any of our facilities.
On the safety front, we ended the year with only four recordable injuries and zero lost time injuries across the entire network for the whole year.
As is typically the case, safe operations are also more productive.
And we proved that again with an all-time ammonia production record of 10.4 million tons.
Our sales and logistics team rose to the challenge and set all-time sales and shipping records of over 20 million product tons.
Truly a remarkable performance by all.
Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about 2021.
As Bert will describe in a moment, the global nitrogen pricing outlook is much more positive than a year ago.
With strong commodity crop prices and significantly higher energy prices in Asia and Europe, we are seeing a robust demand environment, coupled with a steeper global cost curve.
The current conditions in the Southern Plains in Midwest have thrown another crisis at us, but as usual, the team has done a fantastic job responding to and navigating through these new challenges.
We have been able to quickly adjust our plant operations based on close communications with our gas suppliers.
Disruptions have been widespread across the US nitrogen industry and this should result in further tightening of nitrogen supply for the spring planting season in North America, additional support for an already strong 2021.
Longer term, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our commitment to the clean energy economy.
We continue to advance discussions with technology providers and partners, and we have seen new opportunities develop since our announcement.
These underscore how broad the demand for green and low carbon ammonia will be, and also the value of our unique capabilities.
Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook before I return for some closing comments.
Global nitrogen dynamics today with low-cost producers like CF are the most positive they have been since 2014.
Strong demand driven by high commodity crop prices and a steeper global cost curve are creating a tighter nitrogen supply and demand balance.
As a result, prices have risen significantly in recent months and are well above 2020 values.
Global demand is robust and broad-based.
Farmers in North America has seen nitrogen consuming coarse grains reach multi-year highs for both near term and futures contracts.
For corn, we have seen lower-than-expected supply and high global demand led by China.
As a result, the USDA is projecting that the corn stocks-to-use ratio for the marketing year-over-year will be at its lowest level since 2013.
This supports our projection of 90 million to 92 million planted corn acres in the US this year with upside potential.
Through the balance of the year, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil.
We expect the urea tender volumes in India this year will be well above the five year average and close to the 10 million metric tons of last year.
For Brazil, we project 2021 imports of urea to be approximately 6.57 million metric tons, similar to last year.
As demand was increasing, the cost curve steepened significantly.
From July 2020 to July -- to December 2020, the Dutch TTF natural gas price and the Asian JKM LNG price both increased about five times greater than the US Henry Hub natural gas price.
This had a number of impacts.
First, margin opportunities increased for low cost producers.
Second, the significant increase in energy prices for producers in Europe and Asia pressured their margins, not only leading to lower operating rates but creating demand for import ammonia into those regions.
This contributed to even tighter global market.
Over time, we expect the global nitrogen market to tighten further and faster driven by several factors.
In the near term, the need to rebuild the stock of commodity crops will underpin demand growth.
Longer term, a key driver will be emerging demand for ammonia for clean energy applications.
We believe this level of global demand will require more production from the highest cost plants until prices rise enough to incent greenfield construction in other parts of the world.
We are well positioned as we approach the spring application season and have the flexibility necessary to address any challenges that arise.
We believe that the recent weather conditions in the US, or [Phonetic] disruption that we've built our system to overcome.
We are looking forward to working with our customers and leveraging our optionality to ensure that these requirements are met as they make -- as our customers make their final preparations for spring.
For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share.
EBITDA was $1.32 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was approximately $750 million.
These results reflect year over year, global nitrogen -- lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower natural gas and SG&A costs compared to the year before.
The results also demonstrate our continued efficient conversion of EBITDA into free cash.
As you can see on slide 9, we converted more than 55% of our adjusted EBITDA into free cash in 2020, which is the highest rate among our peers.
Our free cash conversion continues to support our capital structure and allocation priorities.
This will lower our gross debt to $3.75 billion.
As we remain focused on investment grade and positioning the company to execute our clean energy growth strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce gross debt over time.
We remain excited to invest in the clean energy growth opportunity given the expected return profile.
We will also continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic repurchases at attractive levels.
As we look ahead to 2021, I want to share some of our expectations for the year ahead.
We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2021 will be in the range of $450 million.
This reflects a return to a normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities in the year ahead, and the first expenses associated with the Green ammonia project at Donaldsonville.
We also expect SG&A levels to return to a level closer to 2019 than 2020.
Our annual cash interest expense will fall to $175 million with the repayment of the 2021 notes.
With our planned maintenance schedule and recent gas driven curtailments, we expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million to 10 million tons.
This, along with lower inventories to the start of the year will likely result in lower product tons sold than in 2020.
Additionally, based on forward curves, we project our natural gas costs will be somewhat higher in 2021 than in 2020.
However, we expect margins to improve this year given the positive nitrogen pricing outlook that Bert described.
As you can see on slide 12, increases in our realized urea price have a much greater impact on EBITDA than higher realized natural gas costs.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call for Q&A.
Their commitment to our values and unwavering focus on safety and execution are truly the foundation of our success.
We feel very positive about the year ahead.
As Bert described, nitrogen industry dynamics for producers in North America are the most favorable we have seen in nearly a decade.
And longer term, the developing demand for ammonia in clean energy applications provides exciting growth prospects for us, where we are uniquely positioned to be a global leader providing clean energy for a better world.
Economies will continue to focus on decarbonization, and hydrogen will be a key solution, with ammonia a critical enabler of hydrogen as a clean fuel.
We have seen tremendous interest in our strategic direction since our announcement last fall, and see substantial opportunities ahead for clean and low carbon ammonia.
This will provide a growth platform for longer-term shareholder value.
","CF Industries reported a strong 2020 with net earnings of $317 million, despite challenges posed by the pandemic. The company set all-time records for safety, ammonia production, and sales volumes. Looking ahead, CF is optimistic about 2021 due to a robust global nitrogen pricing outlook driven by strong commodity crop prices and higher energy prices. The disruptions caused by weather conditions in the Southern Plains and Midwest are expected to further tighten nitrogen supply for the spring planting season, supporting the positive demand environment. Longer term, CF is excited about its commitment to the clean energy economy and the potential for green and low-carbon ammonia. The company plans to invest in its Green ammonia project at Donaldsonville and evaluate opportunities to reduce gross debt over time. CF anticipates capital expenditures of $450 million in 2021 and expects gross ammonia production of 9.5-10 million tons. Margins are expected to improve this year due to positive nitrogen pricing."
CL_q2_2021.txt,"This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.
Actual results could differ materially from these statements.
I will provide commentary on our Q2 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on the current operating environment and how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory.
We will then open it up for Q&A.
As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.
As we report results at the halfway point of 2021, we remain pleased, but not satisfied with our performance so far as we navigate through what can charitably be described as a complicated year.
For both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we delivered growth in organic sales, net sales, operating profit and net income.
This is despite difficult comparisons as we lapped last years strength in categories like liquid hand soap and dish soap.
We are also dealing with the impact of COVID restrictions in several markets, economic and political uncertainty, strong competitive activity, and of course, significantly heightened raw material and logistics headwinds.
We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our business through the second half of this year.
Because of that, we remain focused on delivering impactful innovation, leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to deliver on pricing and driving productivity up and down the income statement.
All of these are crucial to deliver long-term sustainable growth that will help us as we look to deliver TSR at the high end of our peer group.
We delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter, which marked our 10th consecutive quarter, delivering organic sales growth either in or above our targeted range of 3% to 5%.
As we have discussed before, the key to delivering against our long-term targets is delivering balanced growth, which we did once again in the quarter by delivering both volume and pricing growth.
We delivered growth in both developed markets with 3% organic sales growth and emerging markets, which delivered 7% organic sales growth.
We delivered organic sales growth in every division in North America.
Our largest category, Oral Care, delivered organic sales growth of nearly 10%, with organic sales growth across toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes, and organic sales growth in every division.
Innovation continues to be a vital contributor to our Oral Care business, as we benefit from new products across all of our divisions.
Products like Co by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste are all delivering consumer desired benefits and premiumizing our portfolio.
Pet Nutrition delivered organic sales growth of 15%.
Personal Care and Home Care declined on an organic sales basis year-over-year in the quarter as expected, but net sales remain above 2019 levels.
Net sales increased 9.5% in the quarter, which was our highest net sales increased in almost 10 years.
Foreign exchange was a 4.5% benefit to net sales as we lap the peak of last year's COVID-driven strength in the dollar.
After a strong gross margin performance in 2020 and in Q1, our gross margin declined in the second quarter due to the rapid acceleration of raw material costs across our business and the lapping of lower promotional levels in Q2 2020.
We took additional pricing in the second quarter, which will help offset raw material costs in the second half of the year and we will continue to layer in additional pricing where possible.
We expect raw material costs to remain elevated throughout 2021, but we do expect some sequential lessening of inflation as we get into the fourth quarter.
Our efforts on premiumization and pricing, along with our focus on productivity, like our funding the growth initiatives, will also help us as we look to improve our gross margin performance.
In the second quarter, our gross profit margin was 60%, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year on both a GAAP basis and a base business basis.
Year-to-date, our gross margin of 60.4%, down 10 basis points.
Again, that is on a GAAP and base business basis.
For the second quarter, pricing was 90 basis points favorable to gross margin, less than in the first quarter as we lapped lower promotional spending in the year-ago period when many of our markets reacted to COVID restrictions by pulling back on promotional activity.
Raw materials were at 370 basis point headwind as we continue to see significant pressure from resins, fats and oils and agriculture-related costs, and many other materials.
This includes a slightly favorable transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 200 basis point benefit.
Our SG&A was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales for the second quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis.
This was primarily driven by an increase in logistics costs and also by a 30 basis point increase in advertising to sales.
Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year as our net sales growth and savings programs drove leverage on our overheads.
For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 2.5% on a base business basis.
Our earnings per share was up 12% on a GAAP basis and up 8% on a base business basis.
Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to lap very strong working capital performance in the year-ago period.
As we discussed previously, our capital expenditures are also up year-over-year as we invest behind growth, productivity and our sustainability strategy.
A few comments on divisional performance.
North American net sales declined 4% in the second quarter with organic sales down 4.5% and a modest benefit from foreign exchange.
Volumes were down 8.
5% in the quarter, driven by Home Care and Personal Care, which saw strong growth in the year ago period, driven by COVID-related demand.
Pricing across Home Care and Personal Care was positive as we worked to offset higher raw material costs.
Oral Care organic sales grew mid-single digits, driven by innovation and pricing.
I mentioned Co by Colgate before, which is helping us further expand into the beauty and direct-to-consumer channels.
We are pleased with the initial performance of the Colgate Keep manual toothbrush.
It comes with an aluminum handle and by using our replaceable heads, consumers can use 80% less plastic compared to similarly sized Colgate toothbrushes.
We're also excited about our Tom's of Maine relaunch, which is bringing new graphics and advertising to a historic natural segment brand.
Our logistics issues that we discussed on the first quarter call continue to negatively impact our promotional timing, but service levels have improved and we expect our promotional cadence will normalize as we go through the third quarter.
Latin America net sales were up 12.5% with 8.5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point benefit from foreign exchange.
All three categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high teens.
Brazil and Mexico both grew organic and net sales double digits in the quarter.
Our strong innovation performance was led by core innovation behind Colgate Total Reinforced Gums in Mexico, which apparently sounds much better in Spanish and Portuguese than English and several Charcoal variance in Brazil.
Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter despite a sizable negative impact due to political unrest in Colombia, our third largest market in Latin America.
We believe this disruption, which negatively impacted our distribution network for some time is largely behind us, but political disruption will remain a risk, not just in Columbia, but in several markets.
Pricing was up 6% despite lapping lower promotional spending in Q2 2020 as well as some incremental pricing in the year-ago period as we look to offset foreign exchange.
Europe net sales grew 15% in the quarter.
Organic sales grew 5% driven by mid-teens growth in Oral Care, offset by declines in personal and home care as we lap COVID-related demand in the year-ago period.
Volume grew 7% in the quarter, offset by a 2% decline in pricing as we lap lower promotions in the year-ago period as store traffic declined in Q2 2020 due to COVID restrictions.
I mentioned Colgate Elixir toothpaste before and we're very excited about this truly differentiated product.
We designed it with more of a beauty esthetic, including skincare inspired ingredients, a unique clear recyclable bottle and liquid glide technology that allows the pace to leave the bottle leaving no messy tube or cap.
This product began rolling out across the division in Q2 with further launches this quarter.
We delivered 7.5% net sales and 1% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific this quarter, with organic growth in oral care partially offset by a decline in home care.
Volume growth of 3.5% was partially offset by negative pricing as we cycled lower promotional levels in the year-ago period given COVID-related lockdowns across the region, with the biggest impact coming on our South Pacific business.
We have additional pricing planned in the second half across the division to offset raw material cost inflation.
Volume growth was led by India, despite the impact of COVID related disruption in May.
And Thailand, driven by naturals innovation in the Colgate Vedshakti and Colgate Panjaved line as we lapped COVID-related disruptions in the year-ago period.
Our volume in China declined on growth on the Colgate business, which was more than offset by weakness in sales for our Hawley & Hazel joint venture, which is primarily related to inventory reductions in our distributor network.
After Eurasia continued its strong performance trend in the third quarter with net sales growth of 15.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division once again.
Volume grew 9.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 3.5%.
Foreign exchange was a 2.5% benefit in the quarter.
Oral Care delivered high teens organic sales growth and we are relaunching several of our naturals businesses with new packaging and flavors.
Hill's strong growth continued in the second quarter with 18% net sales growth and 15% organic sales growth.
Both developed and emerging markets delivered 10% volume growth as our increased investment around the globe is driving this highly differentiated brands.
In particular, we are seeing good results from our Hill's master brand campaign to end Pet obesity as well as our new campaign for Hill's Pet Essentials, our vet-distributed wellness product in Europe.
And now for guidance.
We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range.
There is no meaningful change in our category expectations at this point.
The categories that benefited from COVID-related demand are behaving in line with our expectations with sales below 2020 levels, but ahead of 2019 levels.
Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in many of our markets, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID and other disruptions related to COVID, and this is not in our guidance.
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low-single digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in April.
All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%.
We have reduced our gross margin guidance for the year and we now expect gross margin to be down year-over-year for the full year on both the GAAP and base business basis given the additional cost inflation we have seen.
We expect the gross margin percentage to improve sequentially in the second half, which would leave us down modestly for the year.
As I mentioned above, we are taking many steps to mitigate the impact of these costs, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG where available and many others.
Advertising is still expected to be up on both a dollar and a percent of sales basis.
Logistics will continue to be a headwind as costs also have risen faster than anticipated, particularly in the U.S.
We still expect these costs to moderate somewhat as we go through the balance of the year.
Our tax rate is now expected to be between 23% and 24% for the year on both a GAAP and base business basis.
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings-per-share growth in the low-to-mid single digits, but most likely toward the lower end of that range.
On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits.
Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range.
So the overriding message I want to lead with you today is that our strategy to reaccelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core adjacencies all over the world, new channels and markets is really working, as we like to say nothing moves in a straight line, but we now have 10 straight quarters of organic sales growth at or above our long-term target range.
Year-to-date, we at the high end of the range despite difficult comparisons and continued volatility in the business.
We're making good progress on our journey, but we still have more work to do.
And as I look back at my comments to you over the past 18 months that we've been dealing with the implications of COVID, there's one consistent theme that we keep coming back, managing through this crisis with an eye on the future.
This is still very appropriate theme, although obviously some of the elements have changed.
The prevalence of the vaccine in many developed markets gives us a sense of guarded optimism, but we've highlighted that many emerging markets which represent almost half of our revenues, the availability of the vaccine remains very low, case rates are high, and governments continue to put in restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus.
We remain hopeful that we will get to a post-COVID sooner rather than later, but we're not there yet.
We will continue to manage to the retail and supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, all while doing our best to protect the health and safety of our employees, which remains our number one priority.
But there are changing headwinds as well.
Last year, we were faced with adverse foreign exchange movements, heightened consumer and customer demand, supply chain volatility and uncertainty for our customers about changing business models and retail environments.
This year, we're faced with unprecedented cost increases for raw materials like resin, fats and oils and many others.
Logistic networks are taxed, whether it's the trucking and warehousing here in the U.S., or ocean freight coming from Asia to the rest of the world, and we're seeing some political disruption in markets like Colombia and Myanmar.
So 18 months into the COVID, many of the challenges are the same, some have changed, but our approach remains we will manage through the crisis with an eye on the future, and so far we feel we've done a pretty good job.
But we know the markets look forward at our potential, not backwards at our achievements.
We know that to deliver top-tier TSR, we need to balance organic sales growth both volume and pricing, all four of our categories and across all of our divisions.
We've talked to you a lot about our changes in strategy that will enable us to continue delivering this balanced growth.
First is our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation.
Our emphasis is on faster growing channels and markets continues to pay off to growth in e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, discounters, club stores and pharmacies.
We're supporting these products with increased focus on our digital media and emerging data analytical capabilities.
But we have to deliver gross margin expansion to fund our brand investment, while we know -- while we now expect gross margin to be down modestly for 2021, it comes on the heels of strong gross margin expansion in 2020 and in the face of unprecedented increases in raw material prices.
We will continue to leverage our robust revenue growth management program and drive productivity so we can return to gross margin expansion.
We have made progress in our journey to improve our mix, but we have further upside potential on this given the benefits we provide to consumers and the fact that our brands under indexing pricing relative to the category across many geographies.
We're working to accelerate our productivity programs like funding the growth wherever possible to try and create additional offsets.
All this should help us in our drive to return to gross margin expansion.
And while the raw material inflation is obviously negatively impacting our gross margin performance this year, we're optimistic that this raw material inflation could drive an improvement in emerging market fundamentals.
Again, we need to first get through the difficulty surrounding COVID, but on the back of our continued rebound in emerging market organic sales growth, particularly in Latin America, we have some optimism that we could see some additional GDP growth and therefore higher category growth on the back end of this movement in commodities.
We have seen some of the emerging market currency stabilize for the first time and what seems like several years, and are optimistic this may be a first step.
And since our last call, we have released our 2025 sustainability strategy.
This comprehensive plan highlights the actions we're taking around climate, plastics, sourcing, diversity equity and inclusion, and all the other areas that are vital to the future, not only of our Company, but our communities and our planet.
","Colgate-Palmolive delivered a strong Q2 with net sales increasing 9.5% and organic sales growing 5.0% despite ongoing challenges. Key growth drivers included Oral Care (+9.8% organic sales) and Pet Nutrition (+15% organic sales). The company expects a continued difficult cost environment in the back half of the year but remains committed to managing through the crisis with an eye on the future. Despite significant raw material and logistics cost headwinds, Colgate-Palmolive delivered increased operating profit. While gross margin declined due to inflationary pressures, the company anticipates sequential improvement in the second half. Colgate-Palmolive maintained its 2021 net sales guidance range of 4% to 7%, including a low-single-digit benefit from foreign exchange. On a GAAP basis, advertising investment is expected to increase, and earnings per share growth is projected to be at the lower end of the low-to-mid single-digit range. On a non-GAAP basis, advertising investment is expected to increase, and earnings per share growth is projected to be at the lower end of the mid-to-high single-digit range."
FMC_q1_2021.txt,"Mark will review our first quarter results and provide our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter.
Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items.
Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding.
Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.
Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA.
A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as any other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.
Our first quarter results were in line with our guidance and expectations.
Revenue and earnings were down as forecasted, though earnings were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance.
We continue to expect a good second quarter and a strong full year.
We had two important product launches in the quarter, Overwatch Herbicide based on our Isoflex active in Australia and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. Isoflex is one of 11 new active ingredients we plan to launch this decade.
Both launches have exceeded our expectations and have delivered approximately $50 million of Q1 sales.
In March, we announced an important agreement with UPL to toll manufacture Rynaxypyr insect control in India and to distribute products based on the active ingredient in selected markets.
In the future, FMC will supply Rynaxypyr active to UPL for use in product formulations developed and marketed by UPL around the world.
This agreement is the next step in growing our important diamide franchise and accelerating FMC's long-term plans to expand the franchise in diverse geographies and crops with differentiated formulations.
It also reaffirms the strength of our patent portfolio that protects our diamide franchise, far beyond just the composition of matter patents.
We returned over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through our recently increased dividend and share repurchases.
Our guidance for Q2 indicates an expected return to mid-single-digit growth on the top line, with slightly lower earnings growth because of higher costs compared to Q2 2020.
These higher costs are principally related to increasing raw materials and logistics.
Additionally, we will be spending more on SG&A and R&D compared to the abnormally low spend in Q2 2020.
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business.
All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed.
Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic.
While many of FMC's other employees continue to work from home, plans are in place to resume in-office operations where permitted by local authorities.
Finally, we are all aware of the challenges India is facing with significant increases of COVID cases across that country.
Last week, FMC announced it will donate seven pressure swing absorption oxygen plants to hospitals across five states in India to help address the rapidly increasing demand for medical oxygen.
This program focuses on rural areas where we are providing further community support.
Turning to our Q1 results on Slide three.
We reported $1.2 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and a 5% decrease organically.
As planned, we saw slower sales in Brazil as we drew down channel inventories in that country as well as the shortfall in EMEA due to Brexit-related sales that occurred in Q4 2020.
In North America, we saw very good demand based on strong fundamentals in row crops and commodity prices, offset by a shift of diamide third-party sales to Latin America.
In Asia, double-digit sales growth in Australia, Japan and our Asian subregion drove revenue performance in that region.
Adjusted EBITDA was $307 million, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
EBITDA margins were 25.7%, a decrease of 290 basis points compared to the prior year.
Adjusted earnings were $1.53 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 17% versus Q1 2020, but also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense.
Moving now to Slide four.
Q1 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year, driven by a 4% volume decrease and a 1% price decline.
Foreign currencies were a modest tailwind in the quarter on the top line.
Sales in Asia increased 18% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
We had strong Overwatch Herbicide sales for cereals, and sales of our diamides were robust for fruit and vegetable and rice applications.
Insecticides also performed well in Indonesia, helped by our recent expanded market access in that country, and improved weather helped sales across the ASEAN subregion.
EMEA sales were down 4% year-over-year and 8% organically.
We had strong sales of diamides and other insecticides as well as fungicides, but these were more than offset by headwinds from the Brexit-related U.K. sales in Q4 that we described a quarter ago as well as discontinued registrations.
In North America, sales decreased 8% year-over-year.
Our herbicide business grew double digits, partially due to the timing of some sales that shifted from Q4 to Q1 as well as the continued strength of Authority Edge and Authority Supreme herbicides.
We also had a strong launch in the U.S. of Xyway fungicide for corn and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops.
These were offset primarily by a shift of diamide third-party partner sales from North America to Latin America, as one of our key partners adjusted the way it purchases from FMC globally.
This was simply a move of purchasing location and not a change in demand.
Excluding this shift, our North America sales were up low double digits.
Moving now to Latin America.
Sales decreased 22% year-over-year and 13% organically.
As a reminder, we were facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America, where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020.
Brazil's cotton business was very strong for us a year ago, which did not repeat this season as cotton hectares were down 15%.
We also proactively reduced channel inventory of FMC products as planned in Q1, improving our inventory situation in Brazil.
And our Andean Zone subregion continued the momentum from 2020 with double-digit sales growth.
Turning now to the first quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide five.
EBITDA in the quarter was down $50 million year-over-year due to a very strong Q1 2020 comparison.
Volume headwinds in Latin America and EMEA were partially offset by new product launches in Asia and North America.
In Latin America, we focused on reducing channel inventory to set ourselves up for a much stronger pricing environment in the second half of 2021.
Cost headwinds were slightly higher than expected, while FX headwinds were far lower than in the prior four quarters.
Turning now to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021.
We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up low single digits on a U.S. dollar basis.
Relative to this time last year, commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher, and stock to use ratios are much improved.
All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the negative impact from COVID on crop demand appeared to be modest.
The only change to our regional forecast is that we now forecast mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market versus low single-digit growth before.
This improved view is due to the strengthening of currencies in that region relative to the U.S. dollar.
Market growth in Asia is still expected to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by India, Australia and ASEAN countries, while growth in the North American and Latin American markets is still projected to be in the low single digits.
Basic crop fundamentals remain strong.
However, our overall forecast for the total crop protection market remains low single-digit growth due to signs of supply chain constraints in the industry as well as modest channel inventory overhang in certain countries.
Although Brazil and India are facing significant increases of COVID cases, we are not seeing signs that this is impacting their respective agricultural markets at this time.
This is, however, something we are continuing to watch closely.
Turning to Slide six and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q2 earnings outlook.
FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 and to $7.40 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 14% at the midpoint.
This is up slightly versus our prior forecast, reflecting the share count reduction from our Q1 share repurchases.
Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance.
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020 and 8% organic growth.
We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above-market performance.
EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Guidance for Q implies a year-over-year sales growth of 6% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 1% at the midpoint versus Q2 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 3% year-over-year.
Turning to Slide seven and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers.
Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, with the largest growth in Asia and a 2% contribution from higher prices.
FX is now forecasted to have no impact on the top line.
We continue to expect broad growth across all regions and a very strong second half of 2021.
New products like Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control, are already making meaningful contributions.
We are also planning to launch Fluindapyr fungicide in the U.S. for non-crop applications later this year.
We expect new products to contribute $400 million in revenue this year.
This includes all products launched since 2018.
We are forecasting strong growth in each of our product categories in the year.
In addition to the continued growth of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls, we expect growth from other key insecticide brands in our portfolio, including Avatar, Hero and Talisman.
Our herbicide portfolio is also expected to grow led by brands, including Authority, Gamit, Spotlight Plus and Overwatch.
Xyway is expected to lead growth of our fungicide portfolio, building on the successful launch of Lucento fungicide a couple of years ago.
Our EBITDA guidance reflects significant volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending, the reversal of some temporary cost savings from 2020 as well as increase in raw material and logistics costs.
As we've stated in February, we are forecasting an increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization.
We are taking cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind to an incremental $10 million versus what we showed in February.
We also intend to offset the higher raw material costs with an additional $10 million in price increases, which will come primarily in the second half of the year.
Moving to Slide eight, where you can see the Q2 drivers.
On the revenue line, we are expecting positive contributions from all categories: volume 4%, pricing 1% and FX 1%.
We're expecting solid sales growth in Asia, EMEA and Latin America.
Asia growth is expected to be broad based across the region, with particular strength in India, Australia and China.
Growth in EMEA will be driven by improved crop conditions for cereals and sugar beets.
Latin America, growth should be supported by improved conditions in both Brazil and Mexico and the continuation of strong growth in the Andean Zone.
We see good conditions in North America for row crops and a positive outlook for our new products.
Regarding EBITDA drivers, positive contributions from volume, price and FX more than offset the increased costs, which we previously discussed.
Turning now to Slide nine.
With the guidance for Q2 and the full year on record, we would like to also show the implied forecast for the second half.
We have a very strong outlook for H2, and let me outline the drivers for that growth.
We forecast year-over-year revenue growth of 15% in the second half driven by five main elements.
First, our expectations are strong for the U.S. and Brazil, following our weak Q4 2020 performance in those countries.
Second, price increases, primarily in Brazil, with contributions from numerous other countries will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year.
Thirdly, new products will continue to be a major factor, Overwatch in Australia, Xyway and diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor and Fluindapyr for non-crop applications in the U.S. and Authority NXT herbicide in India.
Fourth, improved crop fundamentals.
Cotton in Brazil is the most obvious to us, as growers have indicated, a 15% increase in hectares for next season.
And we also expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for soybeans and corn.
And finally, fifth, improved market access and expansions into new geographies and crops.
This is having a significant impact in Asia with recent initiatives in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam all forecast to drive high-growth rates.
Our guidance also implies a 30% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half of the year.
Much of that will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described, but we also expect to limit the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds with sustained cost discipline in other areas.
FX was a modest tailwind for revenue growth in Q1 at 1% versus our expectations of a 2% headwind, as the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies with the notable exception of the Brazilian reais.
Interest expense for the first quarter was $32.4 million, down $8.4 million from the prior year period, with the benefit of lower LIBOR rates as well as lower foreign debt and lower term loan balances, partially offset by higher average commercial paper balances.
We continue to anticipate interest expense between $130 million and $140 million for the full year.
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 13.1% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate between 12.5% and 14.5%.
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity.
Gross debt at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, up over $300 million from the prior quarter, with the expected seasonal build of working capital.
Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.0 times at the end of the first quarter, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.7 times.
Both metrics were above our targeted full year average levels due to the seasonality of working capital.
We expect that this will improve throughout the year, and we will return to target levels by year-end.
Moving on to Slide 10 and cash flow and cash deployment.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was negative $354 million.
Adjusted cash from operations was similar to the prior year period, with improved working capital offset by changes in nonworking capital items and lower EBITDA.
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we ramped up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID.
Legacy and transformation spending was substantially lower with the completion of our SAP program.
We continue to expect to generate full year free cash flow within a range of $530 million to $620 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the second half of the year.
We returned $137 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $75 million of share repurchases, buying back 696,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $107.73 per share.
We continue to anticipate paying dividends approaching $250 million and repurchasing $400 million to $500 million of FMC shares this year.
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark.
Our Q1 financial performance was in line with our expectations.
We are now focused on delivering against our full year forecast.
COVID-19 continues to be a factor to watch, and we're closely monitoring raw material and supply chain costs.
We remain confident in our full year forecast that builds upon the new technologies and improved market access that are driving our growth.
The market demand for our most recent product launches is important as it confirms the strength and value that our innovative R&D pipeline delivers to growers.
We expect this momentum to continue to accelerate over the coming years, with launches of new active ingredients and products as well as outcomes from technology partnerships we've established in the past year.
Finally, we remain committed to our cash deployment plan.
We are on track to deliver more than $700 million to shareholders this year, building on a trend since 2018 of improving cash generation and returning excess cash to shareholders.
","FMC's Q1 results were in line with expectations, with revenue of $1.2 billion, or 5% organic growth, and adjusted EPS of $1.53. The company saw double-digit sales growth in Asia, led by Australia and Japan. Two important product launches, Overwatch Herbicide and Xyway fungicide, exceeded expectations and contributed approximately $50 million in Q1 sales. FMC also announced an agreement with UPL to manufacture and distribute Rynaxypyr insect control. For the full year, FMC has increased its EPS forecast to $6.70 to $7.40, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth and an 8% increase in revenue, aided by organic growth and new products. The company projects strong growth in the second half, driven by favorable crop fundamentals, price increases, new products, and improved market access. Despite higher costs and supply chain constraints, FMC is confident in its growth trajectory and cash deployment plan, with plans to return over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases and expects to return over $700 million in cash to shareholders this year."
NX_q1_2022.txt,"I'll now discuss the financial results.
We reported revenue of $267 million during the first quarter of 2022, which represents an increase of 16%, compared to $230.1 million during the first quarter of 2021.
The increase was largely attributable to volume increases in our Fenestration segment, combined with higher prices related to the pass-through of raw material cost inflation.
More specifically, we realized net sales growth of 14.5% in our North American fenestration segment, 15.5% in our North American cabinet components segment, and 18.6% in our European fenestration segment, excluding the foreign exchange impact.
We reported net income of $11.2 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the three months ended January 31st, 2022, compared to $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share during the three months ended January 31st, 2021.
On an adjusted basis, net income increased by 25.9% to $11.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021.
The adjustments being made to earnings per share are for restructuring charges, loss on the sale of a plant, foreign currency transaction impacts, and transaction and advisory fees.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter was essentially flat year over year at $24.4 million, compared to $24.3 million during the same period of last year.
The increase in earnings for the three months ended January 31st, 2022, was attributable to continued strong demand, operational efficiency gains, and increased pricing.
However, the decrease in margin percentage was driven by inflationary pressures and time lags on material index pricing mechanisms.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Cash used for operating activities was $21.7 million for the quarter, compared to $3.4 million for the same period of last year.
Due to the typical seasonality in our business, free cash flow was negative in the first quarter of this year.
In addition, the value of our inventory increased further due to inflationary pressures, which had a negative impact on working capital.
As a reminder, we usually generate most of our cash in the second half of each year.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong.
Our liquidity position is solid, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was at 0.4 times as of January 31st, 2022.
We will remain focused on generating cash, paying down debt, and opportunistically repurchasing stock as the year progresses.
However, based on improvements in labor performance, the expected continuation of our pass-through pricing strategy, conversations with our customers, and the latest macro data, we're now comfortable providing the following guidance for fiscal 2022.
Net sales of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $135 million to $140 million; depreciation of approximately $31 million, amortization of approximately $15 million; SG&A of $115 million to $120 million, interest expense of $2 million to $2.5 million, tax rate of 28%, capex of $30 million to $35 million; and free cash flow of $55 million to $60 million.
While we do expect some level of volume growth in our Fenestration segments for the remainder of the year, note that our current expectation is that revenue growth for the remainder of the year should be driven more by price, as opposed to volume, and we expect margin expansion to be second-half weighted.
From a cadence perspective for Q2, we expect net sales to be up mid to high single digits year-over-year in each segment.
However, due to inflation and the time lag associated with passing on price increases for most of our raw materials, we believe it will be a challenge to realize margin expansion in any segment in Q2.
Looking ahead into the second half of the year, on a consolidated basis, we currently expect mid-single-digit net sales growth year over year in Q3 and Q4.
In addition, due to easier comps and the expected benefit from our pricing strategy, coupled with some volume growth in our fenestration segments, we expect to realize some margin expansion in Q3 and Q4.
Joe's guidance was key during our transition into a pure-play building products company several years ago, and more recently, his mentorship and support proved invaluable, as I transitioned into the CEO role.
I will now discuss results for the quarter and then conclude with a discussion on the macro environment and guidance.
Demand was healthy across all product lines during the first quarter of 2022.
Volume growth in our fenestration segments and higher prices in all segments, mostly related to the pass-through of raw material cost inflation resulted in revenue growth of 16% year over year.
On a consolidated basis, we estimate that revenue growth for the quarter was weighted approximately 10% due to an increase in volume and approximately 90% due to an increase in price.
The first quarter began with continued supply chain challenges and significant labor disruption caused by COVID absenteeism driven by the omicron variant.
However, these issues started to subside toward the end of the quarter.
The rate of raw material cost inflation remains a challenge, as we typically see a 30 to 90-day time lag in passing these increases through to our customers.
Looking at the individual segments, I will start with the North American fenestration.
This segment generated revenue of $146.6 million in Q1, which was $18.5 million or 14.5% higher than prior year Q1.
Strong demand in our IG spacer and screen product lines, volume growth in vinyl fencing components, and price increases across all product lines were the main drivers of the growth.
We estimate that revenue growth in this segment was weighted approximately 45% due to an increase in volume and approximately 55% due to an increase in price.
Adjusted EBITDA of $16.3 million in this segment was essentially flat versus prior year Q1.
The improved pricing, volume-related efficiency gains, and productivity-related improvements were more than offset by inflationary pressures on raw materials, which caused margin erosion of approximately 170 basis points for the quarter.
However, our current expectation is for margin expansion in this segment later in the year, assuming that the rate of inflation subsides.
Our European fenestration segment generated revenue of $58.9 million in the first quarter, which was $9.8 million or 20% higher than prior year.
Excluding foreign exchange impact, this would equate to an increase of 18.6%.
We estimate that revenue growth in this segment was weighted approximately 20% due to an increase in volume and approximately 80% due to an increase in price.
Strong demand in both IG spacers and vinyl extrusions combined with material-related price increases accounted for the strong performance year over year.
These favorable volume-related impacts and pricing actions were more than offset by inflationary pressure on raw material costs and by inefficiencies caused by the COVID-related absenteeism early in the quarter.
As such, adjusted EBITDA came in at $10.4 million for the quarter, which was $300,000 less than prior year and yielded margin compression of approximately 420 basis points.
Similar to our expectations for other segments, we do anticipate that margins will improve, as the year progresses, again, assuming that the rate of inflation subsides.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $62.4 million in Q1, which was $8.4 million or 15.5% higher than prior year.
Volumes decreased in this segment year over year, mainly as a result of customers' decisions to reduce overtime hours worked in their plants.
Increases in hardwood index pricing as well as discretionary pricing actions offset the volume and resulted in revenue growth year over year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2 million for the quarter, which was $1.2 million less than prior year and resulted in margin compression of approximately 280 basis points.
Improvements in lumber yield and labor efficiency were more than offset by a significant increase in hardwood lumber costs during the quarter.
Weather-related challenges in the Appalachian wood region, as well as increases in maple demand, were the main drivers of the increases in lumber costs.
As a reminder, we have material index pricing mechanisms in place, but they typically have a 90-day lag, and we will require a period of flat or declining wood pricing before we're able to catch up on our margin performance in this segment.
As we look forward through the remainder of the year, we feel good about the demand environment across all of our product lines.
In North America, the housing market remains strong, and our customers continue to have high levels of backlog, which we anticipate will slowly dwindle throughout the year.
The rate of inflation and the potential for further interest rate hikes could impact demand at some point in the future, but we do not expect this to occur in the near term due to the high backlog levels.
In Continental Europe and the U.K., the demand environment remains healthy, although consumer confidence could ultimately be impacted if inflation continues to ramp and energy costs continue to increase.
From a Quanex perspective, we have seen enough improvements in our supply chain and stabilization in our labor force to say that the main challenge we now face is the rate of inflation and the ability to pass through price in an expedited manner.
As Scott mentioned earlier, we have enough data points and adequate visibility into our customers' backlog to give us confidence in providing full year guidance.
Again, we expect to generate revenue of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $135 million to $140 million.
If we execute to plan and are able to post results within these ranges, it will mark the third straight year of record performance for the Quanex team.
Moving on to a more recent tragic subject, which is the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
It is difficult to see these events unfold in real time and watch what you believe to be unfathomable turn into reality.
We have employees and business partners with personal ties to Ukraine and our hearts are with them, their families, and all the Ukrainian people being affected by this pointless and horrific war.
At this point, it is too early for anyone to accurately predict or estimate the impact that this war will have on the European or global economies or what supply chain disruptions or other impacts this may have on our industry.
We anticipate there will be challenges, especially if the situation worsens substantially.
However, at this point, it is much too early to predict or forecast those impacts.
Nonetheless, our team has managed through COVID and numerous global supply chain challenges over the past two years, and we are very confident in our ability to navigate this event as well.
And with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.
","In Q1 2022, the company reported revenue growth of 16% to $267 million, driven by volume increases in the Fenestration segment and higher pricing due to inflationary pressures. Net income increased to $11.2 million from $7.9 million in Q1 2021, leading to an increase in earnings per share from $0.24 to $0.34. Adjusted earnings per share also rose by 25.9% to $0.34. Despite challenges such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, operational efficiency and increased pricing contributed to the growth. However, margin percentage decreased due to inflationary pressures and time lags in material index pricing mechanisms. For fiscal 2022, the company expects net sales of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, with margin expansion expected to be second-half weighted due to easier comparisons and the benefits of pricing strategy."
AAT_q3_2021.txt,"Both are now available on the Investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com.
I am pleased to report that we continue to make great progress on all fronts as we rebound from the impact of COVID-19.
We knew at the onset of the pandemic that we would not be impervious to its economic impact, but we were confident that the high-quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio, combined with the strength of our balance sheet and ample liquidity would help us pull through and maybe even come out on the other side better off than at the beginning.
We continue to be optimistic as we meaningfully rebounded in 2021 and anticipate further growth in 2022 and beyond.
That's why we've aggregated the portfolio comprised of a well-balanced collection of office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties located in dynamic high barrier to entry markets, where we believe that the demographics, pent-up demand and local economies remain strong relative to others.
Our properties are more resilient in our view to economic downturns as they are in the path of growth, education, and innovation and importantly can likely withstand the impact of long-term inflation, perhaps even benefit from the benefits of long-term inflation.
Along those lines during the past quarter, we used our liquidity to acquire two complementary and accretive office properties in Bellevue, Washington, a market that we remain very bullish on and in which we expect continued rent growth.
Meanwhile, our development of La Jolla Commons III into an 11 story, approximately 210,000 square foot Class A office tower remains on time and on budget for Q2 or Q3 2023 delivery.
We are encouraged about the leasing prospects in the UTC submarket for high-quality, large blocks of space, where both tech and life science funding continues at record levels and same tenants continue to expand.
But we don't have specific news to share on that front at this time.
The same holds true for our One Beach Street development on the North Waterfront of San Francisco, which we believe to be a unique opportunity for a full building tenant with delivery expected in Q2 or Q3 of 2022.
Additionally, I'm happy to inform you that our Board of Directors has approved the quarterly dividend of $0.30 a share for the third quarter, which we believe is supported by our expectations for operations to continue trending positively.
It will be paid on December 23 to shareholders of record on December nine.
As we look at our portfolio, we are always reminded of the importance of owning and operating the preeminent properties in each of our markets.
That's why we focused on continuing to enhance our best-in-class community shopping centers to promote a better experience for our shoppers with the expectation that this will further strengthen our properties as the dominant centers in our submarkets.
And we understand the importance of modern state-of-the-art amenities in our office projects, which assist our tenants in the hiring and retention of talent in what is currently a very competitive job market.
We feel strongly that consistently improving and monetizing our properties, including incorporating sustainability and health and wellness elements is critical to remaining competitive in the marketplace in order to attract the highest quality and highest credit tenants.
Meanwhile, we are encouraged by our approximately 97% collection percentage in Q3, increased leasing activity across all asset classes, fewer tenant failures and bankruptcies than we expected and many modified leases hitting percentage rent thresholds sooner than expected and are collecting of approximately 96% of deferred rents due during the third quarter, all validating the strategies we implemented during COVID to support our struggling retailers through the government-mandated closures as we are fortunate to have the financial ability to do so.
Briefly on the retail front, we've seen an improved leasing environment over the past few quarters with positive activity engagement with new retailers for many of our vacancies, including recently signed new deals with Columbia Sportswear, Williams-Sonoma, Total Wine and First Hawaiian Bank to name a few, and renewals with Nordstrom's, Petco and Whole Earth among others as well as many other new deals and renewals in the lease documentation process.
Retailers are choosing our best-in-class locations to improve their sales, all the while we remain selective in terms of merchandising our shopping centers for the longer term.
Chris Sullivan and his team have done a tremendous job on that front despite some of the continuing headwinds at our Waikiki Beach Walk retail.
On the multifamily front as of quarter end, we were 96% leased at Hassalo in Portland, and 98% leased in San Diego multifamily portfolio.
All of the master lease units in San Diego that you've heard us discuss previously were absorbed by early August.
Though multifamily collections have been particularly challenging in Portland due to COVID-related government restrictions, we have started receiving meaningful checks from government rental assistant programs to drive down our outstanding amounts owed and expect more checks to come.
We are confident that Abigail's strong leadership at San Diego multifamily and Tania's new energy at Hassalo will drive improvements at our multifamily properties, both operationally and financially.
Last night we reported third quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.57, and third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.17.
Third quarter results are primarily comprised of the following: actual FFO increased in the third quarter by approximately 11.4% on a FFO per share basis to $0.57 per FFO share compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily from the following four items: first, the acquisitions of Eastgate Office Park in Corporate Campus East III in Bellevue, Washington, on July seven and September 10, respectively, added approximately $0.023 of FFO per share in Q3.
Second, Alamo Quarry in San Antonio added approximately $0.017 of FFO per share in Q3, resulting from 2019 and 2020 real estate tax refunds received during the third quarter of 2021, which reduced Alamo Quarry's real estate tax expense.
Third, decrease of bad debt expense at Carmel Mountain Plaza added approximately $0.005 per FFO share in Q3.
And fourth, the Embassy Suites and Waikiki Beach Walk added approximately $0.012 of FFO per share in Q3 due to the seasonality over the summer months.
Let me give you an update on our Waikiki Embassy Suites hotel.
Due to the impact of the delta variant, Hawaiian Governor Ige made a formal announcement on the third week in August that if you have plans or are thinking of coming to Hawaii, please don't come until we tell you otherwise.
It was not a mandate, but it did create a detrimental impact to our visitors to Hawaii and resulted in huge cancellation starting in August and into September.
Our results for Q3 at Embassy Suites hotel were expected to be much higher.
Overall, occupancy, ADR and RevPAR continued to increase on heading in the right direction.
As of October 19, Governor Ige made another formal announcement to begin welcoming all essential and nonessential travel, starting November 1, 2021.
We look forward to welcoming the fully vaccinated individuals and ramping up our visitor industry.
On our Q2 earnings call, I mentioned that Japan, who was then approximately 9% fully vaccinated, is now over 65% fully vaccinated and is expected to hit 80% by November.
All emergency measures in Japan were lifted on September 30 and lifted the intensive antivirus measures.
It marks the first time since April that Japan is free of corona virus declarations and intensive measures.
We expect to start seeing the Japanese tourists beginning to slowly start revisiting the Hawaiian Islands beginning in November, including Waikiki.
Now as we look at our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021, our total revenue increased approximately $6.5 million over Q2 '21, which is approximately a 7% increase.
Approximately 43% of that was from the two new office acquisitions.
Same-store cash NOI overall was strong at 14% year-over-year, with office consistently strong before, during and post-COVID and retail showing strong signs of recovery.
Multifamily was flat primarily year-over-year as a result of higher bad debt expense at our Hassalo on eight departments in Portland, but it was still approximately 5% higher than Q2 2021.
As previously disclosed, we acquired Corpus Campus East III on September 10, comprised of an approximately 161,000 square foot multi-tenant office campus located just off Interstate 405 and 520 freeway interchange, less than five minutes away from downtown Bellevue, Washington.
The four building campus is currently 86% leased to a diversified tenant base, which we saw as an opportunity when in-place rents were compared to what we were seeing in the marketplace.
The purchase price of approximately $84 million was paid with cash on the balance sheet.
The going-in cap rate was north of 3% as a result of the existing vacancy.
Our expectation based on our underwriting is that this asset will produce a five year average cap rate over 6% and a strong unlevered IRR of 7%.
Let's talk about liquidity.
At the end of the third quarter, we had liquidity of approximately $522 million, comprised of approximately $172 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million of availability on our line of credit.
Our leverage, which we measure in terms of net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.4 times.
Our focus is to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.5 times or below.
Our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.9 times.
As we approach year-end, we are providing our 2021 guidance.
The full year range of 2021 is $1.91 to $1.93 per FFO share with a midpoint of $1.92 per FFO share.
With that midpoint, we would expect Q4 2021 to be approximately $0.46 per FFO share.
The $0.11 estimated difference in Q4 FFO per share would be attributable to the following: approximately a negative $0.025 of FFO per share relating to nonrecurring collection of prior rents at one of our theaters in Q3 that will not occur in Q4 2021.
Secondly, our mixed-use properties are expected to be down approximately $0.037 of FFO per share relating to the normal seasonality of the Embassy Suites hotel and the related parking.
Third, Alamo Quarry is expected to be down approximately $0.02 of FFO per share relating to the nonrecurring property tax refund that was received in Q3 2021 for 2019 and 2020.
And we expect G&A and interest expense to increase and therefore, decrease FFO by approximately $0.02 per FFO share.
Additionally, we plan to issue 2022 full year guidance subject to Board approval when we announce year-end 2021 results in February of 2022.
Historically, we have issued our full year guidance on the Q3 earnings call.
We believe resetting the issuance and cadence of our guidance to the Q4 earnings call going forward is more in alignment with our peers and also gives us more clarity as to the following year guidance.
We will continue our best to be as transparent as possible and share with you our analysis, interpretations of our quarterly numbers.
Our office portfolio grew by approximately 440,000 square feet or nearly 13% in Q3 with the two new office acquisitions.
We brought up these assets on board at approximately 92% leased with approximately 20% rolling through 2022, which provides us with the opportunity to deliver start rates from approximately 10% to 30% over ending rents.
At the end of the third quarter at One Beach, which remains under redevelopment, our office portfolio is approximately 93% leased with 1.5% expiring through the end of 2021, approximately 9% expiring in 2022 with tour and proposed activity that has increased significantly.
Our office portfolio has weathered the storm well.
In the second and third quarters, we executed 57,000 annual square feet of comparable new and renewal leases with increases over prior rent of 9.2% and 14.5% on a cash and straight-line basis respectively.
New start rates for the 2021 rollover are estimated to be approximately 17% above the ending rates.
In fact, we are at least documentation for over half of the space rolling in 2021 as start rates nearly 28% over ending rates.
New start rates for the 2022 rollovers are estimated to be approximately 18% above the ending rates.
We are employing multiple initiatives to drive rent growth and occupancy, including renovating buildings with significant vacancy, adding or enhancing amenities, aggregating and white boxing larger loss of space where there is a scarcity of such blocks and improving our smaller spaces to be move-in ready.
By way of a few examples, we are just completing renovations of two buildings at Torrey Reserve in San Diego.
Those two buildings represent 80% of the total project vacancy.
We now have leases signed or in documentation for over half of that vacancy at premium rates.
We will be completing similar renovations Eastgate Office Park where leasing activity is already robust, but we anticipate taking this property to the next level of quality.
We are adding new fitness and conference facilities at Torrey Reserve, City Center Bellevue and Corporate Campus East III and will be further enhancing the employee's amenities building at Eastgate.
We believe that our continued strategic investments in our portfolio will position us to capture more than our fair share of that absorption at premium rents as the markets improve.
And we have more to look forward to with redevelopments and development.
In addition to One Beach Street and La Jolla Commons previously mentioned by Ernest, construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of seven Tower Square in the, on our market at Portland, which will add another 32,000 rentable square feet to the office portfolio.
In summary, our office portfolio is on us as we move forward into the rest of 2021 and beyond.
","In the third quarter, the company reported an 11.4% increase in FFO per share to $0.57 due to office acquisitions, real estate tax refunds, reduced bad debt expense, and seasonality in hospitality. Key highlights include strong same-store cash NOI in office and retail segments, the 86% leased acquisition of Corporate Campus East III in Bellevue, and increased leasing activity across all asset classes. The company maintains a solid liquidity position of $522 million. For the full year 2021, the company projects FFO per share between $1.91 and $1.93, with a slight decrease in Q4 FFO per share due to non-recurring items, seasonality, and increased expenses. The company will provide 2022 guidance in February 2022. Office leasing activity remains strong, with comparable new and renewal leases reflecting rent increases of over 9% and 14% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. The company continues to invest in portfolio improvements and developments, including redevelopments in Portland and San Diego, to enhance occupancy and drive rent growth."
OGE_q1_2021.txt,"s First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.
Im Jason Bailey, Director of Investor Relations.
; and Bryan Buckler, CFO of OGE Energy Corp.
In terms of the call today, we will first hear from Sean, followed by an explanation from Bryan of first quarter results.
In addition, the conference call and accompanying slides will be archived following the call on that same website.
Earlier, we reported first quarter consolidated earnings of $0.26 per share, which includes utility earnings of $0.06 per share, earnings associated with our investment in Enable of $0.19 per share, and earnings at the holding company of $0.01 per share.
We've accomplished a lot, and I'm pleased to report that we've made great progress in mitigating the impacts of Winter Storm Uri.
We are back within the guidance range we reported last quarter, and we are not done.
We are one quarter into the year, and we're focused on a great year.
Our efforts to mitigate the impacts of Uri are ongoing as we work consistently to deliver shareholder value.
Bryan will provide additional details when he discusses our financial results.
We've had a productive and busy first quarter, starting the year off by announcing our support of the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer.
And as we work to finalize that merger agreement in February, our service territory experienced Winter Storm Uri, and I'm pleased to say that our operational performance during the storm was strong.
Our employees and our generation fleet performed admirably, and our customers experienced minimal disruptions.
Importantly, we performed our work safely, improving our year-over-year first quarter safety results by 60%, which is a great accomplishment when you consider that 2020 was our second safest year on record.
And particularly when you consider that our members worked in some of the most difficult winter conditions imaginable during the storm.
Then we quickly got to work on legislative and regulatory solutions to address the financial impacts of Uri.
We now have a regulatory asset for the recovery of the winter storm cost in Oklahoma and in Arkansas.
We now have securitization legislation in Oklahoma and in Arkansas.
And we have filed for securitization in Oklahoma and in Arkansas.
Turning to other positive regulatory outcomes in the first quarter.
In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the settlement in our Third Formula Rate and new rates were implemented April 1.
In Oklahoma, under our grid enhancement mechanism, the work is going well.
We file regulatory reports each quarter as projects are placed in service.
And I'm pleased to say that the entire program is going smoothly.
On the last call, I mentioned that we have a lot of really exciting projects in and around our communities in various stages of development.
The two projects I'm sharing today are only the first, and there are more to come.
We announced an innovative deal with Dobson Fiber to upgrade the resiliency and capacity of our utility communications network to accommodate new grid automation and mitigate the risk of wireless interference.
This is part of our continued grid enhancement efforts to deploy increased automation, monitoring and operational technologies.
This initiative enables us to essentially future-proof our communications network while saving more than 60% of our standard capital deployment and O&M costs.
Those are just real savings for our customers.
We also announced an expansion of the Choctaw Nation/OG&E Solar Energy Center.
And we're proud to continue our work with the Choctaw Nation and expand our commitment to renewable energy.
This commitment is based off customer-driven demand for our renewable energy offerings.
We now have included $25 million to our 2021 capital investment forecast to reflect the inclusion of these two projects in the first quarter.
These are just two examples of the kinds of innovative projects you can expect from us in the future.
We are seeing the recovery we anticipated at the beginning of the year.
Last quarter, we stated our expectations for 2021 weather-normalized load being 2.4% above 2020 levels.
After the first quarter, we still expect full year 2021 weather-normalized load to be at that level.
Adding to our confidence around the return of load is the fact that even during the pandemic, we've continued our trend of strong customer growth, which is up 1.4% over the same period in 2020, driven primarily in our residential and commercial classes.
Add to this, the fact that in Oklahoma, gross receipts are up 38% for the month of April, adding to the confidence we have in our business.
Today, as I've said before, our electric rates are lower than they were in 2011.
And let me share an interesting data point.
When adjusted for inflation, our rates are actually 14% below what they were in 2011.
Business and economic development is active in our service territory.
These low rates are a significant driver of companies coming to or expanding their operations, including electrification in our service territory.
So far, this year, those efforts expect to bring an additional 50 megawatts of load by the end of 2021.
This combination of strong customer growth and outstanding business and economic development activity puts us on track for sustained load growth of at least 1%.
We will continue to work on the many opportunities that will bring more load, more jobs and more investment to our communities in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
So let me put all of this into perspective.
We've continued to achieve positive regulatory outcomes, we've added new innovative projects, we see strong customer growth.
We have some of, if not the lowest rates in the nation, combined with annual load growth and better unemployment rates than most of the nation.
This is all part of our great story that further supports our sustainable business model of growing revenues by attracting new customers, managing expenses by utilizing technology and becoming more efficient, this helps us maintain the low rates, which in turn attracts more customers.
This virtuous cycle continues.
Our results this year will rest on our operational execution, and I'm very confident in our ability to achieve that.
For the remainder of the year, we will achieve final regulatory approval of cost recovery plans for Winter Storm Uri, submit integrated resource plans in Oklahoma and Arkansas, file our Fourth Formula Rate in Arkansas, including a request for an extension of its term, finished construction of the two solar farms, continue our grid enhancement investments in Oklahoma, which are on track to deliver results to our customers.
And finally, we continue to prepare for our next Oklahoma rate case, which we plan to file later this year.
So we've accomplished a lot already in the first quarter, but we're still going.
And this all sets us up for a great year in years to come.
We expect the transaction to close in 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the HSR clearance.
Our intention to prudently exit our midstream investment remains the same, and we will provide information upon closing of the transaction.
On our last call, we talked about our solid compelling investment thesis, supported by a track record of performance.
We put in motion our vision to become a pure-play utility, targeting 5% earnings growth based off lower risk investments that will enhance our customers' experience.
We have some of the most affordable rates in the nation helping to drive economic growth in our communities.
Weve made great progress toward getting back to our 2021 guidance.
Our ability to meet guidance rests on our operational execution, and I'm confident in our ability to do so.
Our company is strong, and while COVID and extreme weather have presented challenges, it's important to understand that we have always been determined to more than simply manage the downturn instead, set our sights on excelling through the recovery.
Starting on slide nine.
For the first quarter of 2021, we achieved net income of $53 million or $0.26 per share as compared to a loss of $492 million or $2.46 per share in 2020.
The loss in 2020 was driven by the impairment charge recorded on our Enable midstream investment.
At the utility, OG&E's first quarter results were $0.04 lower than 2020, primarily driven by the previously disclosed losses that occurred during the extreme winter weather from the Guaranteed Flat Bill program.
As I discussed during our fourth quarter call, the GFB program represents approximately 3% of our load, whereby variabilities in fuel and purchase power costs are not trued up.
The financial impacts of the weather event are consistent with the estimates we provided you on the fourth quarter call.
Excluding the impact of the extraordinary fuel costs in our GFB program, OG&E's core operations performed very well during the first quarter, including strong cost management.
I'll speak to our updated full year 2021 projection in a moment.
Our natural gas midstream operations were income of $0.19 per share in the first quarter compared to a loss of $2.84 in 2020.
The increase in earnings was primarily due to the 2020 impairment of our investment in Enable.
The current quarter was also marked by higher net income from Enable's transportation and storage business resulting from higher natural gas prices.
Turning to our economic update on slide 10.
As Sean mentioned, we are seeing strong employment figures in our service territory, and we are especially pleased with the customer growth of 1.4% year-over-year, illustrating the attractiveness of living and working in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Furthermore, our commercial segment is showing encouraging strength, with year-over-year load growth of approximately 6% in the month of March alone, leading to the 1.8% quarterly load increase figure you see on the slide.
For the full year, we continue to expect total weather normal load results to be approximately 2.4% higher than 2020 levels.
Let's move to slide 11.
We've made outstanding progress in the quarter toward mitigating the aforementioned GFB program impacts and currently project OG&E full year 2021 results within the lower half of our original guidance range of $1.76 and to $1.86 per share.
On the fourth quarter call, we outlined our initial estimate of approximately $0.10 of headwinds associated with the weather event.
As I mentioned earlier, our estimates continue to come in at approximately this level, included in the $0.10 of headwinds was estimated financing costs associated with the incremental fuel and purchase power, which is no longer an earnings headwind as we were recently able to obtain regulatory orders in Oklahoma and Arkansas for the deferral of the financing cost.
The OG&E team has worked hard during the quarter to further mitigate these impacts and already has line of sight to $0.03 to $0.04 of favorable mitigations, including strong O&M management.
Thus, our current estimate of 2021 full year earnings per share is back in the lower half of guidance with three quarters in front of us.
Looking more long term.
The very solid start to 2021 for our core operations, coupled with the capital investments we are making for our customers and communities in 2021, position our company well for sustained earnings growth into 2022 and beyond.
As I mentioned to you on our fourth quarter call, our business fundamentals are strong, and we have great confidence in our ability to grow OG&E at a 5% long-term earnings per share growth rate through 2025 off the midpoint of our 2021 guidance of $1.81.
On slide 12 and 13, I'd like to update you on the fuel and purchase power costs, the status of our regulatory filings and the securitization path in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
As of March 31, fuel and purchase power costs of approximately $930 million were recorded on the balance sheet, consistent with the initial estimates.
In Oklahoma, approximately $830 million has been deferred to a regulatory asset with the initial carrying charge based on the effective cost of debt financing.
In Arkansas, we have incurred approximately $100 million of cost with the case pending that allows interim recovery of these costs over a 10-year period, including an initial carrying cost that approximates the effective cost of financing.
As Sean mentioned, both Oklahoma and Arkansas have passed securitization laws.
And some of the key parameters of those laws are shown on the slide.
In Oklahoma, we filed an application on April 26, seeking authorization from the OCC to securitize the costs associated with the extreme February weather.
Based on the timeline outlined in the legislation, we would expect to receive proceeds from the securitization by mid-2022, which would restore our credit metrics due to levels we expected prior to the weather event.
In Arkansas, on May 4, we made a filing indicating OG&E's intention to pursue securitization of the fuel and purchase power costs.
As a reminder, the Arkansas legislation dictates that a carrying charge equivalent to a WACC is the appropriate -- is appropriate from the date of cost occurrence to the issuance date of the securitization bonds.
This securitization is pursued in Arkansas, it will replace our open docket that is requesting a 10-year recovery period with a carrying charge at our weighted average cost of capital.
As we noted on our fourth quarter call, we closed on a $1 billion credit commitment agreement that provided short-term funding for our incurred fuel and purchase power costs.
We intend to refinance this short-term loan by issuing longer-term debt in 2021, likely with the call feature that coincides with the expected timing of the securitization of the fuel and purchase power cost.
Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry, and our equity plans have not changed.
While our credit metrics are expected to weaken temporarily due to the fuel and purchase power costs incurred, we believe the metrics will return to the targeted 18% to 20% level once the securitizations are complete.
Separately, as a procedural matter, later today, we will update our standard S-3 Chef filing with the SEC, which ensures our continued access to the capital markets.
Finally, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term OG&E earnings per share growth of 5%, which when coupled with a stable and growing dividend, offers an investors an attractive total return proposition.
","OGE Energy reported $0.26 per share earnings for Q1 2021, driven by utility earnings ($0.06 per share), Enable earnings ($0.19 per share), and holding company earnings ($0.01 per share). Despite winter storm impacts, OG&E expects to remain within its guidance range of $1.76 to $1.86 per share, with mitigating measures already in place. Regulatory approvals for cost recovery and securitization in Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as grid enhancement investments, position the company for sustained load growth of at least 1%. OGE remains confident in its 5% earnings growth target through 2025, supported by strong operational execution and attractive rates that drive economic development in its service territory."
RHI_q1_2021.txt,"We appreciate your time today.
This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally.
The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed.
The supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2018 through 2021.
We are extremely pleased that our first quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance and reflect a broad-based recovery that's well under way.
Protiviti's revenues grew 35% year-on-year reflecting continuing momentum across its wide array of service offerings, including very strong managed solutions with staffing.
This is Protiviti's 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains.
Our staffing operations significantly outperformed their historical sequential trends, led by small and medium-sized businesses and permanent placement, which grew 22% sequentially.
I continue to be impressed with the adaptability of our teams in navigating the new hybrid and remote work models with our clients and candidates, helping them grow and find meaningful work.
Companywide revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down 7% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis, and down 8% on an as adjusted basis.
Net income per share in the first quarter was $0.98, increasing 24% compared to $0.79 in the first quarter a year ago.
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $68 million.
In March, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $44 million.
We also acquired approximately 797,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $61 million.
We have 9.2 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan.
Our return on invested capital for the company was 37% in the first quarter.
Let's start with revenues.
As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter.
On an as adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18% year-over-year.
U.S. staffing revenues were $759 million, down 19% from the prior year.
Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $242 million, down 15% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis.
We have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
In the first quarter, there were 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter one year ago.
The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days equivalent to the second quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $17 million.
This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points.
Now, let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti.
Global revenues in the first quarter were $397 million.
$316 million of that is from business within the United States, and $81 million is from operations outside the United States.
On an as adjusted basis, global first quarter Protiviti revenues were up 35% versus the year-ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 37%.
Non-U.S. revenues were up 26% on an as adjusted basis.
Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $6 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2 percentage points.
Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
We remind you that changes to the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A.
Previously, they were both classified as SG&A.
Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measures of combined segment income.
This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP.
Turning now to gross margin.
In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, first quarter gross margin was 38.8% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the first quarter one year ago.
Our permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 11.2% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago.
When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 160 basis points compared to the year-ago first quarter to 45.6%.
For Protiviti, gross margin was 26.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.6% of Protiviti revenues one year ago.
Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, gross margin for Protiviti was 26.9% for the quarter just ended compared to 26.3% one year ago.
Companywide SG&A costs were 30.3% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 29.4% in the same quarter one year ago.
Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue by 0.8% in the first quarter and decreasing SG&A by 2.4% in the same quarter one year ago.
When adjusted for these changes, companywide SG&A costs were 29.5% for the quarter just ended compared to 31.8% one year ago.
Staffing SG&A costs were 37.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in the Q1 -- in Q1 2020.
Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 1% in the first quarter compared to income of 3% related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter one year ago.
When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 35.3% one year ago.
First-quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income for the quarter was $139 million.
This includes $12 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets.
Combined segment income was therefore, $151 million in the first quarter.
Combined segment margin was 10.8%.
First quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $93 million with a segment margin of 9.3%.
Segment income for Protiviti in the first quarter was $57 million with a segment margin of 14.4%.
Our first quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 32% a year ago.
The 2020 rate was elevated based upon the estimated lower coverage of non-deductible tax items due to lower pandemic-impacted revenues.
Moving on to accounts receivable.
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $800 million, and implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 51.4 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues down 12.5% versus the prior year, compared to an 18.9% decrease for the full quarter.
Revenues for the first two weeks of April were up 9% compared to the same period one year ago.
Permanent placement revenues in March were up 24.2% versus March of 2020.
This compares to an 8.1% decrease for the full quarter.
For the first three weeks of April permanent placement revenues were up 154% compared to the same period in 2020.
We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we've seen during the first quarter and into April.
But as you know, these are very brief time periods and we caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance.
Revenues $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion.
Income per share $1 to $1.10.
The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue increase of 31% on an as adjusted basis including Protiviti.
Midpoint earnings per share of $1.05 would represent an all-time high for the company.
The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows.
Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 23% to 26%, Protiviti up 47% to 49%, overall up 30% to 32%.
On the gross margin percentages, temporary and consultant staffing 38% to 39%, Protiviti 27% to 29% and overall 40% to 41%.
SG&A as percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing 35% to 37%, Protiviti 12% to 14%, overall 29% to 30%.
And segment income, staffing 9% to 10%, Protiviti 14% to 15%, and overall 10% to 11%.
Full year capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs, $85 million to $95 million with $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter.
Our tax rate, 26% to 27% and shares at 112 million.
We limit our guidance to one quarter.
Our staffing results accelerated during the quarter, indicating a faster early cycle pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past.
This was very broad based and seen across geographies, lines of business, client size, and skill levels.
As I mentioned earlier, small and medium-size businesses led the way after being more negatively impacted during the peak of the pandemic.
The NFIB recently reported that 42% of small businesses had job openings they could not fill, which was a record level.
This bodes well for us.
Our investments in advanced AI technologies have allowed us to adapt quickly to a new marketplace, where remote and hybrid work has become commonplace.
Together with our people, these technologies enable us to find solutions to meet the critical talent and consulting needs of our clients across broader resource pools.
Protiviti continues to thrive with multi-year double-digit growth and a pipeline that is highly diversified across both solution offerings and client segments.
Our blended solutions, complementing Protiviti's offerings with contract talent, allows us to be extremely nimble and cost effective in response to client needs, and we expect this offering to be an increasing part of our business going forward.
We're excited about our current momentum and our prospects for the balance of 2021 and beyond, buoyed by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology, and our professional business model.
These are Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work for in 2021 and Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity 2021.
Please ask just one question and a single follow up as needed.
If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.
","Robert Half International experienced a 24% increase in net income per share to $0.98 in Q1 2021 compared to $0.79 in Q1 2020. The company's revenue was $1.398 billion, a decrease of 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an adjusted basis. This decline was largely attributed to a drop in staffing revenues, particularly in the U.S. However, Protiviti's revenues soared by 35%, with an impressive 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The company expressed optimism for the future, citing accelerating staffing results and strong Protiviti growth. Robert Half International's second-quarter guidance projects revenues between $1.435 billion and $1.515 billion, potentially resulting in all-time high earnings per share of $1.05."
BC_q2_2021.txt,"Please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from these expectations.
All of these documents are available on our website at brunswick.com.
Our businesses had another outstanding quarter.
We closed the first half of 2021 by delivering record results as a result of continuing strong retail demand, outstanding operational performance and success in mitigating material supply and labor challenges.
All of our businesses delivered exceptional growth during the quarter.
Our Propulsion business continued to realize strong outward market share gains, leveraging the strongest product lineup in the industry.
Our Parts and Accessories businesses continued to benefit from robust aftermarket demand, driven by elevated boating participation.
And our Boat business posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins despite significant supply chain, transportation and labor challenges.
Robust retail demand for our products in the first half of the year has driven field inventory levels to the lowest level in decades at approximately nine weeks on hand.
And we are progressing our efforts to efficiently increase capacity across several of our facilities to satisfy orders from our global customer base and begin to replenish the pipeline.
As many of you know, we've also had a busy few months on the M&A front.
At the end of the quarter, our Advanced Systems Group significantly expanded its product and brand portfolio by announcing the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Navico, an industry leader in marine electronics.
In addition, we announced in early July that Freedom has expanded into Spain through the acquisition of Fanautic Club.
I'll touch on both these exciting transactions later in our discussion.
Given the unique demand and inventory environment, together with continued strong boat usage through the prime season, which drives P&A sales, we have improved visibility on our ability to deliver against an extremely favorable outlook for the remainder of 2021.
And consequently, we have increased our 2021 guidance.
Before we discuss the results for the quarter, I wanted to share with you some updated demographic insights through the first half of 2021 and comparisons with the favorable trends we experienced in 2020 versus 2019 in the industry.
I'm happy to report that we are not seeing any change in the significant metrics we shared with you during our first quarter earnings call in April.
Brunswick's average boat buyer age continues to be two years younger than the industry average.
Additionally, Brunswick's first-time boat buyers continue to be younger than our overall boat buyer demographic and three years younger than the industry.
First-time boat buyers are trending more female than they did in 2020, and Brunswick over-indexes to the industry by approximately 800 basis points.
In Freedom Boat Club, the average Freedom member continues to be almost three years younger than our typical boat buying customer and female Freedom members make up approximately 35% of our member base.
We continue to outperform the industry in attracting younger and more diverse first-time boat buyers, positioning us for very strong growth in years to come.
These trends are an extremely important validation of our strategy to secure a healthy future for Brunswick and are also favorable for the entire marine industry.
I also wanted to share with you some awards that Brunswick received during the second quarter that provide more strategic proof points.
Brunswick received 6, 2021 boating industry top product awards, including for the Mercury Marine V12 600-horsepower Verado and the Sea Ray 370 Sundancer Outboard we highlighted recently, but also for our Bayliner Element M15 entry-level boat, BEP's Smart Battery Hub, Attwood's Sahara Mk2 automatic bilge pump, and MotorGuide's Xi3 Kayak Trolling Motor.
Brunswick has also been recognized by Forbes for the second year in a row as one of the best employers for women and ranked second overall in the engineering and manufacturing category.
The winners were chosen based on a survey of 50,000 US employees working for companies employing at least 1,000 people in their US operations and only 300 companies made the final list from the thousands of companies that were considered for the honor.
Finally, Brunswick recently had three employees and a Freedom Boat Club franchisee, Bev Rosella, honored with a Women Making Waves Award from Boating Industry Magazine.
We are very proud of these women leaders.
As you know, equal opportunity, inclusion and diversity are cornerstones of our culture.
I'll now provide some second quarter highlights on our segments and the overall marine market.
Our Propulsion business continues to gain significant retail market share in outboard engines, especially in the higher horsepower categories, where we have focused higher levels of investment in recent years.
For the first half of the year, Mercury has gained share in each horsepower category over 75-horsepower, with outsized gains in nodes in excess of 200-horsepower.
I'm also pleased to announce that we began shipping the new 600-horsepower V-12 Verado engine in late June, and as anticipated, demand has been extremely strong.
We're essentially sold out of the V-12 production slots for the remainder of 2021.
And we estimate that just during the back half of 2021, we will sell more outboard engines in this above 500-horsepower class that was sold in the entire prior history of the outboard industry.
Given the surging demand in the current environment and new product launches planned in the coming years, Mercury is accelerating additional capacity investments at its primary manufacturing center in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, in order to maximize its ability to serve the market and capture further share.
Our Parts and Accessories businesses experienced significant topline and earnings growth and significantly overdrove expectations in the quarter due to outstanding execution, robust aftermarket demand driven by elevated boating participation and favorable weather conditions in many areas.
The Advanced Systems Group, which has a larger OEM component to its business and also serves certain non-marine segments, benefited from prior year comparisons as a result of Q2 2020 customer COVID-related plant shutdowns.
As a result, ASG realized significant growth across all product categories and delivered strong operating margins that were accretive to the overall segment.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, in late June, our Advanced Systems Group strengthened its product and brand portfolio and significantly expanded its scale and capabilities by announcing the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Navico.
This action will further accelerate our ACES strategy and will enhance our ability to provide complete innovative digital solutions to our consumers and comprehensive integrated systems offerings to our OEM customers.
We believe this transaction will close in the second half of 2021.
Our Boat segment had another outstanding quarter, posting its second consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins despite significant supply chain uncertainty, while delivering output consistent with our production plans for the year.
We ended the second quarter with historically low pipeline inventory levels due to consistent strong retail demand for our products.
Given the continued robust retail demand and our dealers' continued desire to take all available product, our 2021 production slots are now sold out for the calendar year, with five brands completely sold out through the 2022 model year.
In fact, the sum of our wholesale orders for 2022 model year product is already roughly equal to our projected 2021 full year wholesale Boat Group revenue.
We continue to hire additional new production employees at most facilities to maintain production consistent with our stated plan.
We remain on track with our plans to ramp up and staff the Palm Coast facility and expand our operations at Reynosa and Portugal.
Additionally, we've identified capital-efficient investment options to further raise capacity to approximately 50,000 annual production units by 2023, should this volume of product be required.
Freedom Boat Club also continues to exceed our expectations, growing both organically and through acquisition with a young and diverse customer base.
With the recently announced acquisition of Fanautic Club and expansion into Spain, Freedom now has 314 locations and 44,000 memberships networkwide, and is closing in on 4,000 votes in the overall Freedom fleet, with an increasing percentage of Brunswick product.
The outstanding operational and financial performance I've been discussing has not been without some external challenges that our businesses continue to manage and mitigate sometimes on a daily basis.
Our supply chain teams in particular, have performed extremely well.
Winter storms in late first quarter and resulting power outages in Central and Southern United States disrupted the supply of oil-based resin and foam products throughout the second quarter, while tight semiconductor supply, raw material shortages and transportation disruption and resulting cost increases continued to present challenges, which we are actively managing.
As a result, our businesses have implemented price increases that are higher than normal, but we believe are generally at the lower end of those implemented across the industry.
The global reach of our supply network and our unique scale in the marine industry, together with our purposeful vertical integration, have so far enabled us to mitigate these challenges and keep our enabled us to mitigate these challenges and keep our production plans on track for 2021.
Finally, labor conditions remained tight in many locations in which we manufacture product.
But our talent acquisition teams have been working hard and successfully to add manufacturing and other talent to our teams, as we increase production.
Next, I'd like to review the sales performance of our business by region on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions.
As expected, all regions posted significant sales growth in the quarter versus both, 2020 and 2019.
Domestic sales grew 55%, with international sales up 49%, versus prior year.
We are seeing strong performance across all international regions, with Asia Pacific still growing despite an extremely strong comparison in 2020.
We continue to experience robust demand around the globe, especially for propulsion products.
And we'll be working through backlogs in certain product categories through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022.
This table provides more color on the recent performance of the U.S. marine retail market, comparing the first half of 2021 to same periods in 2020 and 2019.
As is usual for this time of year, there's significant noise in the month-to-month SSI data, but the positive market trends continue.
All boat categories reported retail gains in the first half of 2021 and continuing the momentum from 2020.
Despite more difficult year-over-year comparisons in May and June, the main powerboat segments are still up 17% in the first half of 2021 versus 2020 and up 13% versus 2019.
Brunswick's year-to-date unit retail performance is generally in line with market growth rates with strength in outboard boat categories.
Outboard engine unit registrations were up 5% in the first half of 2021, when compared with the same time period in 2020.
With Mercury's first half growth more than doubling the market growth rate, resulting in significant market share gains, as I discussed earlier.
As we enter the second half of the year, U.S. lead generation, dealer sentiment and other leading indicators all remain very positive.
Approximately 40% of the boats leaving our manufacturing facilities are retail sold, which is approximately three times historical averages.
In addition, five of our brands, including Whaler, have all model year 2022 production slots already sold.
All these factors give us high confidence in the continuing retail strength as we complete the 2021 selling season and move into 2022.
I'm pleased to share with you the results from another fantastic quarter.
To provide perspective in the slides that follow, we have included comparisons in certain places to both the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 in order to highlight the outstanding performance in each of our businesses over the past few years.
When compared with 2020, second quarter net sales were up 57%, while operating earnings on an as-adjusted basis increased by 126%.
Adjusted operating margins were 17.1% and adjusted earnings per share was $2.52, once again setting new all-time highs for any quarter for which we have available records.
Sales and earnings in each segment benefited from strong global demand for marine products, with earnings also positively impacted by favorable factory absorption from increased production and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher variable compensation costs and increased spending in sales and marketing and ACES and other growth initiatives.
Finally, we had free cash flow of $268 million in the second quarter, with a free cash flow conversion of 135%.
First half comparisons are equally as favorable.
Net sales through the first half of 2021 were up 53% when compared with the first half of 2020, and operating margins of 17% or a 520 basis point improvement from 2020.
This resulted in first half earnings per share of $4.76 and a very robust operating leverage of 27%.
Turning to our segments, revenue in the Propulsion business increased 64% versus the second quarter of 2020 as each product category experienced strong demand and market share gains.
Consistent with the theme from the first quarter, boat manufacturers continue to ramp up production in the second quarter and our increased capacity enabled continued elevated sales to the independent OEM and international channels.
Sales growth was also strong across all product categories when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Operating margins and operating earnings were up significantly in the quarter, benefiting from the factors positively affecting all of our businesses.
In our Parts and Accessories segment, revenues increased 42% and adjusted operating earnings were 46% up versus the second quarter of 2020, due to strong sales growth across all product categories.
Adjusted operating margins of 23.2% were 60 basis points better than prior year quarter, with significant sales increases driving the robust increase in adjusted operating earnings.
Sales growth was also very strong across all product categories when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
This aftermarket-driven annuity-based business continues to benefit from more boaters on the water, which is being augmented by flexible work schedules allowing for more leisure time, with the OEM component of the business, leveraging investments in technology to take advantage of increased demand from both builders as they continue to increase production.
As anticipated, our Boat segment results benefited the most when compared with the second quarter of 2020 due to last year's COVID-related plant shutdowns and production ramp-up.
Sales were up 80% and operating margins were 10.5% for the quarter, the second straight quarter this segment has delivered double-digit margins.
Each brand had strong operational performance, executed their aggressive production plan and contributed to the overall segment's success in the quarter.
When compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales were up 22%, and operating margins were up 160 basis points, further illustrating the foundational improvements that have been made in this business.
Operating earnings were also positively impacted by the increased sales and the lower retail discount levels versus 2020.
Freedom Boat Club, which is included in business acceleration, contributed approximately 3% of the segment's revenue and a margin profile that continues to be accretive to the segment.
Turning to pipelines, our boat production continues to ramp consistent with our plans to produce approximately 38,000 units during the year.
Despite producing almost 10,000 units in the quarter, which is up 5% from the first quarter, retail outsold wholesale replenishment by more than 7,000 units, bringing dealer inventories to an all-time low of approximately 7,400 units.
Our boat brands ended June with under 10 weeks of boats on hand, measured on a trailing 12-month basis, with units in the field lower by 50% versus same time last year.
Given our view that the industry retail market will be up high single-digit percent for the year, we believe that retail will outpace our production targets resulting in our year-end weeks on hand to be lower than year-end 2020 by several weeks.
We continue to work with our brands to unlock additional near-term capacity through automation, labor and select capital initiatives, including the capacity actions announced earlier in the year related to our Palm Coast, Reynosa and Portugal facilities, which will begin providing benefits by the end of the year.
2021 is shaping up to be another year of robust earnings and shareholder returns, with pronounced margin increases and substantial free cash flow generation resulting from our outstanding operating performance in a healthy marine market.
Given the enhanced clarity on our ability to drive growth in upcoming periods, we are providing the following updated guidance for full year 2021.
Without including the potential benefits from the Navico acquisition, we anticipate the US marine industry retail unit demand to grow high single-digit percent versus 2020; net sales of between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion; adjusted operating margin growth between 150 and 180 basis points; operating expenses as a percent of sales to remain lower than 2020; free cash flow in excess of $450 million; and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $8.
We're also providing directional guidance regarding the third quarter, where we anticipate revenue growth of mid-teens percent and earnings per share growth of high single-digit percent.
Note that we believe that the Navico transaction, once closed, will be earnings neutral to 2021 as we anticipate Navico's post-closing earnings to offset the incremental interest incurred as a result of the deal.
Next, I'd like to provide some perspective on our 2021 performance against 2020 and 2019 by looking at first half and second half results.
The revenue cadence for 2021 will look more like 2019 and 2018 than it did in 2020.
The first half of every year has additional production days as the second half includes model changeover and holiday shutdowns.
However, first half of 2020 was materially impacted by the COVID-related plant shutdowns.
This resulted in the first half of 2021 comparing very favorably to 2020 in all of our businesses due to higher production volumes, with additional earnings tailwinds from improved absorption, favorable foreign currency comparisons and favorable changes in customer mix in our Propulsion business.
These factors far outweighed the headwinds from supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and higher variable compensation expenses experienced during the first six months of this year.
Our first half performance this year also exceeded 2019 in every metric.
As we head into the second half of 2021, we will face more difficult comps to 2020 as the company recorded record-high earnings per share over the same period last year, and we will continue to be challenged with supply chain constraints and increasing input and freight costs.
Although, we are taking price increases across our businesses, we also anticipate moderated sales mix with propulsion sales trending more toward core OEM customers, more typical seasonality in the P&A business and a higher percentage of overall growth in the Boat business; increased spending on ACEs and other growth initiatives; smaller benefits from currency and absorption; and a higher tariff impact.
However, despite more challenging second half comparisons, this continues to be a growth story.
We anticipate expanding top-line in the second half by double-digit percent versus the second half of 2020, which will be more than 40% greater than 2019 with higher earnings as well.
I will conclude with an update on certain items that will impact our P&L and cash flow for the remainder of the year.
The only meaningful update relates to our effective tax rate for the year.
Due to some fantastic branch restructuring work by our tax team and business units, we now believe our effective tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 22%, which is slightly lower than our estimate from our April call.
Similarly, and putting aside the financing related to the Navico transaction, our capital strategy assumptions have not materially changed.
In the past few weeks, however, we have taken several steps to strengthen our overall liquidity and shareholder return profile.
We extended and expanded our revolving credit agreement, which is now in effect through July of 2026, which now provides for $500 million of borrowing capacity, an increase of $100 million.
In addition, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization earlier this month, and we now have over $400 million approved for repurchases, which we plan to systematically deploy consistent with our capital strategy.
These moves follow our substantial 24% dividend increase approved in April as we continue to balance desired increases in shareholder return and investment in growth initiatives.
We now anticipate spending $270 million to $300 million on capital expenditures in the year to support and in some cases, accelerate growth initiatives throughout our organization.
This slightly increased planned spending is primarily related to the Mercury capacity expansion that Dave discussed earlier.
At our April call, we felt that 2021 was setting up to be an outstanding year for all of our businesses.
And the combination of continued robust retail demand during the first half of the year and solid operational execution by our businesses has us squarely on track to deliver against our operating and strategic priorities.
Our top priority for the Propulsion segment continues to be satisfying outboard engine demand from new and existing OEM customers and expanding market share, especially in dealer, saltwater, repower and international channels.
We are continuing to invest heavily in new product introductions and industry-leading propulsion solutions that we project will enable top line and earnings growth far into the future.
And we've also recently taken the decision to accelerate the introduction of incremental capacity.
Our Parts and Accessories segment remains focused on optimizing its global operating model, to leverage its distribution and position of strength in areas of battery technology, digital systems and connected products in support of our ACES strategy.
We look forward to closing the Navico deal and beginning thoughtful integration into the ASG business.
We will continue to focus M&A activity in parts and Accessories, as we look for opportunities to further build out our technology and systems portfolio.
The Boat segment will build on its first half successes, by continuing to focus on operational excellence, improving operating margins, launching new products, executing capacity expansion plans and refilling pipelines, in the very robust retail environment.
In addition to the Navico and Freedom Boat Club transactions, and the start of shipments of the V-12 600-horsepower outboard, which I've already discussed, proof points in the quarter included, the launch of the My Whaler and Sea Ray+ apps for Apple and Android users, which advances the ACES Connectivity strategy by improving the boat ownership experience, reducing friction across the entire ownership journey.
The initial reception of these products is extremely promising, with more than 2,000 accounts created in the first few weeks and a star rating of 4.9 out of five.
And the launch of the Heyday H22 Wake boat, a new leading-edge, wake-surf model, signaling a doubling down on this fast-growing brand appealing to a younger demographic.
This model is already sold out through mid-2022.
We're tracking well against all our Next Wave strategic goals, including the electrification initiatives outlined in May.
Your hard work has enabled us to seamlessly execute our strategic plan and significantly outpace our initial growth and profit expectations.
","Brunswick Corporation's outstanding performance continued in Q2 2021, driven by strong retail demand and exceptional operational execution. All business segments posted robust growth, with Propulsion gaining market share in outboard engines and Parts & Accessories benefiting from a surge in boating activities. The Boat segment delivered another quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins. Despite supply chain challenges, Brunswick has efficiently managed disruptions and maintained production schedules. The company has increased its 2021 guidance, projecting adjusted operating margin growth of 150-180 basis points, net sales between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $8. Brunswick's favorable demographic trends, including a younger and more diverse boat buyer base, position the company for future growth. The expansion of its product and brand portfolio through the acquisition of Navico further strengthens its ACES strategy. With robust retail demand and strong production plans in place, Brunswick anticipates a positive second half of 2021 and continued growth in the years to come."
ANF_q2_2021.txt,"abercrombie.com, under the Investors section.
A detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
I'm excited to be here today to share our recent results and provide insights into the start of our back-to-school season.
We entered Q2 well positioned to realize ongoing benefits from the work that we had done heading into and during the pandemic.
This included: growing our digital channel, which carries a higher four-wall operating margin in stores; rightsizing our store fleet; expanding our digital and technology teams; adding to our vendor and regional carrier networks; and investing in marketing with an emphasis on digital and social.
Throughout the late spring and summer, our customers took advantage of the warm weather and an increase in social activities.
We were there for all their outfitting needs.
Product acceptance was strong across brands, continuing momentum from the past several quarters.
Once again, we reduced markdowns and promotions, tightly managed inventories, and made strategic investments across marketing, technology and fulfillment to support near- and long-term growth.
Our proven playbook worked and we achieved our best second quarter operating income and operating margin since 2008.
Before I turn to results, just a quick PSA.
As we continue to lap significant impacts from COVID, we will be providing comparisons to both second quarter 2020 and 2019 where applicable.
And due to temporary COVID-driven store closures last year, we do not plan to disclose comparable sales.
Second quarter total sales rose 24% to last year and we were up 3% compared to Q2 2019.
Our largest market, the US, led with sales up 31% on a one-year and 11% on a two-year basis.
Results speak to customer retention and spend and to new customers discovering our brands.
By channel, total global store sales rose 55% from last year and we're down 20% from 2019.
I'm very proud of our stores performance, which was achieved despite permanent closures as well as ongoing restrictions in EMEA.
As a reminder, during fiscal 2020, we proactively closed 137 locations, removing 1.1 million under productive gross square feet from our store base.
We continue to execute against our number one transformation initiative, Global Store Network Optimization, to further align with our customers' shifting shopping behaviors.
Even with aggressive store sales growth, digital did not skip a beat and remained a solid as stores reopened.
Digital sales held steady to 2020 levels and grew 52% from 2019.
Results are further proof of our ongoing evolution into a digital-first global omnichannel retailer and should yield sustainable operating margin benefits.
Our total sales growth has been healthy as evidenced by our significant gross margin expansion.
For the quarter, we achieved our best Q2 gross margin rate since 2009.
Our total Company gross margin rate increased 450 basis points on a one-year and 590 basis points on a two-year basis.
We reduced the depth and breadth of promotions compared to last quarter and last year.
While customer reaction to products has continued to be strong, we have not and will not step away from our inventory discipline.
This is one of the key COVID learnings we will continue to apply going forward.
Reflecting our strong top line and gross margin performance, combined with ongoing tight expense controls, our operating margin rate was over 1,100 basis points compared to last year and 1,800 basis points compared to Q2 2019.
Though we benefited from a good consumer environment, especially in the US, our results also reflect the body of work done by our global teams to dramatically improve our product, voice and experience.
Since I became CEO in 2017, our brands have evolved with our customers and we have focused on being there and supporting them for all their lifestyle needs.
Speaking of those lifestyle needs, let's take a moment to talk about some major fashion wins that applied companywide.
Many have asked me about the current denim cycle.
There is a ton of newness and interest in jeans and it has been great for our brands, especially as it is one of our top three categories on an annual basis and even more important in the back half of the year.
Our teams have done an absolutely amazing job staying on top of current denim trends.
We are viewed as a premier denim destination with newer styles representing over 40% of our jeans volume, up from 25% last year, and our customer is not waiting for sales to get what they want.
In the second quarter, we reduced promotions within this category well below 2020 and 2019 level.
We have [Phonetic] high-rise, wider legs, including mom, dad, straight and flare; skinny is still there, although becoming a smaller part of the total; and there are new and upcoming trends like '90s inspired low-rise; something for everyone.
And lengths are changing too.
Following years of angle, we are starting to see interest in full.
We're encouraged that these changes are not limited to one gender.
Customers are also responding to the wider leg openings in men, which represents another significant opportunity as it's been a long time since we've updated his silhouette.
Of course, our customer needs tops to go with their new jeans.
In Women's, we continue to see customers gravitate to swim and crop tops and oversize and bodysuits, which further reinforces the proportion play in bottoms.
Dresses, skirts, shorts and swim were also popular.
As product acceptance is built, our teams have been meeting our customers where they are in the digital landscape.
We are firmly committed to our test and learn strategy and to new and emerging technology trends and engage in opportunities.
It was certainly a busy and exciting quarter for both technology and engagement and I want to take a moment to discuss some of the highlights.
We introduced an evolved Gilly Hicks brand purpose and positioning; we launched our newest brand Social Tourist; we accelerated investments in testing across influencer, paid media and digital, reaching both core and new audiences; and we hired a Chief Digital and Technology Officer to further evolve and accelerate our digital-first model.
Starting with Gilly Hicks.
On July 15th, we took a huge leap forward in our growth strategy by relaunching the brand globally with an evolved purpose and position to bring our customer to their happy place.
Given our Gen-Z customer is most stress generation, the updated purpose is very important.
In addition, we opened our first stand-alone store Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio, and introduced updated side-by-side with an Hollister store experiences.
This included 20 refreshes to existing side-by-side formats in three new locations, all of which incorporate elements from the stand-alone store.
Well, what can I say, what an absolutely phenomenal moment for the Gilly team, we are truly feeling the love.
Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and the brand is resonating with our Gen Z customer and their mindset.
Early results from the brand relaunch and the new store concept have been very encouraging.
Taking a step back, our customers already responding well to the product and the brand, which gave us confidence to make the necessary investments to accelerate this exciting growth vehicle.
In the second quarter, sales rose approximately 30% year-over-year, with growth across digital and store channels.
This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit total sales gains.
Loungelette match backs, sleep, underwear and our active collection Gilly Go continue to resonate with our customer.
Post-launch, our guys [Phonetic] product and matching collections also been well received.
Turning to Social Tourist.
It's hard to believe it's only been three months since we've taken Hollister's successful partnership with TikTok superstars Dixie and Charli D'Amelio, who combined have over 270 million followers across social platforms to the next level with the launch of our fifth brand.
Social Tourist is a great example of how we are approaching our business differently.
Meeting our customer where they are and pushing boundaries of social commerce in new and exciting ways.
Since the launch, the brand has had over 700 million impressions and views, and we continue to build awareness.
For the first collection, we had several Instagram exclusive pieces.
And for the second, we hosted a live TikTok fashion show, featuring the D'Amelios and other social stars, which would be TikTok benchmarks.
With Social Tourist, we have learned so much in a short period of time that up and coming fashion trends, social commerce and the growth of the TikTock platform.
We are optimistic about Social Tourist and its future and have several more exciting events happening throughout the remainder of the year.
Now onto our remaining brands.
Starting with our largest brand, Hollister, which includes Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist, sales rose 20% in the quarter and we achieved our highest Q2 sales in Company history, congrats to the entire Hollister team.
Our focus on voice and experience clearly complements our product, helping to drive higher average transaction values on strong average unit retail growth.
From a marketing perspective, we launched the Hollister Creator Collective, a year long influencer program.
In July, we sponsored the Lago Vista Snapchat series, featuring 21 non-skippable Hollister commercials.
We rounded out our efforts to the new monthly Instagram Live Shopping series with influencers.
Hollister site and app also got a refresh during the quarter, further improving the customer experience.
Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist now have dedicated tab, allowing users to shop between all three brands with a shared checkout.
In addition, Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist launched their own unique app and we also update our membership loyalty program.
So, the customers can earn points, redeem rewards across all three brands.
As we look to the remainder of the back-to-school season, we are focused on continuing to win in jeans.
We have sterling pop-ups in key markets where we have been engaging with local teams and ceding product and thus far has been highly successful.
We will also have influencers and affiliates in the US and EMEA, amplify denim across Instagram and TikTok.
At Abercrombie Adults, our influencer, affiliate and editorial programs remain one of our top priorities.
In the second quarter, we grew associated sales by over 70% year-over-year and increased our already sizable network of digital brand advocates.
We also launched a Capital series with top affiliate creators and took part in Facebook's Live Shopping alpha test, which had fantastic engagement and insights.
During the quarter, we continued to leverage TikTok content.
On a year-over-year basis, we doubled our new-to-file visits, grew new-to-file orders and sales by over 80%, and continued to break TikTok's benchmarks for paid media.
I can't wait to see what the future holds on this important platform.
After all, according to POPSUGAR, Abercrombie is TikTok's favorite fashion brand, and we are proud to hold that title.
All the hard work connecting to our customers certainly paid-off.
On our last earnings call, I said Abercrombie Women's had a breakout moment.
During the second quarter, that momentum built with women's achieving its best Q2 sales since 2012.
In total, Abercrombie, which includes kids, grew sales 30% in the quarter.
Similar to Hollister, Abercrombie registered higher average transaction values and strong average unit retail growth.
Heading into fall, our team is energized.
We recently launched our Denim Your Way campaign, which features Abercrombie customers from Instagram casting call.
We also collaborated with wedding and events experts, The Knot, on a best dress guest collection.
In addition, we teamed up with Zappos as our exclusive domestic third party e-commerce provider for a limited selection of jeans and tops and a footwear collaboration.
At Abercrombie kids, if report cards were given out during summer, I would say, they received an A. We were highly focused on driving customer acquisition through expansion to new platforms and releasing new products and content franchises.
The Ultimate Summer Outfit campaign contributed to sales growth in shorts and swim, which are two important seasonal categories, while the release of the Cool Stuff collection and the launch of our active assortment both had over 70% new-to-file shop rates and average order values that were over 70% above our goal.
A common theme across the Company has been our focus on digital, which is critical for future growth.
As we continue our transformation into a digitally led operating model, we have made investments in technology and talent.
In the second quarter, the US benefited from government stimulus and reopening, as customers resumed many of their activities.
Internationally, the reopening in many countries, including our largest market the UK, lagged the US, reflecting ongoing COVID-related restrictions.
As we think about Q3, while global uncertainties remain, we are cautiously optimistic.
We've been pleased with the US back-to-school season to date, and believe our customers highly engaged and actively looking to refresh their wardrobe.
We are expecting to see an elongated season as many of our larger markets have yet to return.
In EMEA, the environment is improving and we have yet to start the back-to-school season.
Looking ahead, we will continue to execute our proven playbooks.
We will focus on controlling what we can control and remain on offense.
We are proactively managing through industrywide issues around inflation, production and transportation delays.
With our solid foundation and strong balance sheet, as well as our long-standing relationships with our global vendor and supply chain partners, we are well positioned to be winners in the back half and expect to surpass our previously stated 5.8% operating margin goal this year.
As Fran mentioned, we will be providing comparisons to both second quarter 2020 and 2019 where applicable, and will not be disclosing comparable sales.
Turning to our results, in the second quarter, we delivered total net sales of $865 million, up 24% to last year.
On a two-year basis, sales were up 3%.
We ended the quarter with all of our 733 stores open.
This compares to 92% of our base open at the end of the first quarter.
As of yesterday, all stores remain open.
Store sales rose 55% on a one-year basis and were down 20% on a two-year basis.
We recouped a significant amount of lost sales due to COVID-driven store closures last year.
At the same time, total digital sales dollars remained steady compared to last year and grew 52% to Q2 2019, representing 44% of total sales this quarter.
By brand, net sales increased 20% for Hollister, which includes Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist, and 30% for Abercrombie, which includes kids.
As compared to Q2 2019, net sales increased 2% for Hollister and 4% for Abercrombie.
By region, net sales in the US were up 31% and 11% on a one- and two-year basis, respectively, despite having roughly 129 fewer stores and over 22% less square footage in our US store base as compared to Q2 2019.
In EMEA, sales rose 11% on a one-year basis, but were down 5% on a two-year basis.
Customers responded well to localized product, voice and experience, which allowed us to reduce promotions in region.
We were pleased with results in light of permanent store closures and ongoing COVID-related restrictions.
Since Q2 2019, we have closed 17 stores, including eight flagships, as we continue to reposition to a smaller and wider store network focused on local customers.
During the quarter, the region as a whole remained influx as we experienced intermittent temporary closures and reduced operating hours.
As a reminder, in region, our penetration is highest in the UK, while Germany and France are also meaningful.
In APAC, sales were down 1% to last year and down 39% to Q2 2019.
We experienced continued traffic challenges in the region.
In our largest market, China, we are encouraged by customer response to new products, including APAC exclusive collections.
On Tmall, we saw stabilized sales trend and improved profitability, as we continued to reduce promotional activity.
Globally, we continue to see lower store traffic levels relative to Q2 2019, but sequential improvements of Q1.
From an omnichannel perspective, we were pleased with year-over-year improvements in conversion and average transaction values.
Moving on to gross profits.
Our rate of 65.2% was up 450 basis points to last year and 590 basis points to Q2 2019, driven by higher AUR across brands on reduced promotions and markdowns, partially offset by higher AUC, reflecting increased transportation costs.
Inventories control and current ending the quarter down 8% to last year.
Reflecting well documented industry-related challenges, we did see delivery delays increase over the quarter as global shipping congestion continued, and there were renewed COVID restrictions across several of our production countries.
We are managing through delays of one to three weeks on average, by pulling forward deliveries, employing fabric platforming and leveraging air deliveries as necessary.
Also we are working through an extended closure of factories in Southern Vietnam, which have been further delayed, and are now expected to open in the first week of September at the earliest.
We have and will continue to leverage our strong vendor partnerships in a similar playbook already used in other countries to ensure we get product as quickly as possible upon reopening.
I'll cover the rest of our Q2 results in an adjusted non-GAAP basis.
Excluded from our non-GAAP results are approximately $800,000 and $8 million of pre-tax asset impairment charges for this year and last year, respectively.
Operating expense excluding other operating income was up 11% compared to last year, while operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 52% from 57.8%.
In Q2, we saw an increase in stores distribution expense of 5% compared to 2020, and a reduction of 13% compared to 2019.
Compared to 2019, store occupancy was down approximately $50 million related to square footage reductions and renegotiated leases and included approximately $9 million of benefits associated with rent abatements and a flagship lease-related item.
These savings were partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment expenses.
Marketing, general and administrative expense rose 27% from last year and 7% compared to 2019, primarily driven by increased marketing spend and higher performance-based compensation expense.
We delivered operating income of $116 million compared to operating income of $22 million last year.
As Fran noted, this was our best second quarter operating income and operating margin since 2008.
The effective tax rate was approximately negative 6%.
In the quarter, we released approximately $30 million of previously established valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, primarily in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands.
Additionally, the quarter reflected a discrete benefit of approximately $4 million for UK rate change enacted in the quarter, which increased the value of deferred taxes in the UK.
Net income per diluted share on adjusted non-GAAP basis was $1.70 compared to $0.23 last year.
The current quarter includes the benefit of approximately $0.53 related to the tax items mentioned.
Our strong financial position continues to enable us to both invest in the business and return excess cash to shareholders.
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $922 million and total liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.4 million shares for $100 million, bringing the year-to-date total share repurchases to about 3.5 million shares and $135 million.
At the end of Q2, we had approximately 6.5 million shares remaining under our previously authorized share repurchase program.
In addition, we spent $47 million to purchase $42 million at par value of our senior secured notes on the open market, as a way to deleverage the balance sheet and deploy excess cash.
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on returning excess cash to shareholders, primarily through share repurchases, pending market conditions, share price and our ability to accelerate investments.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect fiscal 2021 capex to be approximately $100 million, with about half of that related to digital and technology and the other half related to real estate and maintenance items.
During the quarter, we opened 14 new stores, bringing the total to 18 for the year-to-date period and closed 12 for a total of 20 year-to-date.
In the back half, we expect to open roughly 20 stores, bringing the total for the year to approximately 40.
This year, we have about 240 leases up for renewal.
We look forward to having thoughtful conversations with our landlord partners to find stores that are the right size in the right location at the right economics.
I'll finish up with how we are planning the remainder of the year.
We will stay on offense and leverage a portion of our structural cost savings to support top-line growth, including investments in marketing across brands, the digital experience and growing Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist.
Reflecting ongoing global uncertainty, we will continue to maintain inventory discipline as we managed through supply chain disruptions and the cost and delays associated with it, as well as read reenact the operating environment in each market around the world.
Recently, we have been encouraged by back-to-school results in the US, where we expect to see an extended back-to-school season.
We are excited for some of our largest school districts, including New York to return in the weeks to come.
For the third quarter, we are planning as follows, using 2019 as our comparison period.
Net sales to be up 2% to 4% from 2019 level of approximately $863 million.
We expect the US to continue to outperform EMEA and APAC.
At this point, our plan assumes a modest impact on sales due to supply chain constraints, with the larger impact coming from cost inflation, which I'll cover momentarily.
We will work to manage through disruption using all available tools in our toolkit, including airing inventory and shifting production as necessary, and if possible.
Gross profit rate to be up at least 300 basis points to 2019 level of 60.1%, including an expected negative impact of approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points of freight cost pressure.
We remain cautiously optimistic in our ability to drive AUR improvements through lower promotions and clearance activity to offset this headwind.
Operating expense excluding other operating income to be up low-single digits to 2019 adjusted non-GAAP level of $494 million.
Lower store expenses will be partially offset by higher fulfillment costs.
We also plan to increase marketing spend compared to 2019 as we look to further drive momentum in social and digital media across brands.
We expect to see benefits from this marketing throughout the back half and into 2022.
And the tax rate to be in the low-20%.
Net sales to be up low to mid single digits to 2019 level of $3.6 billion.
Gross profit rate to be up around 300 basis points to 2019 level of 59.4%.
Operating expense excluding other operating income to be down 3% to 4% to 2019 adjusted non-GAAP level of $2.07 billion.
Assuming we deliver against these expectations, we would expect operating margin at or above 9% for the full year, which is well above our 2018 Investor Day target of 5.8%.
We are excited about the significant progress we have made on our operating model and cost structure.
While plenty of hard work remains, we are optimistic about our future and will provide additional detail on our 2022 assumptions on our year end earnings call.
","In Q2, abercrombie and fitch reported strong results, exceeding revenue expectations with a 24% increase in sales to $865 million compared to last year. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.70, highlighting the company's operational efficiency. Notably, digital sales remained steady, contributing 44% of total sales. The denim category witnessed a significant surge, with new styles driving sales and reducing the need for promotions. The company is optimistic about the ongoing back-to-school season in the US, expecting it to extend due to delayed reopenings in international markets. Despite industry-wide supply chain disruptions and cost pressures, abercrombie and fitch expects to exceed its previously stated 5.8% operating margin goal for the year. The company remains committed to investing in growth initiatives, including marketing, digital experiences, and the expansion of its Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist brands."
MSI_q2_2021.txt,"Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.
I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through the results and our outlook.
First, Q2 was an outstanding quarter.
We grew revenue 22%, earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year.
Additionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog, up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2.
Second, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter.
In Products and Systems Integration, revenue was up 24% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies.
And in Software and Services, revenue was up 19%, and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.
This strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission-critical integrated ecosystem.
And finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.
Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion, up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX.
The GAAP operating earnings were $370 million, and operating margins were 18.8% of sales compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $482 million, up $123 million or 34% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.4% of sales, up from 22.2% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, inclusive also of higher costs related to employee incentive compensation this year.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $0.78 in the year ago quarter.
This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume, improved operating leverage, a lower tax rate related to the release of valuation allowance and lower reorganization charges in the current quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 compared to $1.39 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments.
opex in Q2 was $477 million, up $51 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow.
Q2 operating cash flow was $388 million compared with $209 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $326 million compared with $155 million in the prior year.
These increases in cash flows were primarily due to higher sales and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
Capital allocation for Q2 included $121 million in cash dividends, $102 million in share repurchases at an average price of $206.85 per share and $62 million of CapEx.
Additionally, during the quarter, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt and redeemed $324 million of outstanding senior notes due in 2023.
Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, and we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolve, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution.
Moving to our segment results.
Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million.
Operating earnings were $194 million or 16.2% of sales, up from 13.5% in the prior year on higher sales and improved operating leverage, inclusive of higher costs related to incentive compensation.
Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include a $37 million P25 order for the Kentucky State Police, a $36 million P25 upgrade for a state in the US, a $30 million P25 order from MARTA in Atlanta, a $29 million P25 devices order for a large US state and local customer, and a $5 million video security order, our largest single fixed video order from a US federal customer to date.
Moving to the Software and Services segment.
Q2 revenue was $773 million, up 19% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $9 million.
Operating earnings were $288 million or 37.2% of sales, up 210 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, improved operating leverage and also inclusive of higher compensation related incentives this year.
Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include, an $18 million French MOI body-worn camera frame agreement, a $15 million license plate recognition software extension with US based customer, a $10 million P25 multiyear services extension for Ohio's statewide network, and a $10 million P25 maintenance renewal with the US federal customer.
Additionally, we launched Command Central Suite, Public Safety's, first cloud-native 911 case-call to case closure solution.
Looking at our regional results, North America Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software.
International Q2 revenue was $659 million, up 25%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software.
We saw strong growth in EMEA during the quarter, while in Asia Pac growth was minimal as the region continues to navigate impacts from COVID-19.
Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $11.2 billion, up $741 million compared to last year, driven by $660 million of growth in North America and $81 million of growth internationally.
Sequentially, backlog was down $57 million, driven by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN, partially offset with growth in LMR products.
Software and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multiyear service contracts.
And sequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven again primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.
Products backlog was up $484 million compared to last year and $73 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning to our outlook.
We expect Q3 sales to be approximately up 10% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.09 and $2.14 per share.
This assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24% a year.
And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9%, and we now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share.
This increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.
I thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call.
First, our results for the quarter were excellent.
We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well.
Additionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the continued supply chain challenges that we're navigating primarily in LMR. Second, in video security, demand remains strong.
We've continued investing in this area even during the early days of the pandemic, and these investments have positioned us well to capture the increased demand we're now seeing from our customers.
Additionally, we just announced our acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud based access control solutions.
Openpath is disrupting the access control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market.
As a result, we're also renaming the technology within our revenue desegregation from video security and analytics to now video security and access control to reflect these investments and the future of video and access control convergence.
And finally, as I look to the second half of the year, I'm encouraged.
I'm encouraged by our execution across all of the businesses.
In LMR, customers are looking to invest in their networks, including several statewide upgrades and we're gaining traction with our APX NEXT device designed for the highest tier of public safety requirements.
In video security and command center software, we're leveraging our large installed base and go-to-market footprint to drive continued strong growth.
And with respect to ESG, we've recently released our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which highlights our strategy and performance.
Our work in this critically important area has been recognized by Forbes who named us as one of the best employers for diversity and Barron's who named us as one of the most sustainable companies.
I'm proud of what our teams are doing and look forward to further progress as we continue to deliver mission-critical solutions that create value for employees, customers, communities and our shareholders.
Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible.
Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?
","Motorola Solutions reported a strong Q2 with outstanding revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth. Revenue surged 22% to $2 billion, driven by strong demand for LMR and video security technologies in both the Products and Systems Integration (up 24%) and Software and Services (up 19%) segments. Operating margins expanded significantly by 220 basis points overall, with both segments experiencing notable improvements. The company expanded its backlog to a record Q2 level of $11.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Due to strong demand and momentum, Motorola Solutions raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings per share. The company also invested in the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions, expanding its video security capabilities. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, Motorola Solutions expressed optimism for the second half of the year, citing continued execution across its businesses and growing demand for mission-critical solutions."
CIM_q2_2020.txt,"Before we begin, I'd like to review the safe harbor statement.
During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
Additionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call.
We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information.
I will now turn the conference over to our president and chief executive officer, Matthew Lambiase.
I'll make some brief comments, then Mohit will discuss the changes in the portfolio and Rob will then review our financial results.
I believe the first six months of 2020 will go down in the financial history books as one of the most volatile periods in modern times.
The U.S. economy went from excellent to dismal in the span of just a few months and the financial markets, especially fixed income, experienced record volatility and record intervention from the government.
In our space, many levered investors were caught off guard by the swiftly falling asset price, and they were forced to sell at the low point of the market.
Fortunately, Chimera was able to navigate through this difficult period by executing transactions which enabled us to retain our high-yielding and unique mortgage credit portfolio.
It's important to understand that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to recreate our portfolio in the current low interest rate environment and its retention affords Chimera the ability to pay a meaningful dividend, which we would not have if the assets had been sold.
In the quarter, we took several actions that helped us augment our liquidity.
We issued a $374 million three-year convertible bond, we entered into a $400 million three-year revolving loan facility arranged by Ares Capital and we executed three new mortgage securitizations, totaling over $1 billion, which significantly reduced our loan warehouse exposure and helped reopen the mortgage securitization market, which is a primary source for Chimera's long-term financing.
Additionally, during the period, we negotiated longer-term and non-mark-to -- longer-term and non-mark-to-market repo finance facilities for our mortgage loans and credit-related assets.
We now have approximately 75% of our credit borrowings on longer-term facilities and over 50% of them have no mark-to-market or limited mark-to-market arrangements.
While these actions have had the short-term effect of increasing financing costs, we believe the benefits over the long-term are significant.
We've strengthened our balance sheet, enabling us to further withstand additional market volatility, continue to produce attractive spread income and to make new investments when we see attractive asset opportunities.
This position is enviable, given the uncertain economic conditions and the low return environment that we're currently operating within.
The Federal Reserve has stated that they expect to keep the Fed funds rate zero bound for the next two years and that they will continue to buy large quantities of assets to support the financial markets and the U.S. economy.
We are present -- presently witnessing the effects of these actions.
The 10-year treasury yield is now roughly 55 basis points and a rate on a new 30-year mortgage dipped below 3% for the first time in history.
Current market expectations are that we'll be in this low rate environment for several years to come, and that the returns on all financial assets will be also low into the future.
While the Federal Reserve's asset purchases have not been directly focused on residential mortgage credit, their purchases have started solidifying the markets and senior mortgage bonds have witnessed significant price appreciation.
We would expect that over time, deeper credit subordinate residential bonds could see similar moves.
Chimera's portfolio of higher-yielding legacy assets should become ever more valuable as the Fed continues to buy assets and returns in the market become ever more scarce.
Residential mortgage credit, due to the size of the market and the slow recovery of pricing, offered some of the best opportunities in the fixed income market.
The economics for loan securitization continues to be attractive as the credit curve remains steep.
Senior front-end bonds are well bid, creating an opportunity to securitize loans and retain higher-yielding, back-end subordinate investments.
These subordinated bonds have high relative yield and the potential for meaningful appreciation should markets normalize.
We have executed three securitizations in the period and retained the subordinate tranches from those deals.
Looking forward, we believe that there will be ample supply of loans for sale from the GSEs and banks, and this supply will create opportunities for us to make new investments for our portfolio.
Given the current low yield and low return environment, we think being able to create investments through securitization will allow us to continue to produce attractive results in this challenging market.
While this has been a very difficult period to navigate through, we believe Chimera is well-positioned for the future.
We have materially reduced our exposure to mark-to-market risk on our repo financings, which should help us manage through bouts of volatility in the future.
We have been able to retain our legacy portfolio of assets, which will allow us to continue to produce meaningful dividends for our investors in what may be an extended period of low interest rates.
The retained portfolio also has the potential for book value appreciation if pricing returns to historical levels.
And finally, we believe there are attractive opportunities currently available in the residential loan market and we have a team and a history of being able to use securitization to successfully create high-yielding investments for our portfolio.
As a result of unprecedented monetary and fiscal support provided by the government, the second quarter saw a material improvement in both the equity and fixed income markets.
Parts of the equity markets are flat to up year-to-date while treasury rates were stable in Q2.
With rates stable and the Fed rhetoric for a lower rate for the foreseeable future, volatility has subsided.
The crowding out effect created by the Fed's market intervention has been positive for all highly rated fixed income securities.
The Federal Reserve was mostly focused on agency securities and did not purchase residential mortgage credit.
The shortage of legacy credit assets available, after a slow start in April, new issue securitization volumes were brisk in the second quarter.
Senior tranches of securitized residential product improved steadily with the strongest performance in the latter half of the second quarter.
During the quarter, we focused on the liability side of our balance sheet and entered into three non-mark-to-market facilities to finance $2 billion of our non-agency portfolio.
In addition, we have limited mark-to-market on $611 million of non-agency securities.
As a result of these transactions, approximately 54% of our non-agency borrowings are not subject to full mark-to-market risk.
As of quarter end, the weighted average term to maturity has increased to 698 days from 223 days in the first quarter.
To reduce the risk on our warehouse lines, we completed three securitizations, totaling approximately $1.1 billion in seasoned, reperforming mortgage loans.
Moving loans from warehouse to securitization is an important aspect of our portfolio strategy as it reduces the mark-to-market risk and improves risk metrics for the company.
After the completion of this quarter's securitization, our residential mortgage loan warehouse stands at $263 million and is financed for one year without mark-to-market risk.
CIM 2020-R3 issued in May had $438 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 5.28% and a weighted average loan age of 150 months.
The average loan size in the R3 securitization was $127,000 and the average FICO was 651 with an average LTV of 80%.
We sold $329 million senior securities with a 4.2% cost of debt.
Chimera retained a May 2022 calendar call option for the R3 securitization.
CIM 2020-R4 had $276 million underlying loans, with a weighted average coupon of 4.78% with a weighted average loan age of 168 months.
The average loan size in the R4 was $127,000.
The average FICO was 598 with an average LTV of 75%.
We sold $207 million senior securities with a 3.2% cost of debt.
Chimera retained a June 2022 calendar call option on the R4 securitization.
In early July, Chimera completed a second rate of securitization of the year.
We issued CIM 2020-R5 with $338 million underlying loans with an average coupon of 4.98%.
The R5 securitization had a weighted average loan age of 149 months and an average loan size of $152,000.
The loans had a weighted average FICO of 678 with an average LTV of 70%.
We sold $257 million of investment-grade securities with a 2.05% cost of debt, more than 200 basis points tighter than our early May deal.
And in late July, we issued $362 million CIM 2020-J1, our first jumbo securitization of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with the current investment portfolio and its long-term prospects.
We were able to navigate through this difficult period by executing transactions, which enables us to retain our high-yielding and unique mortgage credit portfolio.
Strong credit performance, strength of institutional buying, and the tightening of new issue credit spreads were all positive components of Chimera's long-term securitization strategy.
We have 13 existing CIM securitization totaling $7.5 billion available for call and refinancing over the next 12 months.
This provides an additional avenue for portfolio performance and complements potential new investment opportunities.
We are continually monitoring our outstanding securitization for the best timing and the opportunity to execute our call optimization strategy and maximize long-term portfolio performance for our shareholders.
Our Agency CMBS continue to provide attractive spread income and liquidity for the portfolio while providing superior call protection relative to residential agency pass-throughs in this low rate environment.
Lastly, the reduction in mark-to-market achieved this quarter leaves us with plenty of dry powder to make new credit investments.
I'll review Chimera's financial highlights for the second quarter.
GAAP book value at the end of the second quarter was $10.63 per share.
Our GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $73 million or $0.37 per share.
On a core basis, net income for the second quarter was $76 million or $0.32 per share.
Our economic net interest income for the second quarter was $121 million.
For the second quarter, our yield on interest-earning assets was 5.7%, our average cost of funds was 3.3%, and our net interest spread was 2.4%.
Total leverage for the second quarter was 4.3:1 while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 1.8:1.
Expenses for the second quarter, excluding servicing fees and transaction expenses were $17 million, down from last quarter, primarily related to lower compensation expenses.
We currently have approximately $850 million in cash and unencumbered assets.
This is after we've paid both our preferred and common dividends in full.
We continue to monitor liquidity closely and look for attractive financing options to support our portfolio.
","Chimera Investment Corporation navigated the volatile first half of 2020 by retaining its high-yielding mortgage credit portfolio and executing strategic transactions. The company has materially reduced its mark-to-market risk through non-mark-to-market repo finance facilities and long-term loan securitizations. Chimera's legacy portfolio and the current low interest rate environment provide opportunities for continued spread income and dividend payments. The company successfully executed three securitizations totaling over $1 billion, retaining subordinate tranches with attractive yields and potential for appreciation. Chimera sees ample supply of loans for sale from GSEs and banks, creating investment opportunities. The company's financial highlights include a core earnings per share of $0.32 in Q2, a GAAP loss per share of $0.37, and a book value per common share of $10.63. Chimera's strong balance sheet, favorable financing terms, and available cash position it for growth in the challenging market conditions."
WWE_q4_2020.txt,"Leading today's discussion are Vince McMahon, WWE's Chairman and CEO; Nick Khan, WWE's President and Chief Revenue Officer; Stephanie McMahon, WWE's Chief Brand Officer; and Kristina Salen, WWE's Chief Financial Officer.
Their remarks will be followed by a Q&A session.
Actual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them.
Additionally, the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP financial measures.
As you can see we're generating some pretty strong financial results in a very challenging environment.
We continue to produce content, we never missed a week in terms of producing content.
It shows the flexibility and our commitment to our audience, which we will always have.
We transitioned our flagship programs through our training facility.
And then of course, to the Amway Center and then continued on to to what -- to something we called the ThunderDome was a great name, any event, it's a -- most of you have seen it.
And there's nothing like it on television allows us to have live fans.
They're just not in seats.
And some of the other things I do want to mention.
Certainly, we -- our multi-year agreement with NBC U is on the big box service.
To my knowledge, I don't think there's any really big deal that's been announced ever since the COVID stuff began.
I really think that's pretty extraordinary on their part, and definitely on our part as well.
And again, we just -- this agreement is really awesome for our WWE fans, our W Universe, as we call it, it's just gives them more -- more value, not just the WWE 999, which is a great value for what we do.
But then again, they for less money, they pick up our, our network, as well as all sorts of entertainment.
So it's great for our fans.
I think that Nick and Stephanie and Kristina are going to provide a little more perspective on this development.
Looking ahead to 2021.
Now, we expect to continue to manage the challenges of the COVID environment, and it continues on.
We no doubt will expect a gradual return to ticketed audiences.
And that is something that, sure, OK, we have live events, but live events make any money, you're going to get 20% capacity, 30%, 50%, whereas you breakeven, and so best to be determined by anyone who's in the live event business and hardly anyone has a handle on exactly when that's going to happen.
Nonetheless, we are ready.
We are the most flexible, adaptable media company in the world.
We can turn something around as far as a live event in six weeks.
And it just speaks to our ability to innovate as a media company and continue to, in this current environment, create long term value.
So that's generally pretty much where we are.
And, Nick, take it away.
A week and a half ago, we made what we believe was a big announcement regarding WWE and Peacock.
Starting on March 18, the entire WWE Network and its content will shift to Peacock in the United States.
This includes WrestleMania, our vast library and all of our pay-per-view events, starting with Fastlane on March 21.
As part of this partnership, WWE will maintain access to valuable audience data.
As we all know, Peacock is free to Comcast, Xfinity and Cox Cable customers.
So watching Fastlane and subsequently WrestleMania on April 10 and 11th will be free to all of those consumers.
Additionally, WWE Network will be available for $4.99 a month on the ad supported Peacock tier, which is half the price that Vince just mentioned, of $9.99 a month.
The price we have been charging for WWE Network in the United States and will continue to be no upcharge of any kind, for any of our events.
499 price is the all in price for our great library and pay per view in ring action.
In addition to the office Saturday Night Live, Modern Family to dick wolf franchises, the English Premier League and the Olympic Games.
I believe the last time we all spoke in October; we collectively discussed how the recent org structure changes at NBC, you and Disney are indicative of the fact that streaming had become a top priority for both companies.
Many months in advance of those org structure changes, we started to engage in deep conversations with multiple buyers in the marketplace about a potential deal.
Ultimately, we felt like the partnership with Peacock was the right move at the right time for our fans and shareholders.
It was Vince McMahon and WWE who were the first movers from closed circuit to pay per view.
It was Vince and WWE that were the first movers out of pay per view and into the SVOD world in 2014.
And WWE is now again the first mover from a stand-alone SVOD for partnering with a media conglomerate that has tremendous assets, reach and promotional power.
With the Peacock deal closed domestically, our focus now shifts to international markets.
In addition to distributing our great domestic content internationally, our focus is to also develop content that is specifically targeted to fans in certain international territories.
Two examples of this I'd like to discuss here today.
We recently produced a two hour in ring special with our partner in India, Sony, which featured our developing Indian Superstars.
The event, which premiered across Sony's platforms on India's Republic Day was available on Sony TEN one, Sony TEN three and Sony MAX, which have a combined reach of 50 million households, as well as on Sony's streaming platform SonyLIV.
The event took place at the WWE ThunderDome to an all Indian virtual audience.
It was announced in Hindi and English, and incorporated stunning and contemporary elements of Indian culture.
The international music sensation known as Spinning Canvas, executed an amazing performance in honor of India's national holiday.
We await for live plus seven numbers, which will obviously substantially add to the total viewership number.
We believe this event will further grow our product in India, which is already a robust WWE market and demonstrates our commitment to our partner, Sony, and our WWE fans in India.
This event is a credit to Vince, Paul Levesque, otherwise known as Triple H and the entire creative and production team who put together this event during a pandemic, while also producing three to four other live in-ring shows a week.
You can look forward to more from us in India along these lines.
The second area of our international focus is Latin America and localizing content tailored toward that region.
A key part of our strategy is bringing in authentic talent who resonate with particular international markets.
You may have seen or read that on the Royal Rumble pay-per-view this past Sunday, Puerto Rican Superstar Bad Bunny performed his new hit single Booker T, which is based on our WWE Hall of Fame Superstar of the same name.
An internationally acclaimed recording artist, Bad Bunny's songs were streamed on Spotify more than 8.3 billion times in 2020, helping to make him the most streamed artist in the world that year.
Then low and behold, at the instigation of one of WWE's up and coming Puerto Rican stars, Damian Priest, Bunny got physically involved later in the night, setting the stage for future storylines.
As of this past Wednesday, this collaboration has led to over 35 million total video views and 2.5 million engagements across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Total media impressions to date are nearly 170 million, and it was reported on by the top sports and entertainment properties ranging from ESPN to Rolling Stone to Telemundo to TMZ.
And within 24 hours, the co-branded Bad Bunny WWE merchandise became the hottest selling drop we've had on record on our e-commerce platform, WWE Shop.
An idea which was born simply from seeing the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine last October, has evolved into one of the most engaging pop culture collaborations in our history, with a targeted focus on the Latinx community.
Look for more of us in the -- look for more of this, excuse me, in the LATAM region.
In addition to our work in India and LATAM, we also closed new international deals with IV Media in Korea and Foxtel in Australia.
And in China, we expanded our broadcast footprint, which already included iQiyi, Yoku and PP Sports by launching Raw on Tencent Video.
Let's also discuss some out of the ring opportunities and deals we are excited about as we continue to expand WWE's brand Beyond The Ring.
In terms of original programming from our WWE Studio, we continue to develop our slate.
As you may know, WWE used to finance productions.
We stopped doing that a few years ago.
Instead, we're licensing content, both scripted and unscripted, to buyers in the marketplace.
We are pleased at how quickly our portfolio has continued to grow.
A few new developments include a multi episode unscripted series order created by and voiced by John Cena, which will be produced with WWE Studios.
Additionally, we have closed the deal for WWE Studios to join the NBC show Young Rock, a long time, long time WWE family member, Dwayne Johnson, and my actual family member, my sister, Nahnatchka Khan.
The show premieres on Tuesday, February 16, on NBC.
And finally, as you may be aware, we sent championship title belts to many of the major sports lead teams who have won championships.
And in some cases, our title belts are more popular than their own trophy.
You may have seen Lebron James hold up a WWE championship title belt after winning the NBA title.
The Golden State Warriors have done the same as well as the Los Angeles Dodgers and many other teams.
This led us to close a deal with a major sports league, where you will be seeing WWE championship title belts that will be made using the team logos of some of the most prominent pro sports franchises.
It's a real testament to the power of our brand.
One of the lessons Vince always taught me in business was to always be slightly ahead of the curve, not so far ahead that people don't understand what you're doing and certainly not behind.
WWE was ahead of the curve with the advent of pay-per-view, bringing WrestleMania directly into people's homes.
Social media allowed one-to-one connection between our superstars and our fans.
And when consumers started migrating to what was then a new short-form platform called YouTube, WWE became one of YouTube's original paid content partners.
When research showed our audience was 5 times more likely to consume online video, we cannibalized our pay-per-view business and launched the first live SVOD service of its kind, WWE network.
And now we're ahead of the curve again, licensing WWE Network, our most premium content, to one of America's premier streaming services, NBCU's Peacock.
Because the landscape has changed.
COVID-19 and quarantine accelerated a behavioral viewership shift to streaming platforms.
Streaming behemoths are investing heavily in technology and infrastructure in order to scale with operational efficiencies creating more flexible pricing options.
And the biggest thing all of these providers have in common is the need for branded content.
In order to be competitive, we need to pivot away from the technology necessary for an optimum user experience and allocate our resources against what we do best: content creation, production and storytelling.
And we get to do it with a trusted partner we have had for over 30 years, NBCU.
Partnering with NBCU's Peacock not only provides a greater value proposition for our current subscribers.
It also allows us to deliver our most premium content to a significantly larger audience, including the 33 million people who have already signed up for the service.
Additionally, this partnership gives greater access to NBCU's best-in-class teams across sales, marketing and promotion as well as some of the most iconic franchises in the United States and around the world.
Just imagine, with NBCU and Peacock, every three years is a Super Bowl, every two years is the Olympics, and every year is WrestleMania.
We believe more than ever in the power of our brand.
In 2020, WWE's television viewership held steady once we transitioned out of the Performance Center and invested in WWE ThunderDome.
In fact, over the period from August 21 through year-end, which covers our move to the Amway Center and subsequently to Tropicana Field, Raw viewership is essentially unchanged and SmackDown viewership has increased 8% compared to the prior three-month period.
During the fourth quarter, digital views increased an estimated 25% and hours consumed increased 44%, excluding the impact of geographical restrictions in India.
In 2020 as a whole, we saw a record 38 billion views and 1.4 billion hours consumed across our AVOD platforms, both representing a 10% increase year-over-year and an 11% increase in revenue.
In order to reach new audiences, we maintained our pop culture strategy, bringing celebrities and influencers into our programming and casting WWE superstars outside of our content.
In the quarter, Matthew McConaughey's appearance in the ThunderDome and in other WWE content generated five million impressions.
In fact, Jimmy Kimmel used the footage from the ThunderDome in an interview with Matthew just this week.
The biggest opportunity outside of WWE programming was bar none SmackDown women's champion, Sasha Banks, appearing as a recurring character in Season two of Disney's Mandalorian.
And as Nick already highlighted, this past week, multi platinum artist and award-winning singer song writer Bad Bunny not only performed at the Royal Rumble, he got physically involved, diving off the top rope and then showed up again on Monday Night Raw the next night driving a Bugatti.
I think it was the first time I've ever seen a Bugatti on Raw.
Bad Bunny, one of the most recognized Latinx performers of our generation said being a WWE Superstar has always been his dream.
As a final measure of our brand strength, our advertising and sales revenue outpaced industry trends throughout the year.
The quarter was highlighted by an increase in gaming partner activations, including Wargaming World of Tanks, Cyberpunk 2077, 2K Battlegrounds and Microsoft Gears.
Additionally, we signed a multiyear partnership with our first banking partner, Credit One, as well as our first official beer partnership with Constellation Brands focusing on Victoria, Corona and Modelo.
In fact, if you were watching the Royal Rumble on Sunday night, you would have seen WWE Superstar Rey Mysterio, a lucha legend, wearing the Victoria brand on his mask.
Rey also posted to a 3.6 million followers on Instagram in Spanish about how proud he was to partner with a brand as authentic to the Latino fan base as Victoria.
Forbes, Complex and Sports Illustrated were just a few of the outlets that highlighted this integration.
And 2021 is already off to a promising start, kicking off a multiyear partnership with cricket wireless as the presenting sponsor of the Royal Rumble, a custom content series with first-time partner GM for the rollout of their Silverado campaign and the announcement of Mars' Snickers as the returning sponsor of WrestleMania for the sixth consecutive year.
WWE is the perfect partner as more and more brands look to engage consumers with customized content creation and authentic influencers.
When you couple that with our over one billion followers across digital and social platforms as well as our broadcast, cable and streaming partners, Fox, USA and Peacock in the states, WWE is poised now more than ever to deliver scale, engagement and reach.
Today, I'll review WWE's financial performance, liquidity and capital structure and business outlook.
As a reminder, all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter unless I say otherwise.
For the year, WWE achieved record revenue and record profit.
WWE's adjusted OIBDA of $286.2 million was at the high end of our rescinded guidance and reflected nearly a 60% increase of more than $100 million.
This growth was driven primarily by higher rights fees from WWE's U.S. Distribution Agreement.
Throughout 2020, WWE managed a challenging environment, particularly for producers of live content.
We estimate that WWE lost more than $90 million in revenue as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, primarily from the loss of ticket sales and the postponement of large-scale international events.
WWE never went off the air.
This was a remarkable achievement.
But it does foreshadow a tough comparison for 2021.
In the fourth quarter, the absence of a large-scale international event contributed to a 50% or $56.4 million reduction in fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA, which also reflected lower advertising revenue and higher TV production costs.
Looking at the WWE's Media segment, adjusted OIBDA decreased 37% or approximately $44 million to $73 million, primarily due to the aforementioned event loss and, to a lesser extent, decreased advertising sales and higher production costs.
On December 11, we transitioned the WWE ThunderDome, our state-of-the-art environment for producing Raw and SmackDown to a temporary residency at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.
In that stadium setting, we bring nearly 1,000 live virtual fans back to our show and surround them with pyrotechnics, laser displays, augmented reality and drone cameras.
This staging increases production costs by approximately 25% per episode.
We expect this investment to continue through at least the first half of 2021 as it brings a high level of excitement to our programs and most importantly, brings our fans back into the show.
Despite a challenging environment, WWE continued to produce a significant amount of content.
More than 700 hours of programming in the quarter and more than 2,300 hours for the year across television, streaming and social and digital platforms.
As we prepare to transition the WWE Network to Peacock, we continue to utilize on the growth in digital consumption, promoting content sampling and subscriptions with the free version of WWE Network.
Since the pandemic began WWE subscriptions and consumption have been up meaningfully.
In the fourth quarter, 2.2 million total viewers watched content across all tiers, representing a 40% increase and those viewers watched 35 million hours of content, which was 14% higher.
Perhaps most importantly, average paid subscribers to the network increased 6% to 1.5 million.
Adjusted OIBDA from Live Events declined by $4.9 million to a loss of $6.7 million due to a $26.7 million decline in Live Events revenue.
These declines were due to the loss of ticket revenue resulting from the cancellation of events.
Until mid-March, WWE held arena and stadium based events in front of ticketed audiences.
During the fourth quarter, however, WWE held no ticketed events.
We are delighted to have announced the return of WrestleMania to Tampa Bay on Saturday, April 10 and Sunday, April 11, 2021 and at Raymond James Stadium with ticket availability and safety protocols forthcoming.
However, it remains challenging to predict the pace at which we will return to a weekly live event schedule.
We do not anticipate the staging of other ticketed events until at least the second half of 2021.
The drop in video game sales was anticipated as WWE and Take-Two had previously determined to delay the release of WWE's franchise game until 2021.
WWE continued to introduce new products, expand its video game portfolio and develop partnerships across product categories.
For example, during the quarter, WWE continued to build out its video game portfolio, launching WWE Undefeated and WWE Racing Showdown in partnership with Indway and JetSynthesys, respectively.
As of year-end, WWE had 140 million installs across its games portfolio.
Demonstrating our commitment to product innovation, WWE released 2,000 new products on its e-commerce platform including 18 new championship title cells, which generated category growth of more than 100% for the year.
In 2020, we generated approximately $292 million in free cash flow, an increase of $240 million.
The increase was driven by improved working capital, the timing of collections associated with large-scale international events, stronger operating performance and to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditures.
As of December 31, 2020, WWE held $593 million in cash and short-term investments.
This included $100 million borrowed under WWE's revolving credit facility which was repaid just in January 2021.
And finally, a word on WWE's business outlook.
Last week, we issued guidance for 2021 adjusted OIBDA.
As previously indicated, WWE expects restrictions related to the spread of COVID-19, particularly related to ticketed live events to continue at least through the first half of 2021.
Additionally, we anticipate a significant year-over-year increase in expense due to continued higher TV production expenses at WWE's ThunderDome as well as the return of employees from furlough.
We estimate that WWE can achieve 2021 adjusted OIBDA of $270 million to $305 million as revenue growth driven by the Peacock transaction, the gradual ramp-up of ticketed live events, including large-scale international events, and the escalation of core content rights fees is offset by the increase in production and personnel expenses.
In our view, the stated 2021 adjusted OIBDA guidance range will be approximately 15% to 20% higher without the ongoing impact of COVID-19, which includes the loss of ticket and merchandise sales of live events and the increased investment in production to further fan engagement.
Turning to WWE's capital expenditures.
In early 2020, and we deferred spending on the company's new headquarters.
Given increasing visibility regarding WWE's projected performance and liquidity, we are planning to restart this project in the second half of '21.
For 2021, we estimate total capital expenditures of $65 million to $85 million, including funds to begin construction as well as funds to enhance WWE's technology infrastructure.
We are in the process of reevaluating the headquarters project, and we will provide further guidance on future capital expenditures when that work is completed.
For the first quarter of 2021, we estimate adjusted OIBDA will decline as incremental profits from Peacock and higher content rights fees are more than offset by the absence of ticketed events, including a large-scale international event, and increased production costs.
The timing and rate of returning ticketed audiences to WWE's Live Events remains subject to significant uncertainty.
And as such, we are not reinstating more specific quarterly guidance at this time.
And finally, I'd like to take a moment and talk about WWE's financial outlook in a post-COVID world, whenever that may be.
As analysts and investors will likely use the ex COVID range of 2021 adjusted OIBDA guidance to estimate future performance, I would note that 2022 and future years will be impacted by a variety of factors.
Certainly, the contractual escalation of WWE's core content rights fees will continue to be an important source of growth.
However, other factors may temper that growth.
Based on the accounting treatment of Peacock revenue, for example, we expect the highest incremental impact of the Peacock transaction to be booked in 2021.
Another key factor to note in the WWE post-COVID business model is that while TV production costs may decline somewhat in 2022 relative to 2021, costs will likely remain higher than in 2019.
This is due to the shift in 2020 to a Monday/Friday production schedule compared to a Monday/Tuesday schedule previously.
Incremental costs related to this change were masked in 2020 by residency in various locations, particularly in WWE's own Performance Center in the early months of COVID.
WWE continues to adapt its business to the changing environment.
As Vince, Nick and Stephanie indicated, we believe WWE can and will continue to innovate across all business lines as we execute our strategic objectives.
We look forward to sharing progress on these initiatives with you all in the future.
Carina, we're ready now.
","WWE highlighted its financial performance in a challenging environment, reporting record revenue and profit for the year. A key development is its strategic partnership with NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service, which will host WWE Network content starting March 18. This deal provides greater value to subscribers and expands WWE's reach to over 33 million Peacock users. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, WWE remained committed to producing content, transitioning its flagship programs to the ThunderDome and later Tropicana Field for live virtual fan experiences. The company anticipates a gradual return to ticketed live events but estimates a revenue loss of over $90 million due to the pandemic. However, TV production costs will increase with the ThunderDome's continued use and the return of furloughed employees. WWE projects adjusted OIBDA for 2021 between $270 million and $305 million, with revenue growth offset by increasing expenses. The company also emphasized its financial outlook in a post-COVID world, noting that TV production costs may decline but will likely remain higher than pre-pandemic levels due to schedule adjustments. Despite the challenges, WWE believes it is well-positioned for long-term success and will continue to innovate across all business lines."
VZ_q3_2021.txt,"This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2.
Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.
As a reminder, we've entered the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction.
So we will not be able to comment on our spectrum holdings or strategy.
Now let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis.
Reported results include a net pre-tax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pre-tax charge of approximately $247 million, which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and $103 million related to a severance charge for voluntary separations under our existing plans.
Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the third quarter compared to $1.25 a year ago.
Please note, our results include two months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo funds closed on September 1.
We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth.
This was supported by a strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth.
This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high quality offerings.
As I said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our number one position in the market.
Our strategy remains unchanged, and we're delivering on everything we promised.
And we're gaining momentum on all of five vectors of growth.
We are more passive to grow than antibody else and we're confident with our growth targets for outer years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter.
As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year.
We now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high-end of our prior guidance.
And adjusted earnings per share or $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35.
We remain on track to achieve our targeted capex levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption into the supply chain.
Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band build and that we have devices that our customer wants.
Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in industry, which I've been so impressed by since I joined Verizon.
And in times like these, it matters.
Let's talk about business.
We continue to provide a best-in-class experience across the board.
On the network front, third-parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience.
This includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and JD Power for the 27th consecutive time.
Our network team is doing a great job.
On the commercial front, we've got great momentum in the 5G adoption with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G capable device.
This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before.
For context, 12 months of the 4G launched, 10% of the devices were on 4G.
Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launch, more than the double were on 5G devices, and it's growing at the rapid pace.
This combined with our millimeter wave strategy is an important combination, and that is paying off.
In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave usage more than double sequentially.
We're doing more gigabit of usage in a month now than we did in all the first quarter.
In some or more established build outs, we're seeing more than 20% of usage of millimeter wave.
And we are on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year end.
For Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios.
And finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with the sale of the Verizon Media Group in September depending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bonds, which is a vital step toward our net-zero goal in 2035.
All this was accomplished in tandem with a strong quarter results.
When it comes to the finances, we are on track to meet and exceed all our 2021 guidance.
We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-Band.
We continued to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios.
We have a diversified path to revenue growth with all five vectors contributing.
EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year.
And on an adjusted basis, earnings per share was up 12.8%.
Our capital allocation stands firm.
We invest in our business to create shareholder value.
We continued to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15th consecutive year.
And Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction.
As we said last quarter, our guidance raise is broad-based and across all our five vectors of growth.
Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2% driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth.
The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher valued price plans as well as high quality net adds, but our growth is more than that.
Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and Mobile Edge Compute.
Our strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to detect for our customers includes Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G, millimeter wave and C-Band.
When it comes to the Mobile Edge Compute, we are the Mobile Edge Compute leader, both in public and private.
And we just announced a private Mobile Edge Compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with.
And this just scratches the surface on how we'll continue to utilize our assets.
We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band.
Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion.
We are on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G.
To date, 5G Home is in 57 markets and the 4G LTE Home in over 200 markets across all 50 states.
In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance of Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint.
We are on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year.
You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 '21 earnings call.
And now, Matt, over to you.
I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance.
As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself, but on a high value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward.
By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we receive from every connection.
As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results.
In the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year.
Our results are inclusive of two months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a segment basis.
Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%.
Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media.
Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery.
Fios revenue was $3.2 billion, up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in customers as well as our efforts to increase the value of each customer by encouraging them to step-up in speed test.
Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of consumer and business, was $17.1 billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year.
The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth and products.
We are creating more positive growth with connectivity and non-connectivity services.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion, up 3.3% from prior year.
Top-line growth and a reduction in non-equipment-related expenses contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth.
Our net EBITDA growth is helping us drive earnings per share growth.
For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41, up year-over-year by 12.8%.
Now, let's take a look at our consolidated metrics.
Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on bringing in high quality net adds, a key component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.
We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our consumer and business units.
Our Mix and Match value propositions, network quality and unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers.
For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels.
We're seeing growth in new accounts as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high quality net adds.
Phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre-pandemic levels.
Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our Consumer and Business unlimited plans.
Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre-pandemic norms.
Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL and fixed wireless, were 129,000.
Fios Internet net adds were 104,000 compared to 144,000 last year.
As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter, as we had largely paused installs in Q2 2020 due to COVID.
Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition built on network quality and our Mix and Match pricing structure.
This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates.
For the first time, we are providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both Consumer and Business fixed wireless products.
We are building momentum and our pre-C-Band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses.
Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well.
We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process as well as the quality and reliability of the product.
Now, let's turn to our Consumer Group results.
Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing in wireless and FIos.
Total revenue was $23.3 billion, up 7.3% year-over-year.
Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5% versus prior year.
These results include strong wireless revenue as well as growth in Fios.
Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past year and migration to higher speeds.
Our actions around Mix and Match, which include a broadband first approach, is helping us to grow Fios revenue and Consumer EBITDA.
We're still seeing plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share Mix and Match penetration rates and our open for sale locations.
Wireless service revenue was $14 billion, up 4% from the prior year.
We have been driving access gains both in growing accounts and phone net adds as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy.
As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now on premium unlimited plans.
Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content and others.
Our wide range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue, but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers.
For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million, driven by a high quality service and other revenue gains coming from multiple growth vectors.
These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we believe will drive continued growth into the future.
The Mix and Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher value tiers and bringing customers in the higher value plans.
We are very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from new customers.
You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results.
Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000, above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020.
The performance was consistent during the period as we were able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churn throughout the quarter.
Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding with approximately 66% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan.
And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over 25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service on C-Band spectrum in the coming months.
Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter.
We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing, especially on retention.
Now let's move to Slide 11 to review the Business Group results.
Our Business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across multiple verticals.
We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the Business segment; our small and medium business unit, private wireless and the MEC space or enterprise customers as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to serve multiple customer groups.
Total revenues for the Business segment was $7.7 billion.
We continue to see growth in wireless revenue, being offset by ongoing legacy wireline declines.
Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year.
We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium business, which was partially offset by distance learning process in public sector.
Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending.
Consistent with our focus on driving high value business in the wholesale space, we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic, which is contributing to the revenue decline, as shown on the slide.
Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the quarter.
While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction.
Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future.
We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest value portions of the segment in 3Q.
Phone gross add volumes were above pre-pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019.
Total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 276,000.
To better highlight some of the trends, on this slide we've broken out the net adds by public sector and our higher growth commercial businesses, which includes small and medium business and enterprise.
During 3Q 2020, the commercial space, primarily within small and medium business, was depressed, while public sector buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds.
In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels.
We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter.
A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net add performance.
Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of 162,000.
Now, let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary.
The business continues to generate strong cash flow.
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.2 billion.
The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a one-time benefit and higher working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes.
Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network.
C-Band capex was more than $1 billion through the third quarter.
And we have placed orders for approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental capex range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-Band deployment.
The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the nine month period.
Net unsecured debt at quarter end was $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter.
In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6 billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity as we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile.
Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7 times.
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group.
We expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach to close of the TracFone acquisition, while continuing to execute on our business strategy within our capital allocation framework.
Let's move on to Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year.
We continued our strong first half performance momentum in the third quarter.
Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare for the C-Band launch.
Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service revenue growth and EPS.
Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4%, the high-end of the prior guidance.
Adjusted earnings per share guidance is being increased to $5.35 to $5.40, up from the prior range of $5.25 to $5.35.
Our guidance for the effective tax rate is unchanged.
Capex guidance is also unchanged, though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion is dependent upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain.
Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results.
We are attracting high quality customers that see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations and step-ups.
I look forward to continued momentum as we wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G built ride has to offer.
As you heard, we delivered solid third quarter results and we are on track to meet or exceed all our 2021 commitments to the investment community.
Our strategy is working.
And I'm confident in the strategy will help to deliver both strong results and premium experiences going forward.
As we look ahead, we'll continue to focus on expanding our 5G leadership, capitalizing on wireless momentum and work toward our C-Band launch, deploying differentiating experiences for our customers and execute our Network-as-a-Service strategy delivering all five vectors of growth.
I will look forward to delivering on all fronts and sharing our results in the coming months.
With that I hand it back to Brady.
Brad, we're ready to take questions.
","Verizon reported solid third-quarter results, with adjusted EPS of $1.41 excluding special items. Total wireless service revenue grew by 3.9% year-over-year, driven by strong net additions in wireless and broadband. The company's high-quality network was recognized by third-party providers, and its 5G adoption momentum continued, with 25% of its consumer phone base using 5G devices. Verizon updated its financial guidance, increasing its forecast for total wireless service revenue growth to around 4% and adjusted EPS to a range of $5.35 to $5.40. The company remains on track to achieve its targeted capex levels for 2021, assuming no further supply chain disruptions. Verizon's operational excellence and partnership strategy were highlighted, and its expansion in fixed wireless access and Mobile Edge Compute are seen as key growth drivers. The sale of Verizon Media and acquisition of TracFone were also mentioned as significant value creation and strategic refinement initiatives."
WSR_q3_2021.txt,"The company undertakes no obligation to update this information.
Whitestone's third quarter earnings news release and supplemental operating and financial data package have been filed with the SEC and are available on our website www.
whitestonereit.com in the Investor Relations section.
Now over to Jim Mastandrea, our Chairman and CEO, to update you on our third quarter results.
Operating portfolio occupancy increased to 90.2% from 89.9% last quarter and annualized base rent increased to $20.41 from $19.95 last quarter.
Our overall foot traffic at our centers in 3Q '21 was 35% higher than the same quarter in 2020.
With the resurgence of the COVID through its delta variant, we maintained a steady, but slightly lighter pattern versus 2Q '21.
We continue to experience active recurring traffic from existing and new community members visiting our centers as population shifts continue with the ongoing migration from corporations and individuals to Arizona and Texas.
Regarding our financial performance for the quarter, revenue grew by 9% to $32.4 million this quarter compared to $29.9 million in 3Q '20.
Same-store net operating income growth of 7% in this quarter and 8% in Q2 was driven by increases in occupancy and annual base rent per square foot as previously noted, as well as positive leasing spreads.
A key financial indicator for REIT is FFO.
Funds from operations core was $0.25 per share and $0.75 per share in the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 respectively.
Along with this noted growth, we continue to make progress toward one of our long-term goals of deleveraging the trust.
We reduced our debt to EBITDA, which is now 8.1 times down from 9.4 times a year ago.
Equally important to the trust is our dividend, which we consider sacred.
Regarding our quarterly dividend, we now have paid dividends to our shareholders for the 134th consecutive months since our IPO.
Our dividend yield of 4.3% remains at a premium and our payout ratio to FFO core is exceptionally strong at 42%.
This quarter we reactivated our external growth plan with the acquisition of Lakeside Market in Plano, Texas at a purchase price of $53.25 million.
Importantly, this acquisition did not require any additional corporate overhead, which is a key component toward our attaining economies of scale.
Along with this acquisition, we're actively pursuing additional properties in our strong pipeline of assets in Austin, Dallas and Phoenix.
Looking at our current portfolio, we now have 4.6 million of our 5.1 million square feet of space leased.
Our approximately 1,500 tenants' average lease space is 3000 square feet per tenant, complemented by a mix of larger square footage leases by our grocery anchors.
Our strong tenant relationships and rigorous vetting process ensures the quality of our revenue for our portfolio and stability of our cash flow.
I would like to point out that our tenant improvement costs to bring a new smaller tenant into one of our centers is much lower per square foot than the cost of a big box tenant.
By doing so, we spread our risk among a group of tenants in a relatively the same space as a larger tenant, achieve higher rent per square foot, annual escalators of 2% or 3% and some of our tenants pay percentage lease of revenues.
In addition, typically our tenants pay taxes, insurance and common area maintenance.
Our strong leasing activity is one of the key drivers and performance this quarter.
Some important metrics to highlight that our new lease count for 3Q '21 is 38 versus 35 in the prior quarter and 32 in the prior year.
Our leasing spreads for 3Q '21 are 5.4% versus 3.1% in the prior quarter and 2.9% in the prior year, both of which are moving in a positive direction.
In summary, the update I've shared with you today highlights, in particular, our business model continues to perform exceptionally well.
Our leasing strategy focusing on entrepreneurial tenants continues to produce consistent results.
And most notably, we are continuing to make good progress to achieving our long-term goals.
While we are pleased with our continued improving performance, we know that the work ahead of us is cut out, but our team remains committed to serving our shareholders and increasing long-term value.
I appreciate the opportunity to share some great results for the third quarter.
During the quarter, our best-in-class geography and strategically designed tenant mix have produced strong top line and bottom line growth, and our long-term focus and day-to-day execution have allowed us to make significant progress toward our long-term goals of scaling our infrastructure and improving our overall debt leverage.
The MSAs that we operate in, continue to see significant population migration and corporate relocations producing jobs from other areas of the country.
This is best evidenced by record leasing activity, occupancy and annualized base rent growth, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter topline revenue, NOI and FFO growth, robust leasing spreads, strong same-store NOI growth, reduced debt levels and interest cost resulting in improved debt leverage metrics and greater scale of our G&A infrastructure.
Total revenue was $32.4 million for the quarter, up 6% from the second quarter and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.
The revenue growth was driven by a sequential 0.3% increase in same-store occupancy from Q2 and a 1.2% improvement compared to Q3 of 2020.
We are also benefiting from our ABR per square foot, rising 2.3% sequentially and 5.3% from a year ago along with lower and collectability reserves.
Property net operating income was $23.2 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.
Q3 same-store NOI increased 7% from Q3 of 2020.
Net income for the quarter was $0.06 per share, up from $0.02 per share in the prior year quarter.
Funds from operations core was $0.25 per share in the quarter, up 9% from the second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date FFO core per share was $0.75 per share, up 9% from the same period of 2020.
Our leasing activity in the quarter continued to build on our very strong first and second quarters, with 38 new leases, representing 90,000 square feet of newly occupied spaces.
Our new leasing activity for the nine months was 56% higher on a square foot basis than 2020 and 48% higher than 2019.
On a total lease value basis, our new leasing activity for the nine months was 112% higher than 2020 and 191% higher than 2019.
Leasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been a positive 8.5% over the last 12 months and third quarter leasing spreads increased by 5.4% on new leases and 14.1% on renewal leases signed.
Our annualized base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis at the end of the quarter grew 2.3% to $20.41 from $19.95 in the previous quarter and increased 5.3% from a year ago.
Total operating portfolio occupancy stood at 90.2%, up 1.2% from a year ago and up 0.3% from the second quarter.
Including our newest acquisition Lakeside Market, our total occupancy is 89.9%, up 1% from a year ago.
Our collections continued to be very strong in the third quarter, reflecting the overall high collection levels and collections on tenants classified as cash basis.
Our tenant receivables decreased by $1 million, an improvement of 4.4% from year-end 2020.
Our interest expense was 4% lower than a year ago, reflecting our lower net debt.
At quarter end, we had $22 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable.
Included in this amount is $17.8 million of accrued straight-line rents and $1.3 million of agreed upon deferrals.
Our agreed upon deferral balance is down 43% from year-end reflecting tenants honoring their payment plans.
Turning to our balance sheet.
Since early last year, we have implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity.
Our total net debt was $616.6 million, down $20.5 million from a year ago, improving our debt to gross book real estate cost ratio to 51% down from 55% a year ago.
Our debt to EBITDA ratio improved 1.3 turns from a year ago and 0.1 turn from the second quarter to 8.1 times in Q3.
We are pleased with the significant progress we are making toward our long-term debt reduction goal and remain steadfast in our commitment in this area.
As of quarter end, we have $155.5 million of undrawn capacity and $81.8 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.
During the quarter, we sold 3 million common shares under our ATM program, resulting in $28 million in net proceeds to the company at an average sale price of $9.49 per share.
These strong results in 2021 are a testament to the strength of Whitestone's strategic geographic focus and business model.
We are encouraged by the acquisition of Lakeside Market in the quarter and look forward to continued delivery of value to all of Whitestone's stakeholders.
With that now -- we will now take questions.
Operator, please open the lines.
","Whitestone's Q3 financial performance demonstrated stable growth, with revenue increasing by 9% to $32.4 million compared to the same quarter in 2020. Same-store NOI grew by 7%, driven by occupancy increases and higher annual base rent per square foot. Funds from operations (FFO) core also improved by 9% to $0.25 per share. Occupancy reached 90.2%, with the acquisition of Lakeside Market in Plano, Texas. The company has made significant progress in reducing leverage, with debt-to-EBITDA improving to 8.1 times. Whitestone's strategic focus on entrepreneurial tenants and strong leasing activity resulted in a 5.4% positive leasing spread. The company remains committed to its dividend, with a payout ratio to FFO core of 42% and a yield of 4.3%."
SXT_q3_2020.txt,"I'm Steve Rolfs, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sensient Technologies Corporation.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide investors with additional information to evaluate the Company's performance and improve the comparability of results between reporting periods.
These non-GAAP financial results should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Our actual results may differ materially, particularly in view of the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental attempts at remedial action and the timing of a return of more normal economic activity.
We urge you to read Sensient's filings, including our 10-K, our second quarter 10-Q and our forthcoming third quarter 10-Q for a description of additional factors that could potentially impact our financial results.
Please bear these factors in mind when you analyze our comments today.
Due to changes we have made to our portfolio and the divestitures we announced last year, we are updating our group and product lines.
The most notable change is that our flavors and fragrances segment will now be named the flavors and extracts segment.
You will also notice some small changes to the names we use for some of our product lines.
Sensient's focused portfolio strengthens our ability to service the food, pharmaceutical and personal care markets.
We will continue to report the three divested product lines of fragrances, yogurt fruit preparations and inks as long as these product lines impact our comparisons.
Now we'll hear from Paul.
And I'm pleased to report that results were in line with our expectations and our overall guidance for the year.
I'm very pleased with the continued revenue and profit growth in our flavors and extract group as well as our food and pharmaceutical business in the color group.
Our Asia Pacific group also posted solid profit growth in the quarter.
Overall, each of our groups performed well despite the adverse impact of COVID-19.
COVID-19 continues to be a net negative to the Company.
The market decline in the makeup industry continues to impact the color group's personal care business.
And on a geographic basis, we continue to see headwinds in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America.
In the midst of this pandemic, we have ensured our employees are safe and healthy, our facilities remain open, our supply chain remains strong and we have delivered our products on time to our customers.
Based on current trends, I expect that we will deliver on our earnings per share outlook for the year as the foundation of our business remains strong.
Our focus over the years on customer service, on-time delivery and sales execution has led to a high level of revenue from new product wins during the second half of 2019 and the first half of this year.
Furthermore, as the pandemic continues and new product development at certain companies has slowed, we have focused on regaining lost business and gaining share at our customers.
This focus, coupled with lower overall sales attrition, is paying off in our results and should continue to benefit future periods.
Last year at this time, we announced three divestitures.
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of inks.
And I'm pleased to say that we completed the sale of the yogurt fruit prep business during the third quarter.
This is our second completed divestiture in 2020, and I am optimistic that we will complete the divestiture of fragrances in the near future.
As I mentioned last year, the divestiture of these three businesses allows us to focus on our key customer markets, food, pharmaceutical and personal care.
I'm very pleased with the progress of our flavors and extracts group this year.
The group had an impressive quarter with adjusted local currency revenue growth of 13% and profit growth of 24%.
This is the third straight quarter of revenue growth, which has resulted in continued profit and margin improvement.
This growth is based on the group's focus on sales execution, which has resulted in a high win rate, a focus on retaining existing business and an overall decline in the group's attrition rate.
Additionally, the group's focus on transitioning the product portfolio to more value-added solutions and the reduction of its production cost structure from restructuring and ongoing initiatives is complementing the revenue growth and the overall improvement in the group's profit and margin.
Within the flavors and extracts group, the natural ingredients business had another strong quarter with local currency sales growth of 14.5% as a result of strong demand for seasoning, snacks and packaged foods.
This business has a solid foundation to deliver a consistent and reliable supply of high-quality natural ingredients to its customers.
Flavors extracts and flavor ingredients also had a nice quarter, up 12% in local currency.
The business' strong technology platform in flavor modulation and enhancement, its clean label solutions and its applications expertise are leading factors in the growth of this business.
Overall, the flavors and extracts group's operating profit margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter.
Long term, I expect mid-single digit revenue growth with continued margin improvement for the group.
Now turning to colors.
Revenue for food and pharmaceutical colors was up low-single digits for the quarter.
The group continues to see solid demand for natural colors in the market.
There's also strong consumer interest in functional natural extracts and nutraceuticals, and the group's product portfolio and innovation are well positioned to support this demand.
Despite the continued growth in food and pharmaceutical colors, revenue in personal care continues to be down as a result of the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the color makeup market.
The demand for makeup in Europe, North America and Asia continues to be down substantially for the year.
Given the uncertainty with COVID-19 and ongoing restrictions, I anticipate challenges for this cosmetics product line to continue.
The color group's adjusted operating profit increased 3% in the quarter.
Food and pharmaceutical colors had a great quarter, generating profit growth of more than 20% and about 15% for the first nine months of 2020.
However, the lower demand for makeup and other personal care products continues to be a drag on the group's profit performance.
Overall, the color group's operating profit margin increased 110 basis points in this quarter.
Long term, I continue to expect mid-single digit revenue growth from food and pharmaceutical colors as well as personal care once demand normalizes from the impacts of COVID-19.
We've made good product -- progress in our Asia Pacific group this year.
Similar to flavors and extracts and colors, the group has focused on sales execution and building a stronger customer service and technology-driven organization.
The group has created a solid infrastructure and has been focused on localizing production.
During the quarter, the group had solid sales growth in certain regions.
However, this growth was offset by declines in other regions, as government COVID-19 restrictions continue to significantly impact many sales channels.
The group had another strong quarter of profit growth, up approximately 15% in the quarter and 17% for the first nine months of 2020.
The group's operating profit margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter.
This was the third straight quarter of strong profit improvement.
The Asia Pacific group is well positioned for long-term growth.
And I anticipate that as certain COVID-19-related restrictions ease, the group will resume mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the results of our groups this year.
Our flavors and extract group is having a great year, and the food and pharmaceutical business within the color group continues to have solid revenue and very strong profit growth.
Our Asia Pacific group is well positioned for future revenue growth.
Overall, COVID-19 continues to be a headwind for the Company.
Despite this headwind, I'm excited about the future growth opportunities for Sensient due to the strength of our portfolio of technologies and our exceptional customer service.
Steve will now provide you with additional details on the third quarter results.
The adjusted results for 2020 and 2019 remove the impact of the divestiture-related costs, the operations divested or to be divested and our recently implemented operational improvement plan.
We believe that the removal of these items provides a clearer picture to investors of the Company's performance.
This also reflects how management reviews the Company's operations and performance.
During the third quarter, the Company initiated a plan primarily to consolidate some of our global cosmetic manufacturing operations.
The Company expects to complete this operational improvement plan during the first half of 2021.
The costs of this plan are estimated to be approximately $5 million to $7 million.
Our third quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78.
Included in these results are $1.4 million or approximately $0.03 per share of costs related to the divestitures and other related costs and the cost of the operational improvement plan.
In addition, our GAAP earnings per share this quarter include approximately $0.04 of earnings related to the results of the operations targeted for divestiture, which represents approximately $23.6 million of revenue in the quarter.
Last year's third quarter GAAP results included approximately $0.02 of earnings per share from the operations to be divested and approximately $34.1 million of revenue.
Excluding these items, consolidated adjusted revenue was $300 million, an increase of approximately 6.1% in local currency compared to the third quarter of 2019.
This revenue growth was primarily a result of the flavors and extracts group, which was up approximately 13% in local currency.
Consolidated adjusted operating income increased 10.1% in local currency to $41.5 million in the third quarter of 2020.
This growth was led by the flavors and extracts group, which increased operating income by 24.1% in local currency.
The Asia Pacific group also had a nice growth in operating income in the quarter, up 15.5% in local currency.
And operating income in the food and pharmaceutical business in the color group was up over 20% in local currency.
The increase in operating income in these businesses is a result of the volume growth Paul explained earlier combined with the overall lower cost structure across the Company.
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.77 in this year's third quarter compared to $0.74 in last year's third quarter.
As Paul mentioned, the overall impact of COVID on the Company's results has been a headwind.
The impact on our food and pharmaceutical businesses is mixed, but as we have discussed, the negative impact in our personal care business is significant.
We have reduced debt by approximately $60 million since the beginning of the year.
We have adequate liquidity to meet operating and financial needs through our cash flow and available credit lines.
Our debt-to-EBITDA is 2.6, down from 2.9 at the start of the year.
Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the first nine months of 2020, an increase of 12% compared to prior year.
Capital expenditures were $34 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $26.1 million in the first nine months of 2019.
Our free cash flow increased 7% to $109 million for the first nine months of this year.
Consistent with what we communicated during our last call, we expect our adjusted consolidated operating income and earnings may be flat to lower in 2020 because of the level of non-cash performance-based equity expense in 2020.
We also expected a higher tax rate in 2020 compared to our 2019 rate, which was lower as a result of a number of planning opportunities.
Based on current trends, we are reconfirming our previously issued full-year GAAP earnings per share guidance of $2.10 per share to $2.35 per share.
The full-year guidance also now includes approximately $0.05 of currency headwinds based on current exchange rates.
We are also reconfirming our previously issued full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.60 to $2.80, which excludes divestiture-related costs, operational improvement plan costs, the impact of the divested or to-be-divested businesses and foreign currency impacts.
The Company expects foreign currency impacts to be minimal in the fourth quarter.
We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance of low-to-mid single-digit growth.
In conclusion, we continue to expect long-term revenue growth rates of mid-single digits in each of our groups.
Our stock-based compensation and other incentive costs have reset this year.
Going forward, this should be less of a headwind for us.
We do expect our tax rate to trend up slightly in future years under current law.
As a result, we believe adjusted EBITDA is a better measure of the Company's operating performance, and expect this metric to grow at a mid-single digit rate or better.
In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we will continue to pay down debt in the near term.
We also continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities.
Absent an acquisition, we have the ability to buy back shares.
We expect our capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $60 million annually.
Our divestiture activity and our operational improvement plan allows us to focus on our key customer markets of food, pharmaceutical excipients and personal care, while providing the foundation for future revenue and margin growth.
","Sensient Technologies delivered solid results in its third quarter, with adjusted local currency revenue increasing 6.1% in flavors and extracts and profit growth of 24%. The flavors and extracts group has maintained consistent growth in revenue and profits, driven by sales execution, customer retention, and a decline in attrition. The Asia Pacific group also posted solid profit growth, up 15% in the quarter. Despite adverse impacts from COVID-19, the company is maintaining its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.80 and low-to-mid single-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA. Sensient's ongoing restructuring initiatives and focus on core customer markets are expected to support future growth and margin improvement."

Additionally, we have provided slides that summarize many of the points we will discuss during the call.
These slides can also be found on our Investor Relations' website.
We delivered a solid quarter and first half of the year and continue to make progress against our overall objectives.
Every business grew revenue and improved EBIT from prior year.
Overall, revenue at constant currency grew 6% and EBIT grew 16%.
SendTech and Presort both grew revenue, albeit as expected, given the easier compare, and both businesses grew EBIT.
Presort continues to see a nice recovery in volumes from pandemic levels and EBIT margins remain in the double-digit range, moving back toward the long-term model.
SendTech's revenue growth was led by a strong performance in our SendPro product family in addition to continued double-digit growth in our SaaS-based shipping portfolio.
The business recorded its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year EBIT growth and continues to maintain its EBIT margin above 30%.
Global e-commerce grew revenue this quarter despite a tough prior year comparison, and importantly, also improved quarter-to-quarter.
EBITDA turned positive in the quarter, and both EBIT and EBITDA improved meaningfully over prior year and prior quarter.
The path to profitability for e-commerce is an integrated approach around talent, training, automation and execution.
We've made several important additions to our team and the new management talent, along with the maturation of our existing workforce are clearly yielding results.
We continue to work to optimize our shipping lanes and continue to focus our investments toward more automation.
We continue to make good progress with substantial opportunity still in front of us.
Entering the second half of 2021, I like where we sit.
The revenue comparisons will get more difficult in the second half of the year compared to the first half, but this quarter was a glimpse into what the business can look like when we hit on all cylinders and that improved profitable revenue growth is within our grasp.
Over the course of the last year or so, I have said that Pitney Bowes will come out of this pandemic, a bigger and better company.
And while we are not out of the woods with the pandemic, we're certainly on the trajectory of being a bigger company, and we are working every day at becoming a better company.
Our second quarter results reflect solid momentum across all of our businesses.
We continue to make good progress and are set up well for the second half of the year.
Revenue was $899 million and grew 6% over prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.11 and included a $0.03 tax benefit in the quarter.
Free cash flow was $87 million, and cash from operations was $79 million, which was a solid performance in the quarter and in line with our expectations.
Although down from prior year, it is important to remember that last year included $66 million contribution from the decline in our finance receivables, which was largely COVID related.
This was an item that we identified as a headwind to our free cash flow comparison earlier this year.
During the quarter, we paid $9 million in dividends and made $5 million in restructuring payments.
We spent $40 million in capex as we continue to invest in our network and productivity initiatives across the business.
We ended the quarter with $814 million in cash and short-term investments.
Total debt was $2.4 billion, which is down $289 million.
When you take our finance receivables and cash into account, our implied operating debt is $567 million.
Let me turn to the P&L.
Starting with revenue versus prior year.
Equipment sales grew 46%.
Supplies grew 14% and business services grew 6%.
We have decline in support services of 1%; rentals of 2%; and financing of 16%.
Gross profit of $301 million improved about $17 million over prior year on growth across all segments.
Gross margin was 33%, which was slightly down from the same period last year, but an improvement from the last two quarters.
SG&A was $236 million and approximately $3 million higher than prior year.
SG&A was 26% of revenue, which was nearly a two point improvement over prior year.
Within SG&A, corporate expenses were $56 million, which was up about $7 million from prior year, largely due to higher employee variable related costs.
R&D was $11 million or 1% of revenue, which was up approximately $4 million from prior year.
During the quarter, we received the remaining insurance proceeds of $3 million for the Ryuk Ransomware attack.
EBITDA was $96 million, an increase of $6 million over prior year, and EBITDA margin was 11%, which was flat to prior year.
EBIT was $56 million, an increase of $8 million over prior year, and EBIT margin was 6%, which was a slight increase over prior year.
Interest expense, including finance interest was $36 million.
Our tax provision was a benefit of about $300,000 and includes a benefit related to a U.K. tax legislation change, which also contributed about $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter.
Shares outstanding were approximately 179 million.
Let me now turn to each segment's performance.
It is important to note that the year-over-year comparison includes the impact of COVID.
Prior year results saw a positive impact on e-commerce revenue and an adverse impact on SendTech and Presort.
As such, I will also provide growth rates from 2019 to 2021 for the larger transactional parts of our business.
Within e-commerce, revenue grew 3% to $418 million and also grew from first quarter levels.
The revenue growth over prior year was driven by our cross-border services and partially offset by lower domestic parcel and digital services.
Domestic parcel volumes were $44 million in the quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of 2019, e-commerce revenue grew 48%.
Demand for our services continues to be strong as new business signings accelerated from the first quarter as we're getting merchants onboarded for peak season while balancing demand from current clients.
We also continue to have success with bundling our services which now represents close to 50% of all new business.
EBITDA for the quarter was $8 million.
EBIT was a loss of $11 million.
Both EBIT and EBITDA were meaningful improvements from prior year.
We also made significant progress sequentially where second quarter's EBIT margins improved nearly 400 basis points as compared to first quarter, as we were able to improve our productivity and work through some of the residual impact from last year's peak that we saw earlier in the first quarter.
We continue to work to improve service levels and make progress against our productivity initiatives within our domestic parcel services.
While still dealing with industrywide concerns around high transportation costs and a competitive labor market.
We made progress on several unit economics as compared to the first quarter, with the greatest being around labor and transportation cost per piece.
We saw a reduction in our labor cost per piece in part due to the contribution of our new management talent, along with the maturation of our existing workforce.
Parcels processed per hour continued to improve from first quarter levels.
Transportation cost per piece also improved versus prior quarter as we continue to better optimize our shipping lanes.
Our improvement in execution, coupled with better network balancing are certainly yielding results.
We continue to invest in automation, including high-end sorters in our larger facilities and sort-to-light automation in our midsized facilities.
We also announced our partnership with Ambi Robotics last month, which we will be rolling out across our network over the next few years.
These initiatives take time to integrate, train our employees and produce results.
And while we're seeing some early benefits, we expect to yield additional benefits during the upcoming peak season.
Also, as mentioned last quarter, we are in the process of opening two new sites and upgrading another.
We expect to have this completed prior to the peak season, and it will allow us to handle volumes more efficiently.
Ultimately, we expect transportation and labor productivity, along with optimizing our final mile costs to be critical drivers in attaining our long-term e-commerce margins.
And as Marc mentioned, we have made some important additions to our e-commerce management team in order to execute this plan.
It is an exciting time, and our e-commerce business is moving in the right direction with substantial opportunities still in front of us.
Our Presort Services and SendTech businesses both turned in solid performances, which were in line with our expectations.
Within Presort, revenue was $135 million and grew 14% compared to the second quarter of 2019, Presort revenue grew 5%.
Average daily volumes grew 10% over prior year, largely driven by growth in first-class volumes of 4% and Marketing Mail volumes of 39%.
EBITDA was $23 million and EBITDA margin was 17%.
EBIT was $16 million and EBIT margin was 12%.
EBIT and EBITDA dollars improved from prior year due to revenue growth and margin expansion.
We remained focused on our productivity initiatives, having improved pieces fed per labor hour by 3%, resulting in 60,000 less processing hours versus prior year.
Within SendTech, revenue was $346 million and grew 6%.
We continue to differentiate ourselves in the market with a wide range of end-to-end mailing and shipping offerings that are attractive to businesses ranging from large enterprises to small offices.
SendTech's SaaS-based shipping products grew at a low double-digit rate over prior year to $31 million this quarter.
The number of labels printed through our shipping offering grew over 30% and paid subscriptions grew about 70% over prior year.
Additionally, shipping volumes that our U.S. clients finance grew nearly 70% over prior year.
Our end-to-end value proposition continues to resonate with clients as they adopt and use these new offerings, which bring value to their businesses.
Equipment sales grew 46% over prior year.
Compared to the second quarter 2019, equipment sales grew 1%, which is an important metric as this is a key indicator for future streams in the traditional side of the SendTech business.
This also points to how our new sending products are resonating with clients and helping to strengthen our portfolio.
We continue to see strong placement of our SendPro C and mailstation multipurpose devices.
Our international operations also saw strong equipment sales growth, and we continue to roll out new products in these markets.
Through the quarter, we, like many others, experienced some transportation challenges related to our supply chain.
We are proactively managing our inventory and are able to place a significant level of new equipment despite those challenges.
Looking ahead at the second half of the year, we continue to closely monitor the semiconductor industry and potential supply shortage concerns.
While it is still a bit too early to tell, we would expect the impacts, if any, to be more pronounced in the fourth quarter.
We will look to mitigate any potential supply shortages by working closely with our suppliers and repositioning our solutions with our clients as necessary.
EBITDA was $115 million and EBITDA margin was 33%.
EBIT was $107 million and EBIT margin was 31%.
EBIT and EBITDA dollars improved from prior year and was the third consecutive quarter of improvement for both metrics.
Let me now turn to our full year outlook, which is in line with what we have previously communicated.
As we all know, there is still a level of uncertainty in the macro environment, particularly as new COVID variants continue to ramp up and concerns around supply chain remain, and we will continue to monitor any potential impacts closely.
We still expect annual revenue at constant currency to grow over prior year in the low to mid-single-digit range.
We still expect adjusted earnings per share to grow over prior year and more specifically, to be in the $0.35 to $0.42 range.
We still expect free cash flow to be lower than prior year due to items that benefited 2020 and are not expected to continue at the same level this year.
Prior year included a lower level of capex and finance receivables and higher customer deposits.
We also expect our tax rate in the second half to be higher and return to more normal levels.
Looking at the timing, we expect third quarter revenue to be in line with second quarter and the fourth quarter to be larger than the third, given a strong holiday peak season.
Taking the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance into consideration, we currently expect our third quarter to represent nearly 20% of our full year attainment.
Let me conclude on this.
In the beginning of the year, we said that we expected revenue and adjusted earnings per share to grow, and we remain committed to this outlook.
Each segment has delivered a solid performance through the first half of the year, improving revenue, EBITDA and EBIT from prior year.
We continue to generate good free cash flow and remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We also continue to make measurable progress and are confident in our ability to achieve our financial objectives.
","Pitney Bowes delivered a solid second quarter, demonstrating growth across all businesses. Overall revenue increased 6% and EBIT improved 16% at constant currency. Presort and SendTech businesses both grew revenue and EBIT, with Presort volumes recovering towards pre-pandemic levels and SendTech benefiting from its SendPro product family and SaaS-based shipping portfolio. Global e-commerce turned EBITDA positive and saw improved EBIT despite a tough comparison, indicating progress toward profitability. Despite facing supply chain challenges, equipment sales grew 46%. Notably, the company made significant progress on unit economics in e-commerce, particularly in labor and transportation costs. The company's full-year outlook remains unchanged, with revenue expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range and adjusted earnings per share projected to be between $0.35 and $0.42."
EMR_q2_2021.txt,"Today, I'm joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan.
Please join me on Slide two.
Turning to Slide three.
I'd like to briefly highlight that Emerson has been publishing a corporate social responsibility report for many years now.
We have renamed the report The Emerson Environmental, Social and Governance Report and are excited to highlight all of the goals, momentum and global standards that our organization is working toward.
In particular, our environmental sustainability framework, greening of Emerson, by Emerson and with Emerson, captures our internal sustainability efforts, our enablement of our customer sustainability journeys through our products and solutions and our collaboration efforts with various sustainability stakeholders.
I encourage you to review the document next month when it is published.
I'd like to briefly mention our recent Emerson Exchange Virtual Series, which took place from November through March.
Emerson Exchange is a chance for our customer base to interact with other users, industry experts and Emerson technology leaders.
Despite the obvious in-person limitations of the pandemic, Emerson had a tremendously successful virtual engagement with customers, focusing on digital transformation, sustainability, technology and many other topics.
This virtual framework dramatically expanded the reach of this already very popular user event.
Due to the success of the hybrid format, we will likely be adopting such a format going forward.
More details to follow as the time and place for the next Emerson Exchange event is finalized.
Over to you, Lal.
I would like to say a few things before passing it on to Frank.
Firstly, to our global team, three things.
This was one that was delivered based on strong execution, which required agility and creativity as we jumped over a number of hurdles over the last three months.
The result was top-class profit leverage over 40% across our operations, well done by everyone.
Momentum is building, and it's more broadly today and across a large number of our markets than it was three months ago.
This expansion across both platforms, now as the cycle expands, will enable us to make critical technology investments, building on our strong differentiation and customer relevance.
You energize me every day in the journey and on the journey that we're taking together.
Secondly, I would like to recognize David Farr, who stepped -- whose Board service concluded today after more than 20 years.
Jim is a highly qualified independent director who is extremely passionate about people, culture and the future of Emerson.
I look forward to working alongside Jim and our entire Board.
Frank, over to you.
We had a strong quarter, and I'd like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides.
The strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end markets, combined with the benefits from our cost reset actions, drove strong operating performance and strong financial results in the second quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.97, ahead of our guidance midpoint of $0.89 and representing 9% growth versus the prior year.
Demand strengthened significantly with sales ahead of expectations at 2% underlying growth and March orders toward the high end of expectations at 4% underlying growth.
Within that growth number for the orders, significantly, Automation Solutions continues its steady improvement in both orders and sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across all its lines of business and in all geographies with 11% sales growth and 21% orders growth for the trailing three months through March.
The cost reset benefits for the program that we implemented almost two years ago are being realized as planned, driving adjusted segment EBIT growth of 15% and 150 basis points of increased margin to 19.1%.
Additionally, cash flow continues to be strong, up 37% year-over-year with free cash flow up nearly 50%.
This represents 125% conversion of net earnings.
We continue to execute on the remaining elements of our cost reset actions.
With the bulk of it behind us at this point, we initiated $21 million of additional restructuring in the quarter.
Please turn to the next slide, if you would, for comments on the EPS, the earnings per share bridge.
Operational performance was very strong in the quarter, adding $0.14 to adjusted EPS.
As we guided in February, stock compensation was a significant headwind in the quarter due to the mark-to-market impact, which was caused by the difference in the share price at the end of last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter.
Of course, you'll recall that last year, share prices in general were all severely depressed with the onset of COVID and we closed last year's second quarter at $48 versus $90 this year.
And that headwind was within $0.01 of the guidance that we gave you in February.
Tax, currency and other miscellaneous items netted to about $0.04 of tailwind and a small impact from share repurchase.
So in total, again, adjusted earnings per share was $0.97 versus the guide of $0.89.
Please go to the next slide for comments on the P&L.
So as I mentioned, underlying sales growth exceeded expectations at 2% and it was 6% on a reported basis, including acquisitions and currency.
Gross profit slipped just a bit, 10 basis points, mainly due to business mix, given the growth in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business.
SG&A increased by 10 basis points, but the real story here is that excluding the stock compensation impact, operationally, it was down 220 basis points, indicative of the magnitude of the cost reduction activity and the flow-through of the benefits.
We had very strong leverage on SG&A, and the spend was actually down year-over-year when you exclude the impact of the stock comp.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.2%, and our effective tax rate was within one point of last year.
Share count at 603 million.
And again, adjusted earnings per share at $0.97.
If you please turn to the next slide, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow.
Adjusted segment EBIT increased 15% with the margin increasing 150 basis points to 19.1%, as I said earlier.
Leverage on the volume and cost reset benefits offset the material cost headwinds that we did see in the quarter.
Again, stock comp was nearly a $100 million headwind.
It was partially offset by some other corporate items.
Adjusted pre-tax earnings were down 20 basis points to 17.3%, again, as the impact of the mark-to-market on the stock comp [Indecipherable].
Operating cash flow was very strong, almost a record again at $807 million, up 37%.
Free cash flow at $707 million was up 48%, driven by the strong earnings and favorable balance sheet items.
Lastly, trade working capital was down to 16.8% of sales as the impact and the distortions from the COVID-related volume decline are beginning to normalize and as the businesses do a good job managing inventory as we return to growth.
Please turn to the next slide, we'll go through Automation Solutions.
Orders continue to turn upward here.
We were at negative 5% on a trailing three-month basis, making good progress, and we're on the trajectory that we have been mapping out for several months.
Underlying sales were above expectations at negative 2%, and we're encouraged to see the continued sequential improvement in order rates underpinning the sales.
China was very strong, and they were favorable comps, but also due to good strength in discrete, chemical and energy markets.
Our demand in North America improved sequentially, but it did lag other world areas.
However, there are noteworthy pockets of growth, very encouraging signs in both discrete, life science, food and beverage and power generation.
Importantly, we also continue to see increasing KOB3 activity across our process automation customer base, driven by increased STOs and focused spend on opex and productivity.
Margin in the platform increased 180 basis points of adjusted EBIT, 230 basis points at adjusted EBITDA driven by the cost reset savings.
The OSI integration continues to go well.
The expected synergies are being realized, and we are increasingly encouraged in validating the case that we made for the acquisition when we did it last October.
Backlog is roughly flat sequentially at $5.3 billion, but it is up 14% year-to-date.
Please turn to the next slide, where we review Commercial & Residential Solutions.
The story here is very, very strong growth.
Orders continue to strengthen with the March underlying trailing three-month rate at 21%.
The demand is primarily driven by ongoing strength in residential end markets, but significantly cold chain, professional tools and other commercial and industrial markets are also picking up and contributing to the growth.
All businesses in all regions were positive, indicative of the trend.
Strong growth in China, over 50%, was attributable to commercial HVAC and cold chain demand in addition to the favorable comp.
Europe grew 9% on the strength of continued demand for heat pumps and other energy-efficient sustainable solutions.
Margins improved 40 basis points at the adjusted EBIT level.
Cost reduction benefits were somewhat offset by price/cost headwinds, which we'll discuss a little more when we cover the guidance.
Commercial & Residential backlog has increased almost 60% year-to-date to about $1 billion.
This is about $400 million above what we would consider normal for this business.
Operations are working through the significant challenges to meet strong customer demand across most of the businesses in this platform.
Please go to the next slide, and we'll talk about the updated guidance for the year.
Based on the strength we see in orders, the increasing pace of business, we are very encouraged and we are improving our sales outlook for the year.
We now expect underlying sales in the range of 3% to 6% overall, with Automation Solutions roughly flat and Commercial & Residential up in the 12% to 14% range.
The stronger volume will drive improved profitability.
We now expect 17.5% adjusted EBIT margin for the entire enterprise.
Cash flow was also projected higher at $3.3 billion operating cash flow and $2.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $150 million.
Our tax, capital spending, dividend, share repurchase assumptions remain as they were.
We're raising adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint from $3.70 to $3.90, and we're tightening the range to plus or minus $0.05 from plus or minus $0.10.
We're doing this, increasing the guidance in the face of additional headwinds to profitability, because we're very encouraged by the underlying strength of the business and the read-through of the cost reset actions that the business has been working very diligently now for almost two years.
The additional headwinds, you can see in the margin there on the right of the slide, mainly $50 million more of unfavorable price/cost, driven by continuing increases in raw materials costs and about another $20 million of stock comp expense versus what we estimated back in February.
The speed and the magnitude of the price increases in key inputs, steel, copper, plastic resins is unprecedented.
Operations are actively and effectively working to mitigate the margin impact through selected price and cost containment actions, and the good work that they're doing gives us the confidence to raise the guidance despite these increased headwinds.
On the plus side, we expect to retain about $10 million more in the year of the COVID-related savings than we previously estimated as basic activity like travel and everything that goes with it comes back in more slowly than we would have thought a couple of months ago.
If you please go to the next slide, I'll give you an update on orders.
So as I mentioned earlier, our underlying trailing three-month orders turned positive in the month of March at 4%.
This is consistent with the upper range of the guidance that we provided to you in February.
It's driven by ongoing strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions, as you can see, at 21%, and continued significant improvement in Automation Solutions as our global markets recover.
And increasingly, we see improvement in our traditional process industries as well in North America.
We expect general demand to remain strong for the balance of the year.
We expect the Automation Solutions markets to accelerate through the second half and the Commercial & Residential HVAC demand will go up somewhat later in the year, but we would expect to see some of the other end markets, commercial, professional tools and such, recover to partially offset that tapering off in Commercial & Residential.
So all in all, we believe we have a good outlook for the second half of the year.
If you please go to the next slide, the underlying sales growth outlook.
Based on what we see and the pace of the improvement in orders, for the second half, we see growth in the high single-digits range at about 7% to 11%, and that will drive the full year growth of 3% to 6%.
We expect net sales to be just a bit above $18 billion.
I'll just cover a few charts here with the group.
Again, increased momentum turning to -- on Chart 15 here.
First, on Automation Solutions, we are -- we were led through the recovery in the first half by our discrete and early cycle businesses within the platform.
And essentially, what's occurred as we've navigated through the second quarter is a broader recovery in their -- in the mid-cycle elements of this platform.
So we see a return to growth in Q3, which is very positive after five down quarters in this business and continued demand in short cycle as well as the acceleration in the core process automation markets in the back half of the year, yielding a 4% to 8% range in the second half and a flat year guidance on sales.
If you turn to Page 16, I'll give you some color on what's going on in the world areas.
Perhaps, before I do that though, I'll just paint it from a KOB perspective.
KOB3 has been incredibly strong, both in our discrete spaces, but more interestingly, as we navigated the second quarter into our process spaces.
Frank referenced the shutdown turnaround activity, which is up double -- mid-double -- teens for the year and the STO schedules are holding in full, honestly, as we go into the summer, into the fall season, which is very encouraging.
The site walk downs are up almost 50% year-over-year, also very encouraging.
And of course, the long-term service agreements are up almost 40% across the world in the business.
Very encouraging to see and really provides the fuel for the underlying activity we're seeing in the process space.
On a KOB1 basis, things are not completely stopped.
Obviously, we digested a significant LNG wave, but there's more activity on the horizon.
We've entered the feed stage on two very important projects: the Baltic LNG and the Golden Island BASF in China.
Those are important opportunities for us in automation.
And secondly, we were awarded the Sempra Costa Azul LNG project on the Pacific Coast, in the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, which has a significant value for us and was awarded and will be booked here in the third quarter.
So there is some activity.
We continue to engage on the KOB1.
And as that starts to loosen up a little bit, I think we're very well positioned.
The tale of the tape, honestly, for the remainder of the year for this business is going to be the Americas.
It's going to be a significant swing from a down 16% first half to a second half in that 10% midpoint.
And we'll see that, we saw that already as we entered April, and we'll continue to see that recovery, I think, as we go through the latter half of the year into 2022.
Europe, an incredibly strong first half, driven by life sciences, activity around biofuels, the number of KOB2-type project awards, and we continue to see that strength, and I feel confident that, that strength will be there into the second half of the year.
Of course, across all of this, the discrete environment has been very, very good into Asia, Europe and in North America, whether it's automotive, medical or semiconductor, and we expect that strength to remain there.
So overall, feeling much better about the second half here and feeling very good about how North America is shaping up for us in automation.
Turning to Chart 17, some comments on Commercial & Residential.
What a great year this team is having.
And obviously, the beneficiaries of a tremendous residential cycle.
Much of it was driven by pandemic inventory levels -- pre-pandemic inventory levels, a prebuild in the cooling season that then we also benefited from a secular shift into suburbs and high family home construction and renovation.
All of that has led into incredible residential strength through the year.
Obviously, my expectation is that it starts to dampen as we get into the latter parts of the fiscal year.
However, the mid-cycle professional tools, cold chain businesses are accelerating, and that's what we see here in this very balanced perspective for this business throughout 2021, and I'm very encouraged by what we're seeing in the later cycle pieces.
Of course, we -- there's some good underlying technology evolutions as well that will impact the residential, be it the refrigerant changes or the heat pump moves in Europe, which are -- which will continue to drive good growth for the businesses.
And then turning to Page 18.
Again, a very balanced picture here from a world area perspective.
And overall, a strong second half with the commercial industrial segment of this business continuing to improve as the residential market start to taper, as I discussed.
I think all the world areas should grow, again, in the low double-digit to mid-teen range as we go into the second half.
In the Americas, we are seeing residential demand remained strong in the near term and the commercial market is really starting to accelerate.
And the cold chain piece, particularly, which is driven by transport and aftermarket, and then we see the tools momentum building in the professional channel.
So very encouraged by that.
Europe, I mentioned heat pump activity.
We expect that to stay strong.
And of course, a surge in construction should bolster our plumbing and electrical tools business.
And then lastly, in Asia, China is the headline contributor to growth as some of you have already noted, and demand is driven by commercial air conditioning and cold chain solutions.
So with that, Pete, I'll turn it to Page 19, and we'll go to Q&A.
","Emerson reported its second quarter earnings, surpassing expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, a 9% increase year-over-year. Despite challenges from unprecedented input cost increases and elevated stock compensation, the company raised its full-year guidance to $3.90 plus or minus $0.05 in adjusted earnings per share. Underlying sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by robust demand in Commercial & Residential Solutions (11% growth) and early signs of recovery in Automation Solutions. The company's cost reset program continues to deliver benefits, with adjusted segment EBIT increasing 15% and margins expanding to 19.1%. Cash flow remains strong, with operating cash flow and free cash flow both increasing. Emerson remains optimistic about the second half of the year, expecting growth in the high single-digits range and continued momentum in key markets."
KRG_q3_2021.txt,"Actual results may differ materially from these statements.
For more information about the factors that can adversely affect Company's results, please see our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K.
Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
They worked tirelessly to ensure the successful combination of these 2 high-quality and complementary real estate platforms.
For those of you that were with us before the transaction, please know that if it wasn't for all of the remarkable things that we've accomplished together over the past several years, none of this would have been possible.
I've enjoyed getting to know many of you over the past several months and I have consistently been impressed with your positive attitude and exceptional professionalism.
We're so excited to have you join us as we embark on this new era of excellence.
This merger has been transformative for all of us yet our model remains unchanged.
We are one team with one focus.
As we began to come out of the depths of the pandemic, we talked about how KRG was positioned to seize upon any opportunities that may present themselves.
It was that very same posture that made the merger with RPAI possible resulting in one of the largest open-air owners in the country.
Yet despite the unprecedented stress and dislocation caused by COVID and despite the immense undertaking of completing the merger that impacted every single person at KRG, we were still able to produce a phenomenal quarter of results.
It all goes back to our 3 Ps, Properties, Processes and People and we absolutely excel on all 3 fronts.
The quality of our results also speaks volumes about the health of the retail environment.
The long-term viability of open-air retail real estate and the durability of our cash flows.
Our property serve not only as a last-minute last mile fulfillment hub for retailers but as an access point for consumers and communities.
The demand for our great real estate is evident, not only in traffic which is up versus 2019, but also in the accelerated leasing volumes and resulting spreads.
We signed approximately 5,000 square feet in the third quarter including 7 anchor leases, 3 lease for grocers.
In the past 2 quarters, we leased over 1.2 million square feet which are unprecedented levels for our legacy portfolio.
Blended lease spreads were 20.7% and 13.4% on a GAAP and cash basis respectively.
Our lease rate continues to rebound.
It is now at 92.8% for the portfolio.
This 130 basis point increase from last quarter is another indication of the continuing recovery in our operation and -- operational and financial performance.
The outsize leasing volume continues to widen our total retail portfolio leased to occupied spread to 400 basis points with current sign not-open NOI of approximately $14 million.
Together with the legacy RPAI portfolio, we have signed not-open NOI of approximately $33 million.
Said another way, our stock is significantly undervalued.
One of the drivers behind the widening lease to occupied spread is the success, we are experiencing in our Anchor Acceleration program.
We signed another 5 anchor leases this quarter for a cumulative total of 12 anchor leases since the program's inception.
These 12 leases are expected to generate average cash yields of over 26% with comparable spreads of 14% on a cash basis.
While the program as far from over, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made.
Let's turn to a topic I'm sure you're all focused on.
The merger of RPAI and KRG is a great strategic match that lines up perfectly with many of the macro trends we're seeing impacting our industry.
First, as is with everything in KRG, it's about the real estate.
As you can see from our operating results, our top quality assets are benefiting from being in high-growth, warmer and cheaper markets.
These low tax and business-friendly geographies continue to benefit from the highest population growth and corporate relocations.
This merger more than doubled the GLA and ABR that KRG owns in those markets.
We now have nearly 60% of our ABR in warmer and cheaper markets, 40% of which belongs in Texas and Florida alone.
An added benefit of the merger is that establishing a significant presence in select strategic gateway markets.
The combined portfolio now has 26% of value in superzip [Phonetic] neighborhoods, the second highest percentage in the sector.
Additionally, our portfolio of mix of predominantly grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers are now complemented by a vibrant mixed use assets, thereby providing greater optionality to help serve both retailers and consumers.
Many of these mixed-use and lifestyle assets have experiential components that were disproportionately impacted by COVID and now are seeing a significant resurgence in demand, while customers reembrace the live, work and play environment.
A final benefit, I'd like to point out is that KRG is now a top 5 open-air shopping center REIT.
The increased scale provide numerous operational and capital market benefits.
On the operational side, we'll be better able to serve retailers by having a balanced variety of additional high-quality assets.
We also believe the combined operations platform will lead to increased NOI margins across the portfolio.
On the capital market side, KRG will become a serial issuer of public bonds that will lower our debt cost and improve our risk profile.
Likewise, the larger equity market cap will make our stock more liquid and expand the universe of potential equity investors.
In addition to the accretion from the merger, synergies will create a significant economic impact from the merger and Heath will address those momentarily.
That being said, we are just as excited about the value of our new entitled land.
Our development philosophy has never been nor will it ever be a mandate.
We evaluate each project based on the needs of the underlying real estate, the timing of the development cycle and the resulting risk-adjusted returns.
Given this mantra, there are times where we may decide it's better to wait or take on a partner to pursue alternatives.
One example is The Corner.
We entered into a 50-50 joint venture to develop 285 apartment units and 24,000 square feet of ground floor retail.
In doing so KRG sold the land to the venture, will earn development fees and is expected to contribute no additional capital.
We will use this discipline to examine all of our real estate included -- including the newly acquired entitled land and determine the best course of action for each opportunity to maximize shareholder value.
No matter what of course of action -- course of action we will take, we will always keep in mind our best-in-class balance sheet.
As part of our due diligence, we had a third party value each of the entitled land parcels.
We believe the approximate value of this entitled land as is with no additional spend is between $125 and $180 million.
That represents a tremendous opportunity for KRG to showcase our capital allocation part.
Regarding the integration of the merger, we are making excellent progress.
We were able to hit the ground running on day 1 due to our pre-close planning.
We not only determine what the combined team would look like, but each business unit had multiple meetings and established both how to integrate the team, their systems and how to operate going forward.
No integration of 2 companies is flawless but we are very pleased where we are to date.
This is a testament to our people.
We are a premier open-air shopping center REIT and I'm proud of the progress our team has made.
KRG remains committed to its primary focus of continuing to grow operating cash flows.
The completed merger paired with a strong quarter of operational results is another step in the right direction.
I can't emphasize enough how excited I am about the processes, properties and especially the people of KRG.
I want to echo John's gratitude for all the hard work that's gone into completing the transaction and the ongoing integration activities.
We are confident that when the dust settles, KRG will have a best-in-class platform across every single business unit.
We are looking forward to doing great things together.
To say this transaction has been full circle for me is an understatement, suffice to say that life works in mysterious ways.
Turning to KRG's stand-alone third quarter results, we generated $0.25 of NAREIT FFO and $0.33 of FFO as adjusted.
As a reminder, we were reporting 2021 FFO on an as adjusted basis so as to reduce the noise associated with 2020 receivables, 2020 bad debt and the cost associated with the merger.
As set forth on page 19 of our supplemental, the net 2022 collection impact in the third quarter was minimal with the collection of $2.4 million of prior bad debt, offset by $300,000 of accounts receivable we now deemed uncollectible.
Our same property NOI growth for the third quarter is 10.8% primarily driven by a reduction in bad debt as compared to the prior year period.
This includes the benefit of approximately $2.1 million of previously written-off bad debt that we collected in the third quarter.
Excluding those amounts, our same-store NOI growth would be 6%.
It is also important to note that when evaluating our same-store results for 2021, keep in mind that KRG consistently achieved the highest levels of rent collections in 2020, thereby trading more challenging comparable period.
With respect to outstanding accounts receivable items as of last Friday, the balance on our outstanding deferred rent stands at $1.7 million as compared to $6.1 million as of December 31, 2020.
Our small business loan program has been extremely successful and not a single borrower under the program is delinquent or has defaulted.
Our balance sheet and liquidity profile not only remain solid but continue to improve.
Our net debt to EBITDA was 6.1 times, down from 6.4 times last quarter.
Pro forma for the merger, third quarter net debt to EBITDA is 6 times along with roughly $1 billion of liquidity, adding in $33 million of signed not-open NOI for the combined portfolio, our net debt to EBITDA would be 6 times.
We are in a great position to not only weather any storm, but to also take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves.
We are also proud to announce our inaugural credit rating from Fitch Ratings of triple B with a stable outlook.
We believe, along with our investment grade ratings from Moody's and S&P, the KRG is well positioned to establish itself as a serial public bond issuer.
I know many of you are anxious to understand the full earnings accretion associated with the merger and we are equally anxious to share with you the details behind our growing enthusiasm.
However, in light of the fact that we just closed the merger last week and that we are in the middle of our budget season prudence dictates that we wait until we give our combined fourth quarter results and 2022 guidance early next year.
What I can share is that with each day our conviction regarding the merger grows exponentially.
In the meantime, to help with your modeling, we can provide some additional detail regarding synergy savings.
As a reminder, we estimated stabilized cash synergies of $27 million to $29 million and stabilized GAAP synergies of $34 million to $36 million.
As of today, we are still comfortable with that range.
In fact, as of the closing approximately $21 million of annualized GAAP savings have already been achieved.
It is important to note that we anticipate realizing on the additional annualized $13 million to $15 million of GAAP synergies over the next 12 to 18 months.
We will provide updated detail with respect to the timing of the remaining synergies when we report our combined fourth quarter results and 2022 guidance.
Finally, due to the timing of the closing of the merger and the challenge in -- challenge of determining correct guidance for a partial quarter we are suspending our 2021 guidance.
We are confident based on performance to date that KRG's stand-alone 2021 results are on track to outperform our last published guidance.
I will further share that based on our initial review of the preliminary operating results for RPAI in the third quarter, it would be safe to assume that they were also on track to outperform the last published guidance.
We look forward to reporting combined fourth quarter results and issuing 2022 guidance in February.
","Following the transformative merger with RPAI, KRG has emerged as a top 5 open-air shopping center REIT with a balanced portfolio concentrated in high-growth, warmer, and cheaper markets. The merger has significantly increased KRG's assets, with nearly 60% of ABR now located in these desirable regions, including 40% in Texas and Florida alone. Additionally, the portfolio now includes a mix of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers complemented by mixed-use assets. Notably, the blended lease spreads improved to 20.7% (GAAP basis) and 13.4% (cash basis), and leasing volumes remain strong with a signed not-open NOI of approximately $33 million for the combined portfolio. The integration of the merger is progressing well, with $21 million of annualized GAAP savings already achieved. Stand-alone Q3 results were strong, with NAREIT FFO per share of $0.25 and FFO as adjusted of $0.33. KRG's solid balance sheet and liquidity position were further enhanced by a Fitch Ratings upgrade to triple B with a stable outlook. Despite the merger, KRG is confident that stand-alone 2021 results will outperform previous guidance, and the combined fourth-quarter results and 2022 guidance will be issued in February."
JLL_q2_2021.txt,"Our exceptional performance this quarter, among the broader market recovery, demonstrates the strengths of our global platform, resilient business model and continued operational and strategic execution of our long-term plan.
Further, we continue to advance our sustainability agenda and development of our related market-leading product capability.
Our most recent responsible real estate survey reaffirm that reducing the environmental impact is a key priority across the industry for both real estate occupiers and investors.
We take pride in our 2020 JLL Global Sustainability Report, which highlights our latest initiatives including our commitment to net 0 carbon emissions by 2040 across all areas of operation, including client sites management globally as well as our need to be fully equipped to help clients in their own journey.
We changed the name of our Corporate Solutions Group to Work Dynamics to more clearly reflect that our technology-enabled and wide-ranging services help our clients enhance the productivity of their people as employees are increasingly empowered to make the decisions on how and where they work.
Our suite of solutions also benefits the performance of their portfolios and help them realize their sustainability and broader ESG goals.
I'd like to express my gratitude for our employees who continue to work diligently and provide outstanding service to our clients and community.
The pace of activity increased sharply throughout the first half of the year, leaving many of our teams over extended.
The tireless efforts and its ongoing challenges and uncertainties embody the strong culture of teamwork and collaboration at JLL.
Let me briefly touch on the future of office, subject being closely analyzed by our best-in-class research team.
While the actual long-lasting effects of the pandemic remain unclear, there are a couple of key points I would like to highlight.
The first is that the office will remain the center of the work ecosystem.
We believe that the pandemic has reinforced the important role that the office can play in fostering and cultivating each company's unique culture and innovation.
The second point is that employees are increasingly expecting, if not demanding, additional flexibility and the ability to choose where and how they work, leading to the doable presence of hybrid work.
These demands have also been coupled with health, wellness and safety becoming top of mind for employees.
As a result, employers are now increasingly evaluating holistic approaches to address these demands, which often require considerable investment into existing and new office space.
We imagine workspaces which serve to not only attract and retain employees but also enhance their sense of safety and well-being are becoming a new currency in the war for talent.
This leads me to conclude that the initial net impact on future space demand and footprints for investment-grade office buildings will be relatively minor.
We believe that the combination of growth from job creation, dedensification and the addition of collaboration space will broadly offset any anticipated reductions in workspace as companies continue to embrace hybrid work models.
Furthermore, we believe that given the world-class capabilities of our project management business, we are well positioned to benefit from accelerated demand for these services as we assist our clients as they embark upon these transformations.
The increasing complexity required to create these global integrated workplace transformation will in turn demand more technology across not only the operations of the building but the entire ecosystem.
We are encouraged that our significant investment in technology and our desire to provide client access to leading-edge technology results in a significant competitive advantage.
The power of data leading to better decision-making will allow JLL to be in the center of this ecosystem.
We continue to work diligently with our clients as a strategic advisor as they transition to the new post-pandemic normal and assist in the development of hybrid work models centered around employee satisfaction and productivity.
Turning to the market environment.
Transaction activity saw sharp recoveries across the world.
JLL's research reports that the tentative signs of improvement in global office leasing activity witnessed in the first quarter have solidified and continued throughout the second quarter.
Quarterly global leasing volumes were 44% higher than a year ago.
However, they are still 36% below Q2 2019.
Across all the three regions, quarterly leasing volumes are below where they were in 2019 with the U.S., the hardest hit at a 44% decline, while Europe and Asia Pacific recorded declines of 32% and 21%, respectively.
Our tenant pricing conditions persist in most markets.
We are seeing a noticeable stabilization and headline rates.
The recovery across capital markets broadened in the second quarter with global transaction volumes marking a 103% increase on the trough a year ago and a 2% increase from Q2 2019.
Each region posted significant year-on-year gains in transaction volumes with activity is particularly robust in markets with sectorial diversity and opportunities of scale.
Allocations to the real estate sector are strengthening as lender diversity and risk appetite trend toward pre-pandemic normalcy.
Assuming no major setback in the global fight against COVID-19, the positive trends recorded in the second quarter are anticipated to carry on in the second half, fueling continued recovery across the commercial real estate industry and global macro economy.
For that backdrop, I'm pleased to turn the attention toward our second quarter performance.
Our exceptional results reflect the continued momentum across our business that we have witnessed since the depths of the pandemic.
We delivered excellent second quarter top and bottom-line performance, standard operating margins and continue to execute on our long-term strategy.
Consolidated revenue rose 18% to $4.5 billion and fee revenue increased 41% to $1.8 billion in local currency.
Adjusted EBITDA of $332 million represented an increase of over 200% from the prior year, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 18.5% from 8.3% in local currency, driven by the significant recovery of our transaction-based service lines, cost mitigation actions taken in 2020, realization of growth initiatives and select discrete items.
Adjusted net income totaled $220.1 million for the quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $4.20.
Our transaction-based service lines recorded significant growth across all three regions.
Leasing benefited from strong demand in the industrial and life sciences sector while industrial and multifamily debt origination were key drivers for Capital Markets outperformance.
We recently passed the two-year anniversary of our acquisition of HFF and are pleased that the acquisition has delivered on both our strategic and financial ambitions despite the pandemic.
All of the key secular trends driving growth in our industry is increasing capital flows to real estate.
The addition of the HFF platform with its market-leading position in the U.S. allows us to not only become a top two player in the U.S. capital markets business but also cements the strengths of our global platform to forge greater ties with the world's largest investors.
I also would like to provide an update on the financial synergies we projected when the HFF acquisition transaction was announced in 2019.
A year ago, we achieved our first 12-month synergy target of $28 million despite unforeseen pandemic headwinds.
Having just passed the two-year anniversary of the acquisition, I'm pleased to say that we have achieved our target $50 million of synergies on a run rate basis, which we had originally predicted within a two- to three-year time frame.
The strong recovery in our transaction-based service lines were complemented by solid growth in our property and facility management and advisory consulting and other businesses.
The resilience of these service lines continues to benefit JLL throughout the course of this pandemic, and we are encouraged by the overall trends supporting their growth.
Over the course of the quarter, we continue to invest to drive future growth, focusing on investments that strengthen and differentiate our market leadership, positioning JLL for long-term growth.
For example, we announced the launch of sustainable operations for now the real estate industry's only end-to-end sustainability product offering developed to help companies configure, launch and manage portfoliowide sustainability programs.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $84 million in JLL Technologies investments, bringing the year-to-date amount to $109 million.
The continued investment through our JLL Technologies business furthers our strategic objectives to be an industry leader in technology innovation.
We also have resumed share repurchases returning approximately $100 million to shareholders through July.
Looking ahead, given the strong momentum in the business, successful integration of HFF and increased visibility into a post-COVID future, we're increasing our 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin target to 16% to 19%, up from 14% to 16% previously.
Our strong results reflect continued disciplined execution as well as the impact of our investments in strategic initiatives over the past several years.
We are encouraged by the broad recovery in our industry and business, particularly Capital Markets and Leasing, and the fact that fee revenue and profitability surpassed 2019 levels in certain service lines by region.
The recovery had exceeded our expectations to date, and we are optimistic about the second half of the year though significant uncertainty remains around the evolution of the pandemic and global economy.
Our balance sheet provides a strong footing to confidently execute our path forward and build upon our operating momentum.
Our overall real estate services fee revenue increased 43% in the second quarter with all regions generating double-digit growth, due in part to lapping COVID-impacted results from the prior year.
Of note, Capital Markets fee revenue increased 110%, inclusive of investment sales advisory up 105%; debt advisory up 157% and loan servicing revenue up 26%, reflecting the market recovery as well as the strength and breadth of our global platform.
Our leasing fee revenue grew 69% and was only down 3% from second quarter 2019.
The Real Estate Services adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% compares with 6.6% a year earlier.
The benefits from our cost reduction actions taken in 2020 and the strong execution and recovery within our transaction-based revenue streams were key drivers of our strong margin performance.
Approximately $16 million of noncash valuation increases to investments by JLL Technologies in early stage proptech companies and a $6 million multifamily loan loss reserve release contributed approximately 130 basis points to the Real Estate Services adjusted EBITDA margin.
It is important to note that second quarter margins clearly benefited from an expense base that is not yet fully normalized, particularly the variable components, such as T&E, but also fixed compensation costs.
In the near term, we intend to accelerate hiring for critical positions to execute on growth opportunities that we see ahead.
Turning to the Americas.
Fee revenue grew year-over-year across all service lines, most markedly in Capital Markets and Leasing.
Within Americas Capital Markets, fee revenue from U.S. investment advisory sales grew 146% and U.S. debt advisory increased 153%.
The U.S. Capital Markets service line witnessed a pronounced rebound with optimism broadening from high-growth areas such as Industrial to other segments of the market, including Retail, Office and Hotels.
Our multifamily debt origination and loan servicing businesses continue to demonstrate strong momentum, highlighted by 26% growth in our loan servicing fee revenue.
Our Americas Capital Markets pipeline has increased from the prior quarter.
Now to Americas Leasing.
Our growth meaningfully outperformed the market, driven by continued gains in the industrial sector as well as strength in Retail, Office and Life Sciences.
Transaction velocity has increased meaningfully, though average deal size has declined.
Our full year 2021 Americas leasing growth pipeline is up 38% from 2020 and 7% from 2019, supporting our optimism for continued strong growth in the second half of 2021, though the evolution of the pandemic will continue to be the critical factor in the recovery rate.
The Americas office sector remains below pre-pandemic levels, but we are encouraged by a multitude of factors indicating an improving market environment.
According to JLL Research, there was a 5% increase from the first quarter in net effective rents in Class A offices across major U.S. cities, bringing the rents to approximately 15% below pre-pandemic levels.
Also, average lease terms increased for the second consecutive quarter to 7.4 years from the fourth quarter 2020 trough of 6.7 years, though it remains below the full year 2019 average of 8.6 years.
Renewals as a percent of the transaction mix, however, remain about two times the historical average mix, at about 56% in the second quarter.
From a profitability standpoint for the quarter, the Americas adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 22.2% from 10.8%, driven primarily by strong growth in transactional businesses as well as the benefit from cost mitigation actions taken in 2020 and an unsustainably low headcount and cost base.
Noncash evaluation increases within our JLL Technologies investments and release of a portion of the multifamily loan loss reserve contributed approximately 180 basis points to the expansion.
In EMEA, fee revenues grew year-over-year across all service lines in much of the region, in part due to reducing pandemic headwinds.
Fee revenue within each of the EMEA capital markets Leasing and Valuation Advisory within the Advisory, Consulting and Other service line was ahead of 2019 levels as vaccinations and a return to the office trend has led to improved market sentiment.
EMEA leasing growth was broad-based across sectors, but most pronounced in Office and Industrial.
EMEA's second quarter profitability was the highest it has been in several years, driven by the higher fee revenue, particularly in the transactional businesses as well as the cost savings, especially in fixed compensation from actions taken over the past year.
Asia Pacific fee revenue growth accelerated to 26% from 12% in the first quarter as activity picked up across most service lines, most notably in Capital Markets and Leasing.
However, our performance was mixed across the region due to varying pandemic recoveries.
Asia Pacific Capital Markets fee revenue exceeded the 2019 level, and its particularly strong year-over-year growth was driven largely by several large transactions in Australia.
Asia Pacific leasing activity continues to pick up across most countries, but the pandemic resurgence is weighing on momentum across the region.
Asia Pacific Advisory and Consulting fee revenue materially exceeded the second quarter 2019 level, with strong growth driven largely by our Valuation Advisory service.
On a global basis, Property & Facility Management service line fee revenue growth was steady, much like it has been throughout the pandemic.
Growth of more annuity-like business is more than offsetting nonrecurring revenues from quick response tasks like supporting pop-up medical sites we saw in 2020.
Additionally, our U.K. mobile engineering business has benefited from some easing and lockdowns compared to the prior year quarter.
Corporate occupiers and investors seek our services not only for higher building management standards but also JLL's broad views regarding best practices in reopening the workplace.
Our global Work Dynamics business fee revenue growth improved to 8%, driven by sustained good growth in the Americas and EMEA starting to recover from the pandemic impact.
We are encouraged by the number of new client wins and contract expansions that are fueling the growth, which is further buoyed by the secular outsourcing trend.
Corporations are increasingly seeking our extensive knowledge and the breadth of our services, including sustainability, delivered seamlessly under our One JLL philosophy.
Fee revenue increased 10%, driven largely by advisory fee growth within its core open-end funds.
Incentive fees of $15 million were driven by strong performance in our public securities mandates.
We now anticipate full year 2021 incentive fees of approximately $45 million, with approximately $10 million coming in the third quarter.
LaSalle's assets under management grew approximately 6% from the prior quarter to $73 billion, driven by valuations and continued capital raising and investment.
LaSalle's $23 million of equity earnings primarily reflects noncash fair value increases across our co-investment portfolio, including our J-REIT.
Shifting now to an update on our balance sheet and capital allocation.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with reported leverage of 0.6 times and liquidity of $2.9 billion inclusive of cash on hand and undrawn credit facility capacity, providing us a solid foundation to execute on our strategic priorities.
We are continuously evaluating growth opportunities, both organic and inorganic, and plan to continue to invest in both LaSalle co-investments and in our JLL Technologies initiatives, which comprise two buckets: one, investments in early stage prop-tech companies that are transforming the real estate industry; and two, investments in technology companies that accompany strategic partnerships to drive revenue growth, such as our investment in rootstock earlier this year.
Overall, we have not completed any significant M&A year-to-date, but are constantly reviewing potential opportunities, holding to our underwriting standards and return thresholds comfortably above our cost of capital.
Importantly, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders while also investing in our business.
Through the end of July, we repurchased $100 million of stock year-to-date and have $500 million remaining on our authorization.
The repurchases to date are roughly equivalent to full year 2020 and more than double the annual dividends distributed in the years preceding 2020.
The level of capital return to shareholders in any particular year will be dependent on a variety of factors, including debt levels, investment opportunities and return expectations, among others.
As we move through the balance of 2021 and next year, we will evaluate the use of capital in the context of the current and anticipated opportunities and the broader economic environment.
We will continue to focus on maintaining flexibility to invest for growth, both organic and inorganic, while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2021, the market environment is quite dynamic, and we are mindful of tightening labor markets globally and an uneven recovery across markets and business lines.
Our improving underlying business fundamentals, strengthening pipelines, global diversified platform and added visibility on the macroeconomic recovery give us confidence that the momentum in the first half of the year is likely to continue.
As Christian mentioned, we are now targeting to operate within an adjusted EBITDA margin range of 16% to 19% for the full year 2021.
This is due to the strong momentum in the business and increased visibility into a post-COVID operating environment as well as the number of steps we've taken to strengthen our business and operate more efficiently over the past several years, including the successful integration of HFF and the cost reduction actions in 2020.
We do expect our cost base to increase in the second half of this year as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities and growth initiatives across business lines, such as our technology capabilities and people, which will drive long-term value.
While we maintain strong cost discipline, we continue to expect certain variable costs, such as T&E to gradually return.
I also reiterate the first half of 2021 included $89 million of equity earnings and $14 million of loan loss reserve releases.
Considering these factors, our earnings mix between the first half and the second half of the year will be different versus prior years, and that we will still expect the majority of our earnings to be generated in the second half of the year, but not to the same extent as in prior years.
We will target to run the company in the near term within the adjusted EBITDA margin range of 16% to 19%, and we will be undertaking a holistic analysis of our long-term financial targets, and we'll have more to share with you next year on this topic.
Christian, back to you.
While we continue to remain confident in our expectations of continued recovery as vaccine availability provides a line of sight to a post-pandemic future, we are mindful of the hurdles that could hamper a complete macroeconomic recovery.
Consumer and business confidence have seen a sharp recovery though uncertainty lingers regarding a return to pre-pandemic norms for behavior patterns.
Further, while inflation continues to be considered transitory for 2021, concerns about an extended inflationary environment, makes the earlier monetary policy tightening cycle.
In closing, the recovering growth outlook, the global scale of our platform, the increased value of our technology investments and continued assets from our outstanding colleagues around the world fuel our confidence in JLL's ongoing strong performance.
Operator, please explain the Q&A process.
","JLL's exceptional second-quarter performance reflects a strong recovery across its global platform. Consolidated revenue and fee revenue saw significant increases of 18% and 41%, respectively, driven by a recovery in transaction-based service lines. Adjusted EBITDA of $332 million marked a 200% increase year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.5%. Quarterly global leasing volumes were 44% higher than a year ago, with strong demand in industrial and life sciences. Transaction volumes in capital markets also rebounded, showing a 103% increase from a year ago. The company's acquisition of HFF has delivered on strategic and financial ambitions, with $50 million in synergies achieved on a run rate basis. JLL Technologies investments totaled $109 million, demonstrating a commitment to industry-leading technology innovation. The company increased its 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin target to 16% to 19%. The strong momentum in the business and visibility into a post-COVID operating environment supports the company's optimism for continued recovery in the second half of the year."
HII_q2_2021.txt,"Actual results may differ.
Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures.
Sales of $2.2 billion were up from $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share of $3.20 was up significantly from $1.30 in the second quarter of last year and pension adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.05.
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a backlog of approximately $48 billion, of which approximately $24 billion is funded.
And Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks.
Shifting to activities in Washington, we are pleased that the congressional markup process for fiscal year 2022 has begun in earnest, following the release of the President's budget request in May.
Of note, the budget requests continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet and supported funding for CVN 80 and CVN 81 forward class aircraft carriers, two Virginia-class submarines, one DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and LHA 9.
We were also pleased that a second DDG 51 class destroyer was included as the number one priority on the Navy's unfunded requirements list for fiscal year 2022, and we look forward to working closely with the Congress during the FY '22 markup process to urge support for the second DDG and other critical priorities, including the efficient production of amphibious warships.
In closing, slide four provides some key takeaways from the recently announced agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology.
The team is preparing for closing of the transaction, and we are very excited about the addition of Alion to the HII family.
Alion is a perfect complement to our existing capabilities in the technology-driven defense and federal solutions space.
The solutions and products they provide are directly in line with the strategic focus that we have articulated for our Technical Solutions business and it enhances our technical capabilities and customer access in high-growth national security markets, including C5ISR, military training and simulation and next-generation technologies and solutions.
We firmly believe that Alion offers significant growth potential and represents an investment in capabilities that support the evolving DoD national security requirements, which, in turn, are expected to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
This was another solid operational quarter, and I'm very pleased with the consistent progress being achieved across our shipbuilding and technical solutions programs.
With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter.
At Ingalls, the team received a contract modification from the U.S. Navy for $107 million to provide additional long-lead time material and advanced procurement activities for amphibious assault ship LHA 9, which increases current funding on this ship to approximately $490 million.
Regarding the potential bundled acquisition of LHA nine with LPD 32 and 33, discussions are ongoing with the customer.
We believe that a bundled acquisition continues to be the most cost-effective method, a procurement of these critically important ships.
In addition, Ingalls was awarded a contract with a potential total value of $724 million over seven years for planning yard services in support of a variety of in-service amphibious class ships, including the LPD 17 San Antonio class and LHA six America class.
Shifting to program status, LHA eight Bougainville is making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction with cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations.
On the DDG program, the team successfully launched the first Flight III Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer, DDG 125, Jack H Lucas in June.
And DDG 121, Frankie Peterson Jr. is expected to conduct sea trials later this year.
On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to conduct sea trials during the fourth quarter and LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. continues to achieve production milestones in support of launch early next year.
At Newport News, there were no significant contract awards to highlight for the quarter, so I will go right on to program status.
CVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 83% complete, and the team remains focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones.
CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 90% complete, and the team remains focused on achieving key test program milestones to support redelivery to the Navy, which is planned for next year.
On the DCS program, the team completed shipment of the final module of SSN 797 Iowa during the quarter.
In addition, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year, and SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float-off milestones as planned in the second half of this year.
And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena is on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year.
At Technical Solutions, contract awards of REMUS 300 unmanned underwater vehicles during the quarter to the U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy affirmed the flexibility and modularity of these units.
TS was also recently awarded a $273 million cost plus fixed fee indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to support maintenance and planning for the overhaul and repair of equipment and systems associated with the Navy aircraft carriers and West Coast Navy surface ships.
In addition, TS was awarded a contract with a 1-year base period and four 1-year options with a total potential value of $346 million to provide a variety of aircraft and operational support services for USAFRICOM, included planning, management, maintenance, logistics and airlift airdrop services and emergency medical care.
Execution within Technical Solutions remains consistent with expectations except for delays in awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs, which we expect to be resolved by the end of the year.
As I close, note that we have included upcoming key program milestones on slide five.
There are no changes from what we have previously provided other than designated those milestones that have been completed with the checkmark.
Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results.
This was primarily due to the growth of Newport News and Ingalls and was partially offset by a decline at Technical Solutions due to the portfolio shaping actions we have taken.
Segment operating income for the quarter of $169 million increased $174 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 7.6% compared to a segment operating margin of negative 0.2% of the second quarter of 2020.
The prior year results were negatively impacted by the Virginia-class submarine program performance as well as impacts related to COVID-19.
Operating income for the quarter of $128 million increased by $71 million from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.7% increased 293 basis points.
These increases were primarily driven by the segments I just mentioned, partially offset by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment.
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.9% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2020.
The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to research and development tax credits recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.3% of revenues resulting in free cash flow of $23 million.
This compares to cash from operations of $201 million and $75 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $126 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $12 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits.
During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million and repurchased approximately 95,000 shares at a cost of $20 million.
Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $670 million increased $48 million or 7.7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues on the NSC program.
Ingalls operating income of $80 million and margin of 11.9% in the quarter were up from the second quarter of 2020, driven by the recognition of a capital investment related incentive for the DDG program that was recognized in DDG-125 as well as higher risk retirement from the LHA 8, LP 28 and LP 29 ships.
Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased $241 million or 21.5% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both the submarine and aircraft carry construction.
Newport News operating income of $76 million and margin of 5.6% in the quarter were up year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts related to the Virginia class performance and COVID in the prior year period.
Now to Technical Solutions on slide 10.
Technical Solutions revenues of $237 million in the quarter decreased 25.9% from the same period last year mainly due to the divestiture of the oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard through a joint venture in the first quarter of this year as well as lower volumes in unmanned systems, partially offset by increases in volumes in the Defense and Federal Solutions.
Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million in the quarter compares to income of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
This increase was primarily driven by higher equity income related to our ship repair partnership with Titan as well as improved performance at Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services, partially offset by lower volumes in the unmanned systems.
Finally, a perspective on the outlook of the shipbuilding for the remaining part of the year.
We continue to see limited opportunities for risk retirements in the third quarter with the remainder of the milestones weighted toward the end of the year.
Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect that the shipbuilding margin for the full year will be in the 7.5% to 8% range.
We continue to expect the Alion acquisition will close in the coming weeks and that we will incur approximately $25 million of onetime pre-tax transaction and financing-related expenses in 2021.
We completed the syndication of the term loan component of the acquisition funding earlier this week, and more details of the specifics are available in the 10-Q.
We will provide a more comprehensive update on our 2021 outlook for Technical Solutions on our third quarter call following the closing of the acquisition.
As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible.
","HII reported solid Q2 results with revenues increasing to $2.2 billion from $2.0 billion in the previous year's second quarter. Diluted earnings per share climbed significantly to $3.20 from $1.30, with adjusted earnings per share standing at $3.05. New contract awards of $1.2 billion contributed to a backlog of $48 billion, including $24 billion in funded contracts. Construction of LHA 8, DDG 125, and other vessels progresses steadily. Technical Solutions, despite portfolio adjustments, secured key contracts for unmanned underwater vehicles and support services for aircraft carriers. Noteworthy was the agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology, enhancing HII's defense and federal solutions capabilities. Ingalls reported increased revenues and operating income driven by DDG and LHA programs. Newport News saw revenue growth in both submarine and aircraft carrier construction, while Technical Solutions recorded a revenue decline due to business portfolio restructuring. The full-year shipbuilding margin is now estimated within the range of 7.5% to 8%."

As a testament to their efforts, our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting strong underlying performance across the business, which we believe was enhanced by the most recent round of government stimulus payments.
The quarter was highlighted by net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories, a 208 basis point increase in gross margin rate and double-digit growth in diluted EPS.
Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, we are increasing our sales and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2021 to reflect our strong first quarter performance.
John will provide additional details on our outlook during his remarks.
As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers continue to be a top priority while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve.
And we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the US population.
Overall, we are executing well against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.
Now let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter.
As we lapped our most difficult quarterly comp sales comparison of the year, net sales decreased 0.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by a comp sales decline of 4.6%.
Notably, comp sales on a 2-year stack basis increased a robust 17.1%, which compares to the 15.9% 2-year stack we delivered last quarter.
Our first quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by growth in average basket size.
And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average they continue to spend more with us compared to last year.
From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales increased 5.7% in February despite a headwind from inclement weather across the country.
For the month of March, which represents our most difficult monthly sales comparison of the year, comp sales declined 11.2%.
Importantly, beginning in mid-March and in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw a meaningful acceleration in sales relative to the first two weeks of the month, especially in our nonconsumable categories.
Comp sales declined 4.3% in April, and while year-over-year growth in nonconsumable sales moderated in comparison to March, they were positive overall despite a more challenging lap.
Overall, each of our three nonconsumable categories delivered a comp sales increase for the quarter.
Of note, comp sales growth of 11.3% in our combined nonconsumable categories and 29.8% on a comparable 2-year stack basis significantly exceeded our expectation and speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum in these product categories, enhanced by the benefit from stimulus.
Once again this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.
Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers acquired over the past several quarters and are working hard to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.
In addition, we recently published our third annual Serving Others report, which provides context related to our ongoing ESG efforts as well as new and updated performance metrics, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead.
Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.
We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and believe we are well positioned to continue advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.
As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock even more growth opportunities as we move forward.
In short, I feel very good about the underlying business and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details.
Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.
As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which we believe was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant benefit to sales, particularly in our nonconsumables categories from the most recent round of government stimulus payments.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.8% in the first quarter.
As Todd noted, this was an increase of 208 basis points and represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion.
This increase was primarily attributable to: higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, a greater proportion of sales coming from our nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales.
These factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs, which were primarily driven by higher rates.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22%, an increase of 152 basis points.
This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales, the most significant of which were store occupancy costs, disaster expenses related to winter storm Uri, retail labor and depreciation and amortization.
Moving down the income statement.
Operating profit for the first quarter increased 4.9% to $908.9 million.
As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 10.8%, an increase of 56 basis points.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% and compares to 22.2% in the first quarter last year.
Finally, earnings per share for the first quarter increased 10.2% to $2.82, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 38% over a 2-year period.
Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders.
Merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 24.2% overall and a 17.6% increase on a per store basis as we cycled a 5.5% decline in inventory on a per store basis, driven by extremely strong sales volumes in Q1 2020.
In anticipation of a more challenging supply environment, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories to better support the sales momentum we were seeing in the business.
And while out of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with the overall quality of our inventory.
The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $703 million, a decrease of 60% but which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 11% over a 2-year period.
This decrease was primarily driven by higher levels of improving inventory positions, including the pull forward of certain inventory purchases I mentioned earlier.
Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $278 million and included: our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.
During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $1 billion and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $100 million.
At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.7 billion.
Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged.
Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives.
We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted-debt-to-EBITDA.
Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021.
We continue to operate at a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business.
Despite continued uncertainty, as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our full year guidance for sales and earnings per share due to our strong Q1 outperformance, which we believe was aided by the latest round of stimulus.
For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales in the range of a 1% decline to an increase of 1%; a same-store sales decline of 5% to 3% but which reflects growth of approximately 11% to 13% on a 2-year stack basis and earnings per share in the range of $9.50 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of approximately 20% to 24% or in the range of approximately 19% to 23% compared to the 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual earnings per share growth on an adjusted basis.
Our earnings per share guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%.
With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.2 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $1.8 billion.
Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook.
First, there could be additional headwinds and tailwinds this year, the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business of which are currently unclear, including but not limited to the potential impacts from legislation and regulatory agency actions.
Given the unusual situation, I will now elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in May.
From the end of Q1 through May 23, comp sales declined by approximately 7% as we continue to cycle extremely difficult prior year comparisons.
As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of May in 2020 was 21.5%.
And while we are nonetheless encouraged with our sales trends, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued uncertainty that still exists, the unique comparisons against last year and the anticipation of fading tailwinds from the most recent round of government stimulus.
That said, as you think about the comp sales cadence of 2021, we continue to expect our performance to be better in the second half, given a more difficult comp sales comparison in the first half.
Turning to gross margin.
As a reminder, gross margin in 2020 benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates in more clear and sensitive nonconsumables categories.
As we move through 2021, we expect pressure in our gross margin rate as we anticipate a less favorable sales mix, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 and higher fuel and transportation costs.
Also, please keep in mind the second and third quarters represent our most challenging laps of the year from a gross margin rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020.
With regards to SG&A, while we continue to expect ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we currently anticipate a significant reduction in COVID-19 related costs compared to the prior year.
Additionally, we continue to expect about $60 million to $70 million incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives this year as we further their rollouts.
This amount includes approximately $23 million in incremental investments made during the first quarter.
However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.
In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results.
As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.
We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.
Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives.
Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth.
We are off to a great start to the year as our team continues to drive strong execution across our portfolio of growth initiatives.
Let me take you through some of the more recent highlights.
Starting with our nonconsumables initiative or NCI.
As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories.
The NCI offering was available in over 7,300 stores at the end of Q1, and we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.
We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we continue to see across our NCI product categories.
Notably, this performance is contributing to an incremental comp sales increase in nonconsumable sales of 8% in our NCI stores and 3% in our NCI Lite stores as compared to stores without the NCI offering.
Given our strong performance to date, coupled with the added flexibility of a more streamlined approach, our plans now include completing the rollout of NCI across nearly all of the chain by year-end 2022.
Moving to our newest concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI.
pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less.
During the quarter, we opened three new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to eight.
And while still early, we continue to be very pleased with the initial results, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin.
In fact, year one annualized sales volumes for our first eight locations are trending between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, with an average gross margin rate of about 40%, which we expect will climb as we continue to scale this exciting initiative.
As a reminder, this compares to year one sales volumes of about $1.4 million for a traditional Dollar General store and a gross margin rate of about 32% for the overall chain in 2020.
For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores.
Importantly, we currently estimate there are about 3,000 pOpshelf store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States.
And when combined with pOpshelf's compelling unit economics, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept.
Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated products.
The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on these items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing.
In fact, DC Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases.
And we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.
Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the continued rollout of additional products, including both national and private brands.
In total, at the end of Q1, we were delivering to more than 17,000 stores from 10 facilities and now expect to complete our initial rollout across the chain by the end of Q2, which is ahead of our previous expectation of year-end as communicated on our Q4 call.
Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative.
During the quarter, we added nearly 18,000 cooler doors across our store base and are on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year.
Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high-capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh.
In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.
Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities.
Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business.
In the first quarter, we completed a total of 836 real estate projects, including 260 new stores, 543 remodels and 33 relocations.
In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,300 stores.
For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total.
We also now plan to add produce in more than 1,000 stores, which compares to our previous expectation of approximately 700 stores.
As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing two of our larger footprint formats, which each comprise about 8,500 square feet of selling space as our base prototypes for nearly all new stores going forward.
With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section with about 30% more feet of selling space and produce in select stores.
We are especially pleased with the sales productivity of these larger formats as average sales per square foot are currently trending about 15% above an average traditional store, which bodes well for the future as we look to grow these unit counts in the years ahead.
In total, we expect more than 550 of our real estate projects this year will be in these formats as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition while driving additional growth.
Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers.
One such example is contactless payment, which is now available in the vast majority of the chain, further extending our convenience proposition, particularly for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience.
Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience.
And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.
Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of digital engagement and customer loyalty.
Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator.
Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions.
This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Safe to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset.
Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach where our goals include: increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability.
We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts, both around rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to even more efficient stocking of our stores.
The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates.
Self-checkout was available in more than 3,400 stores at the end of Q1, which represents more than double the store count at the end of Q4.
And we are pleased with our results including customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback both from customers and employees.
Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we are focused on introducing this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022 as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition while extending our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail.
Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.
As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement.
In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to pursue innovative opportunities to further develop our teams, including our recent announcement to partner with a leading training provider to deliver more personalized training solutions to our employees.
Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our organization and are an important driver of our consistent and strong execution.
At the store level, we continue to be pleased with our robust internal promotion pipeline and store manager turnover, which continues to trend below historic levels.
We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.
Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders.
In closing, I am proud of our team's performance and we are pleased with our strong first quarter results, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward.
","Dollar General's first quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting strong underlying performance boosted by government stimulus payments. Net sales increased by 16% in nonconsumable categories, leading to a 208 basis point increase in gross margin rate and double-digit diluted EPS growth. Despite facing a challenging operating environment, the company raised its sales and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2021 due to its strong Q1 performance. Comparable store sales declined by 4.6% but increased by a robust 17.1% on a two-year stack basis. The company increased its market share in highly consumable product sales, and its retention rate of new customers remained encouraging. Merchandise inventories increased by 24.2% to $5.1 billion at the end of Q1, driven by strategic inventory purchases to support sales momentum. The company generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $703 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11% over a two-year period. Capital expenditures were $278 million, including investments in new stores, remodels, distribution, and strategic initiatives."
JCI_q1_2022.txt,"Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' chairman and chief executive officer, George Oliver; and our chief financial officer, Olivier Leonetti.
In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITA, and EBIT exclude restructuring as well as other special items.
Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis.
Let's get started on Slide 3.
We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2022 with solid Q1 results, as our teams across the world continue to demonstrate best-in-class execution, delivering both strong financial performance for the enterprise and smart innovative solutions our customers demand to ensure a safe, healthy, and sustainable spaces.
Our service activity in the quarter accelerated from both in orders and revenue perspective, and we are making great strides across all of our vectors of growth.
Decarbonization, healthy buildings, and smart buildings.
I'm incredibly proud of how the team is operating in what still remains an incredibly challenging environment, as we continue to face headwinds from supply chain and labor constraints in various dislocations caused by the latest variant of COVID-19.
As the recovery in our end markets expands, I have been continuously encouraged by the underlying demand trends we are witnessing as evidenced by high single-digit order and revenue growth this quarter.
In the $10.5 billion backlog we have built, which increased 10% on a year-over-year basis.
What has been equally as encouraging is the drivers of this demand have been the retrofit replacement of equipment in service offerings required to achieve higher indoor air quality, cost reduction, and energy efficiency goals, which perfectly aligns with our portfolio of end-to-end digital solutions and services.
We continue to advance our initiatives to accelerate growth and transform our service business.
Q1 was another quarter of solid revenue and order growth, and we continue to drive our attachment rate higher with a multifaceted approach, including a number of digitally enabled solutions.
Additionally, there are significant actions underway across the organization to optimize the efficiency of our cost structure, and we remain on track to deliver $230 million in productivity savings this year.
We had another quarter of strong free cash flow performance, as Olivier will share with you later, this has allowed us to continue to fund organic reinvestment in our business as well as share repurchase in M&A activity, all three of which remain top priorities.
Over the next several slides, I will update you on some of the strategic growth vectors we continue to highlight and all of these are supported by the global mega trends that will drive demand within the building sector for the next decade plus.
As we have said in the past, we truly believe we are among the best-in-class when it comes to the ability to deliver fully integrated solutions designed to address the challenges associated with these trends.
Based on our performance in Q1 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our earnings per share guidance for the year.
During the quarter, we were honored to be recognized for our leadership in sustainability and ESG as well as our innovations in smart building platforms.
We received our eighth consecutive ranking in the Corporate Knights Global 100 most sustainable corporations in the world.
We were recognized by Sustainalytics for managing material ESG issues, and we are one of 45 companies globally to receive his Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales' inaugural Terra Carta Seal.
In terms of smart buildings, I was humbled to receive, on behalf of the company, the IoT Company's CEO of the Year Award from IoT Breakthrough.
This award is a reflection of the work of our entire digital and OpenBlue teams, engineering, development, sales, service, and marketing.
Lastly, we were also recognized by Verdantix for having the most prominent IoT platform for smart buildings in 2022, having achieved market-leading scores in several key categories.
Our service business continues to perform well.
We are seeing good traction on our initiatives to accelerate growth and increased recurring revenues.
We are also seeing encouraging trends in the adoption of our OpenBlue digital service offerings.
Overall, service revenues in the quarter were up 5% with broad-based growth across all regions.
Orders were up 7%, led by low double-digit growth in North America with strength across our applied commercial HVAC and fire & security platforms.
We expect a 400 to 500 basis point improvement in our attach rate for the full year and ended Q1 at approximately 41%.
Turning to Slide 6.
It goes without saying that sustainability is at the heart of everything we do.
There are tremendous efforts underway in all parts of the world to decarbonize and it has become very clear that buildings play a pivotal role in these efforts.
We were pleased to see the recent announcement from the Biden administration forming a new National Building Performance Standards Coalition consisting of more than 30 state and local governments across the U.S., incentivizing the development of healthier, lower carbon emitting buildings.
Building performance standards are among the core policy initiatives we have flagged as primary demand drivers for decarbonization and achieving net zero.
This major announcement by The White House is the latest in a number of regulatory actions taken by the local and national governments globally in support of decarbonizing economies, and more specifically in support of accelerating progress toward net zero buildings.
These standards will mandate stringent carbon reduction requirements for new and existing buildings in the U.S., including financial penalties for noncompliance.
The official adoption of these standards would represent an important step toward the formation of the $240 billion decarbonization industry, we expect through of 2035.
Moving to Slide 7.
We recently launched our latest offering under the OpenBlue healthy buildings portfolio, indoor air quality as a service.
This is the industry's first dedicated as-a-service model for delivering indoor air quality.
This offering allows us to combine our traditional holistic approach to delivering healthy indoor environments with innovative financing models that eliminate the need for our customers to commit capital upfront, lowering the risk and time to implement.
This offering provides a turnkey solution that delivers clean air, while simultaneously optimizing the energy efficiency of a building, all while leveraging a subscription-based model.
Solutions like these enabled by OpenBlue are truly differentiating factors when it comes to our customers' decision-making process.
Importantly, we continue to expand our partner ecosystem, not only to supplement our solution portfolio, but also to advance our research and development.
This quarter, we announced an important partnership with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to advance our advocacy of indoor air quality.
We also kicked off a collaboration with Well Living Lab in the Mayo Clinic to study the cognitive and productivity benefits associated with enhancements to ventilation and filtration, which will leverage the partnership established with Phylagen last quarter.
Next on Slide 8.
FogHorn is recognized as the industry's leading developer of Edge AI software for industrial and commercial IoT solutions with the most advanced technology.
Their Edge intelligence, combined with cloud-based model building enables secure real-time machine learning to take place at the device level, which means easier access to actionable insights, it increased flexibility for our customers.
FogHorn software will be integrated throughout the entire OpenBlue platform embedded within our OpenBlue Bridge data exchange which will allow us an even better value proposition when it comes to applying intelligence at the edge device level faster, more secure and at a lower cost relative to cloud-based applications.
We view Edge intelligence as a critical technology for the future of smart autonomous buildings and for Johnson Controls.
FogHorn gives us and our OpenBlue platform, an immediate competitive advantage in the Edge AI with a software platform that is widely recognized as best-in-class.
It avoids the time and cost to build out these capabilities organically.
Among the notable wins for these themes in Q1, we have a few examples across regions, all centered around sustainability.
In North America, we are partnering with the University of Windsor on their 2030 carbon reduction plan as well as their 2050 carbon neutrality objectives.
We will be installing a uniquely configured chiller on our AI-enabled OpenBlue connected chiller platform, which will ensure optimal chiller performance and enable digital service.
We are excited to be partnering with Aldar Properties, a prominent developer in the UAE as they begin a digital transformation to achieve their sustainability commitments.
We were awarded an energy performance contract to improve the energy efficiency across Aldar's network of schools in Abu Dhabi.
In addition to replacing the HVAC equipment, in other energy-consuming assets, we will also be deploying our OpenBlue net zero buildings portfolio of digital solutions.
In China, we were selected to upgrade an existing customers Metasys building automation system and control system and integrate OpenBlue on-prem to leverage key AI capabilities that will optimize the chiller performance to reduce energy consumption.
This includes a long-term service agreement, leveraging our digital capabilities.
These are great examples of the power and breadth of our portfolio, where we deliver tailored, sustainable outcomes for our customers, while expanding our installed base and driving attractive recurring service growth.
We remain laser-focused on our strategic commitments into delivering the outcomes our customers need on the path to a healthy and more sustainable future.
Let me start with the summary on Slide 10.
Sales in the quarter were up 8% organically above our original guidance for mid-single-digit growth and led by strong outperformance across the global product portfolio.
Our longer-cycle field businesses also performed well, up 6% with solid growth in both service and install.
Price contributed to about four and a half points of our total organic growth, about one point above our expectation.
Segment EBITA increased 13% versus the prior year, with margins expanding 30 basis points to 12.3%, including a 100-basis-point margin headwind from price/cost and significant operational inefficiencies related to ongoing supply chain disruptions and worsening labor constraints.
This was more than offset by strong leverage on higher volumes and the incremental benefit of our COGS and SG&A actions.
Just to comment on the impact of the operational efficiencies.
As I mentioned, we were able to yield four and a half points of price.
Beyond raw materials, inflation on most other items, freight, logistics, labor, and components increase further and absorb the benefit of the increased pricing.
Additionally, ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages impacted our field operations, where we were dealing with, not only our own disruptions, but those of our customers as well versus our guidance for Q1, this was an incremental headwind of 40 basis points.
Overall, our underlying margin performance in the quarter was very strong.
EPS of $0.54 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 26% year over year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count.
Free cash flow in the quarter was just over $250 million, primarily the result of a continued focus on working capital management.
Turning to our earnings per share bridge on Slide 11.
Overall operations contributed $0.10 versus the prior year, including a $0.06 benefit from our COGS and SG&A productivity programs.
Underlying segment earnings were a net $0.04 tailwind year over year, which we view as a significant achievement in the current environment.
Excluding the headwinds from price cost, underlying incremental in Q1 were approximately 40%.
Orders for our field businesses increased 8% in aggregate, with fairly balanced growth between service and install activity.
Growth in service orders is being led by a double-digit increase in our short-term transactional business, but also a mid-single-digit increase in our contractual recurring revenue base.
Install demand continues to rebound, primarily driven by a low double-digit increase in retrofit activity globally, including mid-teens growth in North America.
Backlog grew 10% to nearly $10.5 billion, with service backlog up 4% and installed backlog up 11%.
The year-over-year increase was led by higher retrofit activity in North America and EMEALA and new construction activity in APAC.
Let's discuss our segment results in more details on Slide 13.
My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 14.
Sales in North America were up 5% organically, led by 7% growth in service.
Install sales increased 4%.
Similar to last quarter, supply chain disruptions and material availability negatively impacted revenue conversion in our North America business.
Commercial Applied HVAC revenue grew low double digits, including low double-digit growth both in equipment and service.
Client security increased mid-single digits in the quarter.
Performance Infrastructure declined high single digits, given the tough prior year comparison of plus 20%.
Looking at the two-year stack for performance infrastructure we are up double digit with an exciting pipeline of opportunities ahead.
Segment margin decreased 90 basis points year over year to 11.6%, including an 80 basis point impact from lower absorption given the operational inefficiencies related to material and labor availability.
We are also intentionally maintaining a higher level of sales investments, given our order activity is up more than double our revenue growth in the quarter.
The combination of these factors will remain a headwind in the second quarter and significantly improved from there.
Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year with high teens growth in commercial applied, including a significant increase in HVAC equipment orders driven by very strong demand in the data center and healthcare verticals.
Fire & security orders were up low teens with strength in both install and service.
Backlog of $6.5 billion increased 12% year over year.
EMEALA revenue increased 3%, led by continued strength in the fire & security business, which grew at mid-single-digits rate in Q1.
This was primarily driven by a sharp rebound in our retail platform and modest growth in our core offerings due to the material availability constraints.
Industrial Refrigeration grew low single digits, while commercial HVAC in Controls was relatively flat.
Segment EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points, underlying margin performance improved as positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A.
COGS savings more than offset a modest mix headwind.
Orders in EMEALA were up 3% in the quarter with high single-digit growth in fire & security and low single-digit growth in commercial HVAC.
Backlog ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, up 12%.
Sales in Asia Pacific increased 12% organically led by mid-teens growth in commercial HVAC in Controls.
China continued to outperform with revenue up nearly 30%.
EBITDA margin declined 260 basis points year over year to 10.1%, driven by headwinds from price costs as well as unfavorable business and geographic mix.
We do believe Q1 represents peak margin pressure for APAC, and we would expect margins to significantly improve as we -- as the year progresses.
APAC orders were up 5% with continued strength in commercial HVAC, driven by a strong rebound within the industrial vertical in China as well as the benefit of a large infrastructure development project currently underway in Japan, which would include a significant deployment of OpenBlue and digitally enabled services.
Backlog of $1.8 billion was up 2% year over year.
Global product sales increased 14% organically in the quarter, with broad-based strength across the portfolio led by mid-teens growth across our HVAC equipment platforms.
Global residential HVAC sales were up 11% overall in Q1.
North America resi HVAC grew 17% in the quarter benefiting from both higher growth in our power business and strong price realization.
We have been very successful in ramping production of our new facility in Mexico.
So far, we had about 30% capacity and still on track for full run rate later in the year.
In rest of the world, resi HVAC grew high single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe as the adoption of our new Hitachi air-to-water residential heat pump, launched last quarter, continues to improve.
In APAC, resi HVAC was relatively flat as a result of softer industry demand in Japan, related to more mild weather, offset by strong growth in Taiwan and India.
Although, not reflected in our revenue growth, sales in our in Hisense JV were up low teens year over year in Q1, as we continue to expand our distribution footprint in China.
Commercial HVAC product sales were up high teens in aggregate with similar levels of growth in both applied and light commercial.
Strength in applied was driven by increased demand within the data center end markets for our air cool chillers and evaporative cooling solutions as well as our industrial refrigeration platforms.
Strength in light commercial was driven by strong performance at Hitachi which was up over 50% as well as mid-teens growth in North America unitary equipment and high single-digit growth in VRF.
Fire & security products grew low double-digit in aggregate, led by a continued recovery in our commercial science suppression business and mid-teens growth in access control and video solutions.
EBITA margin expanded 240 basis points year over year to 14.5% as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of productivity actions more than offset headwinds from price/cost.
Turning to Slide 15.
Corporate expense was up slightly year over year to $70 million.
For modeling purposes, we have included some of our below-the-line items for FY '22.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape with no major changes to highlight in the quarter.
We ended up Q1 with $1.2 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.9 times, one tick higher versus year-end, but still below our target range of two to two and a half times.
On cash, we generated a little over $250 million in free cash flow in the quarter, down year over year due to the absence of prior year tax credits and other COVID-related benefits as well as nearly a 50% increase in capex spend year over year.
We had another quarter of strong trade working capital management, down 140 basis points as a percentage of sales.
With a continued focus on working capital, we remain confident that we will sustain 100% conversion over the next several years.
From a capital allocation standpoint, we are executing our game plan.
We repurchased approximately 7 million shares for just over $500 million, deploying roughly $100 million toward bolt-on acquisitions and increased our quarterly cash dividend payment by 26%.
Before we get into guidance, I want to comment on two reporting changes that occurred in the first quarter.
First, effective at the start of the fiscal year, our marine business, which was previously split across Asia Pacific and global products and EMEALA is now managed and reported under our EMEALA segment.
Historical segment results have been recast for comparability.
Second, as part of the ongoing transformation of our service business, beginning with first quarter results, we are aligning the way we report revenue associated with certain types of retrofit activity we performed in EMEALA and APAC field businesses as they have evolved to be more aligned with similar offering in North America.
From a management perspective, this provides better visibility to our initiatives aimed at accelerating our higher-margin recurring revenue base.
The changes are being made on a prospective basis.
To help with comparisons going forward, we have included recasted segment results and a table with pro forma service revenue for FY '21 in the appendix.
Now let me get into guidance on Slide 17.
As George mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $3.22 to $3.32, which represents year-over-year growth of 22 to 25%.
Given the continued inflationary environment, we are increasing our organic revenue growth assumptions to a range of 8 to 10%, mainly driven by our increased price expectation.
An additional point of price on the topline we create an incremental margin headwind of approximately 20 basis points.
We continue to expect price/cost will remain positive on an earnings per share basis.
However, the inflated level of pricing will bring our full year price cost margin headwind to approximately 60 basis points.
Therefore, we now expect 50 to 60 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion for the year.
There was no change to underlying margin expansion of 110 to 120 basis points.
Let me specifically point out that there was no change to our expectation for segment EBITA dollars.
Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar has created an earnings per share headwind of $0.03, since we first provided guidance back in November, and we are absorbing this incremental headwind with our reaffirmed adjusted earnings per share guidance range.
Turning to the second quarter.
We expect continued strong performance with high single-digit organic revenue growth, improved segment EBITDA margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.64, which represents a year-over-year increase of 19 to 23%.
Let me give back the call to George for some additional comments.
Yes, before we move on to the Q&A portion of the call, I wanted to announce a quick update to my leadership team.
This will be Antonella's final earnings call, and she will be pursuing a new role outside of Johnson Controls.
Antonella has been one of my constants, really, since I first joined back -- Tyco back in 2006.
She has been an invaluable resource to me personally, and I'm sure she has been to many of you for more than a decade.
She has been a fantastic leader, a trusted advisor, and a friend.
I couldn't be more happy for you.
","Johnson Controls reported a strong Q1 with 8% organic sales growth, led by service and product segments. Despite supply chain disruptions and labor constraints, segment EBITA margin expanded 30 basis points. EPS reached $0.54, a 26% increase year-over-year. The company's backlog grew 10% to $10.5 billion, indicating strong future revenue potential. Johnson Controls highlighted its leadership in sustainability and smart buildings, recognizing awards in these areas. The service business continues to perform well, with revenue up 5% and order growth of 7%. The company is focused on accelerating growth and increasing recurring revenues through its OpenBlue digital service offerings. Johnson Controls emphasized the importance of decarbonization as a major demand driver and discussed its industry-leading Edge AI platform, FogHorn, which enhances the value proposition of its OpenBlue platform. The company cited several customer examples demonstrating its tailored sustainability solutions. While supply chain inefficiencies and labor constraints resulted in a 40-basis-point margin headwind, underlying margin performance was strong. The company remains focused on its strategic commitments to deliver healthy and sustainable outcomes for its customers."
BMI_q1_2021.txt,"Core in this case means designated financial metrics excluding the impact of the recent S::can and ATI acquisitions.
We believe this reference point is important for year-over-year comparability.
In summary, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, delivering sales and earnings per share growth, margin expansion, and robust cash flow.
Most exciting we experienced record order rates for our smart water solutions across both lines of business as the underlying growth drivers for our digital solutions are embraced by customers.
The well-publicized and widespread electronic supply shortages limited our conversion of these record orders into sales in the quarter.
Tempering core sales growth but resulting in a record-high order backlog heading into the second quarter, which bodes well for the balance of the year.
Our recent acquisitions delivered strong top-line results with net profitability muted as expected as a result of purchase accounting items.
Overall, our acquisition integration activities are progressing as expected.
I'll talk about the current environment and our outlook later in the call.
As you can see on Slide 4, total sales for the first quarter were $117.8 million compared to $108.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of 9%.
In utility water, overall, sales increased 12% reflecting the addition of the s::can and ATi acquisitions, which contributed approximately $10 million of sales in the quarter.
Excluding acquisitions, core revenues in the utility water product line were essentially flat year-over-year despite record orders due to the Internet and electronic supply component shortages and logistics challenges that limited manufacturing output.
Scarce capacity of electronics is a pervasive market issue impacting many industries and is not isolated to Badger Meter.
We did experience growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing actions.
As Ken noted, we ended the quarter with strong order momentum and a record backlog, which gives us confidence in our sales outlook moving forward.
As expected the flow instrumentation sales rate of change improved sequentially from down 10% last quarter to down 3% year-over-year, with the majority of end markets served experiencing recovering demand trends.
We expect to return to overall growth moving forward as a result of improving demand conditions and easier comparisons.
We are pleased with the operating profit improvement delivering a 30 basis point increase in margins to 15.1% from 14.8% in the prior year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 41.9%, up a healthy 200 basis points year-over-year.
The core business delivered higher gross margins due to positive sales mix, namely higher SaaS revenues along with favorable pricing, which continued to offset the impact of higher brass costs in the quarter.
Margins also benefited from favorable acquisition mix.
You may recall from last quarter we described the water quality acquisitions of s::can and ATi as having higher than line average gross margins combined with higher SEA as a percent of sales and therefore with a net EBITDA range for the combined businesses in the mid-teens.
The positive acquisition mix benefit to gross margins was muted by the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in the quarter, but that's mostly behind us moving forward.
Copper prices continued their upward trajectory after our last earnings call in late January when they were averaging approximately $3.60 a pound to now near $4.20 a pound.
This obviously increases the potential cost headwind for the year that we had estimated at $4 million to $5 million to closer to $7 million to $8 million on a year-over-year basis if it were to stay in that $4.20 range.
We have executed well in implementing appropriate pricing mechanisms to offset this inflation as evidenced by our first quarter results and will continue to remain nimble and actively addressing inflation.
Turning to SEA expenses, the first quarter spend of $31.6 million increased $4.3 million from the prior year.
This includes a full quarter of SEA spending for both s:can and ATi along with the higher level of acquired intangible asset amortization.
Beyond the impact of acquisitions, higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower travel trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses, the decrease of which we will anniversary starting next quarter.
The income tax provision in the first quarter of 2021 was 22.2%, slightly lower than the prior years' 25.6% rate.
In summary, earnings per share was $0.47 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 15% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.41.
Working capital as a percent of sales was 24.3% down from 25.5% at calendar year-end despite the addition of ATi, largely due to working capital initiatives in the quarter.
Our free cash flow of $28.8 million was consistent with the prior year.
In early January we deployed $44 million net of cash acquired for ATi and currently have cash on the balance sheet of approximately $51 million.
Along with the untapped revolver, we have significant financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies.
Turning to Slide 5.
We don't provide guidance but believe it is important to bring awareness to the increased level of unevenness we're likely going to see in our top line as this year unfolds.
I want to spend just a minute highlighting comparative sales data to provide a clear picture of the varied influences on the quarterly sales growth trend lines and discuss the optimism we have for our results for the remainder of the year and beyond.
This chart depicts the quarterly sales growth rate of our core business in 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021.
As you can see by the various call-out boxes, we had some specific dynamics in 2020 with COVID and now in the first quarter of 2021 that we need to be mindful of as we look at the rest of the year comparisons.
Namely, we will have an easier comp for our upcoming Q2 versus the 2020 COVID lockdowns combined with a portion of the record backlog converting to sales given the anticipation for some modest improvement in electronic supply.
As we move into Q3, we'll have a difficult comparison based on the post-COVID lockdown order rate and manufacturing recovery last year.
The bottom line to all of this is that we continue to have strong momentum and robust bid activity, order rates and backlog consistent with our long-term outlook for mid-single-digit growth.
From a top line standpoint, the acquisitions are performing in line with their historic growth patterns and our integration teams are working to begin putting the steps and processes in place to realize future growth synergies.
Turning to our outlook.
The underlying market drivers for smart water solutions remain intact and in fact, as we've discussed, COVID has spotlighted the benefits of AMi for common utility challenges such as remote work efficiencies and regular and automated consumer engagement tools.
Water quality and security concerns also are driving accelerating interest in our real-time digital solutions.
We saw evidence of that during the recent climate events in Texas and other Southern U.S. States which experienced the debilitating deep freeze with a number of customers describe the real-life benefits of having our cellular AMi solution deployed which remained in service due to the criticality and cellular networks.
These utilities were able to obtain real-time mission critical data which help identify potential main breaks, pipe freezes and bursts keeping safe water supply available for their end consumers.
Now surprisingly, one of the most common outlook questions we get from investors relates to the potential impact of the recent infrastructure proposal from the Biden administration, specifically the portion of the plan that calls for $56 billion of spending to upgrade and modernize America's drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems and additional $10 billion in part to invest in rural small water systems.
As we have repeatedly stated, the underlying secular trends driving demand for our digital water solutions are already evident and growing.
Stimulus investments could perhaps accelerate or add to those underlying drivers, but are not necessary for us to realize our long-term growth plans.
In fact, as we stated over the past couple of quarters, it's the widespread availability of vaccinations that are most relevant to near-term demand patterns.
It's too early to tell if a potential pause in spending might occur as utilities weight and digest the implications of the stimulus proposals.
Our view is that if a pause would occur it would simply be a matter of timing and not a change to the long-term structural growth of our business.
We will as always focus on the elements of our business within our control.
Our teams have done an outstanding job managing value-based pricing initiatives, which have mitigated the significant increase in brass costs, our sourcing and supply chain teams have their hands full actively managing the varied ramifications of the wide-ranging and Universal Electronics shortages along with certain logistics bottlenecks, including those at West Coast ports.
While these circumstances are not unique to Badger Meter, I am confident that we will be able to adequately support customers despite these many challenges.
We will continue to manage working capital and drive cash flow in order to support our investments in both organic and acquisition-driven growth.
Our focus remains on enhancing the product and software offering serving water-related markets and applications globally.
Finally, I want to provide an update on our ESG activities notably establishing our first greenhouse gas intensity reduction target.
This represents an important step on our ESG journey as we work to mitigate the impact we have on the environment and continue to be good stewards of the resources we use in our operations.
The 15% intensity reduction goal by 2030 was developed through a strategic initiative to capture baseline greenhouse gas data globally and identify opportunities to reduce energy and consumption and other Level 1 and 2 emissions.
We will set annual smart goals to monitor progress and we'll report externally on our efforts in our biennial sustainability report.
","Despite ongoing supply chain issues, Badger Meter witnessed robust growth in the first quarter, with sales climbing 9% to $117.8 million. Excluding recent acquisitions, core revenues remained steady due to electronic shortages. The acquisitions, s::can and ATi, contributed $10 million in sales but had muted profitability. Gross margin improved to 41.9%, driven by favorable pricing and higher SaaS revenues. Operating profit increased by 30 basis points to 15.1%, aided by positive acquisition mix. Earnings per share rose 15% to $0.47, and the company experienced record order rates for its smart water solutions. The supply chain constraints have resulted in a record order backlog, which bodes well for the future. Management remains optimistic about the company's long-term growth prospects, despite the potential impact of the recent infrastructure proposals and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of vaccinations. Badger Meter also emphasized its commitment to ESG, setting a 15% greenhouse gas intensity reduction target by 2030."
CHH_q3_2021.txt,"They will be joined by Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President, Real Estate and Finance.
We appreciate you taking the time to join us.
I'm pleased to report that Choice Hotels continued to deliver strong RevPAR growth in the third quarter that once again significantly outperformed the industry.
We also continue to gain share across all segments in which we compete.
As a result of these performance trends, we expect to surpass 2019 RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA levels for full year 2021.
By continuing to implement our long-term strategy, we have positioned Choice Hotels to further benefit from post-pandemic trends that favor leisure travel, limited service hotels and longer stays.
Additionally, our business traveler demand has returned to levels similar to the third quarter of 2019.
The third quarter was exceptional, our strongest quarter of the year.
Our RevPAR increased 11.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, surpassing our prior quarterly RevPAR guidance.
In fact, RevPAR has now exceeded 2019 levels for five consecutive months, with trends continuing into the fourth quarter.
For over 1.5 years, we've maintained significantly higher RevPAR index share gains against the competition compared to 2019.
We continued this trend in the third quarter, increasing RevPAR index versus our local competitors by nearly four percentage points as compared to 2019, reflecting continued growth in both weekday and weekend RevPAR index as reported by STR.
Choice's ability to continue to gain share even as the broader industry recovers, demonstrates that our strategic investments are paying off and gives us further confidence in our future revenue trajectory.
Because of our strategic investments, both before and during the pandemic, we are in a stronger position today to capitalize on outsized growth opportunities over the long term, which we expect will create value and drive our performance to new levels.
What's most impressive is that we continue to drive strong performance through both rate improvement and occupancy share gains.
Choice's average daily rate growth has been stronger than the industry in the third quarter due to our new revenue management tool and broader capabilities.
In addition, our robust merchandising strategy has allowed us to drive occupancy share gains versus our local competitors.
We continue to make major investments that are enhancing our owners' performance and contributing to our brand's outperformance.
Earlier this year, we launched our new revenue management capability designed to improve the ability of our franchise owners to effectively drive top line revenue.
This tool marks a step change improvement that we were able to put in the hands of our franchisees at a critical juncture in the recovery.
As the first mobile-enabled revenue management app, it allows our franchisees to more effectively manage their channels rates and inventory by adapting to local market trends in real time through repricing and competitive rate shopping multiple times during the day, and they can do this from virtually anywhere.
This enhanced capability has contributed to choice taking significant RevPAR index share specifically driving average daily rate index gains versus local competitors, and we expect this trend to continue.
The acceptance of rate recommendations by our franchisees has been significantly higher than our prior tool, demonstrating our owners' confidence in the solutions that we are providing.
This tool, combined with expert advice from our experienced revenue management consultants is helping our franchise owners to swiftly execute the right pricing strategy, which is particularly important in an inflationary environment.
At the same time, we continue to improve the unit economics for our franchisees, concentrating on investments like housekeeping upon request that lower their cost of ownership while driving continued performance improvements.
Recently, we deployed a new digital registration capability, which is integrated with our property management system.
This cost-effective cloud-based solution is designed to simplify the hotel registration process for front desk staff, save on labor, speed up check-in and improve our guests' overall experience.
Moreover, our recent brand investments are designed to appeal to the guest of tomorrow while providing a compelling return on investment for our franchisees.
Just a few weeks ago, we introduced a new Cambria hotel prototype option designed for secondary and leisure markets.
We're excited about the future growth opportunity for Cambria as we expect this prototype will allow developers the flexibility to build at a reduced cost, expanding the markets available for growth while retaining our design forward experience.
I will now provide a brief update on our key segments, where 11 out of our 12 brands achieved RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors in the third quarter as compared to 2019.
Our strategic investments in the extended-stay segment allowed us to quadruple the size of the portfolio over the past five years to reach 467 domestic units with a domestic pipeline of nearly 310 hotels.
This segment, a significant growth engine for the company, expanded by over 45 hotels in the third quarter year-over-year and now represents over 10% of our total domestic rooms.
In addition to strong unit growth, we've also driven impressive RevPAR growth across our extended stay brands.
Specifically, when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our extended-stay portfolio grew RevPAR a by over 18%, driven by occupancy levels of 82% and a 9% increase in average daily rate.
And outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by over 20 percentage points.
The WoodSpring Suites brand celebrated a key milestone with the recent opening of its 300th hotel.
The brand's pipeline expanded by over 20% year-over-year as of the end of September, reaching nearly 160 domestic hotels which further exemplifies developer demand for this brand, given its cycle resilience.
We expect that WoodSpring's robust pipeline will provide a strong platform for future growth of the brand.
Broadly speaking, we are pleased with the significant increase in developers' interest in extended stay projects.
In the third quarter, we executed two dozen extended-stay domestic franchise agreements, an 85% increase year-over-year and a 20% increase compared to 2019 levels.
In addition, the first hotel for our newest extended-stay brand, Everhome Suites is currently under construction and scheduled to open next summer, with nearly 20 additional projects already in the pipeline.
Our mid-scale brands, which represent over 2/3 of our total domestic room portfolio and approximately half of the total domestic pipeline continued to outperform the segment's RevPAR growth.
Our mid-scale and upper mid-scale portfolio grew RevPAR by nearly 10%, driven by average daily rate growth of over 9% and outpaced the industry's mid-scale and upper mid-scale segment growth by nearly seven percentage points when compared to third quarter 2019.
Our flagship brand, Comfort, recently celebrated the highest number of conversion hotel openings since 2014, while increasing new construction agreements threefold in the third quarter year-over-year.
The Comfort brand's domestic unit growth of over 2% and and RevPAR index outperformance versus local competitors demonstrate the attractiveness of this iconic brand to hotel developers and guests alike.
Our upscale portfolio achieved impressive growth in the third quarter year-over-year as we increased our domestic room count by nearly 22%, driven by both Cambria and the Ascend Hotel Collection.
The upscale portfolio also achieved a record for domestic openings in the first three quarters of the year.
The Cambria brand continued its positive momentum, growing by over 9% to 58 units year-over-year with 17 projects under active construction at the end of September, and five additional hotels planned to open this year.
In August, we celebrated the Cambria opening in the heart of one of the world's premier wine regions, Napa Valley.
Our upscale portfolio increased its RevPAR index relative to its local competitive set and outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by 15 percentage points while increasing the average daily rate by 11% when compared to the third quarter of 2019.
This progress shows the attractiveness of Choice Hotels value proposition in the upscale segment for current and prospective owners.
The strong performance across our entire brand portfolio confirms our focus on growing in our strategic segments which we believe will further fuel the long-term revenue intensity of our system.
Turning now to demand trends.
We continue to achieve gains in our weekday occupancy index share during the third quarter compared to 2019.
As discussed on our prior calls, we believe that these share gains are partially driven by long-term consumer trends, such as remote work and an increase in early retirements, which afford Americans flexibility as to when and where they travel for leisure.
In fact, we observed our guests extending their trips into shoulder days of the weekend, giving us further optimism about future travel trends following the historically busy summer travel season.
In addition, we continue to observe a greater share of revenue coming from longer stays as compared to 2019.
Similar to our broader occupancy share gains, these weekday demand gains were achieved through our merchandising capabilities and strategy with targeted promotions at the right time of the week, during the right time of the year and for the right customer.
The investments we've made have allowed us to capitalize on demand that historically propelled our core business while attracting and capturing an even larger share of leisure demand.
While our most loyal Choice Privileges members continue to spend more at our hotels during the third quarter, we were also successful in appealing to those who are new to our brands, increasing their revenue contribution as compared to 2019 levels.
We also see continuing momentum in our business travel trends, with anticipated additional runway for growth.
We've continued to witness sequential quarter-over-quarter increases in our business travel bookings in the third quarter of 2021, with overall business performance similar to 2019 levels.
As a company with a strong emphasis on a customer-first approach, Choice is always looking for innovative ways to better serve the changing needs of today's consumers and anticipate the expectations of the guest of tomorrow.
For example, we are the first lodging company to launch a collaboration with Bakkt a trusted digital asset marketplace, enabling us to cater to guests with more currency options and more ways to redeem this currency.
Our more than 50 million Choice Privileges loyalty members can now unlock new redemption opportunities by converting their rewards points to cash and then use it to buy Bitcoin, transfer their points to a friend or even redeem them online or in-store anywhere, Apple Pay or Google Pay is accepted.
Turning now to our franchisee business delivery and demand for our brands.
In addition, we drove growth as compared to 2019 and 2020 through increased revenue contribution in the third quarter from choicehotels.com and other proprietary digital channels.
Business delivery through these channels significantly improves our owners' profitability as they deliver strong rates at the lowest cost.
As a result, these channels remain a key focus area for enhancing our value proposition.
With such a powerful value proposition, it is no surprise why Choice maintains an industry-leading franchisee voluntary retention rate and our franchise owners continue to seek and develop our brands.
Aided by our strong value proposition for our current and future owners and our record outperformance, we also continue to experience demand for new franchise contracts.
In the third quarter, we awarded 89 new domestic franchise agreements, a 10% increase over the same period of 2020.
Specifically, we're very pleased to see that demand for our new construction brands in the third quarter increased by over 50% year-over-year.
And we are also excited to announce that our WoodSpring brand expanded internationally at the end of October, entering the Canadian market with a more than 15 unit commitment from a well-known developer and operator.
In addition, a team within our development and franchise service departments that is fully dedicated to driving diverse ownership of Choice franchise hotels among underrepresented and minority owners has awarded 18 franchise contracts year-to-date through September, bringing the total agreements executed to over 280 since the program began over 15 years ago.
I'm proud to say that more than half of the 18 agreements this year were awarded to women entrepreneurs.
None of these accomplishments would have been possible without the resilience and hard work of our dedicated associates.
We are committed to continuing to invest in and support our associates, and we are proud to be the hotel industry's only company to recently earn recognition as a Best Work-life Balance Employer by Comparably.
In closing, I'm confident in our continued ability to create value and deliver results for our owners and shareholders through our effective strategic investments, impressive performance and award-winning culture centered around diversity, equity and belonging.
With that, I will hand it over to our CFO.
I hope you and your families are all well.
Today, I'd like to provide some additional insights on our third quarter results, update you on our liquidity profile and capital allocation and share our thoughts on the outlook for what lies ahead.
As we discussed in the previous quarter, we are comparing our financial performance and RevPAR results to 2019, which we believe offers a more meaningful basis for analyzing trends as the prior year's quarterly results were significantly impacted by the pandemic.
For third quarter 2021 as compared to the same period of 2019, total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $166.5 million, an 8% increase.
Adjusted EBITDA rose 18% and to $133.2 million, driven by improving RevPAR performance, revenue intense unit growth and strong effective royalty rate growth, coupled with continued cost discipline.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 80%, a rise of seven percentage points.
And as a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 in for the third quarter, an increase of 10% versus 2019.
Let's now turn to our three key revenue levers beginning with royalty rate.
Our effective royalty rate remains a significant source of our revenue growth.
The company's domestic effective royalty rate increased by eight basis points year-over-year to approximately 5% compared to the third quarter of 2020.
This performance reflects the continued strengthening of the value proposition we provide to our franchise owners, their continued interest in being affiliated with our proven brands and the promising prospects in our pipeline.
It also provides further validation of our long-term past, current and future investments on behalf of our franchisees.
We expect to maintain the current growth trajectory of this lever for full year 2021 and grow at our historical rate in the future as owners continue to seek Choice Hotels' proven capabilities of delivering strong top line revenues that maximize return on investment while helping them reduce their total cost of ownership.
Our domestic systemwide RevPAR outperformed the overall industry by 16 percentage points for the third quarter, increasing 11.4% over 2019.
Specifically, our average daily rate grew by nearly 9%, and our occupancy levels increased by nearly two percentage points compared to the same quarter of 2019.
Our third quarter results showed that we continue to outpace the primary chain scale segments in which we compete as reported by STR by six percentage points versus 2019.
Importantly, our strong RevPAR trends have continued into the fourth quarter.
As you know from our prior calls, we've long focused our brand strategy on driving growth across the higher value and more revenue intense, upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments.
The investments we've made continue to pay off as these strategic segments have enabled us to materially outperform the industry in RevPAR growth and achieve gains versus our local competitors.
Let me highlight just a few impressive performance achievements for our brands in the third quarter.
Just a reminder, we're comparing the growth figures with the same period of 2019.
Our WoodSpring brand achieved 23% RevPAR growth, reaching an average occupancy rate of nearly 86% and experiencing an 11% increase in average daily rate.
Ascend Hotels saw their growth in average daily rate of over 17% and outperformed the upscale segment's RevPAR growth by over 20 percentage points.
At the same time, the Comfort family grew RevPAR by over 8% on reflecting a 9% increase in average daily rate.
Finally, both our Cambria and MainStay Suites brands captured 12 percentage points in RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors.
More specifically, our average daily rate and occupancy improved from the prior quarter, and our average daily rate index and occupancy index continue to increase compared to 2019 as a result of our investments in revenue management tools for our franchisees and the merchandising capabilities and strategy we have put in place.
Our third revenue lever is units and rooms growth, which benefits from the absolute size of our portfolio and the revenue intensity of the totals.
To ensure the quality of our brand portfolio over the long term, we continue to terminate underperforming economy hotels at the bottom end of the portfolio as well as quality hotels that are unable to maintain the standards of a mid-scale brand.
We believe that these actions will not only ensure an even stronger brand portfolio over the long term, but we also expect these targeted terminations to be an opportunity for royalty revenue growth as we plan to replace these hotels with higher quality and more revenue-intense units.
Nevertheless, we continue to grow the overall size of our domestic franchise system.
Across our more revenue intense brands in the upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments, we observed stronger unit growth, increasing the number of hotels by 2% and rooms by 2.6% year-over-year.
Our developers are increasingly optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of the lodging industry.
In fact, 1/3 of total domestic franchise agreements awarded in the third quarter were for new construction contracts representing an increase of more than 50% versus the same quarter of the prior year.
At the same time, demand for our conversion brands year-to-date through September increased by 25% year-over-year.
Let me share a few highlights on specific brands.
The Ascend Hotel Collection leads the industry as the first launch and today, the largest soft brand expanding its domestic room count by 27% year-over-year.
At the same time, Clarion Point has nearly doubled its portfolio year-over-year ending the third quarter with nearly 35 hotels open in the U.S. and 15 additional hotels awaiting conversion this year.
Our MainStay Suites mid-scale extended-stay brand portfolio expanded to nearly 100 domestic hotels open, representing more than 30% unit growth year-over-year.
And finally, our suburban extended stay portfolio of 70 domestic hotels open experienced 13% year-over-year unit growth.
Now a few words about our liquidity profile and an update on capital allocation.
As a result of our strong performance, the company has an even stronger liquidity position.
More specifically, at the end of the third quarter of 2021, the company had over $1 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility.
We are also pleased to report cash flow from operations of $142.8 million for the third quarter 2021, a 53% increase versus the third quarter 2019.
Today, our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage levels remains at the low end of our target range of three to 4 times.
At the end of third quarter 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage level was at 1.8 times.
These impressive results combined with our strong liquidity and confidence in our ability to generate strong levels of cash, leave us well positioned to continue to grow our business and return excess cash flow to shareholders well into the future.
Year-to-date through October, we have returned over $35 million back to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock.
We will continue to monitor the environment for other investment opportunities and evaluate capital returns in the context of our leverage levels, market conditions and our overall capital allocation strategy.
Finally, let's turn to our expectations for what lies ahead.
We currently expect full year domestic RevPAR to surpass 2019 levels and grow at approximately 1% as compared to full year 2019.
Assuming the broader RevPAR and economy recovery trends continue, we now expect to see our 2021 adjusted EBITDA exceed 2019 levels and range between $382 million and $387 million, even with planned incremental investments in the fourth quarter.
Our view is reinforced by our third quarter results which extend our strong year-to-date financial performance, broader macro trends and our continued investments to support growth for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
We will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 across the business, and we'll provide further updates in February during our next earnings call.
In closing, we remain confident in our long-term strategic approach and resilient business model, coupled with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and strong balance sheet, we believe these strengths will allow us to further capitalize on growth opportunities and drive outsized returns for years to come.
","Choice Hotels continued its strong performance in Q3, outperforming the industry and gaining RevPAR index share against local competitors. RevPAR increased 11.4% compared to Q3 2019, exceeding guidance and continuing the trend of surpassing 2019 levels for five consecutive months. The company's strategic investments in the extended-stay segment drove impressive RevPAR growth of over 18%, outperforming the industry by 20 percentage points. Demand trends remained strong, with weekday occupancy index gains and an increase in long-stay revenue. Choice Privileges loyalty members continued to contribute significantly to revenue, with new members also driving growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose 18% to $133.2 million, driven by improving RevPAR performance, revenue-intense unit growth, and continued cost discipline. The company expects full-year domestic RevPAR to surpass 2019 levels and adjusted EBITDA to exceed 2019 levels, ranging between $382 million and $387 million, despite planned incremental investments in the fourth quarter."
OI_q2_2021.txt,"Our discussion today will be led by Andres Lopez, our Chief Executive Officer; and John Haudrich, our Chief Financial Officer.
Today, we will discuss key business developments and review our financial results.
Please review the safe harbor comments and disclosure of our use of non-GAAP financial measures included in those materials.
We appreciate your interest in O-I Glass.
We're very pleased with our performance during the second quarter.
We reported adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.
Results exceeded our guidance range and reflected a stronger-than-expected shipment levels as well as favorable ongoing operating performance.
We continue to see favorable performance across key business levers.
Shipments improved 18% and production rebounded 27% compared to the prior year, which was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
The strong demand also reflected consumer preference for healthy, premium and sustainable glass packaging as markets reopen.
Furthermore, the benefit of higher selling prices substantially offset the rated cost inflation and continued favorable operating performance was driven by the positive contribution of our margin expansion initiatives.
Second quarter cash flow was also very strong as a result of solid operating performance.
As I noted last quarter, O-I has reached an inflection point.
We have seen a step change improvement in our ability to consistently perform and deliver on our commitments, which is underpinned by advanced capabilities across many disciplines developed over the last few years.
I believe current quarter results underscore this view.
As I will discuss shortly, we continue to advance our bold plan to change O-I's business fundamentals.
In addition to better-than-expected earnings and cash flow, I'm very pleased with the progress we made advancing our strategy.
Our margin expansion initiatives are exceeding our expectations, and we achieved a major milestone with MAGMA this past quarter.
Likewise, we continue to rebalance our business portfolio and advance our efforts to resolve our legacy asbestos liabilities.
As we look to the future, we remain optimistic about our business outlook.
We expect third quarter adjusted earnings will approximate $0.47 to $0.52, which is a significant improvement from the prior year.
Our full year earnings and cash flow guidance has improved.
We now anticipate full year earnings of between $1.65 and $1.75 per share and $260 million of cash flow.
Let's move ahead to slide four to discuss recent volume trends.
As you can see on the chart, second quarter shipments were up significantly over the prior year, which was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
Total shipments increased 18% this year compared to a 15% decline last year.
In the Americas, second quarter shipments were up 17%, with all geographies improving from the prior year.
The rebound was most pronounced in Mexico and the Andeans, which were significantly disrupted in 2020.
In Europe, shipments were up 22% and all geographies improved double digits from last year.
While the pandemic was very disruptive, underlying trends point to a stable or modestly improving demand.
For example, second quarter shipments were in line with 2019 levels, reflecting a return to pre-pandemic levels.
Glass has proven to be very resilient despite significant market volatility.
This includes supply chain disruptions, transportation challenges and major channel shifts between retail and on-premise consumption patterns.
The chart on the right illustrates how food and beverage consumption patterns should evolve across channels over the next 18 to 24 months.
As you can see, on-premise consumption is expected to rebound after the depths of the pandemic, while retail purchases should remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.
While we first shared these analysis last quarter, the evolution of packaging demand over the past couple of quarters, supports these trends and continues to reinforce the projected consumption patterns in this chart.
As we look to the future, we expect continued volume growth.
While markets had already rebounded well in the third quarter of last year, we expect our shipments to be flat to up 1% in the third quarter of this year.
Reflecting solid demand year-to-date, we have increased our full year 2021 growth outlook.
While our prior guidance called for 3% to 4% growth, we now expect growth of between 4% and 5% in 2021.
In addition to a strong operating performance, we also achieved a number of key milestones during the first half of the year as we continue to advance our strategy.
On this page, we released our 2021 priorities as well as some highlights on our progress.
I'll touch base on each of our three platforms.
First, we aim to expand margins.
We have targeted $50 million of initiative benefits as well as continued performance improvement in North America.
We have made good initial progress with our margin expansion initiatives.
Benefits totaled $40 million during the first half, and we now expect to exceed our original $50 million target for the full year.
North America in turn has demonstrated a strong resilience responding to severe weather, high freight inflation and a tight supply chain situation, and sales volumes are comparable to 2019 levels.
Next, we seek to revolutionize glass.
To support this, we successfully validated several technology milestones for MAGMA Generation one line in Germany as well as continue to advance our Glass Advocacy campaign and reposition ESG.
Similarly, we remain on track to pilot the Generation two MAGMA line in the Streator, Illinois, in the second half of the year and continue to make solid progress developing Generation three.
Additionally, we're actively working on a R&D lightweighting program we call Ultra, targeting significant container weight reductions to improve even further the convenience and sustainability profile of glass.
O-I's Glass Advocacy campaign aims to rebalance the dialogue about glass.
Our digital marketing campaign is well underway with over 660 million impressions program to date and the campaign has reached over 80 million people across the U.S.
We are building a community of glass advocates, who regularly engage with our content, which demonstrates the relevance of our message.
Like in our technology developments, we are very encouraged by the positive response and progress made, and we'll continue to advance these marketing efforts.
I'll touch on ESG momentarily.
Third, we will continue to optimize our structure.
This includes a number of efforts ranging from portfolio adjustments, improving the balance sheet, simplifying the organization and addressing legacy liabilities.
Regarding our divestiture program, we have completed or entered into agreements for $930 million of assets sales to date.
So we are over 80% of our way toward our targeted divestitures by the end of 2022.
As John will expand, on our cash flow during the first half of the year was quite favorable given historic seasonal business trends, reflecting very good working capital management, which support debt reduction.
In March, we entered into a long-term strategic agreement with Accenture to manage our global business services activities, and we completed the first phase of this transition in July.
In addition to reducing G&A cost, we expect to accelerate capability enhancement by leveraging world-class processes and technologies.
As you know, we reached an agreement in principle back in April for a fair and final resolution to our legacy asbestos-related liabilities.
Efforts to complete the reorganization for Paddock are proceeding as expected.
Before I turn over to John, let me add a few comments on sustainability.
At O-I, our ESG and sustainability vision is holistic, grounded in innovation and touches every part of our business.
In our vision, we see a future where the innate circularity of glass meets O-I's disruptive technologies and other innovations to change how glass is made, sold and recycled.
This sustainable future of glass involves the development of significantly lighter glass containers through Ultra, which implies a lower carbon footprint per container.
It also involves the use of cleaner gas oxygen fuels and improved technology in traditional furnaces.
On top of that, O-I's revolutionary MAGMA melting technology will be capable of using biofuels and other carbon neutral renewable sources of energy, like hydrogen, as well as more grades of recycled class.
MAGMA includes a more flexible manufacturing process, including the ability to turn the unit on and off to optimize the use of energy and efficiency.
It also can be co-located at manufacturing and filling facilities.
This will reduce freight and potentially leverage the use and reuse of wastage, water and other resources.
In addition, we're building a future where innovative approaches, such as glass for good, enhance glass recycling while providing a benefit to the community, elevating O-I's ESG profile.
We are looking forward to sharing all of this and more in our coming 2020 sustainability report, which will be available at the end of Q3.
Now over to John.
I plan to cover a few topics today, including a recent performance, progress on our capital structure as well as our most current 2021 business outlook.
I'll start with a review of our second quarter performance on page seven.
O-I reported adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.
Results exceeded our guidance of $0.45 to $0.50, given stronger-than-anticipated shipments and favorable cost performance.
In particular, sales volume was up more than 18% from last year compared to our expectation of 15% or higher.
Segment profit was $232 million and significantly exceeded prior year results, which were impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
Higher selling prices substantially offset elevated cost inflation linked to higher energy and freight costs.
Naturally, higher sales volume and favorable mix boosted earnings.
Likewise, favorable cost performance was driven by a 27% improvement in production levels as the prior year was impacted by forced curtailment due to lockdown measures.
Keep in mind that maintenance and project activity costs have normalized for the disruption last year.
Cost performance also reflected continued good operating performance and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives.
The slide includes additional details on nonoperating items.
Let me point out that we did record a gain on an indirect tax credit in Brazil after a favorable court ruling, which has been excluded from management earnings.
Overall, we are pleased with favorable performance trends.
Moving to page eight.
We have provided more information by segment.
In the Americas, segment profit was $124 million, which is a significant increase compared to $52 million last year.
Higher earnings reflected 17% higher sales volume as the prior year was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
Higher prices substantially offset cost inflation, which was elevated due to higher freight costs.
In Europe, segment profit was $108 million compared to $42 million last year.
The significant earnings improvement reflected a 22% increase in sales volume, while the benefit of higher selling prices partially offset cost inflation.
In the case of both regions, very good operating performance, mostly reflected higher production, which increased 28% in each segment, while supply chains remain very tight across the globe.
Likewise, very good operating performance also benefited from our margin expansion initiatives.
Keep in mind that we no longer report in Asia Pacific region following the sale of ANZ last summer.
In addition to comparing results to last year, we have added a comparison to 2019 to better understand our performance with pre-pandemic trends.
As illustrated on page nine, our current underlying performance exceeds pre-pandemic levels.
Adjusted primarily for the divestiture of ANZ, segment profit was up $7 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2019.
Overall, higher selling prices have nearly offset elevated cost inflation, while sales volume and mix were comparable to 2019 levels.
Favorable results were really driven by improved operating and cost performance reflecting our margin expansion initiatives.
Let's shift to cash flows in the balance sheet.
I'm now on page 10.
We are following a specific set of guiding principles that are aligned with our strategy to increase shareholder value.
As we focus on maximizing free cash flow, we expect significantly higher cash flow this year and key working capital measures should be in line or favorable compared to 2020 levels.
As illustrated on the chart, our second quarter cash flow was $117 million and was comparable to the prior year, which benefited from significant inventory reduction due to forced production curtailment.
Over the past year, we have improved the consistency of our cash flows and now reflect normal seasonality of our business, solid operating results and very good working management.
Second, we preserved our strong liquidity and finished the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion committed liquidity well above the established floor.
Third, we are reducing debt.
We expect net debt will end the year below $4.4 billion, and our BCA leverage ratio should end the year in the high 3s compared to 4.4 times at the end of 2020.
We expect to receive divestiture proceeds over the next several months, which will further improve our balance sheet position.
Please note, these targets could shift if the Paddock trust funding occurs prior to year-end.
At the end of the second quarter, net debt was down almost $1 billion from the same period last year, reflecting improved free cash flow and proceeds from divestitures.
Furthermore, our bank credit agreement leverage ratio was around 3.8 times as of midyear, which is well below our covenant limit.
Finally, we intend to derisk legacy liabilities as we advance the Paddock Chapter 11 process.
As previously announced, we have an agreement-in-principle for a consensual plan of reorganization, whereby O-I will support Paddock's funding of a 524(g) trust.
Total consideration is $610 million to be funded at the effective date of the plan.
Importantly, the agreement provides a channeling injunction protecting Paddock, O-I and their affiliates from current and future liability.
The Paddock reorganization is proceeding as expected and timing will be a function of the remaining legal and court actions to conclude this matter.
As previously noted, we have ample liquidity to fund the trust in the future.
And for clarity, we are not considering equity as a funding method.
Likewise, we remain highly focused on reducing our total debt obligations over time through free cash flow and proceeds from divestitures.
Let me wrap up with a few comments on our business outlook.
I'm now on page 11.
As Andres mentioned, we anticipate our business performance will improve in 2021 as markets stabilize and recover.
We expect third quarter adjusted earnings will approximate $0.47 to $0.52 per share.
Naturally, this is a meaningful improvement from the third quarter of 2020, which was impacted by ongoing COVID required production curtailments in Mexico and the Andeans.
Overall, we expect shipments will be flat to up 1% from the prior year.
Keep in mind, demand had already rebounded in the third quarter of 2020 from pandemic lows.
Production should be up about 8% to 10% from last year, which was still impacted by lockdown measures in some markets.
At the same time, certain costs like maintenance and depreciation have normalized following the pandemic-induced disruption last year.
Likewise, the current supply chain is fairly stretched across the value chain, reflecting the impact of prior year production curtailments as well as a strained transportation situation in many markets.
Finally, we expect continued solid operating performance and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives.
Our full year 2020 outlook has improved as we've tightened our earnings expectations to the high end of our guidance range and increased our free cash flow estimate.
We now expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.75 per share and free cash flow of approximately $260 million.
This adjustment reflects higher expected shipment levels, which we now anticipate will increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020.
Likewise, we expect the benefit of our margin expansion initiatives will also exceed our original goal of $50 million.
We anticipate the benefit of higher shipments and improved cost performance will more than offset the impact of winter storm Uri, which, of course, was not included in our original guidance.
During this session, we will update our plans that will include more details on MAGMA.
Likewise, we will share key company targets and milestones.
Subsequent investor events will expand on these key topics.
Let me wrap up with a few comments on slide 12.
Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which exceeded our guidance due to stronger sales volumes and improved cost performance.
In fact, our underlying performance was favorable across key business levers.
Selling prices and volumes were up and costs were down.
Our margin expansion initiatives are working well, and our ability to deliver on our commitments has improved, underpinned by advanced capabilities across business functions, rigorously built over the last few years.
I'm very pleased with the progress we are making on our bold plan to change O-I's business fundamentals.
Our business is more stable.
We have well-structured business planning processes, and we are a much more agile and resilient organization.
Likewise, we are removing the constraints of the past, like legacy asbestos liabilities, while successfully advancing breakthrough innovations, such as MAGMA.
Finally, we are encouraged by market trends, which is reflected in our improved earnings and cash flow guidance for 2021.
Over the past several years, we have been hard at work, improving the foundational capabilities of our company as well as staging the company for continued transformation.
We look forward to our Investor Day on September 28.
During this event, we will share our exciting plans to align glass and O-I with the future packaging for decades to come.
We are confident this plan will increase shareholder value and all share a new period of prosperity for life.
","O-I Glass reported strong second quarter results, exceeding guidance due to favorable shipment levels and ongoing operating performance. Adjusted earnings per share reached $0.54, reflecting an 18% increase in shipments and 27% production rebound compared to the prior year impacted by the pandemic. The company's margin expansion initiatives have surpassed expectations, with benefits totaling $40 million in the first half of 2021 and exceeding the original $50 million target for the year. O-I remains optimistic about its business outlook, with improved earnings and cash flow guidance for 2021. The company anticipates third quarter adjusted earnings of $0.47 to $0.52 and full year earnings between $1.65 to $1.75 per share. This reflects higher expected shipment levels, increased 4% to 5% compared to 2020, and continued solid operating performance."
IEX_q4_2020.txt,"This is Mike Yates, vice president and chief accounting officer for IDEX Corporation.
The format for our call today is as follows.
We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's businesses, including a recap of our recent performance and how we are viewing 2021.
Eric will then provide an update on a few initiatives that we believe are key to IDEX's culture before moving into a review of our order performance and providing our 2021 outlook for our end markets.
Bill will then discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results.
And we'll conclude with an outlook for the first-quarter and full-year 2021.
It's been a year full of challenge and change with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace.
In that environment, our people continue to shine.
Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited.
The COVID trends across Europe, North America, and India have been troubling, and we continue to follow those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work.
We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical innovation we need to support our long-term strategy, as well as producing new products to help the fight against the pandemic.
Bill will walk through the details shortly, with customer focus, strong execution and our ability to react quickly to unpredictable events helped us deliver a relatively strong performance in 2020, a true testament to our resiliency.
Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic hit, and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year.
As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021.
We have seen a steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides.
The diversity and quality of our businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize when market conditions improve.
While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back to core commercial endeavors as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages of COVID-19.
Our businesses remain focused on operating safely, and we are prepared to leverage our supply chains and react to increased demands.
A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company.
Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe?
If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive.
IDEX is that kind of company, and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted.
I'm proud of the culture we have built at IDEX.
It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still.
We leverage our culture and mission to bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company, and our commitment to work even harder to support diversity, equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation.
Our resiliency, agility, and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well-positioned to play off as aggressively as we move forward.
We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets, and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives.
The M&A markets are moving again, and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions.
In January, we announced an agreement to acquire Abel Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter.
We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses, as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders.
Moving to Slide 7.
As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture, focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation toward the most important needs of their customers.
Our culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities.
To that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day.
Last month, the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts.
IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company.
The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved, disadvantaged people of color in our communities.
This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving.
In addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers, and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people.
This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world.
The feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion.
Developing a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority.
As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year.
We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation.
You have my commitment on that.
Turning now to our commercial results on Slide 8.
Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth-quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year.
We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third-quarter improvement, and that continued into the fourth quarter.
Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year over year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter.
FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses, continued strength in agriculture, and recovery in industrial day rate businesses.
HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses.
Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter.
Dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes BAND-IT after a strong bounce back in the third quarter, continued to improve based on auto market strength.
And Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines.
A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX.
We have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors.
We then faced the onset of the pandemic, and we responded to it with purpose.
As we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels.
The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well-positioned as we move into 2021.
Turning to Slide 9.
We provide our current outlook for primary end markets.
In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter, further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter.
We see this increase driven largely by opex needs of our customers.
We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold.
We anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again.
But the investment discussions are happening.
Our Water business has continued to show resiliency, and we are closely monitoring the toll that 2020 will take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond.
The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the previous two quarters has continued, and we expect it to grow in 2021.
Energy markets continue to remain challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels.
Stabilization of these businesses is largely dependent on increases in fuel prices, driving new capital investments in oil and gas.
Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment.
We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives.
While some of this revenue is one-time in nature, we believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities in 2022 and beyond.
So relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million.
AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021.
In life sciences, we saw an offset by continued weakness in IVD/BIO as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response, putting on hold other projects and initiatives.
The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter has continued.
In addition, our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive.
We see continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in China and India.
Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business.
Moving to the Fire & Safety/Diversified segment.
We saw continued improvement in most of our markets.
The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets.
As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations, springing on our BAND-IT business.
Fire & Rescue businesses continued to see strong order performance and we believe that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses, driving through some of the delays in backlog concerns we referenced last quarter.
As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending.
As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing across most of our markets.
And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first half of 2021.
Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively.
And the strategic actions we have taken across our businesses has us well-positioned to be able to ride the positive momentum we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic.
I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11.
Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically.
Organic orders increased across each of our segments with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous comments.
For the year, orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic.
Fourth-quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically.
Our industrial and energy markets led the decline but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units, led by strong performance in our ceilings, MPT, and dispensing businesses.
Full-year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness, and challenges in oil and gas.
Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture.
For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points.
Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9%, driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity.
Fourth-quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year.
Full-year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019.
I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following slide.
Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior-year ETR of 20.6% due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates.
Fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an earnings per share of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior-year adjusted EPS.
Full-year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year.
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income.
For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income, driven by strong working capital performance.
Moving on to Slide 12.
We're going to review our full-year adjusted operating income.
As Eric mentioned, we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins.
Using a similar framework as we have for the previous two quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full-year adjusted operating income.
Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year.
With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate.
The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items, and $10 million of price, net productivity, and negative business mix.
Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year.
This yielded a better-than-expected flow-through of 34%.
Again, organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income, less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit.
Overall, our team's focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well-positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021.
Moving on to guidance.
I'm on Slide 13.
Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%.
This translates to an earnings per share impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95, depending on our top-line results.
We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation, providing $0.04 of benefits.
The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of earnings per share benefit in the year.
As we move past the pandemic, we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities.
As business recovers, we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate.
As mentioned previously, we expect approximately two-thirds of the discretionary cost to return over time.
Additionally, we will be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities, as well as continue to fund our targeted organic growth initiatives.
These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance.
Next, we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year.
Finally, FMD has one-quarter of inorganic results, which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue but provide $0.03 of earnings per share pressure.
The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter.
Now, let's take a look at a couple of nonoperational items.
First, we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax, primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020, associated with equity vesting and option exercising.
Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX, providing $0.13 of earnings per share benefit.
So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year, and earnings per share expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020.
Moving to Slide 14.
Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first quarter and full year.
In Q1, we are projecting earnings per share to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%.
The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%.
We expect a 3% top-line benefit from the impact of FX, and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million.
Turning to some additional details for the full-year guidance.
Again, we're projecting full-year earnings per share in the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full-year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8%, with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%.
We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top-line results.
The full-year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million.
And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income.
Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year.
Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges.
Abel Pump is not included in these estimates, and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed.
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.
We have proven the resilience of our businesses and clearly demonstrated the impact of the IDEX difference in our operating model.
While we are not completely out of the woods, this is a time for optimism.
And I believe that our businesses are well-positioned to focus on the critical priorities that will accelerate our growth on the other side of the pandemic.
","IDEX Corporation, despite facing pandemic-related challenges, reported a strong performance in 2020 with fourth-quarter orders increasing by 7% organically. The company's strategy of focusing on innovation, operational efficiency, and financial discipline has resulted in record free cash flow. As the pandemic subsides, IDEX anticipates a bullish 2021 with organic revenue growth projected at 6-8%. End market recovery is evident across most sectors, including strength in agriculture and industrial day rates. The company continues to invest in organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while expanding its capabilities in M&A execution. IDEX remains focused on enhancing its culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion to support its growth strategy. For 2021, IDEX projects earnings per share of $5.65 to $5.95, driven by productivity enhancements and structural cost actions. While acknowledging the potential for interruptions in the first half of the year, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the positive momentum it has experienced as the pandemic recedes."
MAN_q1_2021.txt,"We will start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter, then Jack will go through the operating results and the segments, our balance sheet and cash flow, and guidance for the second quarter.
I will then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session.
But before we proceed, Jack will now cover the safe harbor language.
These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs.
It has been one year since we first referred to the unfolding uncertainty of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns in many of our markets.
At that time, we all had little idea of the magnitude of what lay ahead or what the road to recovery in the most challenging operating environment in our history would look like.
From that moment on we were determined to mitigate the impact on our financial results with early and strong actions and continue our investments in strategic initiatives, so we emerge stronger when the pandemic ends.
Those priorities have enabled us to start 2021 in a good position as we see that the signs of recovery continue to play out in many markets.
That said, the recovery is uneven and although many markets are steadily strengthening other markets, particularly in Europe, continue to experience COVID-19 related difficulties, which are resulting in the need for more restrictions and which is impacting the rate of recovery.
Overall, we believe we are heading in the right direction and expect continued improvement.
Turning to our financial results.
In the first quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency.
We saw increased demand in many of our key markets and this resulted in a better than expected financial performance.
On a reported basis, we recorded an operating profit for the quarter of $98 million.
Excluding restructuring charges in the prior year, operating profit was up 8% in constant currency, marking a significant sequential improvement from the operating profit decline of 24% in the fourth quarter.
Operating profit margin was 2%, up 120 basis points from the prior year on a reported basis, and after excluding restructuring charges in the prior year operating profit margin increased 10 basis points.
Earnings per diluted share was $1.11.
Excluding restructuring charges in the prior year period, this reflects a constant currency increase of 28%.
The improving demand for our services also correlates to the recent results of our Q2 2021 ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey, which indicated broad-based improvements in hiring intentions by employers.
Our survey of 42,000 employers in 43 countries noted positive net employment trends across the majority of markets, a markedly different and improved outlook compared to the same time last year.
77% of employers anticipate returns to pre-pandemic hiring levels before the end of 2021, which is also a significant improvement from previous quarter surveys.
Among the major markets, the U.S. topped the list in terms of overall hiring intentions for the second quarter.
As the demand for skilled workers continues to strengthen, technology-related roles continue to be in demand as has been the case throughout much of the crisis.
However, we are now seeing strengthening demand also for talent within the manufacturing sectors as evidenced by the strong manufacturing PMI data in March.
Even the industries most impacted by the pandemic, hospitality, entertainment, and airlines are showing positive signs of rehiring with indications they will see significant increases in the second half of this year.
Logistics also shows no signs of reverting back to pre-crisis levels as the consumer shift to online retail is likely structural.
As workplaces reopen and workers return in phases, we are seeing demand for HR skills, especially with a greater focus on hiring and wellbeing.
And this is evidenced in the significantly improved demand for our RPO services.
Organizations that were reducing staff levels in 2020 are now seeking strategic and operational flexibility as they optimize their workforce plans, reassess talent needs, and implement hybrid work models.
We are well-positioned to provide the expertise and services to meet this rising demand.
Revenues in the first quarter came in above our constant currency guidance range.
Our gross profit margin came in at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Our operating profit was $98 million representing an increase of 161% or 146% on a constant currency basis.
Excluding restructuring charges in the prior year, operating profit increased 14% or 8% on a constant currency basis.
This resulted in an operating profit margin of 2%, which was 50 basis points above the high end of our guidance.
Breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 6%, our constant currency revenue increased 1%.
After considering net dispositions and fewer billing days, the organic days adjusted revenue increase was 2%.
This represented a significant improvement from the fourth quarter revenue decline of 6.5% on a similar basis.
Turning to the earnings per share bridge on Slide 4.
Earnings per share was $1.11, which significantly exceeded our guidance range.
Walking from our guidance mid-point, our results included improved operational performance of $0.42, slightly lower than expected foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of $0.01, a slightly better than expected effective tax rate that added $0.01 and a lower weighted average share count from share repurchases that also added $0.01.
Looking at our gross profit margin in detail, our gross margin came in at 15.6%.
Underlying staffing margin contributed to a 10 basis point reduction.
A lower contribution from permanent recruitment also contributed 10 basis points of GP margin reduction, which was offset by a higher mix of MSP gross profit on very strong growth in the quarter.
Next, let's review our gross profit by business line.
During the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 63% of gross profit, our Experis professional business comprised 21% and Talent Solutions brand comprised 16%.

This was driven by RPO, which experienced significant double-digit revenue growth as hiring programs continued to strengthen.
MSP business continued to perform well and experienced mid-to-high single digit revenue growth in the quarter.
Career transition activity continued to run off, which contributed to revenue reductions in Right Management in the U.S., as other Talent Solutions offerings experienced solid growth.
Provided there are no significant business restrictions impacting our clients across the U.S., in the second quarter, we expect ongoing underlying improvement and revenue growth for the U.S. in the range of 23% to 27% year-over-year.
Our Mexico operation experienced a revenue decline of 4% in constant currency in the quarter, representing an improvement from the 6% decline in the fourth quarter.
As discussed last quarter, Mexico is in the process of advancing labor legislation that could prohibit certain types of temporary staffing not considered specialized services.
The proposed legislation is in the process of review by the Senate.
When the legislation is adopted in final form, we will assess the potential impact on our business.
It is possible the legislation could be finalized before the end of April, and we would expect the effective date would be a number of months following enactment of the new law.
We will provide a further update during our second quarter earnings call.
Mexico represented between 2.5% and 3% of our global revenues in 2020.
Revenue in Canada increased 3% in days-adjusted constant currency during the quarter.
This represented an improvement from the fourth quarter days-adjusted revenue decline of 10%.
Revenues in the Other Countries within Americas increased 9% in constant currency reflecting improvement from the 4% increase in the fourth quarter.
This was driven by significant constant currency revenue growth in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

France revenue comprised 55% of the Southern Europe segment in the quarter and increased 1% in days-adjusted constant currency.
Although increased restrictions slowed the rate of underlying revenue improvement, the French business performed well in a challenging environment.
This reflects a days-adjusted constant currency decline of about 9% to 10% in January and February and growth of 27% in March as we began to anniversary the onset of the pandemic.
OUP was $43 million in the quarter and OUP margin was 3.6%.
As we begin the second quarter, despite the increased restrictions in France, we are holding associates on assignment relatively steady and cautiously anticipate modest improvement in activity during the quarter.
We are estimating a year-over-year constant currency increase in revenues in the range of 68% to 72% in the second quarter overall, as we anniversary the bottom of the pandemic.
Comparing estimated second quarter revenues to pre-crisis levels in constant currency, this represents an 11% decline compared to 2019 levels in the second quarter using the midpoint of our guidance.
Revenue in Italy equaled $403 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 14% in days-adjusted constant currency, which was a significant improvement from the 3% growth in the fourth quarter.
Excluding restructuring costs in the prior year, OUP increased 13% year-over-year in constant currency to $19 million and OUP margin was flat to the prior year.
Italy is already performing above pre-crisis 2019 levels in the first quarter.
We estimate that Italy will continue to perform very well in the second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 42% to 46%.
Revenue in Spain increased 5% in days-adjusted constant currency from the prior year.
This represents a reduction from the significant growth in the fourth quarter, which reflected significant seasonal year-end logistics activity.

Our U.K. business continues to see strong public sector activity and increased demand across all brands.
The U.K. is already performing above pre-crisis 2019 levels in the first quarter.
We expect growth in the 30% to 35% constant currency range year-over-year in the second quarter, which also reflects significant new customer activity.
In Germany, revenues declined 16% in days-adjusted constant currency in the first quarter, which represented a significant improvement from the 31% decline in the fourth quarter on the same basis.
Although Germany continues to be a difficult market for our industry, we expect to see ongoing revenue improvement in Germany with year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
In the Nordics, revenues declined 1% in days-adjusted constant currency, representing an improvement from the 6% decline on the same basis from the fourth quarter.
Revenue in the Netherlands decreased 4% in days-adjusted constant currency, representing an improvement from the 12% decline on the same basis in the fourth quarter.

Revenue in Other Markets in Asia Pacific Middle East declined 7% in constant currency, which was equal to the rate of revenue decline in the fourth quarter.
Now that ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited has released their 2020 Annual Report, we'd like to provide a brief update on their results.
As we previously disclosed, we remain the largest shareholder and record our approximate 37% share of earnings below operating profit.
In 2020, the company successfully managed an extremely challenging environment and recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 6%, which included 28% staffing revenue growth in Mainland China and achieved an increase in profits attributable to owners.
We are very pleased with the progress of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited.
I'll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet.
During the first quarter, free cash flow equaled $128 million compared to $172 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting more significant accounts receivable declines in the prior year quarter.
At quarter end, days sales outstanding decreased year-over-year by almost four days to 56 days.
Capital expenditures represented $13 million during the quarter.
During the first quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares of stock for $100 million.
As of March 31st, we have 2.2 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in August of 2019.
Our balance sheet was strong at quarter-end with cash of $1.52 billion and total debt of $1.08 billion representing a net cash position of $440 million.
Our debt ratios at quarter end reflect total gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of 2.33 and total debt to total capitalization at 31%.
Our debt and credit facility did not change in the quarter.
In addition, our revolving credit facility for $600 million remained unused.
Next, I'll review our outlook for the second quarter of 2021.
Our guidance continues to assume no material additional lockdowns or business restrictions impacting our clients in any of our largest markets beyond those that exist today.
On that basis, we are forecasting earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.44, which includes a favorable impact from foreign currency of $0.10 per share.
Our constant currency revenue guidance growth range is between 27% and 31%.
The midpoint of our constant currency guidance is 29%.
A slight increase in billing days in the second quarter is partially offset by the slight impact of net dispositions, and as a result, our outlook for organic days adjusted revenue growth is also 29% at the midpoint.
Adding the context with comparisons to pre-crisis activity levels, this would represent a second quarter organic constant currency decline in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% compared to 2019 revenues.
We expect our operating profit margin during the second quarter to be up 180 basis points at the midpoint compared to the prior year.
This reflects another quarter of continued strong sequential underlying improvement.
We estimate that the effective tax rate in the second quarter will be 34%.
Based on improved earnings mix, we are now estimating the full-year effective tax rate will be approximately 34%, a 1% improvement from our previous estimate of 35%.
As usual, our guidance does not incorporate restructuring charges or additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 55.4 million.
The challenging operating environment has not slowed our investments and plans to accelerate our diversification, digitization, and innovation initiatives.
Our plans to simplify and prioritize or helping us realize improved efficiencies.
Amidst all the disruption, what we knew all along has been confirmed and it is the combination of technology and people-first approach of our teams that allows us to confidently manage global uncertainty, deliver locally and collaborate both personally and remotely as necessary.
A good example of this is the recent recognition by industry analyst ALM for our Digitally Enabled, Data Driven Workforce Solutions in ManpowerGroup Talent Solutions.
We are the only company in our industry to have received the Pacesetter designation and it serves as a good example of the strength of our Powersuite technology platforms.
ESG is a very important component of our strategy and we're also proud to have been recognized around the globe for our commitment to driving positive change for people and societies and for our responsible business practices.
We have been awarded the highest recognition by EcoVadis, a provider of trusted business sustainability ratings.
Our France and Norway businesses achieved the global Platinum Award level placing us in the top 1% of all companies assessed.
We now have platinum, gold and silver EcoVadis ratings in more than 20 countries.
For the 12th year, ManpowerGroup has also been recognized by Ethisphere as a World's Most Ethical Company, again we are the only company in the industry to earn this award.
These recognitions are testament to the dedication and commitment of our people to keep the world of work turning in a sustainable and ethical way placing millions of people into jobs during a global pandemic, living our purpose that meaningful and sustainable employment has the power to change the world.
I'd now like to open the call for Q&A.
","ManpowerGroup reported stronger-than-expected financial performance in Q1 2021, with revenue increasing 1% year-over-year to $4.9 billion and operating profit improving 8% in constant currency. Demand for their services is increasing, as evidenced by an improved hiring outlook from the ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey. All major markets, particularly the U.S., are showing positive hiring intentions. The U.S. segment experienced revenue growth of 23% to 27% year-over-year, while Southern Europe saw revenue improvement, with France estimating a 68% to 72% growth in the second quarter. Northern Europe's U.K. market is already performing above pre-crisis levels, with expected growth in the 30% to 35% range. The company expects Q2 2021 earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.44, representing continued improvement. ManpowerGroup continues to invest in diversification, digitization, and innovation while maintaining a commitment to sustainability and ethical business practices, as evidenced by various industry recognitions."
IDA_q3_2021.txt,"The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website.
We'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call today.
This cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We also have other company representatives available for a Q&A session after Lisa and Steve provide updates.
Slide four shows our quarterly financial results.
IDACORP's 2021 third quarter earnings per diluted share were $1.93, a decrease of $0.09 per share from last year's third quarter.
Earnings per diluted share over the first nine months of 2021 were $4.20, which were $0.25 above the same period last year.
The year-to-date earnings are the highest in the history of the company over the first 9 months of the year.
Today, we also tightened our full year 2021 IDACORP earnings guidance estimate upward to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize in 2021 any of the additional tax credits that are available to support earnings under its Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation.
These are our estimates as of today, and they assume normal weather conditions and a continued return to more normal economic conditions over the balance of 2021.
I will begin by addressing the robust economic growth we continue to experience in Idaho Power service area.
You'll see on slide five that customer growth has increased 2.9% since September 2020.
We believe that quality of life, a business-friendly environment and reliable affordable energy from Idaho Power continue to attract a steady influx of business and residential customers, to the benefit of both our company and the local economy.
And while the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic linger, we continue to see a return to normal operations for most of our commercial and industrial customers.
As of the end of September, unemployment in our service area was 2.6% compared to the current rate of 4.8% nationally.
Total employment in our service area has increased 3.3% over the past 12 months.
Moody's forecasted GDP now calls for economic growth of 6.1% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022.
We are encouraged by this growth trend and forecast, especially considering the challenges we have all faced over the past 18 months.
At the local level, we are grateful to see businesses continue to bounce back from the various impacts of the pandemic.
Idaho Power continues to experience a strong volume of potential customers interested in expanding in our service area.
Many prospective projects are expressing a need for rapid speed to market and are seeking existing buildings versus greenfield construction.
This demand is fueling significant industrial spec development to construct shell buildings ranging from 50,000 to 250,000 square feet.
While a number of local developers are building out industrial parks, several nationally recognized developers are making large investments in anticipation of ongoing growth in Idaho's industrial sector.
As you may know, Idaho Power serves a large dairy industry and the state of Idaho ranks as the third largest dairy producing state in the U.S. We've recently received a number of inquiries for dairy waste to energy projects that use electricity as part of the process to produce renewable natural gas that is placed into pipelines.
One such project announced this month by Shell Oil Products U.S. will construct a waste to energy natural gas facility at a large dairy operation in Southern Idaho.
The plan is for the gas to be shipped by pipeline from Idaho to California.
You'll recall that this summer brought extreme high temperatures to our region, which combined with customer growth led to record energy demand.
Idaho Power hit a new all-time peak load of 3,751 megawatts on June 30, and exceeded the previous peak load more than 60 separate hours during June and July, as the weather remained hot and dry over most of the summer.
This led to strong sales across most customer classes.
The benefits of those sales were offset somewhat by Idaho Power's portion of the associated higher power supply costs, in part, because energy was at a premium across much of the West, due to the persistent hot dry conditions.
It was a challenging summer, and we learned some valuable lessons, and I am so pleased to see that both our people and our grid were up to the task.
We anticipate sustained growth in the demand for electricity, a challenge that is amplified by constraints in the transmission system impacting our ability to import energy into Idaho Power system, especially during peak load period.
As a result, we will need new resources to serve customers and maintain system reliability.
Last quarter, I mentioned, Idaho Power had issued a request for proposal to add 80 megawatts of new resources by summer 2023 and expects to issue an additional RFP in late 2021 or early 2022 to meet anticipated needs beyond 2023.
Based on our efforts to address the 2023 projected load deficits, you'll see on slide six that we now could potentially add approximately $100 million in additional capital expenditures related to the 80-megawatt project during the current 5-year forecast window.
These new resources will be in addition to the 120-megawatt solar project scheduled to come online at the end of next year, and the Boardman to Hemingway 500-KV transmission line that will enable an increased import of energy from across the Pacific Northwest as soon as 2026.
Our 2021 integrated resource planning efforts are focused on ensuring we continue to deliver reliable affordable clean energy for our growing customer base from diverse resources.
On the regulatory front, I would like to provide an update on our recent request to accelerate depreciation for the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant.
Last quarter, I mentioned our filing with the Idaho Commission to increase rates $30.8 million in December of this year.
In September, PacifiCorp, our co-owner and operator of the Jim Bridger plant, submitted an IRP to the Idaho Commission that contemplates ceasing coal-fired generation in units 1 and 2 in 2023, and converting those units to natural gas generation by 2024.
At a public meeting this week, the Idaho Commission approved a joint motion to suspend the Idaho power's rate request, while the parties assess this option and environmental compliance requirements for the plant.
We expect to resolve the uncertainties in this case before the end of 2021.
I'd also like to share a brief update on the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line project.
In July, Idaho Power awarded contracts for detailed design, geotechnical investigation, land surveying and right-of-way option acquisition for B2H.
That work commenced during the third quarter.
Given the status of ongoing permitting activities and the construction period, Idaho Power expects the in-service date for the transmission line will be no earlier than 2026.
I have also mentioned on previous calls at Idaho Power and our co-participants are exploring several scenarios of ownership, asset and service arrangements aimed at maximizing the value of the project for each of the co-participants customers.
Any changes regarding the ownership structure would be addressed through amended or new agreements for future phases of the project.
We hope to be able to share more detailed updates in the near-term.
Given the expected increase in capital spending along with the current growth projection and other factors, Idaho Power could file a general rate case in Idaho and Oregon within the next couple of years.
Steady customer growth, constructive regulatory outcomes, effective cost management, and economic conditions, all play significant roles as we refine the need and timing of a future general rate case.
Slide seven shows a recent outlook of precipitation and weather from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Current weather projections for November through January show a 33% to 40% chance for both above normal precipitation and above normal temperatures in much of Idaho Power service area.
If these mild and wet conditions materialize, it could provide a needed boost to our regional snowpack, as well as our forecast for the clean low cost hydro generation that has traditionally been our single largest generation resource.
We will be praying for snow certainly.
And with the storms of this week, we are off to a great start.
Let's now move to slide eight, where you'll see our third quarter 2021 financial results as compared to the same period in 2020.
While this year's third quarter was a bit lower than last year's related to the timing of irrigation sales in both years, IDACORP has achieved the highest first 9 months of earnings ever recorded.
We had a very good quarter, and with continued benefits from higher sales to new customers, and higher sale in most customer classes, as well as positive impacts from transmission revenues.
We also saw lower sales to irrigation customers after strong irrigation loads in the second quarter, and a return to more typical operating and maintenance expenses compared to the same period last year.
On the table of quarter-over-quarter changes, you'll see our continuing customer growth added $5.1 million to operating income.
Increased usage per customer drove operating income higher by $22.9 million.
Cooling degree days were 14% higher than last year's third quarter, and the hot and dry conditions lead to 3% higher residential per customer usage, while more normal operating conditions lead to a respective 3% and 1% higher usage per commercial and industrial customers.
The timing of precipitation, which was higher than last year's dry third quarter, and the early start of the irrigation season that was reflected in our second quarter's results, along with some limitations on water in the third quarter all led to a 4% decline in irrigation per customer usage.
You'll note on the table that the combined usage changes lead to a $0.2 million increase to operating income.
A higher usage for residential and small general service customers was partially offset by $1.4 million of lower revenues from the FCA mechanism next on the table.
Further down, you'll see a decrease in operating income of $3 million that relates to the change in the per megawatt hour revenue, net of power supply costs, and power cost adjustment impacts quarter-to-quarter.
The primary driver of this decrease relates to the decrease in annual customer rates reflecting the full depreciation of all Boardman power plant investments after ceasing coal-fired operations at that plant last year.
In addition, the balance of the decrease relates to the amount of net power supply expenses that were not deferred to Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.
Recall that Idaho customers generally bear 95% of power supply cost fluctuations and those costs were higher as the summer heat wave impacted wholesale energy prices; at a time of increased energy usage by our customers.
The heat wave also affected transmission wheeling-related revenues, which increased operating income by $4.7 million.
Wheeling volumes increased as utilities work to serve high demand by moving energy across our system throughout the region during the quarter, combined with 2 new long-term wheeling agreements that also increased transmission within related revenues this quarter and run through March of 2024.
Wheeling customers also paid 10% more for Idaho Power's out-rate ph that increased in October of 2020 to reflect higher transmission costs.
That out-rate ph increased an additional 4% on October 1, 2021, to further reflect higher costs going forward.
Next on the table, other operating and maintenance expenses increased by $4.9 million, primarily due to a return to more normal levels of purchase services and maintenance costs, compared with the previous year's third quarter, which was more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
While some economic effects of the pandemic continue, much business activity has returned to more normal levels.
You'll note that we continue to expect our full year O&M to be within our previously guided range.
Finally, income tax expense increased $3.4 million this quarter due mostly to plant related income tax return adjustments, which were positive last year and slightly negative in 2021.
These are generally recorded during the third quarter of each year upon completion of the prior year tax return.
The changes collectively resulted in a net decrease to IDACORP's net income of $4.1 million or $0.09 per share.
Earnings per diluted share over the first 9 months of 2021 are well above the same period last year by $0.25.
IDACORP and Idaho Power continue to maintain strong balance sheets including investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, which enable us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and distribute dividends to shareholders.
IDACORP's operating cash flows along with our liquidity positions as of the end of September 2021 are included on slide nine.
Cash flows from operations were about $19 million higher than the first 9 months of last year.
The increase was mostly related to the timing of net collections of regulatory assets and liabilities, and working capital fluctuations, partially offset by changes in deferred taxes and taxes accrued.
The liquidity available under IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities is shown on the middle of slide nine.
At this time, we still do not anticipate raising any equity capital in 2021 or 2022.
Our combined liquidity along with expected regulatory support from our annual adjustment mechanisms is a substantial backstop to our expected capital and operating needs.
Slide 10 shows this year's revised full year earnings guidance and our current key financial and operating metrics estimates.
Given the results year-to-date, we have listed the bottom end of our range and now expect IDACORP's 2021 earnings to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share.
This guidance assumes normal weather and operating conditions for the balance of the year.
Our guidance still assumes Idaho Power will use no additional tax credits in 2021.
And while we do not currently expect to record sharing of excess revenues with Idaho customers this year, the upper end of our range is near that level.
Recall that above a 10% return on equity in the Idaho jurisdiction, Idaho customers would receive 80% of any excess earnings.
Our expected full-year O&M expense guidance remains in the range of $345 million to $355 million.
It's fair to say this goal to keep O&M relatively flat for the 9th straight year continues to be challenged by the level of customers and load growth we're experiencing.
We also reaffirm our capex forecast for this year in the range of $320 million to $330 million.
Our expectation for hydro-generation was tightened within the range of 5.4 to 5.7 megawatt hours.
","IDACORP reported its third-quarter earnings with a modest decrease of $0.09 per share compared to last year, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.93. However, the company achieved the highest nine-month earnings in its history, with earnings per diluted share of $4.20. The revised full-year guidance range is now $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, based on normal weather conditions and a continued economic recovery. Customer growth has surged by 2.9%, driven by Idaho Power's reliable and affordable energy, attracting businesses and residents. To meet growing demand, the company plans to add approximately $100 million in additional capital expenditures related to the 80-megawatt project and other resources, including a 120-megawatt solar project and the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line. Despite higher power supply costs during the summer heat wave, strong sales have been reported across most customer classes. The company continues to monitor the regulatory environment, recently suspending a rate request to assess the potential conversion of the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant to natural gas generation. IDACORP maintains strong financial health with investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, enabling it to fund capital expenditures and distribute dividends to shareholders."
GTY_q3_2021.txt,"We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.
With Josh and me on the call today are Mark Olear, our Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Dickman, our Chief Financial Officer.
I will lead off today's call by providing an overview of our performance for the third quarter of 2021 and highlight the company's investment and capital markets activities.
And then I'll pass the call to Mark and Brian to discuss our portfolio and financial results in more detail.
The net result of our well-positioned in-place portfolio and the continued execution of our active and accretive investment program was a 5.8% increase in total revenues, a 13.2% increase in adjusted funds from operations, and a 6.4% increase in AFFO per share.
The company benefited from the stability of its portfolio of convenience and automotive retail assets, which continued to perform well, meaning that we had another quarter of full rent collections, including all amounts owed to us as a result of our 2020 COVID-related rent deferments.
The success of our investment strategies year-to-date has been a key contributor to our earnings growth.
We invested $61.1 million in 25 properties during the quarter, and another $8.8 million just after quarter-end, bringing our year-to-date total investment activity to more than $144 million.
This accelerated pace of investment activity was highlighted by our ability to bring new high-quality tenants into our portfolio, including Flash Market with sites located across the Southeastern U.S. and Splash Carwash, whose footprint spans the Northeast.
We also continue to successfully execute on our multiple investment strategies, which include [Indecipherable] leasebacks, accretive acquisitions of net leased properties, and development funding for new industry assets.
In addition, rent commenced on three redevelopment projects during the quarter including our second and third projects, with 7-Eleven for remodeled C&G locations in the Baltimore and Dallas-Fort Worth MSAs, bringing our completed projects to 22 since the inception of our redevelopment program.
We also announced yesterday that we successfully amended and extended our $300 million credit agreement, which now will mature in October 2021.
The improved terms of our facility further validate the company's platform and strong performance over the last several years.
When combined with our active ATM program, which we've used to raise more than $50 million this year, and our strong balance sheet, we continue to have access to capital and the right credit profile to support our growth objectives.
Given our performance year-to-date, I am pleased that our Board approved an increase of 5.1% in our recurring quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share.
This represents the eighth straight year with a dividend increase.
Our Board believes this annual increase is appropriate, as it maintains a stable payout ratio and is tied to the company's growth over the past year.
Furthermore, we are again pleased that our year-to-date accretive investment activity has positioned the company to raise its 2021 AFFO per share guidance.
I want to reiterate our commitment to effectively executing on both new investment activity and the active asset management of our portfolio.
Our teams continue to work diligently to source and underwrite new opportunities to invest across our target asset classes including convenience stores, car washes, automotive-related retail properties in strong metropolitan markets across the country as well as to unlock embedded value through selective redevelopments.
We believe our success year-to-date demonstrates our ability to source opportunities that align with our investment strategies, and that will continue to drive additional shareholder value.
As of the end of the third quarter, our portfolio includes 1,011 net lease properties, five active redevelopment sites, and five vacant properties.
Our weighted average lease term was approximately 8.8 years, and our overall occupancy, excluding active redevelopments, remains constant at 99.5%.
Our portfolio spans 36 states across the country plus Washington, D.C., and our annualized base rents, 63% of which come from the top 50 MSAs in the U.S., continue to be well covered by our trailing 12-month tenant rent coverage ratio of 2.6 times.
In terms of our investment activities, we had a highly successful quarter in which we invested $61.1 million in 25 properties.
Subsequent to the quarter-end, we acquired two additional properties for $8.8 million, bringing our year-to-date investment activity to $144.5 million across 82 properties.
We completed two transactions in the convenience and gas sector during the quarter.
The first was a 15 property sale-leaseback with Flash Market, a subsidiary of Transit Energy Group.
In this transaction, we invested $35.1 million to acquire the properties, which are located throughout the Southeast United States with a concentration around the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina MSA.
Properties acquired have an average store size of 3,600 square feet and an average property size of 1.7 acres.
In addition, 53% of the properties have sub-tenancies with either quick-serve restaurants or auto service operators.
We also completed our first development funding project with Refuel in the Charleston, South Carolina MSA.
Our total investment in the project was $4.5 million, including our final investment of $1.1 million during the third quarter.
As per the terms of our development funding transactions, we acquired the property upon completion of development in conjunction with our final funding payment and simultaneously entered into a long-term triple net lease.
In the carwash sector, we completed three transactions in the quarter.
We acquired two newly constructed properties from WhiteWater Express carwash in Michigan for $7 million.
These properties were added to our existing unitary lease with WhiteWater.
We also acquired two additional properties for an aggregate purchase price of $8 million, which are leased to Go Car Wash in San Antonio, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada MSAs.
Additionally, we acquired our first property with Splash car wash, which is located in New Haven, Connecticut MSA.
Our purchase price was $4 million for the property.
In the auto service sector, we acquired our first Mavis Tire property.
We invested $4.6 million to acquire the properties in the Chicago, Illinois MSA.
Getty also advanced $1.2 million of development funding from three new industry convenience stores with Refuel in the Charleston, South Carolina MSA, bringing the total amount funded by Getty for these projects to $8.9 million at quarter-end.
As part of this transaction, we will accrue interest on our investment during the construction phase of the project, and we will expect to acquire the properties via sale-leaseback transaction upon completion and final funding.
The weighted average initial lease term of our completed transactions for the quarter was 14.6 years, and our aggregate initial cash yield on our third quarter acquisitions was 6.7%.
Subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired two properties in the Boyington, Vermont MSA from Splash Carwash.
Purchase price was $8.8 million, and the cap rate was consistent with our year-to-date acquisition activity.
We ended the quarter with a strong investment pipeline and remain highly committed to continuing to grow our portfolio of convenience and automotive retail real estate, and we expect to pursue that growth through continued sourcing of direct sale-leaseback, acquisitions of net lease properties, and development funding for new-to-industry assets.
Moving to our redevelopment platform.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $331,000 in both completed projects and sites, which remain in our pipeline.
In addition, rent commenced on three redevelopment projects during the quarter, including two 7-Eleven convenience stores and one property leased to BJ's Wholesale Club, which is adjacent to one of our newly constructed superstores.
In aggregate, we invested $0.5 million in these three projects and generate a return on investment capital of 43%.
At quarter-end, we had eight signed leases or letters of intent, which includes five active projects and three projects at properties, which are currently subject to triple net leases and have not yet been recaptured from the current tenants.
The company expects rent to commence at two additional development sites during the fourth quarter of 2021.
In total, we have invested approximately $1.9 million in eight redevelopment projects in our pipeline and estimate that these projects will require a total investment by Getty of $7.4 million.
We project these redevelopments will generate incremental returns to the company in excess of where we can invest these funds in the acquisition market today.
Turning to our asset management activities for the quarter.
We sold one property during the quarter, realizing $2.3 million in gross proceeds, and exited five lease properties.
We expect the total net impact of these activities will have de minimis impact on our financial results.
As we look ahead, we will continue to selectively dispose the properties that we determine are no longer competitive in their current format or do not have compelling redevelopment potential.
Let me start with a recap of earnings.
AFFO, which we believe best reflects the company's core operating performance, was $0.50 per share for the third quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 6.4%.
FFO was $0.48 per share for the quarter.
Our total revenues were $40.1 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.8%.
Rental income, which excludes tenant reimbursements and interest on notes and mortgages receivables was 7.5% to $34.3 million.
Strong acquisition activity over the last 12 months and recurring rent escalators in our leases were the primary drivers of the increase, with additional contribution from rent commencements at completed redevelopment projects.
On the expense side, G&A costs increased in the quarter, primarily due to employee-related expenses, including noncash and stock-based compensation.
Property costs decreased marginally due to reductions in real estate tax expense and environmental expenses, which are highly variable due to a number of estimates and non-cash adjustments, increased in the quarter due to certain legal fees and changes in net remediation costs and estimates.
We turn to the balance sheet and our capital markets activities.
We ended the quarter with $567.5 million of total debt outstanding, including $525 million of long-term fixed-rate unsecured notes and $42.5 million outstanding on our $300 million revolving credit facility.
Our weighted average borrowing cost was 4% and the weighted average maturity of our debt was 6.3 years.
In addition, our total debt to total market capitalization was 29%.
Our total debt to total asset value was 37%, and our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.1 times.
Each of these leverage metrics are calculated according to the definitions in our loan agreements.
As Chris mentioned, yesterday, we announced the amendment and extension of our $300 million revolving credit facility, which is now set to mature in October 2025, with two 6-month extensions, where we have the option to extend to October 2026.
In addition to extending the term, we were able to reduce the interest rate by 20 to 50 basis points, depending on where we are in the leverage-based pricing grid, and amend certain covenant provisions to align with those generally applicable to investment-grade rated REITs.
We also amended each of our outstanding unsecured notes to conform to the new credit facility covenant provisions.
All in all, this is a good transaction for Getty.
We reduced our cost of capital, improved some terms, and importantly, demonstrated the continued support of our bank group and unsecured noteholders.
With the credit facility extended, our nearest debt maturity is now the $75 million of senior unsecured notes that come due in June of 2023.
Moving to ATM activity.
We continue to be selective with our equity issuance during the quarter, raising $19.8 million at an average price of $31.12 per share.
Year-to-date, we raised a total of $50.1 million through the ATM.
We think about our future capital needs more broadly, we remain committed to maintaining a strong credit profile with meaningful liquidity and access to capital, low-to-moderate leverage, and a well-laddered and flexible balance sheet.
With respect to our environmental liability, we ended the quarter at $47.8 million, which was a decrease of approximately $300,000 from the end of 2020.
For the quarter, net environmental remediation spending was approximately $1.3 million.
And finally, as a result of our investment in capital markets activities in the first nine months of the year, we are raising our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $1.93 to $1.94 from our previous range of $1.89 to $1.91.
Our guidance includes transaction activity completed year-to-date but does not otherwise assume potential acquisitions or capital markets activities for the remainder of 2021.
Factors which may impact our guidance include variability with respect to certain operating costs and our expectation that we will remain active in pursuing acquisitions and redevelopments, which could result in additional expenses, including certain property demolition costs and transaction costs for deals that are ultimately not completed.
","Getty Realty Trust reported a 5.8% increase in revenue, a 13.2% increase in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), and a 6.4% increase in AFFO per share for the third quarter of 2021. The company invested $61.1 million in 25 properties and $8.8 million in two additional properties after quarter-end, bringing its year-to-date investment activity to $144.5 million across 82 properties. Notably, Getty extended its $300 million revolving credit facility to October 2025, reducing its interest rate and improving its covenant provisions. The company's portfolio consists of 1,011 net lease properties, five active redevelopment sites, and five vacant properties, with an occupancy rate of 99.5% and a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years. Getty raised its 2021 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $1.93 to $1.94 due to its strong investment and capital markets activities in the first nine months of the year."
DBD_q4_2019.txt,"This is the Diebold fourth-quarter earnings call for 2019.
For your benefit, we posted slides which will accompany our discussion today.
And our slides are available on the investor relations page of dieboldnixdorf.com.
In the supplemental schedules of our slides, we have reconciled each non-GAAP metric to its most directly comparable GAAP metric.
Additional information on these factors can be found in company's SEC filings.
And now, I'll pass the mic to Gerrard.
2019 was a good year for the company as we executed on our DN Now transformation initiatives and delivered financial results which were in line or better than our expectations.
To set the stage a bit, I want to reflect for a moment on where we were one year ago.
We were in the early stages of streamlining our operating model and simplifying our portfolio and we have clear goals for strengthening our balance sheet.
Fast forward to today, after year 1 of DN Now and we have met or exceeded on every commitment we made and are on track for future targets.
As shown on Slide 3, we reported total revenue of just over $4.4 billion which was within our initial range, and our results also included substantial currency headwinds of approximately $150 million.
We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $401 million which was within our initial outlook from February of 2019, and which represents a 25% increase over 2018.
And also included a foreign exchange impact of approximately $7 million.
Most importantly, we exceeded our free cash flow target, generating $93 million versus our initial expectation of breakeven.
In line with our focus, these results demonstrate meaningful improvements in profitability and cash flow.
We increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 280 basis points to 25.2% with strong margin expansion in all three segments and business lines.
Our progress enabled DN to boost its adjusted EBITDA margin by 210 basis points to 9.1%.
Free cash flow increased by $256 million.
And unlevered free cash flow jumped by $315 million reflecting our companywide focus on driving both operating and net working capital efficiencies while delivering these against the backdrop of significantly stronger customer satisfaction levels.
Our progress reduced our leverage ratio by more than a full turn, ending 2019 at 4.4 times.
With this progress, our core business has a stronger foundation yielding a more focused and efficient company.
I'm extremely pleased with how the entire team at DN focused on our shared goals.
It is because of our people that we are executing in line with our plan.
On Slide 4, you'll see a list of operating achievements for 2019.
For our banking customers, we enhanced our differentiation by launching our next-generation platform called DN Series, the most IoT-enabled platform on the market.
We also introduced a new cloud-based analytics platform called the AllConnect data engine, through which we will further differentiate our services capabilities.
During the fourth quarter, key wins included a multimillion dollar global agreement for dynamic software and DN Series ATMs with Citibank.
In Belgium, we won a multiyear ATM-as-a-Service agreement to update and maintain approximately 1,560 ATMs with a joint venture called JoFiCo.
Our end-to-end solution features our DN series units, a common DN dynamic software stack and cloud-based analytics from our AllConnect DataEngine.
Banking product orders in Q4 declined year over year as we're up against a strong result from the fourth quarter of 2018 especially in Latin America.
As we enter 2020, we expect some easing of demand from large North American banks as they complete their upgrade efforts.
In the retail segment, we increased our retail self-checkout shipments by more than 50% in 2019.
More recently, a leading market research firm in our space, retail Banking Research, recognized Diebold Nixdorf as the largest self-service kiosk provider in the world.
In the fourth quarter, we won a new $6 million contract at the U.S. value retailer for kiosks and dynamic software.
Continued growth in self-checkout orders and the easing of point-of-sale orders were in line with expectations in the quarter.
As the market for point-of-sale solutions evolves, D&S responding with introduction of an all in one point-of-sale system that brings together the latest technology in the stylish space saving design.
Important wins in the quarter included a $15 million contract with the Swiss gaming cooperative for 5,000 point-of-sale terminals, and a new 3-year $14 million agreement with a European do-it-yourself retailer to refresh the end-to-end customer checkout experience at several hundred stores spanning 12 countries.
When I reflect on 2019, the greatest accomplishments are those which require coordination across large sections of the company.
For example, we're very encouraged by the broad-based success of our services modernization plan which includes proactively upgrading hardware of software on more than 140,000 terminals and implementing standard practices globally.
Similarly, we have substantially increased our product gross margins by streamlining our manufacturing footprint, improving product pricing strategies and optimizing the number of ATM models.
In addition, we dramatically improved the efficiency of our inventory levels, collections and payables which added $110 million to our cash flow and our improving performance led to a successful extension of nearly $800 million of credit in August.
With these accomplishments in the books, we enter the second year of our DNA transformation with momentum across our efforts and confidence in our strategic direction.
Slide 5 summarizes our key DN Now initiatives which are positively impacting both the quality of revenue and the efficiency of operations.
Our execution momentum gives us confidence to increase our targeted gross savings from $400 million to $440 million through 2021.
I'll comment briefly on several initiatives that have been in place for several quarters.
First, the transition to our new operating model is complete and about $100 million of savings have been realized in 2019.
Next, we'll continue to simplify our product portfolio and further optimize our manufacturing footprint.
Heading into 2020, our focus is squarely on realizing the benefits from our next-generation banking solution, the DN Series.
Earlier in the call, I spoke about the actions and significant achievements of our services modernization plan.
While we're pleased with our progress, we believe there is further room to improve service delivery and operating efficiency.
In addition, we launched a new series of actions called software excellence aimed at improving our software operations and gross margins.
We are enhancing professional services delivery by optimizing our resources and improved presales scoping.
Within our software products, we're simplifying our offerings and placing a greater emphasis on software development effectiveness.
Our efforts to reduce general and administrative expenses picked up steam in Q4, and are expected to deliver meaningful savings in 2020 as we build a fit-for-purpose support structure for our business.
I've already mentioned our 2019 success on net working capital, and we are continuing to pursue efficiencies on this important metric.
The final initiative on this slide is divesting non-core assets, enabling us to focus on businesses that meet our return hurdles, creating value for shareholders.
In 2019, we divested or shut down a half a dozen businesses which generated about 2% of revenue.
During Jeff's remarks, he will discuss our focus on revenue quality in greater detail, including two additional transactions which further simplify the company's business operations, enhance liquidity and reduce risk.
On Slide 6, I'll discuss the progress we're making to simplify our product portfolio.
We successfully reduced the number of ATM terminals by about 30% in 2019, and we have solidified plans to further reduce legacy terminals by about 45% in 2020.
When coupled with changes to our manufacturing footprint and better rigor on contract bids, we expanded our non-GAAP product gross margin by 310 basis points in the quarter to 22% which is a multi-year high for the company.
Going forward, we expect to build on our success with the rollout of DN Series.
Early field performance results are confirming substantially higher performance levels than our already strong field performance from prior models.
Customer reactions have remained very positive.
And they see a compelling value proposition, including a more modular and upgradable design which includes our next-generation cash recycling technology, advanced sensor technology and connectivity to the DN AllConnect Data Engine which will increase uptime and offer a better customer experience, greater load capacity, improved reliability and industry-leading security features in a smaller footprint.
And increased options for personalization and branding.
We have initiated the certification process for DN Series with 240 customers across 35 countries.
Our sales pipeline is growing nicely and we fully expect to ramp production as many certification processes are completed in the next few months.
Slide 7 contains key performance metrics for our services modernization plan.
Our service renewal rate continue to exceed 95% during the fourth quarter while our contract base of ATMs remained stable at 582,000.
This chart shows our revised contract based figures which exclude about 35,000 units in China, following our reduction in ownership, the strategic alliance as part of our non-core asset divestiture actions.
As minority owners, services revenues from these units will be deconsolidated going forward.
The recent trend in contract base units reflects our focus on making the business more profitable.
We have completed much of this important work.
And as a result, we expect the services contract base to expand modestly to 590,000 by year-end 2020.
In addition, evolving customer demands have created a growing opportunity for managed services, and we're excited about the potential for securing these contracts.
Our gross services margin increased 330 basis points versus the prior year to 28.2% in the fourth quarter.
Once again, both retail and banking contributed to these gains.
This is the sixth quarter since we launched the program, and we have consistently delivered strong year-on-year gross margin expansion.
Our momentum underpins our confidence in achieving full-year gross margins of 28% to 29% by 2021.
Looking forward to 2020, our service priorities include continuing our modernization program across both banking and retail, growing our services contract base of ATMs and self-checkout terminals and leveraging our AllConnect Data Engine across more of our estate.
On Slide 8, I'll cover our initiatives to further reduce general and administrative expenses.
This is a key opportunity for DN in 2020 to further improve our effectiveness and efficiency.
Within the finance organization, we are executing on centralizing our accounting processes, making greater use of shared services and increasing automation.
In Q4, we built meaningful momentum.
And Jeff will provide more details about our plans to realize substantial savings from these actions over the next few quarters.
During 2019, we reduced our IT spend by consolidating data centers, ramping down spend on legacy platforms and by proactively improving the resiliency and utility of our systems.
In 2020, we are shifting our focus to digitally enabling more capabilities across the company.
So while we continue to rationalize our legacy systems, our greater focus.
We are implementing new tools to support our digital transformation.
We also continue with our procurement rigor and are proactively managing external spend.
Looking forward, we see incremental benefits to be realized.
With respect to our real estate footprint, we reduced our office square footage by about 10% by closing or rightsizing more than 40 locations.
For 2020, our goal is to reduce office space by another 10%, while also implementing more agile workforce practices.
In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to drive non-GAAP SG&A expense to $169 million, our low point for the year.
Looking forward, we expect our initiatives will harvest further efficiencies from functional G&A costs in 2020.
Before I hand over to Jeff, I want to address what we're seeing with respect to the coronavirus situation.
Our first priority focuses on the safety of our employees, customers and suppliers, and we're closely monitoring all developments.
We are also playing close attention to the impact that this developing situation may have on our supply chain, production and logistics.
As you're aware, many Chinese companies resumed production only yesterday, and with partial capacity and the situation, therefore, remains fluid.
Our current view is that we may incur higher freight costs and could experience potential delays from our suppliers as they work to return to normalcy in a way that ensures worker safety.
We're being proactive in developing alternative supplier strategies and have initiated efforts with other technology providers in exploring potential broader solutions to mitigate any supply chain disruptions.
At this stage, the situation remains dynamic, and any near-term impact should not change our long-term trajectory.
Now, over to Jeff for a discussion of our financial performance before I rejoin with a few concluding remarks.
2019 was a very strong year as we took major steps forward in our journey to value creation and are looking forward to building on that success in 2020.
Slide 9 contains our fourth-quarter financial highlights which are squarely in line with the company's outlook.
Excluding the impact from foreign currency headwinds and our divestitures, revenue declined 8.1% to $1.15 billion for the quarter.
Many of you should recall that we reported exceptional strength in our product revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 which was approximately $50 million more than we would typically expect, resulting in an unfavorable comparison.
In the fourth quarter and throughout 2019, we have focused on higher-quality revenue.
And that have been proactively reducing our exposure to lower-margin business which had a fourth-quarter revenue impact of approximately $40 million.
As a result, the year-over-year comps for the fourth quarter are not indicative of our 2020 revenue expectations.
These efforts, coupled with our DN Now progress, are producing tangible and sustainable gains to gross profit, operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin.
We increased gross margins by 300 basis points to 26.3% which translates to higher gross profit of $3 million.
Higher gross profit, coupled with lower operating expenses, enabled the company to boost operating profit by 20% from $83 million to $100 million.
Correspondingly, our operating margin increased by 230 basis points to 8.7%, while the adjusted EBITDA margin improved 180 basis points to 11.4%.
Return on invested capital was approximately 10% in 2019, much better than our mid-single-digit result in 2018.
Going forward, we will continue to be selective about how we go-to-market and build on this momentum which you will see reflected in our 2020 outlook.
We believe this will set us up nicely to execute on our growth initiatives for 2021 and beyond.
Slides 10 through 12 contain segment financials for the fourth quarter and full year.
On Slide 10, we disclose highlights for Eurasia Banking which were in line with our expectations.
Excluding currency and divestiture, revenue declined 8.8%.
The year-on-year variance was primarily due to our proactive efforts to address low margin business.
These actions include our service contract renewal discussions, higher margin thresholds on new deals as well as decline in certain non-core businesses which are in the process of being divested.
Operating profit through Eurasia Banking was impacted by revenue volume as well as a higher mix of professional services which has a lower software gross margin.
On the plus side, we continue to drive higher gross service margins for this segment from our DN Now initiatives.
For the full year, revenue declined 2.4% adjusted for currency, divestitures and other actions.
This decline was primarily due to our actions to harvest low margin business.
Partially offsetting these trends, we delivered product revenue growth from customers in EMEA.
Operating profit increased by $19 million or 13% to $169 million, and includes foreign currency headwinds of approximately $10 million.
Our operating profit gains reflect DN Now's success in driving higher service and product gross margins as well as lower operating expenses.
Slide 11 provides financial highlights for Americas Banking.
Fourth-quarter revenue declined 1.5% after adjusting for currency headwinds and divestitures.
During the quarter, we experienced lower product volume in Latin America, partially offset by product and software growth in North America.
Operating profit nearly tripled in the quarter from $14 million to $40 million when compared with the prior-year period.
Again, execution of our DN Now initiatives resulted in a 630 basis point expansion of the profit margin to 9.5%.
For the full year, revenue increased 7% excluding the impact of currency divestitures and related actions.
ATM upgrades, the adoption of cash recyclers and increased software activity fueled these revenue gains.
In our services businesses, we exited certain contracts which did not align with our gross margin hurdle rates.
Operating profit increased by more than $100 million to $120 million primarily due to our DN Now initiatives and revenue growth.
This is, by far, the best performance in Americas Banking's operating profit and margins since the combination.
Moving to Slide 12.
retail results were in line with expectations.
Revenue decreased 15% after factoring in currency headwinds and divestitures due primarily to a challenging comparison.
Our fourth-quarter 2018 retail revenue was approximately $50 million or 15% above our quarterly average as we delivered on a number of large POS refresh contracts.
Within this segment, we continue to grow self-checkout product revenue as we experienced lower POS sales versus the prior year.
Another factor is our strategic decision to reduce our exposure to low-margin business such as shuttering our consulting business and discontinuing the reselling of certain low margin hardware from third-party suppliers.
Higher quality revenue and better cost structure from the DN Now initiatives, increased operating profit by 62% to $21 million.
For the full year, retail revenue decreased 2.5%, again, excluding the impact of currency divestitures and related actions.
Operating profit increased by 23% to $58 million as we benefited from a more favorable mix of self-checkout products, higher services gross margins attributable to our services modernization plans and lower operating expenses.
Referencing Slide 13, I am pleased with our team's ability to generate $93 million of free cash flow for the full year of 2019.
On a year-on-year improvement of $256 million demonstrates the broad-based commitment to financial discipline across the company.
The DN Now initiatives were the key to our success as we increase adjusted EBITDA to $401 million and harvested $110 million of net working capital.
To put a finer point on our improvements, the company reduced net working capital as a percentage of revenue by 440 basis points from 18.3% to 13.9%.
Our free cash flow progress is even more impressive, considering that we offset $60 million of incremental interest payments.
Unlevered free cash flow was $275 million, an improvement of $315 million.
For the fourth quarter, the company generated free cash flow of $116 million and unlevered free cash flow of $168 million.
While these metrics are squarely in line with our expectation, they do represent a quarter-over-quarter decline as we have focused on working capital management throughout the year versus the fourth-quarter push in 2018.
A summary of our liquidity, leverage and capital structure can be found on Slide 14.
The company has sufficient liquidity to meet its seasonal cash flow needs, invest in R&D and fund our DN Now transformation program.
Total liquidity of approximately $770 million includes nearly $388 million of cash plus available credit.
Company ended the year with gross debt of $2.1 billion and net debt of $1.76 billion.
Our leverage ratio continues to improve declining to approximately 4.4 times at year-end.
Over the next few weeks, for our credit agreements, we will use approximately $50 million of our free cash flow to pay down secured debt reducing 2020 interest cost.
To the right side of this slide, we provide our debt maturity schedule.
While there are no meaningful maturities in 2020 and 2021, we continue to develop strategies to reduce our weighted average cost of capital through the optimization of our capital structure, reduction of interest rates and extension of maturities.
Today, we launched a process to obtain an amendment with our secured lenders which will allow us to -- greater flexibility to issue additional sources of long-term secured or unsecured debt.
On Slide 15, we outlined our finance transformation actions and savings targets.
Our finance and accounting transformation is a good example of the opportunities to harvest efficiencies from our G&A functions.
We are replacing our legacy structure, enforcing standard processes and leveraging new tools to automate tasks.
At a high level, DN will follow in the footsteps of many other global companies in centralizing back office resources and regionalizing compliance activities.
Our workforce streamlined finance, personnel and processes which should lead to incremental G&A savings of $30 million in 2020 and another $20 million in 2021.
Subsequent to the quarter, the company made significant progress in divesting non-core businesses.
First, the company finalized the transaction to consolidate its joint venture operations in China with the Inspur Group.
As a result, DN will repatriate approximately $25 million of cash and become a minority shareholder in the combined operations.
Moving from approximately 55% ownership to approximately 48% ownership.
Due to our minority ownership status in the consolidated JV, we will report pro rata profit or loss on the P&L as equity and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, deconsolidating approximately $50 million of future revenue.
We believe this transaction is important step in strengthening our partnership with Inspur while reducing our risk and exposure to challenging ATM market conditions in China.
In a separate transaction, the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its 68% ownership stake in Portalis to Data Group.
This non-core business provides application management and IT infrastructure, outsourcing solutions to certain financial institutions in Germany.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020, and is subject to customary closing conditions.
DN will harvest approximately $10 million in cash for 68% interest and will receive relief from future liabilities, including capital and pension obligations while maintaining good relationships with common customers.
During 2019, this business generated revenue of approximately $60 million.
On Slide 16, we discuss our 2020 outlook.
We are expecting revenue will be relatively flat excluding approximately $110 million impact from our recent divestitures and reflecting expected currency fluctuations.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $430 million to $470 million reflecting approximately $130 million of DN Now savings, plus $25 million for growth initiatives, $10 million of nonrecurring profit from our divestitures, and typical inflation headwinds and other items.
When compared with 2019, we expect 2020 results will be slightly more weighted to the second half of the year.
Specifically, we expect to generate approximately 45% of our annual revenue and approximately one-third of adjusted EBITDA during the first half of the year.
This reflects the timing of our product backlog, our DN Now initiatives and the priorities of our services business.
Additionally, as Gerrard mentioned, we are working with 240 customers and certifying our DN Series, so it follows the production activity or ramp in the second half of the year.
From a free cash flow perspective, we expect to generate between $100 million and $130 million for 2020, including the following components, an EBITDA midpoint of $450 million and net working capital benefits of approximately $30 million.
Net interest payments of approximately $170 million.
Restructuring cash outflows of approximately $80 million.
Capital expenditure is approximately $70 million which includes certain investments in our internal systems supporting our digital transformation.
And cash taxes and other payments of approximately $45 million.
And now, I will hand the call back to Gerrard for closing remarks.
In closing, following a successful year of execution in 2019, we entered the new year in a stronger financial position with solid execution momentum and a more efficient core operation.
We will advance our strategy as we expand our differentiation with DN Series, the AllConnect Data Engine, more sophisticated self-checkout solutions and the strength of our services organization.
Secondly, by laying the groundwork for future revenue growth opportunities by making targeted investments in services and software.
And thirdly, by continuing to streamline the business, embrace standard processes and operate as efficiently as possible.
And fourthly, by continually strengthening our balance sheet.
This is our path forward toward long-term sustainable value creation.
To learn more about Diebold Nixdorf and our plans for value creation, I'd like to invite investors to join the management team for a discussion of our strategy, market opportunities and financials on Thursday, May 21st in New York.
Please mark your calendars and be on the lookout for registration information from Steve Virostek.
","Diebold Nixdorf reported strong results in 2019, meeting or exceeding expectations in all key areas. Total revenue was $4.4 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $401 million, a 25% increase over 2018. The company significantly improved profitability and cash flow, with free cash flow exceeding $93 million versus the initial breakeven target. Gross margins increased by 280 basis points to 25.2%, while adjusted EBITDA margins rose by 210 basis points to 9.1%. The company's DN Now transformation initiatives played a significant role in these improvements, with targeted gross savings increased from $400 million to $440 million through 2021. Diebold Nixdorf also made progress in simplifying its operations, reducing its leverage ratio by more than a full turn to 4.4 times by year-end 2019. The company's 2020 outlook includes expectations of flat revenue (excluding the impact of divestitures and currency fluctuations), adjusted EBITDA in the range of $430-$470 million, and free cash flow between $100 and $130 million. Diebold Nixdorf remains focused on advancing its strategy, expanding differentiation, targeting future revenue growth opportunities, streamlining its business, and strengthening its balance sheet."
DOV_q1_2021.txt,"So we're going to have a robust Q&A session.
So let's move to page three.
The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover.
First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business, which we needed to operationally deliver against.
Second, we had to work closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability.
We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in a robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2.
Let's take a look at the metrics.
Total revenue was up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period.
Clearly, the quarter benefited from a good order backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and the largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company.
This performance clear indication that our product portfolio was attractive and often under-appreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.
Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase.
The growth was broad-based with all five segments contributing to the increase.
This resulted in the seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%.
Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it is upon it's -- it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full-year demand.
I'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment.
There are several factors driving healthy customer activity, including pent-up demand from last year as a result of low starting channel inventories in certain sectors.
Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking in inflationary pre-buy, and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected in our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%.
So put succinctly, it's not pre-buy if we don't remove it from the full-year revenue estimates.
Still early in the year and we will continue to produce to meet customer demand and watch our backlog and order patterns carefully [Phonetic].
We'll have more color on the drivers of demand and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains, as we progress through the year.
For now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace.
But we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year.
Let's move to profitability.
Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin of 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter.
This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered positive pricing [Phonetic] and continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds.
Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period.
With a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism.
Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust topline outlook and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges.
With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12% all in revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step up compared to our prior guidance.
I will skip slide four, which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter.
So let's move to slide five.
Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly through a comparable period.
Vehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines.
Industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking, and aerospace and defense shipments were solid.
The business remains booked well into the second half of the year.
As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrained shipments in the quarter.
We have forecasted this business to be levered toward H2 and order trends and backlog reflect that.
Same dynamic for industrial winches with revenue down in the quarter.
But recovery in order rates, we expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year.
Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio.
And Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling as well as our software and systems business in Europe.
Activity in China remains subdued.
Order backlogs are up 13%, and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year.
The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions of mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.
Sales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically.
The core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia, but was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic.
We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales.
Textile printer sales remained soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID.
Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates, and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline in new printer sales as the quarter progressed.
Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter.
Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components.
Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong.
Industrial pumps had a solid quarter, driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand.
And polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the U.S. Precision components was down in the quarter though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remains impacted.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing.
This team has moved the segment to best-in-class topline and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development and innovation management and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions.
It's a world-class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.
Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year posting 18% organic growth.
Revenue on new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year.
Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in product programs plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins.
Our natural refrigerant systems business in particular experienced robust demand in Europe and in the US as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions.
The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets.
Foodservice equipment was down in the quarter but saw a stabilization in chain restaurant demand.
Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with installation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points, supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation.
I'll pass it to Brad from here.
I'm on slide six.
On the top is the revenue bridge.
Our topline benefited from organic growth across all five segments, with particular strength in Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments.
FX benefited topline by 3% or $51 million.
Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million.
We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters.
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia.
Our three largest geographic regions.
The U.S., our largest market posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates and retail fueling, marking and coding, biopharma connectors, food retail and can making among others and was partially offset by delayed shipments in waste hauling.
Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, industrial pumps and heat exchangers.
All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically driven by China, which was up 60% against the COVID impacted comparable quarter in the prior year.
Moving to the bottom of the page.
Bookings were up 27% organically reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio.
In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all five segments.
Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year.
Let's go to the earnings bridges on slide seven.
On the top of the chart, adjusted segment EBIT was up nearly $100 million.
On margin improvement -- but margin improved several hundred basis points as improved volumes continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation.
Going to the bottom of the chart.
The adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million, as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses.
The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% [Phonetic] for the quarter compared to 21.5% [Phonetic] in the prior year.
Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020.
Rightsizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax.
Now on slide eight.
We are pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year.
Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production.
Let's go to slide nine.
We expect demand in Engineered Products to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year, which is supported by a robust backlog.
We continue to see strong result with strong bookings trends in vehicle services and industrial automation.
Aerospace and defense have significant revenue visibility through its government programs and is booked well into the second half of the year.
Order rates and waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered toward the second half and we are watching the supply chain here closely, which is a stabilizer we expect a gradual recovery through the second half of the year.
As communicated at our Investor Meeting in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to post modern organic growth for the year.
There was a known headwind from EMV roll-off in the U.S. but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash.
We also expect that Asia, particularly -- China in particular should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half.
The ICS acquisition, which we closed at the end of last year is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily.
Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year.
Our core marking and coding business stalwart in 2020 is expected to continue to deliver low to mid single-digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance.
Digital textile printing remains slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1, as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales.
We expect recovery here in the second half.
Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid year.
Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter and momentum should continue.
Our recent investments in biopharma capacity were prescient, and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story.
Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as a global shortage of plastic and rubber, as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants.
Precision components are stabilized and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth beginning in the second half of the year.
And with its large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year.
New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters, as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amid the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives.
Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position in natural refrigerant systems both in Europe and also in the U.S. where we believe the recent mandate in California will foretell a trend among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions.
We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small format customer segment.
Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1 they're booked for the year.
Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies.
We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture growth.
Demand is stabilized in foodservice equipment at restaurant chains.
And we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half as students return to schools and traffic improves at stadiums and hotels.
Our revised annual guidance is on page 10, we covered the most pertinent of these items in the slides and we summarized here for your reference.
Finally, on slide 11, puts expected 2021 performance in a multi-year perspective.
2020 was proof of lower topline cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability.
Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period.
And we have the playbook and tools for this to continue.
Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit earnings per share growth in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019.
So, Andrey, we can open it up for Q&A.
","Dover Corporation reported a 13% increase in total revenue, driven by strong order backlogs and increased demand. The company's order rates outpaced revenue, resulting in a 27% increase in bookings, with growth across all five segments. This led to a seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion. Despite inflationary pressures, Dover maintained strong profitability with a consolidated adjusted segment margin of 19.1%, due to volume leverage, favorable product mix, and efficiency initiatives. Based on this performance, Dover revised its annual guidance to a revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting robust demand and operational execution. The company's key segments, such as Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, saw significant growth, and Dover expects continued demand improvement in Engineered Products and gradual recovery in Industrial Winches and Waste Hauling. Overall, Dover remains optimistic about the year, citing a solid order backlog and its ability to navigate supply chain challenges, contributing to double-digit earnings per share growth in line with its long-term targets."
DIS_q1_2022.txt,"As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights.
Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago.
Our domestic parks and resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge.
And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 17.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers.
I'll share more about those items shortly.
But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company.
It is perhaps fitting that our 100th anniversary comes at a time of significant change for us and our industry.
In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation.
Each of those actions has helped set the stage for our second century.
And as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism.
We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences.
We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services.
We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine.
We have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on Earth.
In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities, and unique place in the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years.
To carry through on that promise, we will be guided by three strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation, and audience focus.
Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers.
I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended, or signed new contracts.
I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses.
The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including three of the five best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received three nominations.
Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations.
As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2, and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film.
In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye, and returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series, The Book of Boba Fett.
Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality.
In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly a quarter of the industry's best-reviewed shows.
And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieve a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes.
That includes Abbott Elementary, the first freshman broadcast comedy to earn the 100% Certified Fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009.
Our success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret.
However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth, and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services.
In fact, six of the 10 most-watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team.
And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand.
Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority.
In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Black-ish, and The Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service.
Rounding out our content focus is, of course, sports.
Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television, accounting for 95 of the 100 most-watched live broadcast in 2021.
And ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our four major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli.
And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and his Omaha Productions company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season.
While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels.
It extends to sports betting, gaming, and the metaverse.
In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with their favorite sporting events, stories, teams, and players.
Turning to distribution results.
The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout.
Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions, and new market launches.
The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios' Moon Knight in March.
And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including two Star Wars series: Andor and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25.
We'll debut two Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2.
As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024.
Christine will provide more detail into our theatrical results.
However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters.
And given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed.
And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise.
This quarter, audiences proved us right as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families' continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance.
With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest title to cross 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm.
People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation, and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times.
The soundtrack, which debuted at No.
197 on the Billboard 200 chart, reached No.
1 shortly after debuting on Disney+.
And eight of the film's songs hit the Hot 100 chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach No.
1 since Aladdin's A Whole New World in 1993.
At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life.
These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise, and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst.
We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine, and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling.
Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time.
Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and groundbreaking technology, and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment.
From new franchise-based lands and attractions, to craveable food and beverage offerings, to must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before.
At the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun.
While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception.
In the quarter, more than a third of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane, or both.
That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period.
While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance.
In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019.
As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks, along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter.
And we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience.
I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World, a two-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created.
Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new roller coaster at Epcot, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th-anniversary celebrations.
Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation, and our audience.
With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.
Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior-year quarter.
Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first-quarter results and our continued progress toward more normalized operations across our businesses.
At parks, experiences, and products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year over year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter.
In the prior-year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter.
At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland.
And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance.
Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality.
Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Lane.
Putting these factors together, our domestic parks and resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels even as we continued managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations.
Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remain strong, benefiting from our 50th-anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks.
At international parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris.
We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland, although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region.
We expect international parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2.
Moving on to our media and entertainment distribution segment.
First-quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs.
Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services.
We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses.
Turning to our results by line of business.
At linear networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year.
Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute.
At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year.
Lower results at broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter.
At cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue.
Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football.
ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up.
Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter.
This was primarily driven by six points of growth from higher rates, offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.
Operating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year.
These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues.
At direct-to-consumer, first-quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year over year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu.
I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q.
Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology, and marketing costs.
We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4.
Taking a look at subscriber growth by region.
We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription.
In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets.
I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in the quarter.
Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter.
Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year.
As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter to quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half.
At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4.
Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and LaLiga.
And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV.
Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service.
Moving on to content sales/licensing and other.
Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV SVOD results.
As I noted last quarter, while theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family focused animation.
This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results.
This was partially offset by income from our co-production of Spider-Man: No Way Home.
As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around two items that may impact our second-quarter results.
First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer and linear networks.
At direct-to-consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live.
At linear networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts.
We aired four additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter.
And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while it fell into Q3 of the prior year.
Second, at content sales/licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services.
As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior-year quarter.
[Operator instructions] And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.
","In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Disney's adjusted earnings per share surged from $0.32 to $1.06. Streaming services continued their impressive growth, adding 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers, bringing the total to 196.4 million. Among the highlights were Disney+'s record-breaking success with the film ""Encanto"" and ESPN+'s 14% increase in advertising revenue. Despite the Omicron surge, domestic parks and resorts posted all-time revenue and income records, thanks in part to the strategic use of Genie+ and Lightning Lane. The company remains optimistic about its future, citing its strong storytelling capabilities, diverse revenue streams, and popular entertainment offerings. However, it acknowledges that the ongoing pandemic and its impact on theatrical releases and international parks could present challenges in the near future."
KO_q1_2021.txt,"I'm here with James Quincey, our chairman and chief executive officer; and John Murphy, our chief financial officer.
Before we begin, please note that we've posted schedules under the Financial Information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.
You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of gross and operating margins.
Please limit yourself to one question.
If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue.
In what remains a highly dynamic environment, our first-quarter results show promising signs that a broader recovery is on the horizon.
We're encouraged by early results in markets where mobility is on the rise.
Then I'll hand over the call to John to discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we'll continue to deliver on our objectives over the course of the year.
In the first quarter, we positioned our business for recovery while executing against our emerging stronger agenda, equipping our system to win.
At the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets.
We moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way, and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns.
During the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated.
Leveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter.
And while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid-February, trends have improved since then.
We're pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March of 2019 prior to the pandemic.
We continue to see ongoing strength in at-home channels, offset by away-from-home trends which have improved sequentially but remain pressured relative to pre-pandemic levels.
We're working with our customers and bottling partners to sustain at-home momentum and capture improving away-from-home demand.
For example, in Latin America, our Prospera program with our bottlers helps the traditional trade thrive through assistance with their marketing efforts, resulting in outperformance in this critical channel.
In Great Britain, we launched Open, a business accelerator program to support pubs, bars, and cafes.
In North America, our use of mail bundles is driving incidents in pickup and delivery transactions with food service customers.
In 2020, we gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels, offset by negative channel mix.
This continues to be the dynamic affecting our share year to date.
Through our ongoing initiatives and as away-from-home demand improves over the course of the year, we'll seek to build on these wins in 2021.
There are clear opportunities to reaccelerate share positions as the recovery plays out and we'll invest to drive momentum with focus and flexibility.
In market at the forefront of the recovery, we've seen early signs that our actions taken during the pandemic are helping us outpace recovery.
It's important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world.
Many markets haven't yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions.
Looking around the world, in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels.
Strong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions, and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers.
Despite the unexpected state of emergency earlier in the year, Japan expands its successful RGM initiatives geographically and across brands to help drive improvements later in the quarter.
In EMEA, vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than anticipated and many countries have been impacted by ongoing lockdowns.
In Eurasia and the Middle East, brand Coke recruited 4.4 million consumers through affordability packages and a focus on at-home occasions.
New marketing campaigns drove improvement in flavored Sparkling soft drinks, and Fuze Tea reached an all-time-high value share in Turkey.
In Africa, mass vaccination is expected to take longer than the developed markets.
And despite ongoing volatility, Africa worked closely with our bottlers to deliver volume growth that by stepped-up execution through cooler placement and affordability packs like returnable glass bottles.
In North America, the year is off to a good start.
Ongoing strength in at-home channels was driven by core brands in our Sparkling portfolio, as well as Simply, fairlife, and Gold Peak all with encouraging results.
Away-from-home began to approve in March as vaccinations and mobility picked up.
In Latin America, we leveraged our core brands, digital initiatives, and refill packages to recover ahead of the economy and our industry despite ongoing restrictions.
While from away-from-home continues to be impacted by lockdowns, we are expanding the at-home consumption opportunity, leveraging consumer dynamics like indulgence of single-serve multi-packs.
Global Ventures continue to be impacted by lockdowns in the U.K.
But as restrictions loosen, we're focusing on driving digital engagement and traffic back to the cost of the stores.
Cost of express machines continue to deliver strong performance.
Turning our transformation, our operating units are up and running and also a very good start in the rollout of our new model.
Across markets, our newly networked organization has us working more collaboratively with the overall enterprise in mind.
Our operating unit and category leadership teams are working together to identify the most promising combinations across the industry based on economic outlook, consumer trends, channel dynamics, and execution imperatives.
We're using more disciplined resource allocation to capture the biggest opportunities, while making ongoing portfolio decisions faster and at scale.
We're focused on our streamlined growth portfolio, actively and thoughtfully transitioning brands to more powerful trademarks using a phased approach to bring the consumer with us on the journey.
And we're maximizing shelf space with new product launches and higher-velocity products to drive higher-quality growth.
As we discussed at CAGNY, we're focusing on what we do best: marketing our loved brands in more efficient and effective ways.
campaign kicked off in markets from Asia to Africa to Latin America, the message is resonating with consumers with impressions, views, and engagement levels above last year, and intent-to-purchase metrics showing promising signs.
This campaign aligns with our transition to a more sustainable clear bottle, which is important in helping us achieve our World Without Waste goals.
Our media and creative agency reviews are progressing and we're also executing more targeted opportunities in addition to the big strategic shifts.
For instance, we've taken a scaled, digitized approach to buying trade materials resulting in up to 15% cost reduction and improved user experience, all while offering more consistent, better quality, and sustainable alternatives.
We've extended this pool buying opportunity to our bottlers, many of whom are already on board to share the benefits systemwide.
Our more disciplined innovation approach is yielding results as we balance big bets with intelligent experimentation.
Using our networked approach, we are scaling our best innovations quickly and effectively, while being disciplined with those that don't get the traction required for further investment.
Local experiments like Aquarius with functional benefits and Ayataka Cafe Matcha Latte in Japan, Fanta's exciting mystery flavor innovation in Europe, and package innovations like the 13.2-ounce recycled PET bottle in North America could all be lifted and shifted globally over time.
It's similar to what we're doing this year with our half-flavored Sparkling water.
Our big bets for 2021 include ongoing work to scale our coffee platform under Costa.
We're expanding ready-to-drink coffee in China and taking a portfolio approach to complement our powerful Georgia coffee brand in Japan.
We're also rolling out an enhanced formula and package designed for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar this month in Europe, in Latin America, and across markets globally later this year.
The improved recipe brings its taste even close to that of the iconic Coca-Cola original taste.
This was influenced by consumer insight and our focus on constant improvement.
And despite this enormous success, Coca-Cola Zero sugar still represents a relatively small percentage of the trademark.
And we continue to respond to consumer desires for lower-sugar options and the rollout will be supported by global, occasion-based marketing campaign.
Finally, it's early days but we're excited to come back and report on our expanded experimentation in flavored alcoholic beverages with Topo Chico hard seltzer in Latin America, Europe, and most recently, the U.S.
We also continue to rapidly digitize our ecosystem.
For example, a champ born in South Africa engages with consumers on social media to increase away-from-home transactions.
In China, we've used digital campaigns to harness consumer data to drive traffic and incidents leading to incremental growth.
We're using machine learning and AI tools to stay on top of a rapidly evolving consumer trends and identify emerging needs.
Our dedicated digital transformation structure is leading to strong online to offline growth.
We've seen e-commerce share gains in a key advanced markets like North America, Japan, and Great Britain.
And in markets like Turkey, where the channel is still developing with more than tripled sales and gained almost 10 points of share versus last year.
As always, we're supporting these initiatives with strong revenue growth management and execution.
Through RGM, we continue to capture at-home occasions with multi-pack options in both premium and affordable segments, while expanding distribution of smaller packaging like our sleek cans in China.
And we have affordability plays like our successful refillables in Latin America, the Philippines, and now Africa.
As part of our new organization, we're dedicating more resources to RGM, continuing to raise the bar to even higher standards.
In many markets, we're working with our bottling partners to optimize cooler placement, driving incremental volume through outstanding customer service, our cooler productivity, and innovation.
Our bottling partners are executing strongly.
And together, we are working on initiatives across the enterprise to identify more efficiencies.
We're operating in a networked way, leveraging our platform services organization to scale our collective data, marketing, digital, and supply chain capabilities.
Our system continues to evolve as shown by the pending combination of Coca-Cola European partners and Coca-Cola Amatil.
I'm especially proud of how we are delivering on our purpose as a company.
Every action is guided by our ambition to create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in people's lives, our communities, and the planet.
Throughout the pandemic, we've focused on helping communities through relief funds from the company and the Coca-Cola Foundation.
In this next phase, we are supporting vaccination efforts in regions where distribution has been slower.
For instance, in Brazil, our system has partnered with the country's Ministry of Health to co-create a vaccine awareness campaign.
We're using our network to deliver 700,000 doses with vaccine information to more than 350,000 mom-and-pop stores.
Tomorrow, we'll release our 2020 business and ESG report, where we will highlight last year's progress.
While 2020 was a milestone year in terms of meeting and exceeding some previous goals like women's empowerment and global water replenishment, we continue to work toward an even more ambitious agenda.
This includes our 2025 and 2030 packaging goals, our 2030 climate goal, and our new 2030 water security strategy with more details to come later this year.
In conclusion, we're optimistic about the future and bullish about our ability to continue to deliver on the objectives we laid out at the height of the crisis: more consumers, more share, better system economics, and a positive stakeholder impact.
Today, I will highlight our first-quarter performance and go over our top-line and earnings guidance, which we are reiterating.
Then I'll provide a progress update on working capital, our ability to manage through the current commodity environment, and other factors that may impact our outlook.
2021 is off to a good start, with the quarter showing steady sequential monthly improvement.
We're leveraging our learnings and strategic initiatives from 2020 and leaning into growth in a thoughtful way.
Our Q1 organic revenue was up 6%, driven by concentrate shipments up 5% and price/mix improvement of 1%.
While shipments benefited from certain timing impacts and the five additional days this quarter versus last year, unit case volume was flat versus the toughest quarterly compare of 2020, and March volume was in line with 2019 levels, largely driven by strength in Asia Pacific.
Comparable gross margins, although still down year over year, improved sequentially, driven by less pressure from channel and package mix.
While currency was still somewhat of a drag, it was less of a headwind than prior quarters.
Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management.
We continue to reintroduce marketing spend in a targeted way, particularly as we ramp up investments in markets that are seeing recovery.
First-quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.55 is an increase of 8% year over year and was driven by top-line growth, margin improvement, and some contribution from equity income, offset by currency headwinds.
Regarding our ongoing tax case with the IRS, there are no material updates since our last report.
Our decisions and actions from last year certainly were not easy, but we are seeing the results of our efforts start to come through, and our organization is embracing the changes as we move forward into the recovery phase.
We stayed very focused on driving a healthy top line, and we remain on a journey to maximize returns, including strong cash flow generation.
We never relented on our cash flow goals and, indeed, have had an even sharper focus on managing capital spend and working capital.
Since we embarked on a journey toward best-in-class working capital performance, we've made great strides in extending our payment terms, generating a working capital improvement of more than $1 billion over two years.
In the same vein, we are implementing accounts receivables factoring programs, which are rolling out across a number of markets, and also looking at initiatives to better manage inventory days.
At the center of these efforts is a robust digitization and automation agenda.
In addition, and you've heard us talk conceptually about the network model, this is a great example of the network in action.
And when you put the right people from different parts of the organization against key initiatives, it delivers a step-change in performance.
Last quarter, we said that despite a rising commodity environment, we expected a relatively benign impact in 2021 given our hedged positions.
While this continues to be the case, we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs such as high-fructose corn syrup, PET, metals, and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.
Given the environment, we'll continue to benefit from revenue growth management initiatives.
Through an intelligently diverse price pack architecture, we can produce a range of options that meet the needs of consumers across the income spectrum while also capturing value for customers.
2020 provided great learnings on how to be more logical and data-driven in our promotions, and we'll continue to be purposeful in our approach, driven by the consumer and the strength of our brands.
We'll also continue to pursue productivity across the supply chain, pushing all levers at our disposal.
And as we noted in our release, we now expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 1% to 2% to the top line and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable earnings per share in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge positions.
For the full year, we now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19.1%.
Putting it all together, our quarterly performance and the momentum we saw in March give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2021 guidance.
We expect high single-digit organic revenue growth and high single-digit to low double-digit growth in comparable earnings per share.
We still expect recovery to be asynchronous and to see signs of a return to normal in more markets later in 2021.
We are preparing our end-to-end supply chain for stronger demand and will fuel the momentum in recovering markets as they emerge from the pandemic by accelerating investments in our brands.
There's no doubt that uncertainty remains.
Europe continues to see challenges.
Many countries in regions like Latin America and Africa expect further waves and slower vaccine distribution.
And India is seeing a surge in cases and responding with localized lockdowns.
But as we begin to lap the most difficult periods from last year, we feel good about our position and our ability to navigate the environment as a company and as a system.
Based on the lessons we've learned and the agility provided by our new network organization, we remain confident that our actions and the progress we've made will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels.
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.
","Despite pandemic-related challenges, Coca-Cola reported encouraging first-quarter results, showing signs of broader recovery on the horizon. Global unit case volume remained flat compared to the challenging first quarter of 2020, but March volume recovered to 2019 levels, driven by strength in Asia Pacific. Organic revenues increased 6%, with concentrate shipments up 5% and price/mix improvements of 1%. Amidst improving trends and the continued strength of at-home channels, the company maintained its full-year guidance, expecting high single-digit organic revenue growth and high single-digit to low double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. COVID-19 vaccination efforts and other initiatives are underway to support recovery and address uncertainties. The company remains confident in its ability to navigate market challenges and deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels."
PPL_q4_2021.txt,"Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement.
We appreciate you joining us for our 2021 year-end earnings call.
Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call.
I'll highlight key achievements we made throughout the year, including our progress in strategically repositioning PPL for future growth and success.
Turning to Slide 4.
I'm incredibly proud of how our team performed and what was truly a remarkable year for PPL.
As we began a new century in our company's history, we took bold steps to strategically reposition PPL as a US-focused energy company committed to sustainable growth and well-positioned to lead the clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers.
We completed the sale of our UK utility business in June.
Achieving exceptional value at almost $11 billion while eliminating risks associated with foreign operations.
We then took steps to strengthen PPL's balance sheets by reducing $3.5 billion of our holding company debt, which provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward.
We advanced our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric, which will expand and diversify our US presence, add another high-quality regulated utility to our portfolio, and create additional opportunities to leverage our proven operating model to drive value for customers and shareowners.
We anticipate receiving a final order from the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers with respect to the acquisition by March of 2022.
While strategic repositioning was a key priority in 2021 to set PPL up for long-term success, we also remain focused on achieving our near-term objectives.
In 2021, we continued our track record of earning equity returns that were in line with those allowed by our regulators.
We also achieved constructive regulatory outcomes in 2021 with the settlements on the Pennsylvania FERC ROE challenge and the rate case in Kentucky, which will provide added stability and predictability to our plan over the next several years.
We also returned over $2 billion to share owners through dividends as well as share repurchases, which included the completion of our targeted $1 billion in share buybacks through December 31.
And true to our mission, we delivered energy safely, reliably, and affordably for our 2.5 million customers in the United States.
And as the pandemic refused to yield, we stayed resilient acted responsibly to protect our employees, and remain focused on continuous improvement.
From Kentucky to Pennsylvania, we delivered exceptional service throughout 2021.
We maintain transmission and distribution reliability as well as generation availability that was among the best in the industry.
Despite PPL electric utilities experiencing significant storms during 2021, it maintained top quartile performance for safety, which measures the average number of outages our customers experienced.
Meanwhile, our Kentucky operations posted their second-best year on record for the state.
When severe weather struck either in Pennsylvania or Kentucky, we responded quickly and effectively.
For example, after December tornadoes tore through portions of our service territory in Kentucky damaging or destroying more than 500 transmission and distribution poles.
We restored power to most customers within 48 hours.
Similarly, when the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through our Pennsylvania service territory, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers, we mobilized quickly and effectively to get the lights back on as soon as possible.
Our restoration performance in the wake of Hurricane Ida was recognized with an EEI Emergency Response Award.
This performance is the result of the investments we've made in our grid and our dedicated employees who pride themselves on delivering a superior level of service each day.
And that service was once again reflected in our customer satisfaction scores.
We were honored to receive four new JD Power awards in 2021 for electric utility residential and business customer satisfaction with PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both ranking highest among similarly sized utilities in their respective regions.
And following an independent survey of customers at 140 of the largest utilities in the US, PPL Electric and Kentucky Utilities were recognized by Escalent as two of the most trusted utility brands in the nation.
Across PPL, we also continue to foster a culture of innovation, investing in advanced technology and data analytics to deliver industry-leading reliability and enterprisewide cost efficiencies.
This resulted in multiple industry awards in 2021, including the use of dynamic line rating, technology, and the use of data analytics to better target vegetation management.
With an eye toward keeping reliability strong and empowering our customers, we also continue to invest in the future.
This included executing more than $2 billion in infrastructure improvements to further strengthen grid resilience, modernize our networks, incorporate advanced technology, and pave the way for increased electrification and renewable energy in our service territories.
Turning to Slide 5.
Over the past year, we also delivered on our commitments to deliver a sustainable PPL for our shareowners, employees, and the communities we serve.
We made significant progress in advancing our clean energy strategy.
We adopted a net-zero carbon emissions goal, accelerated our interim emissions reduction target to 70% from 2010 levels by 2035 and 80% by 2040.
And we also accelerated our coal plant retirements scheduled.
Separately we announced the commitment of over $50 million in new investment to fund research and development in the clean energy space with our planned investment in EIP and EPRI's low carbon resources initiative.
We also launched a new partnership to study carbon capture at a natural gas combined cycle power plant and reached new agreements to provide an additional 125 megawatts of solar power to major Kentucky customers.
In November, we published our latest comprehensive climate assessment report, which highlights the risks associated with climate change and the opportunities in responding to it and evaluating potential future emissions under multiple scenarios.
This included a scenario consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Our climate assessment outlines our clean energy strategy and goals to enable a responsible transition that balances our commitments to the environment, our customers, our employees, and our communities.
LG and KU also submitted their triannual joint Integrated Resource Plan, which reflected a significant increase in projected renewable additions in the 15-year planning horizon compared to our prior plan.
We expect the trend of more rapid decarbonization of our generation fleet in Kentucky to continue with further improvement in cost and technology for renewables, as well as other clean energy technologies.
In addition to our focus on advancing our clean energy transition, we also remain very engaged in the communities we serve and with our employees throughout 2021.
We continue to move PPL forward by creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace.
We implemented an enterprisewide diversity equity inclusion strategy, adopted DEI commitment, increased diversity within our leadership ranks, overall workforce in the board, and we expanded our support for social justice and equity initiatives in the communities we serve.
In addition, we continue to create new opportunities for business resource groups for employees of all backgrounds and experiences to collaborate, share perspectives, and contribute to PPL's success.
Our strong commitment to diversity and inclusion received recognition from multiple organizations in 2021, with PPL being named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality and disability inclusion, as well as a top company for ESG.
And this January, PPL once again was named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality, marking the sixth straight year PPL has received this recognition.
During our fall giving campaign, PPL employees, and retirees collectively raised more money than ever before.
More than $7 million in individual pledges and corporate matching contributions will help lift individuals, families, and the community.
And in the aftermath of the Kentucky tornadoes, we responded quickly providing financial support to assist Kentucky families and businesses.
In other highlights, we continue to build an exceptional management team that we believe will lead PPL to its best years to come.
We promoted Greg Dudkin to the chief operating officer and our leveraging his experience in building one of the most advanced utilities in the nation and PPL Electric Utilities to drive further value for stakeholders across all the PPL operating companies.
We're extremely excited to have Wendy Stark on our team as our new general counsel.
Wendy's extensive experience in regulatory matters and her deep knowledge of our industry have made her a great addition to PPL.
We named two new utility precedents in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with Stephanie Raymond in Pennsylvania, and John Crockett in Kentucky.
Stephanie is the first female utility president in our company's 100-year history.
We also named a highly qualified and experienced leadership team in Rhode Island led by Dave Bonenberger from PPL and numerous talented employees from National Grid to lead our electric and gas operations pending the completion of the acquisition.
We also took steps to strengthen our corporate governance during the year.
Our board of directors appointed an outstanding leader and experienced board member as independent Board Chair in Craig Rogerson, reflecting PPL's continued commitment to strong corporate governance and independent oversight by a diverse, engaged board.
In summary, across our business, we made tremendous progress in 2021 as we pursued our strategy to deliver sustainable value for all stakeholders and position PPL for future growth and success.
Today, we announced fourth quarter reported earnings of $0.18 per share.
Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.04 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric and discontinued operations associated with the UK utility business.
Adjusting for special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.22 per share.
Our fourth quarter results bring our total 2021 results to a net loss of $1.93 per share.
Special items for 2021 were $2.98 per share, primarily due to discontinued operations associated with the UK utility business, a UK tax rate change prior to the sale, and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt.
Adjusting for special items, 2021 earnings from ongoing operations for $1.05 per share.
Before turning to the 2021 earnings walk, I'll highlight a few other financial updates.
As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, we plan to update the dividend following the January 3 payment as we continue to progress on PPL's strategic repositioning.
Recall that we had maintained the dividend at the prior rate despite the sale of WPD, providing $350 million of dividends to reward long-term shareowners as we work to close the transactions and deploy the cash proceeds from the WPD sale in a value-accretive manner.
Today, we've announced the first quarter 2022 dividend of $0.20 per share payable on April 1.
The updated quarterly dividend aligns with our earnings projections for PPL's current businesses and a targeted payout ratio of 60% to 65%.
We plan to provide an updated annualized dividend rate and growth projections to align with earnings growth during an Investor Day following the completion of the Narraganset regulatory review process.
We recognize that it would have been optimal to declare the April 1 dividend when we provide our annualized earnings forecast.
However, since we haven't completed the Narragansett regulatory review process, we wanted to be transparent today by providing clarity on the dividend reset following the sale of WPD.
We plan to reflect any increase in the dividend due to the inclusion of Narragansett in our forecasts when we provide a comprehensive financial update at Investor Day.
As Vince noted, one of the key financial highlights for 2021 was a reduction in our holding company debt as we allocated a significant amount of the WPD sales proceeds to strengthen PPL's balance sheets.
We had a unique opportunity to establish one of the leading credit profiles in the sector, an attribute we see as increasingly important with a growing capital needs to fund the clean energy transition and now amid the backdrop of rising interest rates.
In other financial updates, we amended and extended our credit facilities during the fourth quarter to better align our liquidity needs.
Post the strategic repositioning.
In short, we slightly reduced the capacity of PPL capital funding to $1.25 billion from $1.45 billion, as we no longer need the same level of liquidity without the foreign currency risk associated with the UK.
We've also included an option to add Narragansett as a co-borrower to the PPLcapital funding credit facility pending the closing of the acquisition.
And we continue to target 16% to 18% CFO and FFO to debt metrics, including the Narragansett Electric acquisition.
We believe these actions provide a very strong financial foundation and place PPL among the best credit profiles in our industry.
Let's move to our full-year 2021 earnings results on Slide 8.
I would note that while I will compare 2021 earnings to our 2020 results, the periods are not truly comparable given the sale of the UK businesses, the reallocation of certain costs, the balance sheet recapitalization along with the outcome of the transmission ROE challenge.
Similar to prior quarters, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate other amounts to reflect certain costs previously allocated to the UK regulated segment, primarily interest expense and other support costs.
These costs totaled about $0.07 per share for the year.
Turning to the ongoing segment drivers.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.61 per share, a $0.04 year-over-year decrease.
Earnings results in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by a reduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity, lower peak transmission demand, and higher operation and maintenance expense.
These decreases were partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission.
Turning to our Kentucky segment, we earned $0.61 per share in 2021, a $0.6 increase over comparable results one year ago.
The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1.
Lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky regulated segment and lower interest rates.
Partially offsetting these items were higher operation and maintenance expenses related to several factors including support costs, generation plant costs, T&D costs, and higher depreciation due to the additions to PP&E.
Results at corporate and others were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year.
Factors driving earnings results at corporate and other, primarily included lower interest expense primarily due to less outstanding long-term holding company debt, partially offset by interest costs previously allocated to the Kentucky segment, partially offsetting this increase were several factors that were not individually significant.
Moving to Slide 9.
The capital investments made in Pennsylvania and Kentucky during 2021, support grid modernization, grid resiliency and reliability, and improved service for our customers.
Of the $2 billion of capex that Vince noted, we invested about $1 billion in each of the segments.
In Pennsylvania, investments in distribution were made to maintain top quartile industry reliability and performance and investments in more advanced IT systems.
Meanwhile, on the transmission side, investments were primarily related to asset health reliability with a focus on smart relays, equipment monitoring, and automation to support of more advanced grid.
Our Kentucky investments were primarily related to replacing the aging transmission, infrastructure, maintaining and enhancing our electric distribution network, generation outages, environmental compliance, and grid modernization.
This resulted in total rate base growth of nearly 6%.
Even as a rate based related to our coal-fired generation facilities decline.
As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, 2021 was very much a transition year for PPL.
It was about reimagining PPL and laying a firm foundation for the company's future growth.
And I believe we achieved just that.
Looking forward, our focus is on completing the acquisition of Narragansett Electric and introducing a new PPL to shareholders.
The PPL that is committed to delivering sustainable value for shareowners backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the US utility sector, distinguished by best-in-class customer service, committed to net-zero carbon emissions, and well-positioned to lead the clean energy transition while maintaining affordable reliable service for our customers.
We look forward to sharing further details on our strategy and the exciting growth prospects for the new PPL at our Investor Day.
With that operator, let's open the call for Q&A.

TRV_q1_2021.txt,"All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.
Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.
They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.
Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures.
We are very pleased to report first quarter core income $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior-year quarter, despite our highest ever level of first quarter catastrophe losses.
The higher level of core income for the quarter was driven by very strong underlying underwriting income as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, all of which more than offset the record level of catastrophe losses.
Underlying underwriting income of $735 million pre-tax was nearly 25% higher than in the prior-year quarter driven by an increase in net earned premiums to $7.4 billion and an underlying combined ratio, which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 89.5%.
We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all three of our business segments.
In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved by more than three points, which again included the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends.
On Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both benefited from higher earned premiums with continued strong margins.
Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating net investment income of $590 million after-tax for the quarter, up 14% from the prior-year quarter.
These results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 9% over the past year after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders.
During the quarter we returned $613 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $397 million through share repurchases.
In recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in our business, I'm pleased to share that our board of directors declared a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.88 per share, marking 17 consecutive years of dividend increases, with a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period.
Our board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.
We remain pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies.
During the quarter, we grew net written premiums by 2% to $7.5 billion.
Our premium growth once again reflects strong renewal premium change and retention in each of our three segments.
In Business Insurance, renewal premium change increased to 9.2%; its highest level since 2013 and 4 points higher than the prior year quarter, while retention remained strong.
In workers' compensation, pure renewal rate change was slightly negative, but continued on an improving trend.
Workers' comp renewal premium change, which includes exposure, was positive for the first time in a number of quarters.
Both renewal rate change, annual premium change in every other product line were near or above recent record highs.
Net written premiums in Business Insurance were down a little bit year over year, driven overwhelmingly by the workers' comp product line, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic on payrolls, as we're comparing a pandemic-impacted quarter in the current year to a largely pre-pandemic quarter in the prior year.
Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 9%, driven by a renewal premium change of nearly 11% in our management liability business, while retention remained strong.
Across our commercial businesses, the pricing environment continues to be rational and favorable with written pricing well above estimated loss cost trends.
Overall pricing levels continue to be near record levels, and while margins have improved, given the continued headwinds impacting returns for the industry, we expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trend for some time.
Turning to Personal Insurance, production was excellent in the quarter.
Net written premiums increased by nearly 7%, driven by renewal premium change of almost 8% in our homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both auto and home.
New business for both auto and home combined was up 17% compared to the prior year quarter, which is the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in new business, demonstrating the ongoing success of our product, distribution, and customer initiatives.
Some number of years ago and consistent with our approach generally of recognizing, assessing, and addressing trends rapidly, we took decisive action in anticipation of continued weather volatility.
Our efforts started with talent.
We added experts in data science, meteorology, geophysics, and environmental engineering, among others, to our cat management organization.
We also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise.
We have incorporated the results into our product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation, and claim response.
The insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor cat models with our own sophisticated peril by peril view.
This gives us a refined granular view of cat risk, incorporating proprietary variables, such as complex roof characteristics, tree and brush [Phonetic] density and location intelligence down to the parcel level.
These variables are incorporated into our product development enhancing segmentation.
They are also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions.
In terms of our claim response, our data scientists and other experts have developed geospatial tools, artificial intelligence, and analytic models to facilitate a more effective tailored deployment of claim resources.
This has resulted in a more satisfying experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us.
Taken together, these efforts have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes.
While there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, over the past five years, our share of property catastrophe losses relative to total property catastrophe losses for the domestic P&C industry have declined significantly compared to the five years prior to that.
Our property cat losses over the past five years have also been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share.
Advancing our understanding of the risk and reward of catastrophe underwriting is an ongoing effort for us.
As a footnote but importantly, we've made these and other strategic investments in our business while we improved our expense ratio.
To sum up, the strength of our underwriting and investment expertise enabled us to deliver strong profitability this quarter, notwithstanding the severe winter weather.
As a result, we're off to a terrific start for the year.
We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all three of our business segments.
Our proven strategy, strong track record of execution, leading analytics, talent advantage give us confidence that we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers.
Core income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 11.1%.
The increase in core income resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlying underwriting results, and increased net investment income, largely offset by a much higher level of catastrophe losses.
Our first quarter results include $835 million of pre-tax cat losses, an all-time high for our first quarter cats and an increase of $502 million compared to last year's first quarter.
This quarter's cats include $703 million from the February winter storms which impacted Texas and a number of other states.
Prior year reserve development, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $317 million pre-tax in the quarter.
Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $735 million was 24% higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio, which improved by 1.8 points from a year ago to 89.5%.
The improvement in the underlying combined ratio resulted largely from the continued impacts of earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends in our commercial businesses and continued favorable loss conditions in personal auto.
These improvements were partially offset by the comparison of more typical non-cat weather this year to relatively benign non-cat weather in last year's first quarter.
After-tax net investment income increased by 14% from the prior year quarter to $590 million as higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were partially offset by the impact of the expected decline in fixed income yields.
Consistent with our comments on the fourth quarter earnings call and in our 10-K, we continue to expect that for the remainder of 2021, fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter after-tax.
Turning to prior year reserve development.
Total net favorability of $317 million pre-tax in the quarter included a $72 million benefit from a subrogation settlement with Southern California Edison related to the Woolsey fire of 2018.
$62 million of that benefit was recorded in Personal Insurance with the remainder recorded in Business Insurance.
Beyond that subrogation benefit, net favorable PYD in Personal Insurance reflected both auto and property losses coming in better than expected for recent accident years.
In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected results in the surety book.
In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, partially offset by some adverse development on losses for environmental exposures in our runoff book.
Regarding reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we renewed our underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL Treaty for 2021 providing aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses [Indecipherable] an aggregate retention of $1.9 billion.
Through March 31st, we have accumulated $915 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention.
Turning to capital management.
Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong.
All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion.
Our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $4.1 billion after-tax at year end to $2.8 billion after-tax at March 31st as interest rates rose during the quarter.
Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $101.21 at quarter end, up 2% from year end and up 9% from a year ago.
We returned $613 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $397 million and dividends of $216 million.
Following this quarter's share repurchase activity, we had a little more than $800 million remaining under the previously authorized repurchase program.
In order to provide the appropriate capital management flexibility and reflecting its confidence in our business, the board authorized an additional $5 billion for share repurchases.
And as Alan also mentioned, our board authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share.
Business Insurance produced $317 million of segment income for the first quarter, a 10 increase over the first quarter of 2020 driven by higher levels of underlying underwriting income, net favorable prior year reserve development, and net investment income, which more than offset higher catastrophe losses.
We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.7%, which improved by 3.6 points.
A little less than 2 points of that resulted from earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends.
The improvement also reflects the comparison to the net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic.
Turning to the top line, net written premiums were down 2% primarily due to lower net written premiums in the workers' compensation product line as a result of the impact of the pandemic on payrolls.
Net written premium benefited from strong retention, higher renewal rate change, and a return to positive exposure growth, reflecting an improving trend in our customers' outlook for their businesses.
Turning to domestic production.
Renewal rate change remained strong at 8.4%, up 2.5 points from the first quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%.
Written pricing for some time now has been exceeding loss trend and is significantly improving the margins of our book.
Importantly, we believe we have a high quality book of business and seek to maintain high retention.
With that in mind, we continue to execute deliberately and granularly on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis.
We remain exceptionally pleased with our execution.
As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal rate change increased to 4.5%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020.
Retention of 78% reflects deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of this business.
As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result.
New business of $95 million was down $24 million from the prior year quarter, also driven by our focus on improving profitability as we remain disciplined around risk selection, underwriting, and pricing.
Importantly, we have not slowed down our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which position us well for the long-term profitable growth in this business.
As an example, in previous quarters, we've highlighted our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience.
During the last three months, we rolled out the new product in an additional seven states, bringing the cumulative total to 30 states, representing approximately 60% of our CMP new business premium.
We're encouraged with our agent's adoption of the new product as both flow in new business premium are meaningfully improved as compared to the legacy BOP product.
In middle market renewal rate change was strong at 9.1%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020, while retention remained high at 86%.
Additionally, we achieved positive rate of more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a 10-point increase from the first quarter of last year.
New business was down $12 million driven by certain business units and geographies where returns are not meeting our thresholds.
To sum up, we're pleased with our execution and further improving the underlying margins in the book,and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.
Bond & Specialty posted strong returns and solid growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19.
Segment income was $137 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year quarter driven by an improved underlying underwriting margin and higher business volumes.
Elevated cat losses related to the Texas weather event were largely offset by favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 84.2% improved by a 1.5 due to an improved expense ratio, primarily reflecting higher earned premiums.
Earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 and other loss activity.
Turning to the top line.
Net written premiums grew 9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting strong management liability production.
Decreased demand for new construction surety bonds due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 were largely offset by strong commercial surety production.
In our management liability business, we are pleased that the renewal premium change remained near historic highs of nearly 11% while retention was a strong 87%.
Management liability new business for the quarter decreased $8 million, primarily reflecting our disciplined underwriting in this elevated risk environment.
Consistent with recent quarters, submissions were up while quote activity was down.
These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategies to maintain underwriting discipline and pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio.
So Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges in the current environment.
Personal Insurance began 2021 with strong profitability and growth.
Segment income was $314 million and net written premiums grew 7%.
The combined ratio of 90.3% rose about 2 points from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher levels of catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development.
On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a strong 85.4%.
Automobile delivered another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.8%, an improvement of more than 9 points compared to the first quarter of 2020.
The improvement comprises 5 points of higher net prior year reserve development and an underlying combined ratio that is 4 points better than the prior year quarter.
These results reflect the ongoing effects of the pandemic, namely lower claim frequency due to fewer miles driven.
That said, we have begun to see miles driven moving back toward pre-pandemic levels as restrictions have eased and economic activity is picking up.
We're actively monitoring current trends and incorporating them into our state-specific pricing decisions as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability.
In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.4% increased by 15 points relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses of 22 points, up over 11 points, with most coming from the February winter storm and freeze events, and an 8 point increase in the underlying combined ratio primarily due to a comparison to unusually mild winter weather in the prior year quarter, along with about 2 points of elevated fire losses, many of which relate to extreme winter weather often resulting from the use of alternative heating sources.
The increases were partially offset by 5 points of higher net favorable prior reserve development, which included the subrogation benefits of the Woolsey wildfire that Dan mentioned.
Turning to domestic production.
Automobile net written premiums grew 3% with 14% growth in new business while retention remained strong at 84%.
Renewal premium change was about flat, consistent with our plan to align pricing with our loss experience in auto.
We are very pleased with our ongoing balanced execution in this line which has resulted in 4% year-over-year policies in-force growth at attractive returns.
Homeowners and others delivered another strong quarter with net written premium growth of 12%.
New business was up 21% from the prior year quarter, retention remained strong at 85%, and renewal premium change was 7.7%.
As Alan mentioned, we have achieved double-digit new business growth across auto and home for each of the past nine quarters.
Our ongoing new business success is driven by a combination of strategic investments and initiatives, including Quantum Home 2.0, IntelliDrive, and new and expanded partnerships and distribution relationships.
In addition to delivering strong results for the quarter, we continue to roll out new and expanded capabilities to deliver value in the eyes of our customers.
Recent examples include closing on the acquisition of InsuraMatch, our digital independent agency that expands our capabilities to serve customers and distribution partners, improving our customer self-service capabilities with the rollout of our new MyTravelers mobile application, continuing the rollout of our digital quote proposal to further enhance our agents' digital capabilities, further expanding our new version of IntelliDrive into Canada and eight additional states, and adding digital auto discount in nine more states for customers who leverage paperless, telematics, and mobile applications.
In summary, we're off to a great start to the year and are well positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth.
We're ready to open up for Q&A.
","Travelers Companies reported strong financial results for the first quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of their underwriting and investment strategies. Core income reached $699 million, representing an increase driven by favorable prior year reserve development, strong underlying underwriting income, and higher net investment income. Despite severe winter weather leading to record catastrophe losses, the company maintained discipline in pricing and risk selection. Underlying underwriting income improved due to earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends in commercial businesses and favorable loss conditions in personal auto. Net written premiums grew by 2%, driven by strong renewal premium changes in each business segment. Personal Insurance experienced excellent growth with new business increasing by 17% year-over-year. The company also announced a 4% increase in quarterly dividend and authorized an additional $5 billion for share repurchases, reflecting confidence in their financial position and business prospects. Overall, Travelers' strong execution and disciplined underwriting position them well to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers."
PRA_q2_2021.txt,"On our call today, we have Ned Rand, President and CEO; Dana Hendricks, Chief Financial Officer; Mike Boguski, President of our Specialty Property and Casualty lines; and Kevin Shook, President of our Workers' Compensation Insurance operations.
Ned, the floor is yours.
We closed the NORCAL transaction on May five, roughly halfway through the reporting period, and the financial teams of our newly combined organization did a great job getting everything ready to report our results.
We've made excellent early progress on our integration plan and already NORCAL is proving its value as we expand our operating model to a truly national platform.
As I said in the release yesterday, closing the NORCAL transaction was a transformative event for ProAssurance and the combined companies are off to a strong beginning.
As you will hear from both Mike and Kevin, the strategic changes we've made over the past two years are beginning to show through, and I'm very encouraged by the results of the second quarter.
We remain in an uncertain environment due to the continuing effects that pandemic has had on our healthcare and civil court systems and as workplaces navigate the return to work to an office environment.
In spite of these uncertainties, I am confident we have the right team in place, especially as we add in our colleagues from NORCAL to succeed as we move forward.
The NORCAL acquisition was, of course, the most impactful item in the quarter, and we'll get to that in a moment.
But first, I think it's important to answer the question of, excluding the noise from the transaction, how did we do this quarter?
In short, it was a good quarter.
We expected significant improvement year-over-year just by nature of the adverse events booked in the year ago period, and we saw that improvement and then some.
Our Specialty P&C business continues to show improvement with strong rate gains, solid retention and top line growth.
Lloyd's turned in an excellent result at a little over $4 million.
Our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Sale Reinsurance businesses both produced underwriting income in a very challenging marketplace, with their expense ratios benefiting from the restructuring completed last year.
Finally, we saw excellent returns from our investments in LPs and LLCs, driven by the market increase in the first quarter.
Recall, those investments are typically reported on a quarter lag.
All told, a solid result as we continue to execute strategies that drive steady incremental improvement.
Now for the results for the quarter.
We will be filing our 10-Q on or before Monday, which will provide a great look into exactly how NORCAL contributed to the quarter and the effects of transaction accounting.
I'll address certain of those impacts throughout my remarks today.
At the consolidated level, we reported net income of $92.1 million in the second quarter or $1.70 per diluted share, driven by a gain on bargain purchase of $74.4 million related to the NORCAL acquisition, partially offset by $20.3 million of pre-tax transaction-related costs.
Because these one-time items are unique and unusual in nature and non-indicative of regular operations, they are excluded from operating earnings and segment reporting.
We reported non-GAAP operating income of $26.6 million or $0.49 per share, again, driven by strong performance from our LP and LLC investment portfolio and meaningful year-over-year improvement in our underwriting results.
All segments contributed to our profitability this quarter.
Consolidated gross premiums written increased nearly 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by the addition of NORCAL's premium to our Specialty P&C results, as well as $14 million of new business written in the quarter from our core operating segments.
Our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio was 81.9%, a year-over-year improvement of 28.1 points, primarily attributable to the adverse effect of losses associated with significant events in the second quarter of last year in Specialty P&C.
More importantly, that improvement also reflects the continued benefits of our reunderwriting efforts.
We recognized net favorable development of $13.8 million in the current quarter, driven largely by the Specialty P&C segment, which included $2.1 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment on NORCAL's assumed reserve.
Our consolidated underwriting expense ratio increased in the quarter to 32.3%, driven by the pre-tax transaction costs associated with our acquisition of NORCAL.
Excluding those transaction costs, the expense ratio in the quarter was 23.8%, reflecting the continued impact of restructuring efforts, but also included the impact of certain purchase accounting adjustments.
As a part of purchase accounting, we wrote off NORCAL's capitalized DPAC asset on the acquisition date.
As a result, DPAC amortization expense for NORCAL in the second quarter was only $900,000 and represented expenses capitalized and subsequently amortized since the acquisition.
This amount is approximately $6.3 million lower than would be considered normal.
In our Form 10-Q, we will provide a detailed breakout of the various items affecting our expense ratio in the quarter to help our readers arrive at a run rate.
From an investment perspective, our consolidated net investment result increased year-over-year to $29.3 million, driven by $11.9 million of income from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, which were driven by the results of our investments in LPs and LLCs, as previously discussed.
Consolidated net investment income was $17.4 million in the quarter, down slightly from the year ago period, primarily due to lower yields from our short-term investments in corporate debt securities, due to the current low interest rate environment.
This decrease was partially offset by $2.7 million of net investment income from additional invested assets that came over from the NORCAL acquisition.
They've done a great job.
Mike, congratulations on a significant improvement in Specialty P&C this quarter.
What can you tell us about the results?
I want to start by extending congratulations to the Specialty P&C team for the continuing turnaround of our operating results, over the past two years to achieve an operating profit, the close of the transaction with NORCAL and the great start to integration of the companies.
We are proud of all that has been accomplished and look forward to a bright future with our new team members and business partners at NORCAL.
The significant year-over-year improvement in the segment's results was driven by several components.
Primarily, the comprehensive business strategy executed since 2019 to address our operating and underwriting results and the resulting reunderwriting and rate strengthening efforts in our legacy HCPL business.
We recorded improvement in operating metrics for all lines of business in the segment, including higher premium retention, continued rate gains, a reduced expense ratio and a lower current accident year loss ratio.
Most material to the improved results for the quarter was the impact of certain adverse events recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
However, we recorded improvement in the current accident year net loss ratio, even excluding those adverse events, a direct result of the continued benefits of our HCPL reunderwriting efforts.
Also contributing to profitability in the quarter was $10.5 million of net favorable reserve development spread relatively evenly across lines of business within the segment.
Just a brief aside before we move on from the loss ratio.
The reduction in HCPL claims frequency observed in 2020 has continued into 2021 thus far, as courts and jury trials in most places have yet to return to normal schedules.
We remain cautious in recognizing these favorable frequency trends in our current accident year loss pick due to the long-tailed nature of our lines of business and the high degree of continuing uncertainty that COVID-19 has introduced into operating conditions.
We continue to carefully monitor pandemic related claim activity and no adjustments have been made to the COVID-19 IBNR reserves booked in the second quarter of 2020.
Moving on to our top line.
Gross premiums written during the second quarter increased by over 30% or approximately $35 million.
We benefited from $22.4 million delivered by the NORCAL team and growth in our legacy business of 6.9%.
We achieved this growth with focus on underwriting discipline and we will continue to manage the segment's top line as necessary to achieve our long-term profit objectives.
Premium retention for the segment was 86% in the quarter, driven by retention rates that either improved or remained flat in all lines of business.
Furthermore, we achieved average renewal price increases of 10% in the segment this quarter, driven by 11% in Standard Physicians and 10% in Specialty Healthcare.
Although not reflected directly in our rates or pricing, we continue to strengthen rate adequacy through adjustments to product structure, terms and conditions.
Our small business unit and medical technology liability business also achieved increased rate gains of 6% and 8%, respectively.
New business written in the quarter totaled $7.2 million, an increase of $2.6 million from the year ago quarter and primarily driven by $3.7 million written in our HCPL specialty business.
The Specialty Property and Casualty segment reported an expense ratio of 17.1% for the first quarter -- for the second quarter, an improvement of 2.8 points from the year ago quarter, driven by significantly higher earned premiums, the impact of transaction accounting and benefits from prior organizational restructuring efforts.
This was partially offset by a slight increase in technology costs.
To conclude, we are pleased with the results of our reunderwriting, restructuring, expense management and operational improvements in our legacy Specialty P&C business over the past two years.
We are extremely excited about the strategic value of the NORCAL transaction and the bright future ahead.
We have made excellent progress on our integration plan during the quarter, and we are well on our way to building our future business model on a national basis with the goal of enhanced and sustainable performance through all economic and insurance cycles.
And congratulations again to you and the team.
Kevin, Workers' Compensation Insurance and the Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segments had solid results to report as well.
Can you walk us through those?
The Workers' Compensation Insurance segment produced income of $1.1 million and a combined ratio of 99.6% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 98.7% in 2020.
The increase in the combined ratio year-over-year reflects a higher accident year loss ratio in 2021, partially offset by an improvement in the underwriting expense ratio.
During the quarter, the segment booked $57.8 million of gross premiums written, an increase of 1.1% year-over-year despite negative audit premium.
Renewal price decreases in our traditional book of business were 3% in the second quarter of 2021 and premium renewal retention was 85%.
Traditional new business writings increased by $300,000 to $6.1 million in the quarter.
Audit premium in our traditional book of business decreased $1.3 million year-over-year reflecting the economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on final audits of policyholder payrolls.
The increase in the calendar year loss ratio to 68.3% in 2021 reflects an increase in the current accident year loss ratio, partially offset by prior year favorable development of $1.9 million in 2021 compared to $1.5 million in 2020.
The increase in the full year 2021 accident year loss ratio during the quarter reflects our response to observed higher claim activity as workers return to full employment with the easing of pandemic related restrictions in our operating territories.
The trend in higher claim activity was concentrated in our historically profitable small business unit, most notably in restaurant, hospitality and small construction market segments and was from accounts within our renewal policyholder base.
We booked a current accident year loss ratio of 73% for the second quarter of 2021, which brings the ratio for the six months ended June 30th to 72%.
Despite the increase in claim activity in our small business unit, overall frequency continues to be below pre-pandemic levels, albeit higher than 2020.
The claims operation closed 15.4% of 2020 and prior claims during the 2021 quarter consistent with second quarter historical trends.
Reported COVID claims continued to decrease during the second quarter of 2021.
Of note is the fact that there are no currently reported COVID claims with accident dates in the month of June.
However, there was a slight increase in reported COVID claims during July.
We continue to monitor legislative attempts to broaden workers' compensation coverage in our underwriting territories but observed minimal movement during the second quarter.
The 2021 underwriting expense ratio decreased to 31.3%, primarily due to the restructuring initiatives implemented in August of 2020, partially offset by a decrease in net premiums earned.
Other underwriting and operating expenses were $8.3 million in the quarter, a decrease of 7% or approximately $700,000.
The Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment produced income of $955,000 and a combined ratio of 84.4% for the second quarter of 2021.
Premium trends in the SPC Re segment were largely consistent with those in the Workers' Compensation Insurance segment.
We renewed all of the captive programs that were available for renewal during the current quarter.
The SPC Re calendar year loss ratio increased from 45.9% in 2020 to 51.9% in 2021.
The 2021 accident year loss ratio was 62.9%, up from 57% in 2020 and reflects both the continuation of intense price competition in the workers' compensation business and the impact of higher claim activity as workers return to employment.
Favorable loss reserve development was $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.9 million in 2020.
In all, another solid quarter in a very competitive marketplace.
Ned, can you give us just a quick look at the Lloyd's results before closing comments?
Happy to do so, Ken.
As you know, for the 2021 underwriting year, we reduced our participation in Syndicate 1729 from 29% to 5% and our participation in Syndicate 6131 from 100% to 50%.
The gross premiums written in the segment this quarter reflect that change.
As a result of these reductions, we received a return of capital of $24.5 million.
Despite the reduced participation, results improved meaningly meaningfully from the year ago period to $4.3 million.
Before we get to questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are to deliver improved results after an exceptionally challenging year.
While we still have much to do in pursuit of our long-term profit objectives, I believe our progress from a year ago speaks for itself.
I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish in the second half of the year.
","ProAssurance reported a solid quarter, with net income of $92.1 million or $1.70 per share, driven by a $74.4 million gain on bargain purchase related to the NORCAL acquisition. Excluding one-time items, non-GAAP operating income was $26.6 million or $0.49 per share, boosted by strong performance from the investment portfolio and improved underwriting results. All segments contributed to profitability, with Specialty P&C showing significant improvement due to reunderwriting efforts, rate strengthening, and favorable reserve development. Workers' Compensation Insurance saw higher claim activity in small business units but maintained profitability, while Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance delivered a solid result in a competitive market. Lloyd's also improved its results despite reduced participation. Despite uncertain economic conditions, ProAssurance remains confident in its team and the integration of NORCAL, which is expected to enhance performance through all economic cycles."
WAB_q3_2021.txt,"We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics.
John is a well-respected leader with broad operational and financial experience.
He is already bringing a great perspective to our business and long-term strategy with a clear focus on growing shareholder value.
We are thrilled to have him on the team.
I also want to take a moment to tank Pat Dugan for his nearly 20 years of service to Wabtec.
We're grateful for all that he has contributed to the company.
I will start with an update on our business, my perspective on the quarter and our long-term value framework and then John will cover the financials.
Overall, we made significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong third quarter as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share each of which were up year-over-year.
Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion driven by growing demand in freight services and components but offset by continued weakness in the North America OE end market.
Adjusted operating margin was 17% driven by strong mix and productivity, ongoing lean initiatives and cost actions.
Total cash flow from operations was $244 million this takes year-to-date cash from operations to $759 million versus $458 million a year ago.
This is a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance.
Cash conversion for the year is at 103%.
Finally, we ended third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 up 20% year-over-year.
Today, we're also pleased to share that we have achieved our $250 million synergy run rate, a full-year earlier than expected at the time of the GE Transportation acquisition.
We have consolidated and optimized our operations reduced costs to drive stronger profitability, accelerated lean across the enterprise and created additional capabilities in best cost countries.
We're already feeling the benefit of these efforts which will continue to improve our competitiveness.
So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy.
Shifting our focus to Slide 5 let's talk about our end market conditions in more detail.
Internationally, freight activity continued to improve in the third quarter, across our major markets and our order pipeline remains strong.
We expect long-term revenue growth in Russia/CIS Brazil, Africa, Asia and Australia.
Rate trends in North America weakened slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, not driven by lack of demand but by global supply chain disruption that has impacted intermodal volumes and auto production.
Consumer and industrial activity continue to spur volume growth in chemicals, metals and materials.
Locomotive parkings continue to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter.
We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency to continue to increase placing our services business in a position of strength.
When it comes to the North America railcar build, demand for railcars is improving.
About 21% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage a slight improvement from the previous quarter and in line with pre-COVID levels.
As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve.
We forecast the railcar built this year will be in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars.
Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets, however infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally turn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation.
Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain strong.
Shifting to Slide 6, we are developing innovative solutions that address the main cost drivers for our customers, including fuel efficiency and increased velocity in the transportation sector.
Our commitment to succeed in these efforts is underscored by our focused on continuing to position rail transportation as the safest and most sustainable way to move freight and people overland.
Today, we have the capability and expertise to transition diesel-powered locomotives to battery power and drastically reduce emissions as we're doing with our FLXdrive locomotive.
We expect to extend this technology further to hydrogen fuel cells and help lead the industry to a zero emission rail networks of the future.
And we're not stopping there; we have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well and we are driving several technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and pollutants.
An example of this is our Green Friction technology which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90% an incredible milestone and significantly improving the quality of the air in our metros.
We're also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network; a great example of this and a solution of growing interest among Class 1 customers is Trip Optimizer Zero-to-Zero.
These advanced technology allows an operator to autonomously start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control.
It builds on Trip Optimizer's proven performance which has saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year.
Looking forward, we will continue to advance efforts toward cleaner, more energy efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report which will be released in a couple of weeks.
In the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLXdrive locomotive.
We also closed a significant order for international locomotive kits and one additional contract in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions.
In Freight Services, we want a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for 100 locomotive modernizations in North America.
Overall, mods backlog remains strong and we are showing good momentum on deliveries.
Finally in transit we won new power collection, HVAC and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the UK.
Looking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs.
We also will continue to control while we can and leverage the strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply change disruptions, increasing metal and commodity costs and labor shortages.
These dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases.
Across the board, our team's working hard to mitigate the impact of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can.
We anticipate our costs will continue to increase over the next few quarters and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges.
It's great to be with you and I'm very excited to join the team at Wabtec.
It is a storied company with incredible talent, deep innovation and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail while growing shareholder value and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months.
Now, turning to Slide 8 before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face.
During the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products as well as significant increases in many key input costs.
On the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which are causing delays in production and customer delivery.
We believe that our enterprise revenues were to 2% to 3% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales, not lost sales.
The impacts to Wabtec's cost structure come in four areas.
First, commodity inflation; where markets year-over-year are up more than 200% for steel, 94% for aluminum and roughly 40% for copper.
The second area of impact is elevated freight and logistics costs, which in many cases are up over 3 times to 4 times from pre-COVID levels.
Third is wage inflation and labor availability, which are adversely impacting the business and finally, we are experiencing loss manufacturing efficiencies, largely due to component and chip shortages.
Our costs have increased during the quarter and have impacted both our Freight and Transit segments.
We estimate that cost increases in the third quarter are in the range of $15 million to $20 million.
Having said that, we expect these headwinds to intensify as the full cost of rising metals and lower manufacturing efficiencies work their way through our inventories and purchase contracts.
We anticipate cost to continue to increase over the next few quarters.
Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by triggering price escalation clauses that are included in many of our long-term contracts, implementing price surcharges, driving operational productivity, and lean initiatives and finally through higher realization of synergies.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our third quarter results in more detail.
We had good operational and financial performance during the quarter, sales for the third quarter were $1.91 billion, which reflects a 2.2% increase versus the prior year.
Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad-based recovery we are experiencing across much of our portfolio.
The acquisition of Nordco and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market and lower year-over-year sales in Transit.
For the quarter adjusted operating income was $325 million which was up 10.6% versus the prior year.
Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both our segments, up 1.3 percentage points on a consolidated basis.
Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, improved productivity and better than expected realization of synergies.
As Rafael stated during the quarter, we achieved our goal of $50 million of synergy run rate a significant milestone delivered a full year earlier than originally forecasted.
What makes this quarter's margin expansion even more impressive is the fact that our margin gains were achieved in the face of an incredibly dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment.
Looking at some of the detailed line items for the third quarter; adjusted SG&A was $257 million which was up $16.1 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and the acquisition of Nordco.
For the full year, we expect SG&A to be about 12.25% of sales, adjusted SG&A excludes $12 million of restructuring and transition expenses, of which most was allocated to further optimize our European footprint.
Engineering expense increased from last year, we continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing, our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve safety, productivity and capacity utilization.
Our 2021 investment in technology, which includes engineering expense remains at 67% of sales.
Amortization expense was $72.5 million and our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 24.8%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 25.8%.
For the full year, we still expect an effective tax rate of about 26% excluding discrete items.
In the third quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.14 up 20% versus prior year.
We are pleased with our Q3 results.
In particular, our sales growth in the face of supply chain disruptions, our margin growth in the face of sharp cost increases.
We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges.
Now, let's take a look at segment results on slide 10 starting with the Freight segment.
Across the Freight segment, total sales increased 4.7% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by continued strong growth at our services and component businesses.
In terms of product lines, equipment sales were down 5.7% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by strong mining sales.
This year-over-year performance demonstrates the resiliency of our equipment portfolio.
In line with an improved outlook for rail, our services sales grew a robust 13.6% versus last year.
The year-over-year sales increase was largely driven by higher aftermarket sales from our customers modernizing their fleets, the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco.
The performance, reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet.
Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the third quarter were up 6.1%.
Digital Electronics sales were down 3.6% year-over-year driven by delays in purchase decisions due to economic and cost uncertainties as well as chip shortages.
We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on safety, improved productivity, increased capacity and utilization.
Component sales continued to show recovery and were up 6.7% year-over-year driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end markets.
We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage higher order rates of new railcars and accelerated recovery across industrial end markets.
Shifting to operating income for the segment; Freight segment adjusted operating income was $266 million for an adjusted margin of 20.6%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year.
The benefit of higher volumes, improved mix across our portfolio and increased synergies and productivity were partially offset by significantly higher input costs.
Finally, segment backlog was $18.2 billion, up $375 million from the prior quarter and the broad multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed across the segment.
Turning to Slide 11, across our Transit segment sales decreased 2.5% year-over-year to $612 million.
Sales were down versus last year, due in large part to supply chain issues and COVID related disruptions.
This was partially offset by positive ridership trends.
Excluding near term supply chain challenges, we estimate that Transit sales would have been up slightly on a year-over-year basis.
We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues.
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 50 basis points versus prior year.
Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost and improve project execution despite the volatile cost environment.
For the year, we remain committed to deliver about 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment and the team continues to take aggressive action to mitigate rising costs and supply chain disruption, which will pressure the pace of near term margin improvement.
As we execute in the fourth quarter, we expect significantly improved operating margin driven by strong productivity gains, improved project mix and more favorable comps versus the prior year's fourth quarter.
Finally Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was flat with the prior quarter after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange.
Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 12.
We had another strong quarter for cash generation.
We generated $244 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash flow generated to over $759 million.
This performance, clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio.
During the quarter, total capex was $23 million bringing year-to-date capex to $78.5 million.
In 2021, we now expect capex to be approximately $120 million.
This is $20 million lower than our previous guidance as the team judiciously manages every dollar of spend.
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6 times and our liquidity is robust at $1.62 billion.
Also during the quarter we returned capital to shareholders, repurchasing $199 million of shares.
As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value.
Let's flip to Slide 13 to discuss our updated 2021 financial guidance.
We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and the end market momentum remains strong.
As John indicated, we do expect continued headwinds from a more challenging sales and cost environment into the fourth quarter.
Taking into consideration this market backdrop and volatile cost environment combined with our solid performance in the first three quarters we are narrowing our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance.
We expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share.
We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90% resulting in strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year.
Now, let's turn to our final slide; everything we've outlined today reinforces that we have a clear strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth.
Our strategy is built on our expansive installed base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers and accelerated by our lean continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation.
I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging supply chain, cost and market environment.
You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company and our financial results.
As we go forward the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector.
We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry and our company to deliver long-term profitable growth.
As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world.
After demonstrating strong performance in the first three quarters of 2021, I'm confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.
We will now move on to questions.
But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.
If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.
Operator, we are now ready for our first question.
","Wabtec Corporation reported strong financial results in the third quarter of 2021, surpassing expectations. Despite challenges in the supply chain and rising costs, the company achieved adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, a 20% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 2.2% to $1.91 billion, driven by strong growth in freight services and components. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 17%, reflecting improved mix, productivity, and cost actions. Wabtec has also realized synergies of $50 million, a full year ahead of schedule. The company continues to forecast strong cash flow generation and expects approximately $1 billion for the full year. However, Wabtec faces headwinds in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions, increasing metal costs, and labor shortages. To mitigate these challenges, the company is triggering price escalations, implementing price surcharges, and aggressively managing costs. Despite these challenges, Wabtec remains optimistic about long-term profitable growth in the rail sector."
MED_q3_2021.txt,"This has been another strong quarter for Medifast, with positive trends across our business and solid growth in both revenue and earnings.
Compared to the same time period last year, revenue increased 52.3% to $413.4 million in the third quarter, while earnings per diluted share rose 22.3% to $3.56.
As planned, we ran our business dealer promotion in August, consistent with the prior two years.
This promotion focuses on driving coach growth by incentivizing sponsorship at the time when coach leaders are deeply engaged and focused on broadening their reach following our annual convention.
The number of independent active earning OPTAVIA Coaches exceeded 61,000 at the end of the third quarter, with growth of 44.9% from the same period last year and up 3% sequentially.
Both coaches and the company had to adjust to the new scale of the business, and that's caused some to be expected bottlenecks that were manifest in product delivery delays in our supply chain in the second quarter and early into the third quarter, which impacted coaches and client experience.
Consequently, the sequential growth rate in active earning coaches decelerated as existing coaches spend more time supporting the record number of new clients who have entered the OPTAVIA ecosystem rather than onboarding as many new coaches.
As planned, we brought new fulfillment capacity fully online at the beginning of August 2021, and this had a significant positive impact on both coach and client experience in the back half of the quarter and is expected to continue going forward.
Promotional activity directed a client acquisition during the third quarter included the essential start promotion we ran in September.
Last year, this program ran in the April-May time frame, and it was an important catalyst to the sharp acceleration we experienced starting in the summer of 2020.
As this year's event was later in the quarter, the initial revenue benefit is expected to occur more in the fourth quarter, while some of the costs negatively affected the margins in the third quarter.
The key takeaway from our third quarter client acquisition results is that it will put us in a very strong position as we move into the final quarter of the year and moving to next year.
Our coach based model is driven by activation of new clients who then go on to be new coaches.
New client numbers are up about 50% year-over-year in the month of September due to the essential start promotion and the continued strong demand for our coach supported health and wellness plan.
As a result of new client acquisition, productivity hit a record high for the company with revenue per active earning coach reaching $6,773.
This is up 7% from a year ago and up 1.7% from Q2, the prior high.
Coaches are continuing to leverage our infrastructure, advanced digital tools and field-led training to amplify their engagement across social media as well as other technology platforms, enabling them to support a greater number of clients.
Our strategic investments in expanding supply chain and fulfillment capacity have proven invaluable in supporting our growth since 2017 when we decided to double down on the clinically proven coaching model through OPTAVIA.
This was accomplished three to six months in advance of the respective target dates.
Given our expected growth over the next several years, we are continuing to allocate capital and investments to this critical infrastructure and have already started work on an additional distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas in partnership with a leading third-party logistics company.
This comes on the heels of the new warehouse and distribution center in Maryland that came online in Q2 and to which we continue to add capacity through Q3.
Additionally, in October, we held an event with top coach leaders at Sundance, Utah, to reinforce alignment and provide planning and alignment sessions around major initiatives for 2022.
During the meeting, we aligned our plans for the fourth quarter, which supported their field-led training events over the final months of 2021 in preparation for Q1 of next year.
Consistent with last year, we will execute our Holiday Dash program, which will begin in December and carry over into the first week of January.
This promotion rewards coaches to attract new clients during the program period.
We continue investing in our digital lab in Utah to pioneer exciting growth and productivity tools for existing coaches as well as developing additional pathways for attracting new clients and encouraging and engaging new coaches.
Deployment of the two proprietary apps we've been developing is advancing and the early metrics are encouraging.
The OPTAVIA app targets clients and features healthy recipes, self-service options related to the OPTAVIA Premier orders and other key information to stay engaged.
It's broadly available in the U.S., while select users have access now in our Asia markets, where it is on track to go live within the next few weeks.
Through mid-October, there have been over 217,000 unique downloads and daily average usage has averaged approximately 50,000 over the past month.
Our Connect app is designed for OPTAVIA coaches to provide a powerful tool to help them efficiently manage and grow their business with instant access to key data and insights.
And that recently went live with approximately 2,000 business leaders and business coaches and will be rolled out across the broader coach population of 61,000-plus OPTAVIA coaches during the fourth quarter.
For some time now, many people have been looking at their health more holistically with a specific focus on developing healthy habits in every area of their life.
Our latest survey findings revealed that a large majority of U.S. adults have guidance from someone who has had similar experiences in helping them not only to reach their goals, but also to develop healthy habits.
We found that 66% of adults say having support helped them throughout their health and wellness journey and that more than four in five or 81% of U.S. adults believe that they would be more successful in creating healthy habits if they had support from someone who had been in their shoes.
This is true of our clients who are supported by independent OPTAVIA coaches, the majority of whom have undergone their own transformation on program and therefore, understand the clients what the clients are going through.
Coach support continues to be a critical component of the OPTAVIA program and a key differentiator of our unique model.
Our competitive position has never been stronger.
OPTAVIA's unique model and holistic approach incorporating coach and community to support helps people achieve their individual goals around health and wellness.
About 91.9% of our revenue is subscription-based and 100% of our orders are DTC, ships directly to consumers.
We now support over one million clients on an annual basis and the number of people we consider as part of our client community is increasing at a rapid rate.
Investments in technology and infrastructure have made us more efficient and has created a more powerful, scalable platform.
The strong consistent growth in revenue and profits that we have delivered in the third quarter as well as over the past several years is a testament to the strength of our business and continues to reinforce our confidence in the future.
In 2019, I shared the goal with our investment community of Medifast generating $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2021.
In Q3, we are pleased to announce we surpassed that full year revenue goal three months ahead of the original projection, allowing OPTAVIA to join an elite group of brands as it exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue.
According to a study by the Boston Consulting Group, there are around 290 $1 billion FMCG brands with U.S. sales and only around 20 of those brands were introduced after the year 2000.
Less than five years ago, we partnered with our coach community to introduce the lifestyle brand, OPTAVIA.
Today, OPTAVIA joins that select group of $1 billion brands.
It's a rare achievement that only a handful of brands can claim and further demonstrates the power of our unique coach model.
However, our proudest achievement lies in the human aspect.
It's the countless personal stories we hear from our OPTAVIA community each day and the two million lives we have impacted to date that underscores our mission of Lifelong Transformation, One Healthy Habit at a Time.
We remain confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth.
Demand for health and wellness products and services is strong with a particularly high addressable market for approaches that favor healthy habit building over dining or other weight loss approaches.
This achievement is a reflection of the strength of our independent coaches and the team that supports our community on a daily basis.
I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished, and I look forward to achieving many more growth milestones ahead.
Lastly, I'll close my remarks with an update on our initiatives around corporate social responsibility, which is a key priority for the entire Medifast organization and closely aligned with our overall mission.
Last month, we hosted our third annual Healthy Habits For All week, a week dedicated to helping underserved communities around the globe adopt healthy habits through improved education and expanded access to resources.
The event kicked off near our headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, where employees assembled back-to-school bags for after-school students at the Living Classrooms Foundation.
We closed the day by distributing those bags to the community and donated Chromebooks to the kids, providing critical access to technology that will allow them to adapt to changing environments throughout the school year.
We concluded the week with a virtual cooking class for our OPTAVIA community benefiting our nonprofit partner, No Kid Hungry.
The class was led by celebrity chef Fabio Viviani and our own OPTAVIA Co-Founder and independent OPTAVIA coach, Dr. Wayne Andersen.
Together, they taught attendees how to create two restaurant-inspired lean and green dishes.
We're proud of the impact we've made through Healthy Habits for All thus far, but we're just getting started.
Our community has a clear passion for making a difference and has demonstrated an impressive commitment to transforming communities around the world.
Revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased 52.3% to $413.4 million from $271.5 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting continued growth in the number of active earning OPTAVIA coaches and higher per coach productivity.
We ended the quarter with over 61,000 active earning OPTAVIA coaches, another new record, up 3% sequentially compared to Q2 and an increase of 44.9% from last year's third quarter.
Average revenue per active earning OPTAVIA Coach for the third quarter was 6,773, also a new record and a 1.7% higher than the previous record set in Q2 of 2021.
Versus a year ago, revenue per active earning OPTAVIA Coach was up 7%.
Gains in productivity per active earning OPTAVIA Coach for the quarter continued to be driven by an increase in both the number of clients supported by each coach as well as an increase in average client spend.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2021 increased 50.5% to $307.1 million compared to $204 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of sales.
Gross profit margin was 74.3%, down 90 basis points compared to 75.2% in the third quarter of 2020.
The primary reason for the year-over-year decline in gross margin was due to the essential start promotional activity and higher product and shipping costs.
We continue to expect pressure on gross profit margin through the remainder of 2021 due to planned higher use of co-manufacturers to keep up with demand along with inflation in raw ingredients, freight and labor costs and investments in supply chain and technology to achieve our growth objectives in 2022 and thereafter.
We believe gross profit as a percentage of revenue will improve in the longer term as we develop pricing strategies, enhance and reduce cost in our distribution network and gain productivity improvements in our procurement and manufacturing processes.
SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2021 increased 57.9% to $251.9 million compared to $159.5 million for the third quarter of 2020.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 220 basis points year-over-year to 60.9% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of 2020.
The increase was primarily due to higher OPTAVIA commissions expense, increased salaries and benefits related expenses for employees, incremental consulting costs related to information technology, increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales as well as costs associated with our annual convention held at the end of July 2021.
As the OPTAVIA Convention in July 2020 was a virtual event in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the costs were significantly lower.
Income from operations increased $10.6 million to $55.2 million from $44.6 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses.
Income from operations as a percentage of revenue was 13.3% for the quarter compared to 16.4% in the same period last year.
The effective tax rate was 23.9% for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 22.8% in last year's third quarter, reflecting higher state income tax rates and limitations on deductibility of officer compensation along with the tax benefit of stock compensation.
Net income in the third quarter of 2021 was $42 million or $3.56 per diluted share based on approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock outstanding.
This compares to net income of $34.5 million or $2.91 per diluted share based on approximately 11.9 million shares of common stock outstanding in last year's third quarter.
With approximately $160 million of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities and no interest-bearing debt, our balance sheet remains strong.
We have substantial capital and liquidity to continue executing our strategy, including prioritizing growth investments focused on technology and capacity expansion.
It's also important to note that we have been steadily increasing our share buyback activity, including repurchasing $26.3 million of stock in the third quarter, bringing the total for the first nine months of 2021 to approximately $46 million.
Given our expected trajectory for revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, we believe share repurchase remains a compelling way to enhance stockholder value.
Finally, in September 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $16.6 million or $1.42 per share, which is payable on November 8, 2021, to stockholders of record as of September 21, 2021.
Turning to our guidance.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $13.27 to $13.96.
Our guidance also assumes a 23.25% to 24.25% effective tax rate.
We have been able to increase our guidance multiple times this year due to the strength of our business.
Our revised earnings guidance from our last earnings call reflects strong revenue gains as well as increased investment in key growth initiatives, focused in supply chain and technology, which support us achieving our long-term objective in 2022 and thereafter.
In closing, third quarter results were strong, and we remain confident in our business model as we move into the fourth quarter and get ready for 2022.
We continue to target 15% top line growth and 15% operating income margin in the long term, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth at those levels.
","Medifast reported strong Q3 results, driven by growth in active earning coaches (up 44.9% YoY) and revenue per coach (up 7% YoY to a record $6,773). Revenue surged 52.3% to $413.4 million, while earnings per diluted share rose 22.3% to $3.56. The company's unique coach-based model supports new client acquisition, with new client numbers up 50% YoY in September. Despite promotional activity driving client acquisition, margins were impacted, with gross profit margin down 90 basis points to 74.3%. SG&A expenses increased 57.9% to $251.9 million due to higher commissions and increased information technology costs. Despite the expense increases, income from operations rose to $55.2 million, with the effective tax rate increasing slightly to 23.9%. The company's strong balance sheet includes $160 million of cash and equivalents and no debt. Medifast remains confident in its long-term growth prospects, targeting 15% top-line growth and a 15% operating income margin, forecasting revenue between $1.51 billion and $1.53 billion and earnings per share between $13.27 and $13.96 for fiscal 2021."
CHD_q3_2020.txt,"The pandemic has given us an opportunity to display our agility as a company.
We increased our communications with retailers.
We changed our marketing messages.
We shifted investments to categories that are most important to consumers.
And we set new production records for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER baking soda.
And we've moved people to focus on the online class of trade.
So we've been proactive in seizing the opportunities presented by the crisis and are increasing manufacturing capacity in our plants and externally with new co-packers.
The agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team is showing up in our results.
Our priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands.
Our plant, warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job in keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain.
Our office employees continue to work remotely and are doing a super job running the company.
So now let's talk about the results.
Q3 was another exceptional quarter.
Reported sales growth was 13.9% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.70.
Revenue, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher in Q3 than last year, driven by the significant increase in demand for many of our products.
Organic sales grew 9.9%, driven by higher consumption.
Regarding e-commerce, we were already strong pre-COVID and well positioned online.
In Q3, our online sales increased by 77% as all retailer.coms have grown.
One example would be gummy vitamins.
In 2019, 8% of our full year sales were online.
This year, we expect full year to be about 14% online.
Recall, we began the year targeting 9% online sales as a percentage of global consumer sales.
In Q1, it was 10% online; Q2, 13%; and Q3, also 13%.
So we expect the full year to be actually close to 13% as well.
We continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers.
There's no surprises here, actually.
There is continued consumer concern that stores will run out of stock and websites will face delivery issues.
Consumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time.
If we look at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally in balance in the 15 categories in which we compete.
With respect to our brands, we had broad-based consumption growth in Q3.
We saw a double-digit consumption growth in VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits and cleaners.
In Household, our laundry business consumption was up 4% and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was up 8%.
Water flossers is another bright spot as consumption turned slightly positive in Q3.
Although our Lunch & Learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to continue to address this with incremental advertising.
In addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, water flossers is another brand we expect to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness.
BATISTE dry shampoo remains impacted by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but improved sequentially compared to Q2 when consumption was down 22%.
TROJAN consumption was down 6% in Q3, but also improved sequentially when we were down 15% in Q2.
There's no doubt that consumers have made health and wellness a priority.
VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw the greatest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%.
The category consumption was even higher.
Our expectation is that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain high.
And we have new third-party capacity coming online in late Q4 to take advantage of this trend.
Consumers are focusing on health and wellness, but also, cleaning, home cooking and new grooming routines.
At a recent investor conference, you may have heard me cite consumer research that suggests it takes 66 days to form a new habit.
And only time will tell if all of these new behaviors will translate into permanently higher levels of consumption.
But if they do endure over time, we believe we are well positioned.
Now a few words about private label.
As you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories.
Private label shares have remained generally unchanged for the first, second and third quarters of this year.
Our international business came through with double-digit organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our GMG business, that's our Global Markets Group, and Canada.
In October, our GMG business is off to another strong start, and we continue to see strong POS recovery in Canada and Europe.
After three consecutive quarters of growth, our Specialty Products business contracted 3.4% in Q3, primarily due to the poultry segment.
Now turning to new products.
Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers even in this economy.
VITAFUSION gummy vitamins launched a number of new products.
And to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity, we launched POWER ZINC and Elderberry gummies.
We've launched ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, which has only six ingredients plus water compared to 15 to 30 ingredients for typical liquid detergents.
And in the second half, we launched ARM & HAMMER ABSORBx clumping cat litter, a new litter, which is 55% lighter than our regular litter.
Now let's turn to the outlook.
We're having an exceptional year.
We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%, which is far above our evergreen target of 8% annual earnings per share growth.
Given our strong performance, we have raised our full year outlook for sales growth to be approximately 11% and organic sales growth to be approximately 9%.
As mentioned many times in the past, we take the long view in managing Church & Dwight in order to sustain our evergreen model.
In the second half, we took the opportunity to increase our marketing spend behind our new products and we made incremental investments in the company.
As we wind up the year, we are putting together our 2021 plan.
It's safe to say that we have a high degree of confidence that we will meet our evergreen model in '21.
In February, we'll provide our detailed outlook for next year.
Now in conclusion, I would like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight.
The great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good and bad economic times.
The categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers.
And we have a few categories that stand to benefit from the current environment.
We have a balance of value and premium products.
Our power brands are number one or number two in their categories.
And we have low exposure to private label.
We're coming off some of the best growth quarters we've ever had.
And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses.
We believe our company is stronger and more agile than ever.
And finally, we have the resources, the common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands perform well in the future.
Next up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter.
We'll start with EPS.
Third quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an acquisition-related earnout adjustment, grew 6.1% to $0.70 compared to $0.66 in 2019.
As we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period.
Stronger-than-expected sales performance allowed the company to spend incrementally on marketing.
Reported revenue was up 13.9%, reflecting a continued increase in consumer demand for our products.
Organic sales was up 9.9%, driven by a volume increase of 10.2%, partially offset by 0.3% of unfavorable product mix and pricing, primarily driven by new product support.
Volume growth was driven by higher consumption.
Now let's review the segments.
Organic sales increased by 10.7%, largely due to higher volume.
Overall, growth was led by VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and OXICLEAN stain fighters.
We commonly get asked to bridge the Nielsen reporting to our organic results.
This quarter, tracked consumption was 7.7% for our brands compared to an organic sales increase of 10.7%.
In this environment, one might assume that is restocking retailer inventory.
That is not the case.
We had 400 basis points of help from strong growth in untracked channels, primarily online, and 100 basis point drag from couponing to support new products.
The good news is, as you heard from Matt, consumption and shipments are in balance, both low double digits.
Consumer International delivered 11.6% organic growth due to higher volume, offset by lower price and product mix.
This was a great recovery for our international business from a flat Q2.
Growth was primarily driven by the Global Markets Group and Canada.
For our SPD business, organic sales decreased 3.4% due to lower volume, offset by higher pricing.
The lower volume was primarily driven by the nondairy animal and food production in sodium bicarbonate business.
Turning now to gross margin.
Our third quarter gross margin was 45.5%, 110 basis point decrease from a year ago.
Gross margin was impacted by 110 basis point drag from tariffs and a 90 basis point impact from acquisition accounting.
In addition, to round out the Q3 gross margin bridge is a plus 100 basis points from price/volume mix; plus 160 basis points from productivity programs, offset by a drag of 80 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, inflation and higher distribution costs; as well as a drag of 90 basis points for COVID costs.
Moving now to marketing.
Marketing was up $45.7 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brands.
Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales increased 230 basis points to 13.8%.
For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to leverage from strong sales growth.
Other expense all in was $12.3 million and $3.9 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates.
And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 17.3% compared to 21.6% in 2019, a decrease of 430 basis points, primarily driven by higher tax benefits related to stock option exercises.
And now turning to cash.
For the first nine months of 2020, cash from operating activities increased 29% to $798 million due to significantly higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital.
As of September 30, cash on hand was $549 million.
Our full year capex plan continues to be approximately $100 million as we begin to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins.
As I mentioned back at the Barclays conference in September, we do expect a step-up in capex over the next couple of years to approximately 3.5% of sales for these capacity-related investments.
In addition, as you read in the release, due to the strong cash position, the company may resume stock repurchases in the future.
For Q4, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 9%, organic sales growth of approximately 8%.
And as Matt mentioned, we have strong consumption across many of our categories.
Turning to gross margin.
We previously called 150 basis point contraction in the second half.
Now we're saying down 190 basis points.
The change is primarily due to nonrecurring supply chain costs.
We also expect significant expense, and we have called flat for the year in terms of a percent of sales, which implies a step-up in Q4.
We also anticipate a lower tax rate.
As a result, we expect Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share, excluding the acquisition earnout adjustment as we exit 2020 with momentum.
And now for the full year outlook, we now expect approximately 11% for the year 2020 sales growth, which is above our previously 9% to 10% range.
We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 9%, up from our previous 7% to 8% outlook.
We raised our cash from operations outlook to $975 million, which is up 13% versus year ago.
Turning to gross margin.
We expect gross margin to be down 20 basis points for the year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition accounting, COVID costs, incremental manufacturing and distribution capacity investments and the higher tariffs on WATERPIK.
As to tariffs, remember back in 2018, we got caught up in Tier two tariffs for which we were granted an extension in 2019.
That exemption expired and was not extended as of Q3 2020.
We continue to work on mitigating that impact.
Another word or two on gross margin.
Previously, I have said the first half of the year was plus 150 basis points on gross margin and the second half was down 150 basis points on gross margin.
And so our outlook as of last quarter was flat for the year.
And then also last quarter, you heard me walk through investments we were making in the second half of 2020.
Examples here included a new third-party logistics provider, outside storage to handle surge inventories, preliminary engineering on capacity, VMS outsourcing costs as well as other investments around automation, consumer research and analytics.
Now we're calling down 190 basis points for the back half or down 20 basis points for the year, and that implies down 250 basis points for the quarter.
We have some supply chain nonrecurring costs.
Here are a few examples.
First, because of our outsized growth, I mentioned last quarter, we're adding a new 3PL distribution center.
In the quarter, we again had stronger sales.
And as such, had duplicative outside storage locations and the new 3PL distribution center that wasn't operational.
So for a period of time, we had duplicative costs.
We're also in the process of going through make first buy decisions.
And that will trigger a couple of asset write-offs likely in Q4.
We have lean training across the plants.
And finally, due to the great results this year, higher incentive comp cost that flow through COGS.
So our full year tax rate expectations are 19%, and we also raised our adjusted earnings per share growth to 13% to 14%.
Now that we're through the outlook, I also want to spend a minute on FLAWLESS.
As you saw in the release, we had an earnout benefit of approximately $50 million in the quarter in reported earnings.
We exclude any of the earnout movements in adjusted EPS.
Some color on that swing.
As a backdrop, we bought that business for $475 million upfront and a $425 million earnout tied to year-end 2021 sales.
That sales target represented in excess of 15% CAGR for three years off of a baseline of $180 million of trailing sales.
The revised 3-year CAGR for this business is closer to 8%.
And as such, the earnout liability comes down and earnings go up.
We're still positive on this business.
And the strong consumption growth these past six months is a great indicator for the future.
As you heard from Matt, the company is well positioned as we enter 2021.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
","Church & Dwight's third quarter was marked by a 13.9% increase in revenue, driven by organic sales growth of 9.9% and increased consumption across various categories. The company's agility during the pandemic, including increased marketing communication and investment in essential products, has contributed to these positive results. Q3 adjusted earnings per share grew 6.1% to $0.70, exceeding expectations. Furthermore, the full year outlook has been revised, with sales growth now expected to be approximately 11%, organic sales growth at 9%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%-14%. VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, along with ARM & HAMMER products, led the growth. E-commerce sales also saw a significant increase of 77%, with the full year expected to reach 13%. Despite the pandemic's impact on some categories like BATISTE dry shampoo and TROJAN condoms, the company remains optimistic, citing strong fundamentals, a balance of value and premium products, and low exposure to private label. Church & Dwight also plans to increase its marketing spend and make incremental investments in the second half of the year. With a strong balance sheet and the ability to acquire TSR-accretive businesses, the company is confident in its ability to perform well in both good and bad economic times."
SUN_q4_2020.txt,"These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the Partnership's future operations and financial performance, including expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Actual results could differ materially and the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events.
During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as adjusted.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Partnership recorded net income of $83 million, adjusted EBITDA was $159 million compared to $168 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Volumes of 1.8 billion gallons were relatively unchanged from the third quarter, but remain down about 12% from levels seen a year ago.
Fuel margin was $0.092 per gallon and included approximately $8 million of one-time write-offs associated with prior period fuel tax and inventory-related items.
Fourth quarter margin also included approximately $9 million of unfavorability related to inventory valuation and associated hedges.
For the full-year 2020, the impact of this inventory valuation and hedging activity resulted in approximately $2 million of margin favorability.
Karl will elaborate further on our fuel margin in his remarks.
Fourth quarter distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $97 million, yielding a coverage ratio of 1.1 times.
We ended the full-year 2020 with the coverage ratio of 1.5 times.
On January 28, we declared an $0.8255 per unit distribution, the same as last quarter.
The proven resiliency of our business and history of delivering results has allowed us to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders.
We continued to deliver strong results in 2020, despite the challenges of the COVID pandemic and fully expect to continue building on the strong performance in 2021 and beyond.
First off, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments for 2020 before walking through the 2021 guidance that we unveiled in December.
Our full-year 2020 accomplishments include the following: adjusted EBITDA of $739 million, a record for SUN and up 11% from 2019 levels; distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $517 million, also a record for SUN and up 14% from 2019.
We improved our already strong coverage ratio to 1.5 times, up from 1.3 times in both 2018 and 2019.
Our cost reduction initiatives resulted in total operating expenses of $448 million, which was a reduction of 11% from 2019 levels.
Our fuel margin increased $0.018 per gallon from 2019 to $0.119 per gallon.
We successfully refinanced our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023, with new 4.5% Senior Notes due 2029, thereby lowering interest expense, while significantly expanding the weighted average maturity of our debt.
For reference, our nearest Senior Note debt maturity is now the 2026 Senior Notes.
And finally, we improved our leverage to 4.18 times, or 4.1 times when adjusted for total cash on hand from 4.6 times at the end of 2019.
Our liquidity remains strong, with an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and $97 million in cash at year-end.
With all these accomplishments as a backdrop, we enter 2021 poised to continue to deliver strong results.
In December, we provided guidance for 2021 for adjusted EBITDA of between $725 million and $765 million.
Underpinning this guidance are the following: fuel volumes in a range of 7.25 billion to 7.75 billion gallons; annual fuel margin between $0.11 per gallon and $0.12 per gallon; total operating expenses of between $440 million and $450 million; maintenance capital of $45 million; and growth capital of at least $120 million.
Free cash flow generating capability of this business allows us to focus on the pillars of our capital allocation strategy.
First, to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders.
Second, to protect our balance sheet through debt paydown when prudent.
And third, to pursue disciplined investment in our growth opportunities.
We will be financially disciplined with the target coverage ratio of 1.4 times, which is up from our prior target of 1.2 times and a target leverage ratio of 4 times, which is down from our prior target of 4.5 times to 4.75 times.
I'd like to conclude my remarks by stating that Sunoco established a strong financial footing early on in 2020 and this continues to carry through as we enter 2021.
Scott and Dylan walk you through the numbers for the quarter and the full year.
I want to take a few minutes and give you a sense of how we view these results and what kind of insight they give us into 2021.
Let's start by talking about volume.
On the surface, our fourth quarter results were very similar to the third quarter.
There are a few additional factors though that we view as promising.
First, during our last conference call, I shared the volumes were off around 12% for October.
When we moved into November and December, we all experienced some additional restrictions on travel and business activity, with the increase in COVID cases across the country.
Even with those additional restrictions, our volumes held and we finished the quarter at about the same level relative to the prior year.
The second factor is around J.C. Nolan volumes.
Last quarter, I explained that our J.C. Nolan diesel volumes were off much more than the rest of our business.
We were also lapping the start-up of the pipeline in the third quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter, this was an even bigger impact, since we were comparing against a full period of pipeline operation.
Year-over-year, J.C. Nolan volume reductions accounted for 3% of total volume for the fourth quarter.
So that would put our volumes down only 9%, if you remove the impact of J.C. Nolan.
My final thought on volumes provides some insight into one of the reasons for the solid performance, which is our ability to add new customers.
Starting last summer, we started ramping backup our growth focus on signing up new customers, and we're starting to see that in our Q4 numbers, and that will carry forward into 2021.
The bottom line is that we see our volumes continue to grow through the rest of this year, both from overall economic recovery and our own growth efforts.
Moving over to margins, the market continues to support stronger margins.
Let me give you some perspective on our reported margins for the fourth quarter.
First, we saw a challenging market environment with a fairly steady and relentless claim in RBOB prices for most of the quarter.
If you look back at our history, that would have likely resulted in margins close to $0.09 a gallon, maybe even dipping a little lower.
Fast forward to the post-COVID environment and the floor is higher, which is what our fourth quarter results look like after you account for the one-time adjustments and inventory timing impacts as Scott mentioned.
As we have stated before, the higher breakeven environment for many industry participants, both in the wholesale and retail channels, helps support the higher margin floor.
As we look to the first quarter, we've continued to see a steady rise in RBOB prices, putting pressure on margins.
And we still feel like a floor in the $0.095 to $0.10 range is reasonable for these tough market environments, excluding one-time issues in the quarter.
We already discussed some one-time items for the fourth quarter, and we expect the 7-Eleven catch-up payment in the first quarter that will provide a boost to our base margins.
Finally, I want to provide some more color around our expense performance.
For the last few years, we've been extremely focused on looking hard at what it takes to efficiently run our business.
When COVID hit, we took an even deeper look and made some tough choices.
Our expense performance in the third and fourth quarters show that we are able to operate at these levels.
There will always be some fluctuations in timing, and there were a few favorable one-time impacts in the fourth quarter that brought the expenses down even a little further than our run rate.
But the takeaway is that we have continued to deliver on our expense commitments, and are very comfortable with our guidance for this year.
We continue to add volume to our network.
Margins are solid, and our expense focus falls directly to the bottom line.
We delivered very strong results in 2020.
We came into 2020 financially healthy, and we finished the year stronger than where we started.
While countless companies had significant financial difficulties, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.
Last year, we delivered record EBITDA and DCF.
Over the last three years, we have steadily improved our coverage, while at the same time, decreasing our leverage ratio.
Looking forward, we expect to have another good year.
We're about a month and a half into the New Year and both fuel volume and RBOB costs continue to rise.
Since early November, both gasoline and diesel prices has steadily increased.
Over that time period, New York Harbor RBOB has gone up around $0.75 per gallon.
As you know, this is not the most conducive margin environment.
With that said, there are other important factors to consider.
Industry break-evens are higher.
We're seeing this play out, as the market continues to pass on price increases to the rack and to the street.
However, the steady constant rise in costs does create a time lag, resulting in short-term margin pressure.
Taking a step back, there will always be some quarters where the commodity environment provides noticeable headwind.
But there will also be quarters where the commodity environment will be highly supportive of wide margins.
History has shown that run-ups in prices are followed by periods of more volatile or falling prices that provide margin tailwinds.
When you look at our business beyond a quarter-by-quarter basis, we expect to have quality long-term results.
On the volume side, we're seeing positive increases in volume, excluding material regional weather events.
We expect this to continue over the course of this year.
Finally, you can expect us to deliver on expenses.
Moving on to growth, we'll continue to grow our field distribution business.
The opportunity set remains strong, and we expect these organic and M&A opportunities to remain for the foreseeable future.
On the midstream side, we remain patient looking for the right opportunity at the right price.
We'll continue to look for highly synergistic opportunities, while remaining financially disciplined.
","In Q4 2020, Sunoco recorded net income of $83 million and adjusted EBITDA of $159 million. Fuel margin was $0.092 per gallon, impacted by one-time write-offs and inventory-related items. Fourth quarter distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $97 million, yielding a coverage ratio of 1.1 times. For the full-year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $739 million, a record for SUN and up 11% from 2019 levels. Distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $517 million, also a record for SUN and up 14% from 2019. The partnership reduced leverage and improved its coverage ratio. Looking ahead to 2021, Sunoco anticipates adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $765 million, with fuel volumes ranging from 7.25 billion to 7.75 billion gallons. The partnership is targeting a more conservative coverage ratio of 1.4 times and a leverage ratio of 4 times. Sunoco remains focused on growth initiatives, including organic growth and M&A opportunities in the field distribution business."
SKT_q4_2020.txt,"This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors.
We direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations or FFO, core FFO, and Same-Center net operating income.
As such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, February 18, 2021.
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.
We request that everyone ask only one question and one follow-up to allow as many of you as possible to ask questions.
If time permits, we are happy for you to requeue for additional questions.
On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Clearly, 2020 was a year like no other.
And I want to express my deep appreciation for the entire Tanger team who have worked so diligently to navigate the challenges brought on by the global pandemic.
Virtually, all of our tenants have been facing mandates, directing them to close their stores, operate at reduced capacity and comply with additional health and safety measures.
In 2020, there were several retail bankruptcies and restructurings, resulting in space recapture and higher vacancy than historic levels.
But also providing us with opportunities to further diversify and upgrade our tenant mix.
This past year also highlighted the positive characteristics of the Tanger Outlet platform.
As evidenced, by the resilience, our portfolio has demonstrated since governmental mandates were lifted starting in the second quarter of 2020.
Our open-air centers provide an excellent value proposition for both retailers and shoppers that cannot be duplicated by e-commerce or other brick-and-mortar formats.
These desirable characteristics are demonstrated in our recent results, including the rapid pace that stores reopened after mandates were lifted and the positive trends in our traffic and rent collection metrics.
Our balance sheet further differentiates Tanger.
Our financial strategy has always been conservative, with a great emphasis on maintaining sufficient liquidity to provide optimal flexibility.
In January, given the meaningful improvement of our cash flows since the onset of the pandemic, we reinstated out dividend, which is an important part of our total return for shareholders.
As previously announced on January 1, I assumed the role of Executive Chair after 12 years as CEO.
And the more than 35 years that I've been with the company, I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished as the leader in the outlet industry.
We created a brand synonymous with quality Outlet Centers, became the go-to-channel for countless world-class brands and retailers, created thousands of jobs and prioritized our role as a community leader, contributor, and partner.
I have complete confidence in Steve's ability to lead the company during this transformative time and look forward to advising Steve through this transition.
We are encouraged by the opportunities we have identified to position the company to return to sustained growth over time.
Finally, I want to extend our best wishes to those who are in the path of the current winter storms and are being so impacted by the extreme weather and power outages.
I'm grateful and excited for the opportunity to lead Tanger through this important transition, in partnership with Steve, our Board of Directors, and the entire Tanger team.
While the last 11 months' have been challenging for our company, the positive traffic, rent collections and liquidity trends that Steve mentioned are all indicators that our business is stabilizing and our shoppers are quickly returning to our open-air outlet shopping centers.
During 2020, while navigating the pandemic, we accomplished many things and established the groundwork for positioning our company for growth.
Our team turned challenges into opportunities and focused on enhancing the key components of our core business, leasing, operations and marketing.
Our year end consolidated portfolio occupancy was 91.9% despite having recaptured almost 8% of the square footage in our portfolio during the year due to bankruptcies and brandwide retailer restructurings.
Leasing has taken on an increased intensity and a broader focus across the entire company.
Our leasing and business development professionals are focused on growing our existing tenant base through store expansions and new deals across our portfolio, identifying new retailers and users in order to diversify our center offerings and augment our merchandising with best-in-market food, entertainment and experiential retailers, aimed at driving new shopper visits, increasing their frequency, extending their stay and driving sales growth.
This strategy has already begun to pay off as we have added best-in-class brands such as Tory Burch, Lululemon, Victoria's Secret and Hugo Boss to several new locations.
And in early 2021, we'll add new categories.
For example, in the F&B category, the iconic Gourmet grocer Nantucket Meat and Fish took space in Hilton Head, South Carolina.
In the sporting goods category, Dick's will open their first outlet warehouse concept with us later this month.
And in shipping and distribution, through our partnership with PELAGIC [Phonetic], the last mile distribution and logistics platform, we are opening our first on-center facility in Deer Park, which we anticipate will be a model for other locations going forward.
Leasing momentum had started to build in Q4 across our portfolio and continues to do so now.
We are well staffed to take advantage of this increased activity.
In addition to our team of leasing professionals, we've entered into strategic partnerships in key markets with top retail brokers to tap their local market expertise and drive best-in-class local and iconic businesses in these select markets.
Lastly, as I discussed last quarter, we brought on an EVP of Property Operations to help create a field-led strategy.
Through this initiative, we've reorganized our field management teams and have empowered them to take a proactive role in supporting our local leasing initiatives.
Given the level of vacancy going into 2021, it's going to take time to rebuild our occupancy, and we anticipate that.
In certain cases, rent spreads will continue to be pressured.
However, we are encouraged by an increase in deal activity as we see more retailers strategizing growth.
While our strong brand, stabilized traffic and an attractive value proposition, Tanger Outlet's offers retail brands a compelling solution to manage their product, placement and pricing that is unique to any other retail distribution channel.
We also believe there is an opportunity to drive NOI by monetizing additional elements of our center, such as media and amenity sponsorships.
At the onset of the pandemic, we proactively offered all of our retail partners the opportunity to defer April and May rents until January and February of this year, in order to provide them the flexibility to reopen quickly when the mandates were lifted.
This strategy proved effective.
The percentage of occupied stores that are open rapidly accelerated post mandate and currently stands at 99%.
Our strong rent collections at 95% of fourth quarter build rents and better than expected deferred rent collections to date demonstrate that the strategy was successful, where we permitted concessions, we negotiated landlord-friendly amendments that resulted in a value for value exchange that strengthened our portfolio.
We also took a closer look at expenses and we're able to quickly devise a plan that resulted in almost $18 million in cost reductions over the last nine months of 2020.
I'm pleased to note the meaningful rebound in traffic to our centers.
In the fourth quarter, shopper traffic rebounded to approximately 90% of prior year levels, rising to more than 95% during the month of January.
Excluding our Canadian centers, where stores were closed under government mandate, January traffic rebounded to prior year levels.
This performance reflects our favorable characteristics, open-air, outdoor centers that offer an inviting way for shoppers to find their favorite brands and everyday value pricing.
During 2020, we started the journey of our digital transformation.
During the second quarter, we rolled out our Tanger 3-Ways To Shop, in-store, curbside pickup and our proprietary Tanger virtual shopper service, each allowing the customer to shop the way they feel most comfortable.
Tanger virtual shopper is a service that meets our customer where they are and allows them to virtually shop any brand in the Tanger portfolio regardless of geography using FaceTime to chat with the Tanger stylist.
Orders can be picked up your curbside or shipped to home.
To date, our Tanger virtual shopper engagements continue to build.
Throughout the pandemic, our centers have been hubs for civic engagement, including blood drives, food drives, and voter registration sites.
During 2020, Tanger team members created and organized a D, E and I leadership council with the mission of championing diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization, empowering us to reach our full potential, fueling innovation and connection with our employees, customers and the communities we serve.
My confidence in our business is steadfast and I'm energized by our opportunity.
While there is still headwinds as we enter 2021, I'm confident in our team, our strategy and our ability to execute to our initiatives.
We remain focused on our core business, accelerating leasing, reshaping operations and advancing our marketing strategy to meet shoppers where they want to shop.
Each of these initiatives are establishing the necessary infrastructure to return to sustained growth and profitability over time, which is our top priority.
Fourth quarter results showed continued improvement from our second and third quarter performance, but reflect the ongoing impact of the pandemic, recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.
Fourth quarter Core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.54 per share compared to $0.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Same-Center NOI for the consolidated portfolio decreased $7.8 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting the rent modifications and store closings from the recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings, including an additional 317,000 square feet recaptured during the quarter.
Included in Same-Center NOI for the quarter or write-offs of approximately $3.1 million related to the fourth quarter build rents.
The write-offs were offset by the reversal of approximately $3.5 million in reserves related to rents previously deferred or under negotiation as a result of better-than-expected collections, leaving a net benefit of approximately $400,000.
In addition, we recognized a $1.1 million charge to core FFO related to the write-off of straight-line rents, which are not included in Same-Center NOI.
Through the end of January, we had collected 95% of fourth quarter rents build.
We also continue to collect rents build for prior periods, including amounts related to 2020, we allowed our tenants to defer to 2021.
As of January 31, our second quarter improved to 63% of build rents from 43%.
Third quarter improved to 91% from 89% and 57% of deferred rents had been collected, nearly half of which represented prepayments.
We collected 90% of the deferred rents that were due in January.
As of January 31, 2021, collections of January rents build were similar to collection rates for the fourth quarter.
Core FFO for the quarter was positively impacted by the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $4.1 million, which was significantly elevated over the prior year amount of approximately $100,000.
As previously discussed, we have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position and particularly through the pandemic, this discipline has proven to be critical.
With the improvements in rent collections, the ongoing focus on cost controls and a prudent approach to capital allocation, we had over $680 million of available liquidity, including over $80 million of cash and $600 million of unused capacity on our lines of credit as of the end of January.
We have no significant debt maturities until December 2023.
Given the improved rent collections and our ample liquidity position, our Board declared a dividend of $0.1775 per share, which was paid last week to holders of record on January 29.
We will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to capital allocation.
In addition to dividend distributions sufficient to maintain REIT status, our priority uses of capital include investing in our portfolio to grow NOI, reducing leverage to pre-COVID levels over time, and evaluating selective growth opportunities over the longer term.
While we are encouraged by the pace of leasing and progress of the initiatives that Steve Yalof discussed, we anticipate that there will be variability in our performance.
As the ongoing impact of the pandemic remains uncertain, we continue to anticipate pressure from current vacancies, additional potential store closures and rent modifications.
In light of this backdrop, we expect core FFO per share for 2021 to be between $1.47 and $1.57 per share.
This guidance assumes there are no further government mandated shutdowns and assumes lease termination fees decrease by $9 million to $10 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per share, from the elevated level we recognized in 2020.
Currently, we expect to recapture approximately 200,000 square feet due to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings during 2021, most of which we expect will occur during the first half of the year.
We are not providing any further detailed operational performance assumptions at this time.
However, we do anticipate there will be some variability in quarterly operational performance on a year-over-year comparison basis.
In 2020, we did not see any meaningful impact from COVID it in the first quarter.
And in the first quarter of 2021, there have been widespread winter storms across much of our portfolio.
We expect a combined annual recurring capital expenditures and second generation tenant allowances of approximately $40 million to $45 million for 2021.
Finally, we believe our balance sheet is well positioned from a liquidity perspective.
We are continuing to take the appropriate steps to navigate the current environment and maximize our financial flexibility.
Operator, can we take our first question.
","Tanger Outlet's fourth-quarter core funds from operations per share reached $0.54. Despite challenges, they have experienced positive traffic trends, with 95% of stores open and 95% rent collection. Leasing momentum remains strong, with additions of notable brands like Tory Burch and Victoria's Secret. Tanger has a well-positioned balance sheet with over $680 million in liquidity and no significant debt maturities until 2023. They have also implemented cost-cutting measures, resulting in approximately $18 million in savings. Tanger is focused on rebuilding occupancy and anticipates pressure on rent spreads due to vacancies. They prioritize investments in portfolio growth, debt reduction, and selective growth opportunities. For 2021, Tanger expects core FFO per share between $1.47 and $1.57, assuming no further government-mandated shutdowns."
FUL_q1_2021.txt,"Our speakers are Jim Owens, H.B. Fuller President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Corkrean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
First, a reminder that our comments today will include references to organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues.
We believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist their understanding of our operating performance and how our results compare with other companies.
Unless otherwise specified, discussion of sales and revenue refers to organic revenues and discussion of EPS, margins or EBITDA refers to adjusted non-GAAP measures.
Many of these risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by COVID-19 and resulting deterioration of the global business and economic environment.
Last evening, we reported first quarter results, which built upon the momentum we saw in Q4 of last year.
Organic revenues this quarter were up 10.5%, adjusted EBITDA was up 30% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 was nearly doubled last year's first quarter.
The H.B. Fuller team gained share and reduced operating expense in each of our businesses in 2020, which created the momentum that is delivering exceptional financial performance to begin fiscal 2021.
Market innovation and exceptional service led to the share gains as H.B. Fuller solved customer problems faster than competition and growth accelerated as demand continued to strengthen in the first quarter.
As we reported last March, COVID-19 impacted our fiscal Q1 of 2020 only in China and by about $15 million in revenue, $4.5 million in EBITDA and $0.06 of EPS.
Excluding this impact, our revenues were up 8% organically, EBITDA was up 23% and earnings per share was up 65%, exceptional results.
H.B. Fuller works with our customers to solve their toughest adhesive problems.
In today's remote work environment, this means collaborating in new ways and delivering market-driven innovation faster than ever.
For example, we proactively developed and qualified new engineering adhesives for mobile devices, automotive, electronics, electronic vehicle batteries and solar panels to name just a few.
These innovations helped drive one of our strongest quarters for engineering adhesive sales growth.
We created technology and branding opportunities with the new line of GorillaPro MRO adhesives and there will be more H.B. Fuller marketing innovation in the year ahead.
We work with Hygiene, Health and Consumable customers to develop innovative applications and to ensure supply to meet high demand for their products.
As a result, we substantially grew our sales across the majority of our HHC end markets in the first quarter.
H.B. Fuller's revenue growth was also broad based geographically in the quarter with organic growth in all three of our geographic regions.
Importantly, our growth came with positive incremental margins driven by product mix, reduced expenses and structural efficiencies resulting from our business realignment last year.
EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points year-on-year.
Raw material cost increased from where we exited 2020, but we're still relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter and in line with our expectations.
Raw material cost going forward will increase at a faster rate than originally anticipated due to increased demand, reduced inventories and supply constraint.
Winter storm Uri in the Gulf Coast in February has created additional tightening in the United States and is impacting global supply.
Supply has become tight for commodity materials, which make up a smaller portion of our portfolio.
As the year progresses, this will also have an impact on the supply and pricing of the specialty materials, which make up the majority of our purchases.
Most suppliers have made good progress in recovering from Uri.
However, the rate of recovery going forward will mostly depend on the output rates of the impacted assets and the time it takes for supply chains and inventory levels to fully recover.
We have done a very good job of serving customers thus far by working closely to manage inventories and available materials.
Our contracted positions with our suppliers, backward integration of key polymers and global breadth have helped us manage the supply crisis thus far.
The breadth of our adhesive chemistry and the diversity of our raw materials has meant that no single material has had a large impact on us and has enabled us to help customers find alternatives when short supply exists.
The near-term disruptions we are navigating in the US are considerable, but they are temporary and supply is expected to normalize to a more balanced level in the coming months.
Our planning assumptions anticipate that the risk of supply disruption will lessen as we exit the second quarter and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our ability to meet demand.
However, we now expect year-on-year raw material inflation to be in the range of 5% to 8%.
H.B. Fuller has done a remarkable job in supporting customers through supply shortages and we also have implemented over $100 million in annualized price adjustments that are effective in Q2 and will enable us to continue to seamlessly serve our customers.
Some of these were effective on February 15, with most effective March 15 and April 1.
We are preparing for further price adjustments, if needed in Q3.
These price adjustments will fully offset the impact of raw material increases.
Now let me move on to discuss performance in each of our segments in the first quarter on Slide 4.
Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives' first quarter organic sales increased 7.6% year-over-year, continuing the strong performance trend in this business unit in 2020.
Sales increased versus last year across the majority of our HHC markets with strong growth in Packaging, Tissue & Towel and Tape & Label and good growth in hygiene in particular.
HHC segment EBITDA margin was strong at 13.3%, up 180 basis points, margin improved versus last year, reflecting volume leverage, restructuring benefits and good expense management.
Construction Adhesives' organic revenue was down 10% versus last year as winter storm Uri, extreme weather and material supply issues across much of the United States impacted construction activity as we started the year.
Construction Adhesives' EBITDA margin declined versus last year reflecting these issues.
Underlying operational improvements from the GBU restructuring were offset by lower volume and the impact of severe weather.
Uri temporarily disrupted operations at our construction adhesive facilities in Texas in February.
Both plants have now been fully up and running since early March.
Aside from these near-term impacts, demand for Construction Adhesives continues to be strong for residential builds and remodeling.
Demand has also begun to improve on the commercial roofing side.
We are planning for both top-line performance and margins to improve significantly over the rest of the year.
Engineering Adhesive results were extremely strong with organic revenue up 21% versus last year, reflecting share gains and improving end market demand.
Sales increased versus last year across the majority of our EA markets with the strongest growth in electronics and new energy.
We expect continued strength and double-digit full year growth in this segment.
Engineering Adhesives' EBITDA margins were strong at 15.4%, up 300 basis points compared with Q1 last year, reflecting strong volume leverage and good expense management.
Looking ahead at our full year results, our planning assumptions are that COVID-related shutdown impacts will remain but continue to decrease as vaccines are rolled out around the world.
We anticipate that many raw materials will be tied through the summer as supply chains normalize and demand continues to be strong.
We anticipate continued improvement in underlying demand in each of our business units, driving volume growth in 2021 versus 2020.
Growth in some end markets such as commercial construction and aerospace will improve at a slower pace and may not return to 2019 levels of activity this year.
While Engineering Adhesives demand is expected to moderate from first quarter levels, which reflect some pent-up demand, we expect end market demand will likely be strong for the entire year.
Overall, when considering our strategic pricing actions, coupled with the solid volume growth in HHC, improved performance in Construction Adhesives and strong demand in Engineering Adhesives, we now expect full year revenue growth of high single digits to low double-digits versus 2020.
I'll begin on Slide 5 with some additional financial details on the first quarter.
Net revenue was up 12.3% versus same period last year.
Currency had a positive impact of 1.8%.
Adjusting for currency, organic revenue was up 10.5% with volume accounting for all of the growth.
Pricing had a neutral impact year-on-year in the quarter.
Year-on-year adjusted gross profit margin was 26.7%, up 20 basis points versus last year, driven by the higher volume.
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expense was up 2.9% versus last year.
SG&A was down 170 basis points as a percentage of revenue, reflecting savings associated with our business reorganization, lower travel expense, general cost controls, offset by higher variable comp than last year.
Net other income increased by $3 million versus last year, driven primarily by increased income on pension assets.
Net interest expense declined by $2 million, reflecting lower debt balances.
The adjusted effective income tax rate in the quarter was 27.5%, up 180 basis points versus the adjusted tax rate in the first quarter last year, driven primarily by mix of income and tax related to the global cash strategies.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $101 million is 30% higher than the same period last year, driven by strong top-line growth, particularly in Engineering Adhesives, restructuring savings and good cost management, partially offset by higher variable compensation.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, up 94% versus the first quarter of last year, reflecting strong operating income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction.
Cash flow from operations in the quarter of $36 million was up from last year, reflecting strong income growth, partly offset by higher working capital requirements to support the strong top-line performance.
We continue to reduce debt paying down $16 million in the quarter compared to $6 million during the same period last year.
Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today and the planning assumptions that Jim laid out earlier, we anticipate revenue to be up high single-digits to low double-digits versus 2020 and EBITDA to be between $455 million and $475 million as continued strong volume growth and pricing actions offset higher raw material costs.
We expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $200 million of debt during 2021.
We were very pleased with our strong start in the first quarter, which follows a strong fourth quarter, both of which greatly outperformed predominantly non-COVID quarters from the prior year.
We are growing through our strategy of delivering sustainable innovation and high value solutions and we are in a great position to continue to grow our business as global economies continue to open up in 2021.
This year, we will focus on three critical priorities to profitably grow our business in a dynamic environment.
Our top priority is to drive continued volume growth as we support our customers success in the current high demand and supply constrained environment.
This means continued growth through innovation, leverage of remote servicing tools as a new standard and finding creative ways to address any raw material shortages we see in the coming months.
Our second imperative is to strategically manage pricing aligned to the value we deliver in this inflationary environment.
Our company has built pricing tools and in-depth training in anticipation of the day when material inflation returned.
And we are already executing with speed and precision to maintain and grow our business while pricing to value.
Our third priority, to help fuel our growth will be to release productive capacity through our operational excellence programs.
Our 2020 operations investment was centered on creating the operational discipline and metrics that enable more productivity per employee work hour.
In a low capital-intensive business like ours, this helps to reduce cost and increase capacity.
We will also deliver an additional $200 million of debt reduction in 2021, moving the company closer to our net debt target of 2 to 3 times EBITDA.
On our conference call a year ago in March of 2020, I told you that because of our extraordinary collaboration with customers, a robust global operations and supply chain and our unmatched expertise and adhesive innovation, I was confident that H.B. Fuller which strengthened its position in this industry, setting ourselves apart from competition and enabling us to grow as global economies recover.
I was confident that we would emerge as an even stronger company than prior to the pandemic.
Our stronger performance throughout 2020 and our exceptional results in the first quarter are proof that my confidence was well founded.
This company is built on an agile business model where people collaborate remotely with each other, with customers and with suppliers around the globe.
In a changing world, these attributes of agility, collaboration and flexibility have enabled H.B. Fuller to excel.
As working conditions changed, supply and demand fluctuated and as supply constraints emerged, the H.B. Fuller team has been first and fastest among adhesive companies at addressing challenges.
Growing the business this year in a period of economic recovery presents exciting opportunities and unique challenges.
In 2021, our business priorities are squarely focused on capturing share and managing inflation risks as we continue to build on our rising leadership position in the global adhesives industry.
Our culture of collaboration and innovation and our improving operational execution gives me confidence that we are strongly positioned to continue to deliver sustained value for our shareholders in 2021 and in the years ahead.
Operator, please open up the call so we can take some questions.
","H.B. Fuller reported exceptional first-quarter results, with organic revenue surging 10.5% and adjusted earnings per share nearly doubling to $0.66. The company attributed this growth to market innovation, exceptional service, and accelerated demand. Across its Hygiene, Health and Consumable, Construction Adhesives, and Engineering Adhesives segments, H.B. Fuller saw strong organic revenue increases in all regions, driven by product mix, reduced expenses, and structural efficiencies. Despite raw material cost increases, the company implemented price adjustments to offset the impact. H.B. Fuller anticipates high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth for the year, with EBITDA ranging from $455 million to $475 million. The company is focused on driving volume growth, strategically managing pricing, and increasing productive capacity to support its growth. Additionally, H.B. Fuller plans to pay down an additional $200 million of debt in 2021, bringing it closer to its target of 2-3 times EBITDA. The company remains confident in its ability to capture market share and deliver sustained value for shareholders in 2021 and beyond."
AN_q4_2021.txt,"Please ensure that your lines are muted until the operator announces your turn to ask a question.
Leading our call today will be Mike Manley, our chief executive officer; and Joe Lower, our chief financial officer.
I will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.
But as this is my first call, I was also trying to think about what may be helpful for me to touch on in addition to the financial results.
And I thought that, firstly, I'm going to give a brief overview of some of the things that I've been doing over the last three months.
And then I'm going to go through the highlights of the group's performance and hand over to Joe who will give you more of the fine detail.
After that, I'm going to touch on a number of the key topics I gained attention over the last few weeks.
And in closing, before our Q&A, I thought I may give a knock to the future, which will albeit just a summary of some of my preliminary observations.
So as you can imagine, when you join in the organization, particularly one that has a broad national footprint of retail locations and over 20,000 people in the field, you spend quite a lot of time traveling around the country.
And today, I have the opportunity to visit a number of our franchise dealerships, including our most recent acquisitions, many of our AutoNation USA stores, our auction sites and a number of our collision centers from coast to coast.
Now obviously, I knew from our previous life that AutoNation was the largest automotive retailer in the United States, and that it also begun to build additional brand businesses and capabilities at scale.
But I have to genuinely say that reading about it on paper actually doesn't do it justice to what has been built and the talent that the organization possesses, that could actually see, feel, and get a sense of by actually visiting the locations.
I think when you get the opportunity to travel to our dealerships and businesses, you really start to recognize the incredible assets that the group has been able to build, acquire and develop.
When I think about the 330 franchises in our dealerships, not only do the brands we represent account for 99% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S., but we're also fortunate to have a superbly balanced portfolio of the best automotive brands in the world.
And they are located in some of the most exciting franchise territories.
In addition to visiting our retail businesses, I've also met with a number of our OEM partners.
And I have to say, unfortunately, I haven't been able to get around all of them.
So for me, this is a big clear to do and finish list.
And I'm looking forward to meeting with our partners that I haven't met yet.
But I have to say the ones and have now been incredibly encouraged by our conversations.
We've had what I would consider very frank exchange of views.
And very importantly, I've been able to see the brand and the product plans for the future.
And for me, just makes representative fantastic brands even more exciting when you understand what's actually coming through the pipeline.
Now obviously, our franchise dealerships is an important core part of our group, and our scale gives us significant opportunities.
But it's also clear that we're also developing businesses and platforms that will significantly expand our reach, and I think give us the opportunity to take advantage of things as they unveil in the future.
As you know, we're building a strong focus used car brand with AutoNation USA.
And as Joe will tell you in a minute, all of the stores we have, including those added in 2021, are up and running.
They're profitable, ahead of our expectations, and adding happy customers to our growing family on a daily basis.
And finally, and I think this is really important, the one thing you really do get a true feel of once you're on the inside on a day-to-day basis is the quality and the passion of the AutoNation team.
It doesn't matter where I've been, either in our dealerships, our collision centers and our corporate office, I think there's really a clear will to win and a customer and community-focused culture.
So on this point, as a reality check, I do have to say I've never heard an incoming CEO say anything bad about the team he or she walked into.
Certainly, not at least on the first.
But and you know doubt probably expected me to complement our people.
But my comment actually goes well beyond platitudes.
Because you can imagine, our strong performance, how pleased I am with the team's delivery of the seventh consecutive record quarter.
And I think we have to remember, this is still delivered during very unusual times, with significant disruption from lack of supply, winter COVID spikes and competition everywhere.
And my comments actually go beyond that.
They're made as much for the performance the team delivered as they are for the less visible selfless work they do in our communities and the fight against cancer.
AutoNation's Drive Pink campaign was a true revelation to me.
Not in the center, an organization was involved in social and community projects or charity works, because actually, I think that's what organizations are supposed to do.
But I was amazed to see just how many of our associates get involved on their own time to support Drive Pink and drive out cancer.
Today, the people of AutoNation have raised over $30 million, which has been plowed into research, treatment and care.
Now that is a team that I can tell you, I'm already very proud of.
So just give you a brief flavor of my first three months, and now I'm going to turn to our results.
So you've seen from the numbers, we delivered another outstanding quarter and a very strong year.
And today, as I already mentioned, we report our seventh consecutive record quarterly results with adjusted earnings per share of $5.76, which is an increase of $137, and revenue increasing by $797 million or 14% compared to the prior year.
Now this was driven by robust growth in used vehicle sales, consumer finance services and aftersales.
Total units for the quarter declined by 1%.
And that was driven by new vehicle sales, down 20%, which was largely offset by an increase in 21% of used vehicle volume compared to the prior year.
And with strong consumer demand, we continue to focus on our sourcing capabilities to used vehicles, which further strengthened both our franchise dealerships and our AutoNation USA businesses.
When I look at that, nearly 90% of all pre-owned vehicles retailed in the quarter were self-sourced prior acquisition strategy, which obviously includes all of the trade-ins, but now increasingly, our we buy your car program, which processes directly from customers.
And as a result, used vehicle revenue increased 55% for the quarter.
Now as I previously mentioned, AutoNation USA is a successful part of our plan.
And in November, we opened AutoNation USA Avondale and Phoenix and recently entered the new market with our 10 AutoNation store, USA store in Charlotte.
Now each new store opened in 2021 has exceeded expectation, and as I said, profitable in the first four months of operation.
And we remain on target to open 12 additional new stores over the next 12 months.
I think our focus on margin expense control significantly contributed to our performance as strong new used finance and insurance margin per unit, up significantly year over year and in the quarter, and continued our improvement in our after sales business, which delivered an 11% increase in gross profit.
I know it's been discussed over, the ongoing expense control, something which, frankly, I consider structural in the business now helped contribute to an overall increase in total store profits by over 150%.
Now with that, I'm going to hand you over to Joe, who's going to take you through the detail of the financials.
Today, we reported fourth quarter total revenue of $6.6 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, driven by impressive growth in used vehicles of 55% as well as double-digit growth in both customer financial services and aftersales.
This was partially offset by a 7% decline in new vehicle revenue due to the continuing supply chain disruption to new vehicles production.
Strong consumer demand and tight new vehicle inventories continued to support new vehicle margins in the fourth quarter.
We expect demand to continue to achieve supply well into 2022.
In addition, many consumers have shifted to used vehicles due to limited availability of new, which has been very beneficial as we continue to demonstrate exceptional growth, supported by our self-sourcing capabilities and ongoing expansion of our AutoNation USA footprint.
For the quarter, total variable gross profit increased 49% year over year, driven primarily by an increased total variable PBR of $2,026 or 50% increase, with a slight decline in total units of 1%.
As Mike mentioned, 21% growth in used units year over year largely offset a 20% decline in new units over the same period.
We also demonstrated strong growth in aftersales gross profit, which increased 11% year over year.
Taken together, our total gross profit increased 34% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 56.7%, a 710 basis point improvement compared to the year ago period.
As measured against gross profit on an adjusted basis, our metrics improved across all key categories, with overheads decreasing 370 basis points, compensation decreasing 230 basis points and advertising decreasing 110 basis points year over year.
Longer term, we expect normalized SG&A to gross profit to be in the mid-60% range, well below our pre-pandemic levels that were consistently above 70%.
This improvement is the result of structural changes that we have made to our business model.
Floor plan interest expense decreased to $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to lower average floor plan balances.
Combined with the lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, we reported adjusted net income of $380 million or $5.76 per share, a 130% increase year over year.
This results our seventh consecutive all-time high full earnings per share result.
Our strong operating performance and cash flow generation continue to provide us a significant capacity to deploy capital.
During the fourth quarter, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Priority 1 Automotive Group, adding $420 million in annual revenue.
We remain focused on identifying additional acquisitions that allow us to expand our current portfolio and offer attractive long-term financial returns.
As Mike discussed, we continue to see a tremendous opportunity to capture a larger share of the used vehicle market by leveraging our sourcing capabilities, rich data analytics and AutoNation USA growth strategy.
We recently opened our 10th AutoNation USA store in Chile, North Carolina and expect to open 12 more stores over the next 12 months.
Longer term, we continue to target over 130 stores by the end of 2026.
We also continued to repurchase our own shares.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $382 million.
This represents a 5% in shares outstanding from the end of the third quarter.
The company has approximately $776 million available for additional share repurchase at this time.
As of February 15, there were approximately 62 million shares outstanding.
We ended the fourth quarter with total liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion.
And our covenant leverage ratio of debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5 times remains well below our historical range of two to three times.
Looking ahead, we will continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash flows to invest in our business and drive long-term shareholder value.
So strong results, as you can see.
And again, congratulations to all of the AutoNation team, and their delivery is fantastic.
So I do just want to add a couple of points I think are important.
When I step back and think about the business and our results, I look to understand which of the key profit drivers are, let's say, circumstantial to varying degrees and which are the drivers are now structurally embedded in the group.
And I think this is important because it's clear to me that some are mistakenly discounting all of the improvements in performance is totally temporary.
And they're preferring to rely on 2019 as a more reliable baseline.
And I think this is wrong.
Because now, you can see there are clearly structural improvements that should translate into long-term value.
So the business drivers that I consider in that category are improvements in F&I performance, which is more driven by a focus on product penetration rather than rate, by used volume, which is more related to sales effectiveness, operational focus as well as additional USA stores, and finally, the SG&A control that Joe just mentioned again.
And we can clearly see the benefits of that coming through in our net income margin.
And in my view, we should continue to translate into value and not be so quickly discounted as situational at this time.
So obviously, that leads one of the biggest variables, which is clearly new vehicle margin.
And naturally, there's a lot of debate where this may go in the future.
And I remember in my previous life, on quarterly discussions on calls like this, we spent a lot of time talking about breakeven points and what level of SAAR can you still make a profit or level of SAAR can't you make a profit.
And if you look at the fourth quarter, we delivered a SAAR around that $13 million from my estimate, well below anyone would have been able to forecast.
And the levels of profitability for both OEMs and dealers clearly show the benefits of selling vehicles at MSRP.
And what a concept, right, selling at MSRP.
So if that's the learning, I think, has got to do that.
By the way, while we're on the subject of retail price, we've seen a number of comments about vehicles being sold above MSRP, quoting the potential adverse impacts on brands and customers, which I understand.
And by the way, last year, less than 2% of all the new vehicles sold by AutoNation were above MSRP.
But this discussion on MSRP branded customers actually also adds to my optimism regarding new vehicle margins going forward.
Because I think it's equally clear that significant discounting and high incentives can also damage a brand, which is another reason for our industry to balance appropriately supply and demand, and another reason why we may expect higher new vehicle margins than we have historically seen pre-COVID.
So finally, let me briefly turn to the future.
I think everybody recognizes the industry will go through a significant transformation.
And that's not just in terms of product and powertrain, but in many other ways as well.
When COVID is behind us, we'll see the emergence of additional mobility models and choices.
We'll see changes in the way customers approach vehicle ownership and usage.
And we will progressively see changes in how dealers and OEMs are traditionally competed.
And for me, this is an exciting time and offers many more opportunities and downsides.
And now I'm more convinced than ever, having seen under the hood of AutoNation, that the group can be well placed and positioned to continue to grow and thrive.
AutoNation in the past has been known for its innovation and progressive approach.
And you can be certain we're going to be taking this approach to the next level.
As we see it today, we have over 11 million customers in our family already, and every year, an additional three million interactions.
So we have the opportunity not only to leverage our brand, our scale, our strong bricks and mortar footprint, but also to build on our growing digital capabilities and expand our business model to ensure we have greater autonomy and control in our future.
So obviously, a lot more to come in the coming months.
But I'd like to make one announcement that will help indicate some of what the future may hold for AutoNation.
And that is, I'm now creating a new executive role.
And I'm delighted to announce Gianluca Camplone will be joining the group from March 1 and assuming the position of EVP, head of mobility, business development and strategy, and COO of Precision Parts.
This role will report directly to me.
Gianluca will sit on our executive committee.
And I'm sure several of you will already know Gianluca Camplone.
But for those who do not know him, he joined AutoNation from McKinsey, where he was most recently serving as senior partner and leader of the advanced industry global practice and private equity industrial practice in North America.
Gianluca orchestrated a companywide $1 billion digital business building program.
And he spearheaded a global team on multiple billion-dollar mergers in the automotive sector.
He's led a major dealer performance transformation at a leading North American commercial vehicle manufacturer.
And in addition, very relevantly, he redesigned the multibillion dollar used car business and multichannel environment for a global auto manufacturer.
So as you can tell, I'm incredibly excited about the future.
I'm absolutely delighted that Gianluca has agreed to join our executive team.
And I think, as you can tell, it bodes well for some of the things that I'm certain AutoNation and we can do that not only will give us a great future, but as I said, give us a lot more autonomy and control over where we're going.
So let me close.
I think demand for vehicles continues to be strong.
Used vehicle growth is robust.
And the -- we are going to continue, as Joe said, AutoNation USA store expansion.
And obviously, we're going to look aggressively opportunities to expand our customer-centric personal transportation solutions.
","In Q4, AutoNation reported strong financial results, with revenue increasing by 14% to $6.6 billion. This growth was driven by a 55% increase in used vehicle revenue and double-digit gains in customer financial services and aftersales. Despite a 20% decline in new vehicle sales due to supply chain issues, used vehicle sales grew by 21%, leading to a 130% increase in adjusted net income to $5.76 per share. The company's strong financial performance is attributed to improved margins, expense control, and the success of its AutoNation USA used car business. With over $1.5 billion in liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times, AutoNation has ample capital to invest in growth opportunities. The company's management is optimistic about the future, recognizing the industry's transformation and the opportunities it presents. To drive innovation and expansion, AutoNation has created a new executive role, appointing Gianluca Camplone as EVP, head of Mobility, Business Development and Strategy, and COO of Precision Parts. The company remains committed to leveraging its brand, scale, and digital capabilities to grow its customer base and expand its mobility solutions."
FE_q1_2021.txt,"We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Participants in today's call include our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Vice Chairperson and Executive Director, John Somerhalder.
We will also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.
Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which is in the upper end of our guidance range.
As Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather-adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses.
Last month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors.
I greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me, since I was named President last May and Acting CEO in October.
I have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities.
It's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success.
As we work to move FirstEnergy forward, my priorities are the continued safety of our employees and customers.
Ensuring that ethics, accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program.
Executing FE forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential, deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers.
During today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments.
John Somerhalder will join us for an update on the Board and management's work toward instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity.
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations.
We have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement.
We can't currently predict the timing, outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ.
Our goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review.
This approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy.
For example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s.
We've paused all other political disbursements, including from our political action committee.
And we have limited our participation in the political process.
We have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships.
In addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency.
For example, we have committed to post updates on our website, on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our corporate political activity policy, which is under revision.
A comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity.
In Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty, affecting our utilities in the state.
This includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million.
This comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law plus interest, the partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers.
Together, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers.
These are important steps to put this matter behind us.
In other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case to provide perspective SEET values on an individual company basis.
We are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 SEET cases that were consolidated into this proceeding.
During our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments.
Those conversations are under way in each effective jurisdiction.
In Ohio at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of Rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments.
Outside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate.
For example, on March 1, JCP&L, filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities seeking approval for its proposed EV driven program.
If approved, the four-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory, in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers.
And in late March the Pennsylvania PUC approved our five-year $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets.
In March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump-storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million.
And we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local co-op.
The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers.
During our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our companywide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry leader delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns.
We expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid, while also maintaining affordable electric bills.
During the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve.
While our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes, take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees.
We've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter.
Examples of this work include, improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers, leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs, using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self service options and improve their experience and leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms.
As part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer focused strategic priorities.
We will also remain focused on emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure and our customers' evolving energy needs as we think through how to reduce our carbon footprint.
We're off to a great start this year, and yesterday we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
Our leadership team is committed to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing on our proven strategies as we put our customers at the center of everything we do.
We will take the appropriate steps to deliver on our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, the investment community, regulators and our employees.
It's a privilege and a pleasure to join you today.
I'd like to start by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after almost two months in this role.
This is a company with a firm foundation, including a commitment to improve in the area of governance and compliance, our commitment to customers by embracing innovation and technology to help ensure the strength, resilience and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deep seeded and strong safety culture and a strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer focused growth.
Since joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions and enhancing our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community.
Steve spoke about our business priorities.
So, I will focus my remarks today on our compliance work including remedial actions.
First, I'd like to update you on our internal investigation which has rebuild no new material issues since our last earnings call.
The focus of the internal investigation has transitioned from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with the ongoing government investigations.
Management and the Board with the assistance of the compliance subcommittee of the Audit Committee, have been working together to build a best-in-class compliance program.
Through these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in five broad categories, including governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management and third-party management.
As part of these efforts FirstEnergy is embracing a commitment to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class.
Some of the actions completed to date include hiring, our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park in January; Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week; and myself.
On the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno, joined us from Icahn Capital in March.
And the Board has nominated a new Independent Member, Melvin Williams for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month.
I believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to round out a very committed and confident Board and management team.
In March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by naming him CEO.
Steve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills, strategic acumen and deep knowledge of our businesses needed to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability.
These changes along with the Board's reinforcement of the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top or support a culture of compliance going forward.
For instance, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders, regarding the expectations to act with integrity, in everything we do.
Our legal department recently completed training on up the ladder reporting and we have enhanced our on-boarding process for new employees and for third-parties on expectations around our code of business conduct.
Over the course of the next few months, there will be many more steps the company will take to enhance our compliance program such as, continuing to build the new more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership; addressing our processes, policies and controls, which include additional oversight for political contributions; continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees, incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees regardless of title to the same standards; enhancing the channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct; and insuring increased communications with and training of employees with respect to our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures; compliance requirements; our code of business conduct; and other company policies; and understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or code of business conduct.
We have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals, targeted reviews of any suspicious payments and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company.
Additionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed.
A detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter FactBook.
Over the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, where it will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management steering committee for Ethics and Compliance.
Through these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings.
Our leaders are continuing to elevate the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics are core values, just like safety.
We are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and are comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear precautions.
By continually emphasizing the importance of compliance to our strategies and future as well as demonstrating that we are setting the right tone at the top, we strive to bolster confidence among our employees that the management team and the Board are taking the proper decisive actions to move the company forward.
I believe we have learned a lot from recent challenges and are taking the right actions to emerge as a better, stronger company with a bright future.
Now I'll turn the floor over to Jon Taylor for a review of first quarter results and the financial update.
We have provided new disclosures in three main areas within our Investor FactBook.
Our steps to support a cleaner, smarter grid and the movement to more green and renewable resources, additional disclosures on our balance sheet, including our funds from operations target and the steps we're taking to achieve our goals and third, enhanced ESG disclosures.
Also note that we continue to provide more robust disclosures on ROEs including more granular sensitivities.
Yesterday we announced GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range.
GAAP results for 2021 include two special items, regulatory charges related to customer refunds associated with previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues and expenses associated with the investigation.
In our distribution business our results for the first quarter of this year as compared to 2020 reflect higher residential usage on both in actual and weather-adjusted basis as well as growth from incremental riders and rate increases, including DCR and grid modernization in Ohio, the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey.
These drivers were partially offset by $0.10 per share related to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forgo the collection of lost distribution revenues from our residential and commercial customers.
Our total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 2% on a weather-adjusted basis as compared to the last year, reflecting an increase in residential sales of 2% as customers continue to spend more time at home in the first quarter of 2021, a decline of 7% in commercial sales and in our industrial class first quarter low decreased 3%.
It's worth noting that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter are consistent with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher versus our forecast, while industrial load is down 2%.
In our regulated transmission business earnings decreased as a result of higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest, partially offset by the impact of rate base growth at our ATSI and MAIT subsidiaries.
Finally, in our corporate segment, results reflect lower operating expenses, offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 pension OPEB credit, related to energy harbors emergence from bankruptcy as well as higher interest expense.
We are off to a solid start for the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021.
We've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share.
In addition, our strong focus on cash helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and a $185 million increase in free cash flow versus our internal plan for the first quarter.
As to a couple of other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on track.
In March FirstEnergy transmission issued $500 million in senior notes and a strong well supported bond offering that showcase the strength of our transmission business.
The deal was oversubscribed and on par with an investment grade offering.
We used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility.
In addition, we repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy Holding Company.
We also successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at MonPower in April, that was also very well supported.
This supports our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings as well as our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintain the strong credit ratings at our utilities.
We continue to provide the rating agencies with regular updates on our business and we are working with them to develop a clear outline of what is needed to return FirstEnergy to investment grade credit ratings.
Key milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation and solid credit metrics.
As to more longer term financing needs through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023, mainly at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies.
Additionally, as we have previously mentioned, equity is an important part of our overall financing plan, with plans to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023.
As we said previously, we'll flex these plans as needed and we are also exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more value enhancing to all stakeholders.
These actions combined with new rates at JCP&L and our 60% plus formula rate capital investment program will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow each year, while maintaining relatively flat adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range.
Turning to our pension.
Our funding status was 81% at March 31, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulting in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies.
The extended funding timeframe permitted under the American Rescue plan, together with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules means that we do not expect any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets.
Although, we plan to make contributions into the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we assess our capital allocation plans.
As Steve mentioned discussions have begun with the Department of Justice.
While no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we believe that it is probable we will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this investigation.
However, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount.
Finally last month President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax as well as potential opportunities related to proposed infusion into the electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid.
Clearly, it's very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form.
Our solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems.
As we move our company forward, we are laser focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers and employees.
Now, let's open the call to your Q&A.
","FirstEnergy reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, within the guidance range. Strong residential load, rate increases, and operational efficiency contributed to the results, partially offset by lost revenue from discontinued decoupling. The company is committed to enhancing compliance, with key actions including hiring a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, strengthening governance, and improving internal controls. Despite investigations, FirstEnergy remains optimistic about its future, emphasizing its focus on safety, ethical behavior, and innovation. The company reaffirms its 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and anticipates a $150-$200 million annual cash flow increase through 2023. FirstEnergy's progress in pension funding and debt reduction will support its goal of returning to investment grade credit ratings."
