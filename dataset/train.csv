Earnings Call Transcript:
 Also on the call are Brian McDade, chief financial officer; and Adam Reuille, chief accounting officer.
As all of us know, 2020 was a difficult year for all of those affected by COVID-19, including our company.
Even with the unprecedented operating environment, we accomplished a great deal.
We earned $9.11 per diluted share and funds from operation for the full year, which includes a $0.06 per share dilution from our recent equity offering in November.
We generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow.
We acquired an 80% interest in the Taubman Realty Group, made strategic investments in several widely recognized retail brands at attractive valuations and have already made significant progress in repositioning each brand and increasing their operating cash flow.
We raised over $13 billion in debt and equity markets; opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others, completed three domestic redevelopments; abated rent for thousands of small and local businesses, regional entrepreneurs and restaurateurs who, frankly, needed our help to survive; paid $700 million in real estate taxes which, unbelievably, was an increase from 2019 despite losing approximately 13,500 shopping days in our domestic portfolio during the year due to the restrictive governmental orders placed upon us, and that's roughly 20% of the whole year to put in perspective; and we returned $2 billion in cash to our shareholders in dividends.
These results and, frankly, these accomplishments are a testament to the entire team, Simon team, for the resilience, relentless focus on operations and cost structure and the safety of the communities we serve and, obviously, focused on giving back to the communities in terms of what we did from an abatement and real estate tax point of view.
Now let's go to the fourth quarter, and then we're going to turn the page.
Fourth-quarter FFO was $787 million.
That's $2.17 per share.
Obviously, that was affected by the dilution of our equity offering that I mentioned.
I'm pleased that -- to report that with the solid profitability and the $900 million in operating cash flow we generated within the fourth quarter, our domestic international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately a net $0.95 per diluted share, primarily due to the reduced lease income, including sales-based rents and other property revenues caused by COVID-19 disruption and $0.06 also from the international operations due to various restrictions placed upon those properties.
Collection from our U.S. retail portfolio continued to improve.
As of last week, we have collected 90% of our net billed rents for the second, third and fourth quarters combined.
We made significant progress in the fourth quarter in addressing previously unresolved amounts with certain large tenants.
We still, even to this day, have a handful of large tenants, unfortunately, who have yet to resolve their receivables.
And we are hopeful that -- and we anticipate resolving those, certainly, in the next few weeks.
Again, to remind you, these are on a gross basis and not a company share.
Last year, our NOI was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.
This year, it's $1.2 billion.
That's a decrease of 23.9% or approximately $380 million.
And here are the components of the decline: $220 million in aggregate from domestic rent abatements and higher uncollectible rents, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies.
And this is an important reminder, we do not amortize any of the abatements.
Even though through FASB, you could, we chose to write those off in the period that they were granted.
And hence, they affect our lease income in the period that we decided to go ahead and grant the abatement.
Approximately $205 million from lower minimum rents reimbursement, short-term leasing, ancillary property revenues and terminations associated with bankruptcy tenants and lower sales volume due to COVID-19 disruption, obviously, lots of government restrictions o...
...lion, divide it by $330 million to get a sense of our return on investment.
Now I want to remind everyone that we do not add back the depreciation associated with these retailer investments to our FFO because it's not real property.
So the contribution of that from an earnings point of view will, obviously, be much less.
But the EBITDA is the EBITDA.
So the other point to make in these retail investments is all of these brands generate $3.5 billion in digital sales.
$3.5 billion in digital sales.
And all we have to do is look at how e-commerce brands are being valued today, and I think you could all conclude, we hope you do, that we've been making some wise investments here.
Now with respect to Taubman, I'm very pleased to have completed the transaction for 80% TRG and their premier retail portfolio, asset portfolio.
Our teams have worked -- started working together.
And we are off to a very productive, good spirited start.
I really do look forward to the partnership and growth inherent in the portfolio, and I think we'll all work very well together.
As many of you know, we recently filed an S-1 with the SEC to raise $300 million in a Simon-sponsored special purpose acquisition corporation, i.e., SPAC.
We are currently in a quiet period for the filing and are unable to speak to it, about the proposed offering, at this time.
We've been very active in the debt and equity capital markets, raising $13 billion in the last 12 or so months and, just some highlights, amended and extended our credit facility with a $6 billion facility that included a $2 billion term loan, which was used to fund the Taubman transaction; issued $3.5 billion of senior notes including the recent $1.5 billion offering in January, addressing all of our 21 unsecured maturities and, obviously, before the treasury really moved up; we completed 15 secured loan financings -- refinancings for $2 billion; and again, in November, we completed a common stock issuance of 22 million shares for $1.56 billion.
The term loan funded the Taubman deal, and our net debt was flat compared to last year, exclusive of the properties that we added with the Taubman transaction and the term loan drawdown.
Fourth quarter, we ended our liquidity with $8.2 billion, consisting of about $1.5 billion of cash, including our share of joint venture and $6.7 billion of available credit facility.
This is net of $623 million of commercial paper outstanding at quarter end.
Dividend, we paid our fourth-quarter dividend of $1.30 per share, which is $6 in total for the year.
We paid more than $2 billion in 2020.
We're up to over $34 billion in dividends of our history as a public company.
And we're really proud that we paid the cash dividend when many of our other companies are either suspended or completely eliminated or dramatically reduced their dividend.
Now, finally, let's move on to 2021 because I do, frankly, want to turn the page on 2020 as I'm sure we all -- as you all do.
We feel confident we've turned the corner.
We expect growth in cash flow and earnings.
In 2021, our guidance is $9.50 to $9.75 per share.
This range, it includes approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share from our retailer investments.
Again, keep in mind that we can't add back -- or we don't add back depreciation for those investments.
That's a growth range of 4.3% to 7%, compared to our full year of $9.11.
And just no more -- our diluted share count will be 376.
No significant acquisition or disposition activity and no further government mandate shutdown of our domestic retail properties is in that guidance.
As you know, we are dealing with certain shutdowns in Europe as we speak.
So let me just conclude, one heck of a year.
Let's not repeat it in any stretch of our imagination.
Let's turn the corner.
In a very tough environment, we've dealt with just basically about everything.
And everyone out there, be well.
And we're ready for any and all questions, though I'm sure people want to go home and warm up because it's cold.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Actual results may differ materially from those made or implied in such statements, which speak only of date they are made and which we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise.
Our Chairman and CEO, Clarence Smith will now give you an update on our results.
And then, our President, Steve Burdette will provide additional commentary about our business.
We're very pleased with the record results for the second quarter with sales of $250 million.
We've done a good job in our expense controls across the board, and combined with pricing disciplines from the merchandising teams and stores, we achieved solid gross margins and 11.7% pre-tax operating profits.
Our ongoing objectives are to grow market share in our existing distribution footprint and maintain double-digit operating margins.
We believe that the increased importance of home that was jump-started with the impact of COVID last spring is a longer-term trend.
While we don't expect the rush that impacted our industry to be at the elevated levels we experienced in recent quarters, we do believe that home is a priority and a sustainable trend for the near future.
The strong desire for homeownership, combined with Havertys strong positioning in Florida, Texas and the Southeast, puts us in an ideal position for today and for the future.
Our supply merchandising and distribution teams are working with our factories and shippers to bring in product to fill orders and reduce our record backlog.
The shipping challenges that home-related industries are experiencing have caused major delays for furniture, which we believe will be problems until the spring of 2022.
We are working to increase our inventories as the production and product flow improves.
We're investing in our distribution capacity to support growth over $1 billion over our regions.
We just completed additional racking to our mothership, the Eastern Distribution Center in Braselton, Georgia, which adds 20% more storage capacity.
We will evaluate potential expansions to our network to better serve our planned growth.
Our current focus is on building market share in our key markets with store positioning and target marketing to our core customer and new homeowners.
Examples of this were the opening of Myrtle Beach earlier this year, the opening of a third store in Austin, in the fast-growing Pflugerville, Round Rock markets and a store opening tomorrow in the villages in Central Florida.
We're in a deep dive reviewing potential locations in our best markets, which will reach the fastest-growing areas and leverage our existing infrastructure.
We expect to announce several new fill-in locations for the 2022 openings.
We're very excited about the rollout of the WE FURNISH HAPPINESS marketing campaign, which we believe more clearly separates Havertys from our competitors and continues to raise the bar on service, quality, furniture and design.
We continue to be focused on our front door, havertys.com.
We've committed to significant investments in IT and state-of-the-art systems to better reach and appeal to our customers.
We've contracted with Adobe to bring on a collection of applications and services that will lay the foundation for unmatched customer experience.
The new foundation will improve functionality, help us create content easier and faster, provide better personalizations using AI-driven automation and enhance our analytics and reporting.
Our goal is to have the best-in-class website experience.
I'm very excited with our results for the second quarter.
This performance was due to the commitment, passion and determination of the store, distribution, home delivery, service and home office teams, whom I want to congratulate personally for their efforts.
Our supply chain network has been able to increase the flow of products into our warehouses over the second quarter even with all the headwinds.
Container capacity continues to be under pressure with the continued increase in demand across all of retail.
We ex...
...rofit margin increased 240 basis points from 54.2% to 56.6% due to better merchandising, pricing and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.
These improvements were partially offset by an increase in our LIFO reserve as we continue to see increased freight and product cost.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39.8 million or 54.7% to $112.4 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.
However, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined over 2,000 basis points to 45% from 66.1%.
As demonstrated in the past three quarters, our financial model has substantial operating leverage at these sales levels.
Other income in the second quarter of 2020 was $31.8 million, which included the gain on the sale-leaseback transaction of three distribution facilities in 2020.
If you recall, the gross proceeds from the sale was approximately $70 million.
Income before income taxes increased $10.5 million to $29.2 million.
Our tax expense was $6.3 million during the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.6%.
The primary difference in the effective rate and statutory rate is due to the state income taxes and the tax benefit from vested stock awards.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $22.9 million or $1.21 per diluted share on our common stock compared to net income of $13.6 million or $0.72 per share in the comparable period last year.
Excluding the gain on the sale of our distribution assets in 2020, our adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of last year was a $0.52 loss.
Now, turning to our balance sheet.
At the end of the second quarter, our inventories were $115 million, which was up $25 million from the December 31, 2020 balance, and up $10.2 million versus the second quarter of 2020.
At the end of the second quarter, our customer deposits were $116.1 million, which was up $29.9 million from the December 31st balance and up $58.5 million versus Q2 of 2020.
We ended the quarter with $235.3 million of cash, cash equivalents.
We have no funded debt on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter of 2021.
Looking at some of our uses of cash flow, capital expenditures were $10.9 million for the first half of 2021, and we paid $8.6 million of regular dividends during the first half of 2021.
During the second quarter, we did not purchase any common shares in our buyback program, and we have $16.8 million remaining under current authorization for this buyback program.
We expect our gross margins for 2021 to be 56.5% to 56.8%.
We anticipate gross profit margins will be impacted by our current estimates of product and freight cost and changes in our LIFO reserve.
Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $275 million to $278 million range.
This is an increase over our previous estimate, primarily due to rising warehouse compensation and benefit cost.
The variable type costs within SG&A for 2021 are expected to be in the range of 17.3% to 17.5%, a slight decrease over our previous guidance.
Our planned capex for 2021 has increased from $23 million to $37 million.
Anticipated new or replacement stores, remodels and expansions account for $18.7 million.
Investments in our distribution network are expected to be $15.2 million, and investments in our information technology are expected to be approximately $3.1 million.
The largest increase in our planned capex for 2021 is in our distribution network.
In the third quarter of this year, we will be buying back our Virginia warehouse, which we sold and leased back last year.
This is a key distribution asset that may be expanded in the upcoming years.
Owning this asset gives us more flexibility as we evaluate our future growth plans.
Our anticipated effective tax rate in 2021 is expected to be 24%.
This projection excludes the impact from vesting of stock awards and any potential new tax legislation.
This completes our commentary on the second quarter financial results.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On our call today, we have Andy Rose, Worthington's president, and chief executive officer; and Joe Hayek, Worthington's chief financial officer.
Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later on our worthingtonindustries.com website.
Our teams executed very well in the quarter, and the result was a strong financial performance.
For Q3, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share versus $1.27 in the prior-year quarter.
Excluding a small restructuring and impairment charge, we generated $1.13 in the quarter versus $1.36 in the prior year, after adjusting for restructuring and a small gain on our investment in Nikola.
In the quarter, we had inventory holding losses estimated to be $25 million or $0.37 per share.
In the prior-year quarter, we had inventory hoarding gains of $31 million or $0.44 per share.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.4 billion were up significantly compared to $759 million in Q3 of last year.
The increase in sales was primarily due to higher steel prices, the inclusion of our most recent acquisitions, and higher average selling prices in both consumer and building products.
Gross profit for the quarter decreased to $143 million from $164 million in the prior-year quarter, and gross margin was 10.4% versus 21.6%, primarily due to the swing from inventory holding gains to losses, which were partially offset by increases in both consumer, and building products.
Adjusted EBIT in Q3 was $112 million, down slightly from $126 million in Q3 of last year, and our trailing 12 months adjusted EBIT is now $662 million.
And I spend a few minutes on each of the businesses, In steel processing, net sales of $1.1 billion more than doubled from $504 million in Q3 of last year, are mainly due to the average selling prices being higher, and the inclusion of both Tempel Steel and Shiloh BlankLight business.
Total ship tons were down 2% compared to last year's third quarter despite the recent acquisitions which contributed 80,000 tons during the quarter.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, total ship tons were down 9% year over year.
Direct tons in Q3 were 51% in mix compared to 48% in the prior year.
Despite the decrease in ship tons, underlying demand during the quarter was healthy.
Volumes were impacted by COVID-related production challenges, last shipping days due to weather, the US Canada bridge closings, and the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage that continues to impact automotive schedules.
Automotive volume increased from the prior-year quarter, but demand was below seasonal norms and is still difficult to predict as production levels demands remain choppy.
Construction demand continued to be solid, but our volumes decreased slightly from the prior year, as we had reserved some capacity for automotive demand that did not materialize.
And market demand is good, and the war in Ukraine, and its impacts on the steel supply chain pricing, and end-market demand are difficult to predict.
Our teams are best in class and continue to navigate market volatility, and supply chain challenges exceptionally well as they remain focused on taking care of each other, their customers, and our partners.
In Q3, steel generated an adjusted EBIT of $7 million compared to $62 million last year.
Large year-over-year decrease was driven by the inventory holding losses I mentioned earlier, estimated to be $25 million in the quarter compared to inventory holding gains of $31 million last year.
An unfavorable swing of $56 million.
Inventory holding losses for the current quarter included a $16 million charge to write inventory down to net realizable value, and to the expected future decline of steel prices at year-end, at quarter-end.
Steel prices have since risen, but based on current steel prices, we believe we will have higher inventory hoarding losses in Q4 than we did in Q3.
In consumer products, net sales in Q3 were $162 million, up 41% from $115 million in the prior year.
The increase was driven by higher a...
...wer steel prices, which added $49 million cash flow.
During the quarter, we received $29 million in dividends from our unconsolidated JVs', spend $270 million on the acquisition of Tempel, invested $24 million in capital projects, paid $14 million in dividends, and spent $54 million to repurchase a million shares of our common stock at an average price of $54.26.
Following the Q3 purchases, we have slightly over $7 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
Looking at our balance sheet and liquidity position.
Funded debt at quarter end of $813 million increased $111 million sequentially, primarily to fund the acquisition of Tempel.
Interest expense of $8 million was up slightly due to higher average debt levels, and we ended Q3 with $44 million in cash and $396 million available under our revolving credit facility.
Yesterday, the board declared a $0.28 per share dividend for the quarter, which is payable in June of 2022.
We had another very good quarter despite the continuation of a difficult operating environment and the emergence of inventory holding loss headwinds.
I'm not surprised, but continue to be humbled, and grateful for the commitment of our employees to doing what it takes to deliver for our customers.
And market demand remains strong across most of our product lines.
But operating challenges remain, including labor availability, supply chain disruptions, transportation shortages, and an extremely volatile steel pricing environment.
Our commercial purchasing and supply chain teams have done an excellent job reacting quickly, and effectively to higher input costs by passing through price increases as appropriate.
Our experts in steel processing continue to prove that they are world-class at managing through this volatility without compromising customer quality and service.
The benefit of higher selling prices was particularly noticeable in the year-over-year improvement in consumer products, in building products this quarter.
ClarkDietrich had another strong quarter, and an exceptional calendar year, but we expect their business to gradually return to more normalized levels in 2022.
Sustainable Energy Solutions' are struggling due to lower automotive demand in Europe, and higher input costs.
We continue to be very bullish on the future of all these business segments as we refine and execute more dynamic growth strategies that will continue to leverage innovation, transformation, and M&A.
Most of you on the call know there was a precipitous decline in steel prices during the quarter from an all-time high for hot roll of $1958 per ton.
During the quarter, it fell briefly below $1 thousand per ton.
However, the recent events in Ukraine have reverse this trend significantly, as hot roll now sits around 1300 in upward pressure.
The decline during the quarter helped us achieve a modest level of working capital relief, although this may be short-lived.
But we've yet to establish specific targets, so this is in process.
Worthington today has many products and solutions that enable emissions reductions, and we intend to increase our focus on these products to capitalize on the growth opportunity in those businesses.
We believe firmly that we have a huge opportunity to play a central role in building the bridge to a cleaner environment.
We are positioning our businesses to maximize this opportunity.
Several of these areas include laser welding, lightweight applications, electrical steel eliminations for batteries and transformers, and gas systems for the hydrogen ecosystem.
Many other of our existing products already offer cleaner fuel alternatives that can bridge us to a future dominated by wind, solar, hydrogen, and hydroelectric.
The business environment continues to be very challenging.
Our teams continue to go above and beyond to manage through these difficulties and deliver for our customers and shareholders.
We are well-positioned for whatever the market brings us next.
Will now take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 My name is Aaron Howald, and I'm LP's Director of Investor Relations.
All these materials are available on LPs investor relations website, www.
Rather than reading these statements, I incorporate them herein by reference.
Finally, in today's discussion and materials, we refer to Siding Solutions, where we would previously have said SmartSide.
This is an expanded descriptor, which in addition to SmartSide also includes newly developed Trim and Siding products, with different branding.
I should stress that this modification is consistent with and therefore does not require any recasting of any previously reported growth numbers for SmartSide Trim and Siding.
Q2 was another remarkable quarter for LP Building Solutions.
All our segments set records for sales and EBITDA in the second quarter, with over 150,000 housing starts in June, single-family mix over 70% and repair and remodel indices equally robust, we are encouraged that demand for LP's products remain very strong.
EBITDA was $684 million, generating $457 million in operating cash flow and $4.74 in earnings per share.
Siding Solutions growth is a significant component of these results, as slide seven illustrates.
Siding Solutions includes primed and prefinished SmartSide, as well as innovative strand-based Siding products sold under other brand names.
Revenue for Siding Solutions grew by 39% compared to last year.
This is composed of 27% volume growth, compounded by 9% price growth.
In addition to market penetration and share gains, Siding is growing through product innovation, the most innovative and value-added subset of Siding Solutions, which includes SmartSide Smooth, Shakes and ExpertFinish and LP's new builder series Siding, combined for 9% of total volume in Q2.
This is compared to 6% last year and these new products contributed more than one point to the 9% increase.
For LP's OSB segment, extraordinary prices generated impressive cash flows, but also overshadowed important gains in Structural Solutions volume.
OSB prices have pulled back in recent weeks.
We have not wavered from our strategy of growing structural solutions and supply market demand agility.
In fact, in Q2, we grew Structural Solutions as a percentage of total OSB volume by five points, compared to prior year quarter.
While not driving our strategy, OSB prices do of course continue to be a significant driver of LP's cash flow and share repurchases, about which Alan will update you in a few minutes.
LP South America segment also had a very strong quarter with OSB and Siding price increases more than offsetting raw material cost inflation.
South American sales almost doubled and EBITDA tripled compared to last year.
Let me briefly update you on our capacity expansion projects, beginning with the Siding conversion in hold.
While material costs particularly still, have been subject to inflationary pressures, the project is on schedule.
We expect to begin SmartSide production in Houlton in late Q1 of 2022.
We continue to work to accelerate the Sagola conversion and we are currently planning to start SmartSide production there in the first quarter of 2023.
Finally, we are implementing projects to optimize our production and distribution processes that should result in incremental gains in production capacity across our mills.
As for LP's Peace Valley OSB mill, I'm happy to announce that Peace Valley pressed its first Board of OSB in late June.
We have received APA Certification in our shipping product, including TechShield Radiant Barrier, a significant contributor to Structural Solutions growth.
In previous quarterly calls, I have discussed shortages of resin and adhesives as well as LP's operational responses to mitigate the impacts of these disruptions.
As the broader economy continues this on even recovery, we expect intermittent supply chain challenges to continue.
LP's Strategic Sourcing teams is working diligently to minimize disruptions.
This includes collaborating with our operations teams to allo...
...pressures to continue and they are reflected in our third quarter guidance.
One potential contributor to supply chain concerns are the fires in British Columbia and elsewhere in the West.
So far, our employees and facilities are safe and we've seen minimal interruptions to inbound and outbound shipping.
We will of course continue to monitor the situation closely with safety as our highest priority.
Let me turn to LP's capital allocation strategy which remains to return to shareholders over time at least 50% of cash flow from operations in excess of investments required to sustain our core businesses and grow Siding Solutions at OSB Structural Solutions.
In the second quarter of 2021, we returned $481 million to shareholders through a combination of $465 million in share repurchases and $16 million in dividends.
Furthermore, since the end of June, we've spent an additional $140 million on buybacks which leaves $572 million remaining under the current $1 billion authorization.
And since LP embarked on its strategic transformation, we've returned over $1.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing more than 5 million shares and bringing the current share count to a bit under 95 million.
In order to consistently reflect ongoing Siding growth and the decrease in share count driven by aggressive share repurchases, LP has declared a midyear increase in the quarterly dividend of 13% or $0.02 per share raising it from $0.16 a share to $0.18 per share.
Slide 13 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment, as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the third quarter.
We now anticipate spending $95 million in 2021 for the Houlton conversion an increase of $10 million of prior guidance largely due to increased costs for steel and labor.
The remainder of the project costs will be incurred in early 2022.
Spending for other growth capital, is expected to be $45 million and we anticipate spending about $120 million on sustaining maintenance for full-year total capital outlay of $270 million.
This assumes continued easing of travel restrictions and contractor availability the reversal of, which could result in some execution risk, which brings me to the revenue and EBITDA outlook.
For Siding Solutions, the third quarter should see year-over-year revenue growth of around 10%, which would be another quarterly record despite the much stronger comparative.
This will however, bring the business very near to full production capacity with the result that revenue growth for the remainder of the year will be primarily driven by price increases and mix shifts.
And if we assume 10% year-over-year revenue growth for the second half of this year Siding Solutions revenue growth will hit 24% for the year, which is double our long-term guidance.
However, the combined effects of the Houlton conversion and other growth projects increased selling and marketing investment and input cost inflation will result in third quarter EBITDA being below last year's.
But on a trailing 12-month basis, we still expect the EBITDA margin to meet our long-term guidance of 25%.
For the OSB segment although prices are exceptionally volatile right now our order file gives us some near-term visibility.
We also tend to lag price movements both when they are rising and when they are falling.
We're therefore guiding to OSB revenue being roughly 10% sequentially lower than the second quarter.
This includes the assumption that Random Lengths prices stay flat from last Friday's print throughout the remainder of the quarter.
And while this is obviously, not a prediction of future OSB prices, we hope it's a useful characterization of the impact of price movements so far.
And so with further caveats about certain changes in demand raw material price and availability or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the third quarter to be at least $530 million, which will not be another quarterly record for LP but will be second only to the quarter we've just finished to report it.

Siding Solutions revenue surged by 39%, driven by volume and price growth, including gains from innovative products like SmartSide Smooth and ExpertFinish. OSB prices remain volatile, pulling back recently, but the segment still saw growth in Structural Solutions. South America also had a stellar quarter, with doubling sales and tripling EBITDA. LP anticipates continued growth in Siding Solutions with Q3 revenue projected to be 10% higher than Q3 2020, although capacity constraints may hinder further growth. However, OSB revenue is expected to decline sequentially by 10% in Q3, and potential supply chain issues and inflationary pressures could impact results. Despite these challenges, LP expects Q3 EBITDA to exceed $530 million, driven by strong order backlog and cost-cutting measures. LP remains committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders, repurchasing $481 million in shares during Q2, and has increased its quarterly dividend by 13%.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 You can access this announcement on the Investor Relations page of our website, www.
aam.com, and through the PR newswire services.
You can also find supplemental slides for this conference call on the Investor page of our website as well.
For additional information, we ask that you refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Information regarding these non-GAAP measures as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial information is available on our website.
With that, let me turn things over to AAM's Chairman and CEO, David Dauch.
Joining me on the call today are Mike Simonte, AAM's President; and Chris May, AAM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
To begin my comments today, I'll review the highlights of our third quarter 2021 results.
I'll then touch on some exciting business development news, including electrification announcements with REE and our largest customer, General Motors.
And lastly, we'll discuss the ongoing supply chain challenges and our financial outlook.
After Chris covers the details of our financial results, we will then open up the call for any questions that you may have.
AAM delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter of 2021 despite unprecedented supply chain challenges that impacted industry production in the third quarter.
When we reported second quarter earnings, our expectation was that the worst of the shortage was behind us.
This turned out not to be the case.
Production volatility stemming from the semiconduct -- chip shortage took another leg down, which eventually forced OEMs to idle production at many facilities, including their full-size truck plants that were largely protected previously.
However, the AAM team did a great job in managing these obstacles and factors under our control, resulting in solid financial performance.
AAM sales for the third quarter of 2021 were $1.21 billion, down approximately 14% compared to $1.41 billion in the third quarter of 2020.
The decrease in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the impact of the semiconductor supply chain disruptions of nearly $245 million.
North American industry production was down approximately 25% according to third-party estimates.
Light truck production was down 20% year-over-year and volumes on our core platforms decreased significantly from a year ago.
The industry is at a point where a lack of inventory has begun to impact retail sales.
Days supply on key products that we support were at or below 30 days with certain platforms in single digits and large SUVs closer to 20 days.
Once the supply chain issues are resolved, which will take some time, we foresee an extended recovery to meet customer demand and replenish dealer inventories.
AAM is in a great position to benefit from the strong demand in light trucks, especially pickups and SUVs and the replenishment of crossover vehicles.
AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2021 was $183 million or 15.1% of sales.
This compares to $297 million last year.
Excluding the impact of metal markets and currency, our EBITDA margins would have approximated 19%.
This is a testament to our optimization efforts and our strong cost control, yielding strong EBITDA conversion.
AAM's adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2021 was $0.15 per share compared to $1.15 in the third quarter of 2020.
As for cash flow, we continue to generate positive free cash flow in the third quarter.
AAM's adjusted free cash flow was approximately $69 million.
Earlier this year, we announced a development agreement with REE.
We are pleased to share that we have secured an initial platform business award with our partner, and AAM plans to supply REE with high-performance electric drive units for its highly modular and disruptive REEcorner technology that enables full flat EV chassis for multiple applications.
This is a great electrification opportunity for AAM and its validation of our innovative industry-leadi...
...ed significant customer interest in our new products and technology.
Now let's move on to interest and taxes.
Net interest expense was $47 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $50.5 million in the third quarter of 2020.
We expect this favorable trend to continue as we benefit from continued debt reductions.
In the third quarter, we redeemed $100 million of our 6.25% notes due 2025 and refinanced the remaining $600 million balance.
In the third quarter of 2021, we reported an income tax benefit of $13.6 million compared to a benefit of $22.5 million in the third quarter of 2020.
As we near the end of 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 10% to 15%.
We would also expect our cash taxes to be in the $25 million to $30 million range.
Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net loss was $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in the third quarter of 2021 compared to an income of $117.2 million, or $0.99 per share, in the third quarter of 2020.
Let's now move on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2021 was $89.8 million compared to $249.5 million last year.
Capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment for the third quarter of 2021 was $33.2 million.
Cash payments for restructuring and acquisition-related activity for the third quarter of 2021 were $9 million.
The net cash outflow related to the recovery from the Malvern fire we experienced in September of 2020 was $3.5 million in the quarter.
However, we anticipate the Malvern fire to have a neutral cash impact for the full year as timing of cash expenditures and cash insurance proceeds aligned over time.
In total, we would expect $55 million to $65 million in cash payments for restructuring and acquisition costs in 2021.
Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $69.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.
From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.6 billion and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $930.2 million, calculating a net leverage ratio of 2.8 times at September 30.
We are focused on improving the balance sheet and delivering on our goal to improve our leverage this year.
We have made meaningful progress in reducing our gross debt outstanding and reducing our leverage ratio by more than a full turn as of the end of the third quarter.
Before we move on to the Q&A portion of the call, let me close out my comments with some thoughts on our 2021 financial outlook.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million.
Just as a reminder, investors need to consider the impact of the metal market pass-throughs as it relates to our margin calculations when comparing from period to period.
In periods and environment such as this, it is meaningful.
We expect to generate approximately $400 million of adjusted free cash flow in 2021, or nearly 50% adjusted free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion.
We expect our capital expenditures at less than 4% of sales as our capital reuse and optimization efforts continue to deliver results.
Our updated outlook is based on the latest and best information we have regarding customer production schedules.
We continue to assume our customers will prioritize building full-size pickup trucks and SUVs through the end of the year with minimal disruptions.
However, the operating environment remains choppy with multiple factors posing a risk to the supply chain.
As volumes begin to normalize, we should be in a great position to leverage that environment to generate profits and cash flow.
This in turn will be used to support our highly advanced research and development initiatives in electrification and solidly position us for future profitable growth aligned with our capital allocation priorities.
We have reserved some time to take questions.
So at this time, please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Also on the call are Brian McDade, chief financial officer; and Adam Reuille, chief accounting officer.
Our conference call this evening will be limited to one hour.
For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question.
I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.
We had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year.
We recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales, and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results.
We generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in '21 or $11.94 per share.
The $4.5 billion is a record amount for our company for the -- for a year.
And coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments, coupled with coherent strategy.
Fourth-quarter funds from operations were 1.160 billion -- I'm sorry, $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share.
Included in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest.
Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year.
Our international operations improved in the quarter.
Domestic property NOI increased 22.4% year over year -- I'm sorry, for the quarter and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties, portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year.
Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year over year.
Average base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent.
For the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet.
This was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last six years.
Retail sales, reported retail sales continued in the fourth quarter.
Mall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 34% year over year.
Reported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our Mall and Outlet Business and $645 for the Mills.
These results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for '21.
Occupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they've been in five years at 12.6% year-end.
and a premium outlet in South Korea.
Construction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie France opening the spring of '23.
We completed five significant redevelopments.
We added densification components with the opening of two hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility.
Progress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall.
We have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow.
Let me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG, and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe.
JCPenney's results were impressive.
Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion.
The company de-levered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit.
CEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer.
RGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet, marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth.
SPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There's a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise.
The Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach.
TRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80% posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting.
Reported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year over year.
Occupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year.
Now, turning to the balance sheet.
We've been active in the debt markets.
We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a lower pricing grid for five years.
We issued $2.75 billion of senior notes 750 million-euro notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%.
We paid more than $4 billion in debt and de-levered by $1.5 billion.
And with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion.
Now, just to turn to dividend.
We paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year.
Today, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%.
This dividend is payable on March 31.
Now, just to go through guidance for 2022.
Our FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share.
When looking at our '22 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to '21 actual results.
Approximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands.
These gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for '21.
'21 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average.
Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: Domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney, and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to '21 levels and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition or disposition activity.
And for bouncing back in '21 after a very difficult 2020.
Make no mistake about it, '21 was a great year.
And I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share.
So, that's a heck of a year.
I'm very excited about our plans for '22 and the future growth prospects of our company, and we're ready for any questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.
Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing first quarter performance is a comparison of the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the first quarter of fiscal '21.
We plan to release fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 17 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.
Rick will give an update on our operating performance, and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update of our fiscal '22 financial outlook.
Our teams continue to operate effectively in a challenging environment.
And I'm proud of their focus and ability to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability.
All of our segments delivered record first quarter profit.
Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and our continued to adherence this strategy we implemented six years ago.
Our brands remain laser focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture.
Our first quarter sales trends started strong.
This momentum carried over from the fourth quarter, and they further strengthened and peaked in July.
However, in August, sales slowed due to the impact of the Delta variant, but remained positive relative to pre-COVID levels.
For the first quarter, sales per operating week were up 4.8% relative to pre-COVID.
And through the first three weeks in September, sales per operating week were up approximately 7% relative to pre-COVID.
Regardless of the operating environment, our unwavering commitment to our strategy ensures we will stay focused on what we do best, providing exceptional guest experiences.
Throughout this unique period, our operators have shown tremendous flexibility, while remaining locked in on the fundamentals of running great restaurants.
At the same time, our focus helps us continue to find ways to make our competitive advantages work even harder for us.
One of the ways we do this is by leveraging our ability to open value-creating new restaurants.
We opened seven new restaurants during the quarter, all of which are exceeding our expectations.
And we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year.
A long-term framework calls for 2% to 3% sales growth from new restaurants.
Given our stronger unit economics, our development team is working hard to build out a pipeline of locations for fiscal '23 and beyond that would put us at or above the higher end of our framework.
As I visit our restaurants and talk with our teams, I'm constantly reminded why our people are our greatest competitive advantage.
Their passion for being of service to our guests and each other fuels our success.
Our success this quarter was driven by the work we have done to simplify our processes and our menus to drive execution at the highest level.
We also paused any new initiatives in order to further eliminate distractions for our restaurant teams and allow them to focus on what it takes to run 14 great shifts a week.
In addition, To-Go sales continue to benefit from the ongoing evolution of our digital platform.
This platform makes it simpler for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up, all while making it easier for our teams to execute at the highest level, both in the dining room and off-premise.
This served our teams well, as To-Go sales remained high through the quarter.
For the quarter, off-premise sales accounted for 27% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn St...
...lculating wage inflation rate, in which we keep the hour and job mix constant and only look at change in wage.
While we expect higher rates of inflation to persist for the remainder of the year versus what we initially planned, we believe our scale and recent enhancements to our business model enable us to deliver significant margin expansion, while still adhering to our strategy of pricing below inflation.
Now looking at the P&L for the first quarter of 2022, we're providing a comparison against pre-COVID results in the first quarter of 2020, which we believe is a more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been talking about our margin expansion.
For the first quarter, food and beverage expenses were 150 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing significantly below inflation.
Restaurant labor was 110 basis points lower, driven primarily by hourly labor improvement, due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures.
Restaurant expenses were also 110 basis points lower due to sales leverage.
Marketing spend was $45 million lower, resulting in 220 basis points of favorability.
As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 20.9%, 290 basis points better than pre-COVID levels.
G&A expense was 30 basis points higher, driven primarily by approximately $10 million of stock compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement eligible employees.
Additionally, we had approximately $5 million of expense related to mark-to-market on our deferred compensation.
As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it's largely offset on the tax line.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned.
Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been closer to the top end of our guidance range for the year.
Turning to our segment performance.
First quarter sales at Olive Garden were flat to pre-COVID, while segment profit margin increased 220 basis points.
This was strong performance despite elevated inflation and two-year check growth of only 2.4%.
LongHorn had the best sales performance across our segments with sales increasing by 26% versus pre-COVID, while growing segment profit margin by 250 basis points.
Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 24% versus pre-COVID in what's traditionally their slowest quarter from a seasonal perspective.
Segment profit margin grew by 490 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodity inflation.
Our Other segment grew sales by nearly 5% and segment profit margin by 360 basis points.
We continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of this segment, as it's driving the strongest underlying business model improvement of all our segments.
Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022.
Based on our performance this quarter and expected performance for the remainder of the year, we increased our outlook for the full year.
We now expect total sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, representing growth of 7% to 9% from pre-COVID levels; same restaurant sales growth of 27% to 30% and 35 to 40 new restaurants; capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 4% with commodities inflation of 4.5% and total restaurant labor inflation of 5.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation of about 7%; EBITDA of $1.54 billion to $1.60 billion; and annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14% and approximately 131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.25 and $7.60.
This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID, in line with our previous outlook as higher sales are helping offset elevated inflation.
This will be a net negative to second quarter from a sales perspective.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President and Barry Logan, Executive Vice President.
Before I report, let me first wish that you and your families are healthy and safe.
Now onto our report.
Watsco just completed an outstanding third quarter.
EPS grew 25% to a record $2.76.
Records were set for sales, gross profit, operating profit, operating margins and net income.
These results were driven by strong growth in our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business, which grew 19% during the quarter and from operating efficiencies achieved throughout our network, as evidenced by the nominal change in SG&A.
Homeowners clearly are investing in their homes as HVAC replacement sales have remained strong from early summer through today.
We also believe that greater adoption of our Watsco technologies has contributed to our results and led to gains in market share.
Our best indication of this impact are two simple metrics.
first, customers that use Watsco technologies are growing at a much faster rate than non-users.
Second, we are experiencing minimal attrition among active users on a year-over-year basis.
Now keeping this in mind, we continue to invest in our platforms and to drive for greater adoption by more customers.
Here are some examples of our progress.
Weekly users of our mobile apps have grown 31% since last year with over 100,000 downloads.
E-commerce transactions have grown by 19% this year to nearly 1 million online orders, which is about $1.5 billion in annual rate at the moment.
Our annual -- our annualized e-commerce sales run rate is 32%, versus 29% at the end of last year and in certain markets the use of e-commerce is over 50%.
Our dockside pickup services have expanded to more locations and now include non-contact payment functionality.
This technology has only been available for a few months and already over 12,000 orders were fulfilled during the quarter by more than 2,000 unique users.
Two of our newer innovative platforms have gained momentum.
We call them OnCall Air and the second one CreditForComfort.
These platforms provide digital connectivity for contractors and homeowners when making proposals, and buying and financing replacement systems.
Contractors using our -- what we call OnCall Air platform provided digital proposals to over 39,000 households during the quarter, and generated $114 million in sales, nearly double that of last year.
Our CreditForComfort platform process doubled in number of digital financing applications resulting in an 87% increase in third-party funded loans.
Investments in inventory management software have also benefited us this year, with inventory turns improving 25 basis points over last year and of course contributing to cash flow and operating efficiency.
All of this is exciting, but we believe, Watsco's technology are only scratching the surface of their full potential.
As always, feel free to schedule a zoom call with us and we can further explain our technology and progress.
We also strengthened Watsco's balance sheet this quarter.
We generated record operating cash flow of $373 million, which is far away a record for the year, so far, and we have no debt at this time.
Importantly, we have the capacity to make almost any size investment to grow in our business.
And I always like to comment that we're in a $40 billion industry of which we are only $5 billion, so we have lots of room for growth.
And then finally, one more very important thought, our results are a testament to the efforts of our teams across the Watsco network.
We deeply appreciate their commitment.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined today by Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer.
Let's begin with the business highlights on Slide 4.
Our sales for the quarter were $301 million.
Excluding favorable currency translation, our organic growth was up 37% from the prior year.
It should be noted, however, that our prior-year quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic.
In this year's fourth quarter, our team faced multiple challenges, first with the chip shortages and then with the plastic resin shortages, resulting from the freeze in Texas.
These issues, along with the ongoing port congestion, created meaningful headwinds.
In response the Methode team did what it does best, recognize the challenge early, work with the customers and suppliers to develop solutions and then execute.
As a result, we were able to meet the high end of our sales guidance for the quarter.
However, the supply chain disruptions required remedial actions such as expedited shipping and premium component pricing that significantly impacted our margins.
Moving forward, these challenges are lingering into the first quarter and some may continue until the end of this calendar year.
However, we have confidence in the situation improving as evidenced by our guidance for the full fiscal year.
The growth that we realized in the fourth quarter was due to increased demand across most of our businesses that was especially focused in auto and commercial vehicle.
We also saw growth in our Dabir business as a result of a major hospital system order.
Overall, we had strong awards for EV, LED, lighting and e-Bikes.
Last quarter we reported that sales into EV applications were over 12% of consolidated sales.
This quarter, EV sales were over 13% of consolidated sales and we continue to expect the number to be in the mid-teens for fiscal 2022.
Methode's combination of user interface, LED lighting and power distribution solutions is a winning formula in EV, but we are especially seeing growth in our power offering.
Regarding our balance sheet.
We generated $31 million in free cash flow and further reduced our net debt in the quarter.
We continue to have ample liquidity and our net leverage ratio is now near zero.
The strength and flexibility of our balance sheet allows us to consider multiple paths to invest in the business in order to drive growth and ultimately shareholder return.
As an example, this quarter, we initiated a stock buyback program and purchased $7.5 million in Methode shares.
After the quarter end, we also announced a 27% increase to our dividend.
Methode's business model continues to generate excellent free cash and we are allocating capital per our balanced approach.
Moving to Slide 5.
Methode finished the fiscal year with another strong quarter of business awards.
These awards continue to capitalize on key market trends like vehicle electrification, LED lighting in auto and cloud computing.
The awards identified here represent a cross-section of the business wins in the quarter and represent over $40 million in annual business at full production.
In vehicle electrification, we won awards for power distribution, user interface and LED lighting programs.
We continue to win programs with OEMs globally in both auto and commercial vehicle applications.
In non-EV LED lighting, we were awarded programs for automotive and motorcycle applications.
In cloud computing, we continue to see demand for our power distribution products and data center applications.
Additionally, we continue to participate in the growth of e-bikes which utilizes our proprietary magnetoelastic technology.
We also won two awards for traditional user interface solutions as well as secured a power distribution award for our wind farm application.
Turning to Slide 6.
Despite having one less week, we were able to deliver year-over-year organic growth and finished with our good sales of $1,088 million for the year.
Also a record for the year was our free cash flow of $155 million.
The team's disciplined focus on ...
...decreased by $127.9 million to $6.9 million in the fiscal year '21 from $134.8 million at the end of fiscal year '20.
We ended the fourth quarter with $233.2 million in cash.
Our debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio, which is used for our bank covenants, is approximately 1.25.
Our net debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA ratio was 0.04, virtually nil.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, which effective in fiscal year '21 is defined as net cash provided from operating activities less capex.
For fiscal year '21 fourth quarter, free cash flow was $31.2 million as compared to $47.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20.
The decrease was mainly due to higher working capital in the quarter to support year-over-year increased sales.
For the full fiscal year '21, we produced record net cash provided by operating activities of nearly $180 million and record free cash flow of $155 million.
While we don't expect to equal the fiscal year '21 free cash flow results in fiscal '22, largely due to increased working capital to support fiscal year '22 sales growth and increased capex, we do expect to generate sizable free cash flow.
We anticipate continuing our proven history of consistently generating reliable cash flows which allow for ample funding of future organic growth, inorganic growth and return of capital to the shareholders.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21, we invested approximately $4.8 million in capex as compared to $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20.
The lower fourth quarter capex was simply due to timing as opposed to a conscious effort to curtail capex.
We approved capex during the quarter and the full fiscal year that is not yet reflected in the cash flow statement as the actual cash outlay for these approved expenditures will occur in future reporting periods.
We have a strong balance sheet and we'll continue utilizing it by continuing investment in our businesses to grow them organically in the future.
In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for inorganic growth.
Regarding capital allocation, we recently announced two initiatives.
First, on March 31 we announced a $100 million share repurchase program, which we executed $7.5 million of repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21.
In addition, last week we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.14 per share.
We are confident in our cash-generating ability to simultaneously invest in organic growth, inorganic growth and provide an ample return of capital to the shareholders.
Don mentioned in his remarks, we are providing revenue and earnings per share guidance in the first quarter of fiscal '22 due to the uncertain direct and indirect impacts from the ongoing semiconductor supply shortage and the continued challenges from other supply disruptions, including port congestion.
The revenue range for the first quarter of fiscal year '22 is between $285 million and $300 million.
Diluted earnings per share range is between $0.68 per share to $0.80 per share.
The revenue range for the full fiscal year '22 is between $1.175 billion and $1.235 billion.
Diluted earnings per share ranges between $3.35 per share to $3.75 per share.
The midpoint of the range represents an 11% increase over fiscal '21 despite having a significantly higher tax rate in fiscal year '22.
The wider range is due to the uncertainty from the supply chain disruption for semiconductors and other materials on both Methode and its customers.
Factors that could result in us moving toward the higher end of the sales range include higher sales due to lesser disruption of supply to us and/or our customers which would result in higher demand for our products.
Lesser disruption would also minimize the cost of sales impact from premium freight, factory inefficiencies and, to a lesser extent, tariffs and other logistic factors such as port congestion.
Don, that concludes my comments.
Kathryn, we are ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 David Zalman will lead off with a review of the highlights for the recent quarter.
He will be followed by Asylbek Osmonov who will review some of our recent financial statistics, and Tim Timanus, who will discuss our lending activities, including asset quality.
During the call, interested parties may participate live by following the instructions that will be provided by our call moderator, Jamie.
Before we begin, let me make the usual disclaimers.
We are pleased with our second quarter 2020 results and with completing the operational integration of Legacy on schedule in early June.
The team members from Legacy, now Prosperity, have been excellent and we could not have achieved such a smooth integration without their commitment and efforts.
We remain excited about the combination and look forward to continuing to build the best bank anywhere.
For the second quarter of 2020, we showed impressive returns on average tangible common equity of 19.98% annualized and on average assets of 1.61%.
Our earnings were $130.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $82 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $48.6 million or 59.1%.
Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 for the second quarter of 2020 compared with the $1.18 for the same period in 2019, an increase of 19.5%.
The second quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.41 includes a $0.22 income tax benefit, a $0.06 charge for merger related expenses and a $0.03 charge for the writedown of fixed assets related to the merger and some CRA funds.
In summary, it was $0.22 in benefit to earnings and $0.09 in inductions mostly related to the merger.
Loans at June 30, 2020 were $21.025 billion, an increase of $10.4 billion or 98.6% compared with $10.587 billion at June 30, 2019.
Our linked quarter loans increased $1.898 billion or 9.9% from the $19.127 billion at 31, 2020, of which $1.392 billion were SBA Paycheck Protection Program, sometimes referred to as PPP loans.
Mortgage warehouse loans also increased $843 million in the second quarter 2020 compared to the first quarter.
Our core loans, excluding held for sale and the warehouse purchase program and the PPP loans, decreased $311 million.
However, a portion of this decrease resulted from loans that were intentionally removed that were identified in our due diligence of Legacy.
We saw strong loan growth in the first part of the second quarter but that slowed as business shut down or reduced operations in response to various government orders.
Our deposits at June 30, 2020 were $26.153 billion, an increase of $9.265 billion or 54.9% compared with $16.888 billion at June 30, 2019.
Our linked quarter deposits increased $2.326 billion or 9.8% from the $23.826 billion at March 31, 2020.
Historically, our deposits are lower in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter and then begin to increase in the third and fourth quarters for us.
But this year, second quarter deposits are higher.
A large portion is from the PPP loans as well as reduction in customer spending and customer saving [Phonetic] right now.
With regard to asset quality, it's always been one of the primary focuses of our bank and always will be.
I have always said you will like us in the good times but love us in the bad times, and this is playing out to be true again during this pandemic and oil price downturn.
Nonperforming assets totaled $77.9 million or 28 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets at June 30, 2020.
We continue to provide relief to our loan customers through loan extensions and deferrals when possible.
For the second quarter of 2020, net charge-offs were $13 million.
Of these charge-offs, $12.4 million were related to PCD loans with specific reserves of $28.5 million that we acquired in the merger.
So far, $16.1 million in specific reserves were released to the general reserve in addition to the $10 million provision for loan losses for the second quarter.
M&A activity has subsided during this pandemi...
...ple to be the next generation of leaders, make every customer experience easy and enjoyable and operate in a safe and sound manner.
Let me turn over our discussion to Asylbek, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss some of the specific financial results we achieved.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $259 million compared to $154.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $104.1 million or 67.2%.
The increase was primarily due to the merger with LegacyTexas in November 2019 and loan discount accretion of $24.3 million in the second quarter 2020.
The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3.69% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.16% for the same period in 2019 and 3.81% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, the core net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was 3.33% compared to 3.14% for the same period in 2019 and 3.36% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
Non-interest income was $25.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $30 million for the same period in 2019.
The current quarter non-interest income was affected by $3.9 million in writedown of certain assets and general impacts of COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $134.4 million compared to $80.8 million for the same period in 2019.
The increase was primarily due to the merger with LegacyTexas and one-time merger related expenses of $7.5 million due to the core system conversion that occurred in June.
In addition to this merger-related expenses, the second quarter results reflected elevated expenses related to increased mortgage activities.
With the core system conversion and operational integration process behind us, we do not anticipate any significant merger related expenses going forward, and we expect to start realizing the remaining cost savings beginning in the third quarter of 2020.
We expect this additional savings to be about $7 million to $9 million per quarter.
This, combined with the savings realized in the first and second quarter, will be in line with our previously stated 25% cost savings in non-interest expense.
The efficiency ratio was 46.56% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 43.74% for the same period in 2019 and 42.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
Excluding merger related expenses of $7.5 million, the efficiency ratio was 43.97% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.
The bond portfolio metrics at 6/30/2020 showed a weighted average life of 2.69 years and projected annual cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion.
Our nonperforming assets at quarter-end June 30, 2020 totaled $77,942,000 or 37 basis points of loans and other real estate.
The June 30, 2020 non-performing assets total was made up of $71,595,000 in loans, $187,000 in repossessed assets and $6,160,000 in other real estate.
Of the $77,942,000 in nonperforming assets, $12,173,000 or 16% are energy credits, $12,73,000 of which are service company credits and $100,000 are production company credits.
Since June 30, 2020, $15,786,000 has been removed from the nonperforming assets list through the sale of collateral.
This represents 20% of the nonperforming assets dollars.
Net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $13,01,000.
$10 million was added to the allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
The average monthly new loan production for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was $871 million.
This includes a total of $1.430 billion in PPP loans booked during the quarter.
Loans outstanding at June 30, 2020 were $21.025 billion.
The June 30, 2020 loan total is made up of 39% fixed rate loans, 36% floating rate loans and 25% loans resetting at specific intervals.
The fixed rate percentage increased somewhat due to the inclusion of the PPP loans.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-Q and other periodic reports.
We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations.
We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.
Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.
While lessened, disruptions from pandemic do in fact remain along with volatile industry dynamics and numerous global supply chain constraints.
Having said that, our impressive results throughout this entire period and again in Q2 demonstrate the strong execution of our global teams and the resiliency of our business model.
Now, turning to our second quarter highlights on slide four.
We delivered very strong revenue growth of 32% year over year, which also represents growth above 2019 levels, driven by robust and sustained consumer demand and the execution of our pricing actions.
Next, our decisive response plan to address volatile industry dynamics and broad supply constraints delivered ongoing earnings per share of $6.64, a $4.57 improvement year over year.
Ongoing EBIT margin of 11.4%, a year-over-year improvement of 640 basis points overcoming 400 basis points of cost inflation.
Additionally, we generated positive free cash flow of $769 million, led by strong earnings and the successful completion of a partial tender offer of our Whirlpool China business and the divestiture of our Turkish subsidiary.
These global results were driven by substantial EBIT growth and margin expansion across every region.
The execution of these actions and the sustained consumer demand delivered very strong Q2 results and give us the confidence to significantly raise our guidance to approximately $26 per share.
Turning to slide five, we show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin.
Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by reduced promotions and the further implementation of a previously announced cost-based pricing actions.
Additionally, structural cost takeout actions, higher volumes, and ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 550 basis points of net cost margin improvement.
These margin benefits were partially offset by a raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, which resulted in an unfavorable impact of 400 basis points.
Lastly, increased investment in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margin by a combined 100 basis points.
Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering even above our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive outstanding results throughout 2021 and beyond.
Turning to slide seven, I'll review our second quarter regional results.
In North America, we delivered 22% revenue growth driven by sustained strong consumer demand in the region.
Additionally, we delivered another quarter of very strong EBIT margin driven by volume growth and the disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions, and the previously announced cost-based price increases that were fully in place as we exited the quarter.
Demand for our products remains high as we continue to produce in a constrained environment that we now expect to persist throughout 2021.
Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model.
Turning to slide eight, I'll review our second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region.
Double-digit growth in all key countries drove a fourth ...
...e realize further efficiencies from higher revenues and strong cost takeout initiatives.
As we closely monitor cost inflation globally, particularly in steel and resins, we continue to expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion due to peak increases to materialize in the third quarter.
Increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, are expected to impact the margin by 125 basis points.
Overall, based on our track record, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate this uncertain environment, and delivered 0.5%-plus EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion.
Turning to slide 14 we show our updated industry and regional EBIT guidance for the year.
We have increased our North America industry expectation to 10% plus to reflect the continued demand strength.
We continue to expect to see demand strength driven from broader home nesting trends and an under-supplied housing market.
Additionally, we have updated the EBIT guidance of our North America region to reflect the benefits of increased cost efficiencies, which are more than offsetting increased cost from logistics, labor, and operational inefficiencies of producing in a heavily constrained environment.
This brings our EBIT guidance for North America to approximately 17%.
Lastly, we continue to expect to deliver strong growth and significant EBIT expansion across our international regions with each region contributing to our global EBIT margin of 10.5% plus.
Turning to slide 15, we will discuss the drivers of our updated 2021 free cash flow.
We now expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of $450 million.
Driven by expectations for stronger top line growth and improved EBIT margins, we increased our cash earnings guidance by $250 million.
Next, we have reflected the benefit from the divestitures completed in the quarter.
This represents free cash flow generation of 7.5% of sales delivering above our long-term goal of 6%.
Turning to slide 16, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021.
We continue to expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future.
This includes industry-leading externally recognized innovation, such as our newly launched 2-in-1 Removable Agitator in our top-load laundry machine in North America and the launch of new products in EMEA, such as our new built-in refrigerator, which is recognized as the quietest built-in fridge in the marketplace.
Next, with a clear focus on returning strong levels of cash to shareholders and a signal of our confidence in the business, we expect to increase our rate of share repurchases in the second half of 2021 to at or above $300 million.
Lastly, we repaid a $300 million maturing bond and issued our inaugural sustainability bond, focusing on actions to drive positive environmental and social impacts.
This milestone further advances our global sustainability strategy and reflects our core philosophy that sound corporate citizenship and environmental performance are good for business and underscores our leadership position in our industry as we continue our constant pursuit of improving life at home.
And let me just recap what you heard over the past few minutes.
Q2 again impressively demonstrated our ability to operate in a very volatile environment and delivered very strong operating results.
Sustained healthy market demand and strong operational execution give us the confidence to increase our guidance for revenue, EBIT, earnings per share, and free cash flow.
Next, we remain unwavering in our commitment to drive strong shareholder value and return cash to shareholders.
Lastly, as we look beyond 2021, we firmly believe we have demonstrated that our business is structurally improved and well positioned to again build on our record results.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Charlotte Rasche, General Counsel of Prosperity Bancshares.
David Zalman will lead off with a review of the highlights for the recent quarter.
He will be followed by Asylbek Osmonov, who will review some of our recent financial statistics and Tim Timanus, who will discuss our lending activities, including asset quality.
During the call, interested parties may participate live by following the instructions that will be provided by our call moderator, Matt.
Before we begin, let me make the usual disclaimers.
I'm pleased to report that because of the confidence in our company, our strong capital position and our continued success, our Board of Directors voted to increase the fourth quarter dividend to $0.52, a 6.1% increase from the third quarter.
Prosperity continues to do well, and we want to share that success with our shareholders.
Additionally, as our stock price experienced declines in the third quarter, Prosperity repurchased 767,134 shares of its common stock at a weighted price of $67.87.
Prosperity Bank was ranked by Forbes as the second best bank in America for 2021 and has been in the top 10 of the Forbes list since 2010.
Prosperity reported net income of $128.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, '21 compared to $130 million for the same period in 2020.
The net income per diluted common share was $1.39 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 and compared with $1.40 for the same period in 2020.
Prosperity continues to exhibit solid operating metrics and return on tangible equity of 16.2% and return on assets of 1.42% for the third quarter of 2021.
Net interest margins have been stressed throughout the low rate environment.
However, we believe this should improve if interest rates rise as projected as the bank is positioned for increased earnings in a higher rate environment.
Our loans on September 30, 2021 were just shy of $19 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion or 8.8% and compared with $20.8 billion on September 30, 2020.
Our linked quarter loans, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program and PPP loans increased $217 million or 1.3%, 5.3% annualized from $16.4 billion on June 30, 2021.
We saw loan growth throughout the company with the exception of the Dallas-Fort Worth area as we continue to reduce loans that were categorized as PCD loans at the time of the merger as well as loans in the nonrecourse structure commercial real estate category.
Excluding these categories, Dallas/Fort Worth continues to show solid growth and win some marquee deals in their area.
Deposits on September 30, 2021, were $29.5 billion, an increase of $3 billion or 11.3% and compared with $26.5 billion on September 30, 2020.
Our linked quarter deposits increased $341 million or 1.2%, 4.7% annualized from $29.1 billion on June 30, 2021.
Deposits continue to increase, which we believe is due in part to the government benefits and programs implemented during the pandemic and more people saving to have a safety net after the recent events.
Our nonperforming assets totaled $36.5 million or 11 basis points of quarterly average interest-earning assets on September 30, 2021, compared with $69 million or 24 basis points of quarterly average earning assets on September 30, 2020, and $33 million or 11 basis points of quarterly average interest-earning assets on June 30, 2021.
The reduction in nonperforming assets year-over-year is 47.4%.
The allowance for credit losses on loans was $287 million or 1.73% of total loans when excluding Warehouse Purchase Program, and PPP loans on September 30, 2021.
The allowance for unfunded commitments was $29.9 million on September 30, 2021, unchanged from prior periods.
This is a total reserve of $317 million.
Our net charge-offs were $15.7 million for three months ending September 30, 2021.
Net charge-offs included $4.6 million related to resolved PCD loans and $10.8 million related to a partial charge-off of one commercial structure real estate loan that was not a PCD loan and obtained through the acquisition...
...ding the impact of PPP loans, Warehouse Purchase Program loans and fair value loan income improved compared to the same results in the second quarter 2021.
The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to 3.57% for the same period in 2020 and 3.11% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, the net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, was 3.03% compared to 3.25% for the same period in 2020 and 2.96% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.

On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $4.6 million from $115.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
The increase was primarily due to gain on sale of ORE of $1.8 million recorded during the prior quarter and higher current quarter salaries and benefits resulting from higher incentives.
For the fourth quarter 2021, we expect noninterest expense to be in line with the current quarter or in the range of $118 million to $120 million.
The efficiency ratio was 42.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to 40.2% for the same period in 2020 and 41% for three months ended June 30, 2021.
During the third quarter 2021, we recognized $5.4 million in fair value loan income.
This amount includes $3.3 million from anticipated accretion, which is in line with the guidance provided last quarter and $2.1 million from early payoffs.
We estimate fair value loan income from anticipated accretion for the fourth quarter of 2021 to be around $2 million to $3 million.
As of September 30, 2021, the remaining discount balance is $18 million.
Also during the third quarter 2021, we recognized $13.4 million in fee income from PPP loans.
As of September 30, 2021, PPP loans had a remaining deferred fee balance of $15.6 million, with the majority of these deferred fees to be earned in the next two quarters.

This represents approximately a 9% increase in nonperforming assets, which comes from one loan.
The September 30, '21 nonperforming asset total, was made up of $36,73,000 in loans, $326,000 in repossessed assets and $150,000 in other real estate.
Of the $36,549,000 in nonperforming assets, $5,459,000 or 15% are energy credits, all of which are service company credits.
The $5,459,000 as of September 30, '21 is a 35% decline from $8,378,000 as of June 30, '21.
Since September 30, '21, $7,990,000 in nonperforming assets have been put under contracts for sale, but there is no assurance that these contracts will close.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.
We plan to release fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings on December 18 before the market opens followed by a conference call.
And then Rick will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the second quarter.
As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp-Track, excluding Darden, specifically, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse.
During our first fiscal quarter, industry same restaurant sales decreased 26%.
Given the ever-changing environment we continue to operate in, I am very pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter.
We are focused on four key priorities.
The health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in a complex operating environment, investing in and deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model.
The progress we made in these areas combined with our operating results, gave us the confidence to repay the $270 million term loan and reinstate a quarterly dividend.
Let me provide more detail on the four priorities.
First, the health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority.
Following CDC guidelines and local requirements, our teams continue to practice our enhanced safety protocols, including daily team member health monitoring.
We also continue to configure our dining rooms with social distancing that create a safe, welcoming environment, while maximizing allowable capacity.
A key part of this work is installing booth partitions to enable us to safely increase capacity where permissible.
At the end of August, we had completed installation in just over 500 restaurants in our total portfolio.
Operating in this environment adds another layer of complexity to an already complex operation, and I'm proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each others safe.
Second, we are laser focused on our back to basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant-level execution that creates guest experience, whether that's in our dining rooms, outdoors on our patios or in their homes, but it's not easy.
Executing at a high level is more complex today due to COVID-19 restrictions that vary by market.
Additionally, the constantly changing mix between on-premise and off-premise, plus expanded outdoor dining that is weather-dependent, leads to unpredictability in sales.
This is why the work we continue to do to streamline our menus and improve our processes and procedures is so important.
Moving complexity from our operations has allowed our restaurant teams to execute more consistently in this unique environment.
Our operators continued to deliver great guest experiences by displaying a high level of flexibility, creativity and passion every day, and I'm thrilled to see that reflected in our guest satisfaction metrics.
Third, we are continuing to invest in and implement technology to remove friction from the guest experience.
This includes providing multiple ways for our guests to order inside and outside the restaurant across our digital storefronts.
Additionally, we are deploying mobile solutions to make it easy for our guests to let us know when they have arrived to dine or pickup curbside order to go.
We are also expanding mobile payment options providing additional convenience for our guests.
For our three largest brands combined, more than 50% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online.
Finally and most importantly, we transformed our business model.
Even with the sales declines we are experiencing, our restaurants continue to produce high absolute sales volumes.
Therefore, we made the strategic decision to focus on adjusting our cost structure in order to generate strong cash flows, while making the appropriate investments in our businesses.
This provides us a stronger found...
...rkforce in the restaurant support center and field operations leadership positions.
It is expected to save between $25 million and $30 million annually.
We expect to see approximately three quarters of these savings throughout the remainder of fiscal '21.
Looking at our segment performance this quarter.
Despite a sales decline of 28%, Olive Garden increased segment profit margin by 110 basis points to 22.1%.
This strong profitability was driven by simplified operations, which reduced food and direct labor costs as well as reduced marketing spending.
LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining and the other business segment delivered strong positive segment profit margins of 15.1%, 11.9% and 12.8% respectively despite a significant sales decline experienced in the quarter.
These brands also benefited from simplified operations, keeping segment profit margin at these levels.
In the first quarter, 68% of our restaurants operated with at least partial dining room capacity for the entire quarter.
These restaurants had average weekly sales per restaurant of $69,000 and the same-restaurant sales decline of 21.9%.
And while Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment had fewer dining rooms opened than our average, these restaurants had the highest average weekly sales per restaurant of almost $76,000 and $90,000 respectively.
At the start of the second quarter, we had approximately 91% of our restaurants with dining rooms opened operating in at least limited capacity.
Now turning to our liquidity and other matters.
During the quarter, as we saw steadily improving weekly cash flows, we gained confidence in our estimated cash flow ranges.
We fully repaid the $270 million term loan we took out in April.
We ended the first quarter with $655 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.4 million of available liquidity.
We generated over $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 59% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of below 75%.
Given our strong liquidity position, improvements in our business model and better visibility into cash flow projections, our board reinstated a quarterly dividend.
The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share.
This dividend represents 53% of our first quarter adjusted earnings after-tax within our long-term framework for value creation.
We will continue to have regular discussions with the board on our future dividend policy.
Our first quarter results were significantly better than we anticipated.
The actions we took to simplify menus and operating procedures and capture other cost savings, along with our choice to pursue profitable sales, have yielded strong results.
And now, with a full quarter operating under this environment, we have even better visibility into our business model.
We anticipate EBITDA between $200 million and $215 million and diluted net earnings per share between $0.65 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 131 million shares.
In this environment, we continue to focus on building absolute sales volumes week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter.
This may result in variability in sales comparisons to last year as capacity constraints lead to less seasonality than we would have experienced historically.
Said another way, if capacity and social distancing restrictions remained similar to where they are today, it will be challenging to dramatically increase our on-premise average unit volumes.
Our second quarter is typically our lowest average unit volume quarter and our third quarter is typically our highest.
Additionally, as capacity restrictions ease and sales normalized, we will be able to reinvest to drive the top-line and a better overall guest experience.
Based on our strong business model enhancements, we now think we can get to our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales, while still making appropriate investments in our business.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Participating on the call today are Aaron Ravenscroft, president, and chief executive officer; and Dave Antoniuk, executive vice president, and chief financial officer.
However, actual results differ materially from any implied or actual projections due to one or more of the factors, among others, described in the company's latest SEC filings.
And with that, I will now turn over the call to you, Aaron.
Clearly, in retrospect, the economic dislocations created by our return to normal were far greater than anyone anticipated.
That being said, 2021 was a year of transition for Manitowoc on multiple fronts.
While we bounced back operationally from the COVID shutdowns, we also made significant changes in our strategic orientation.
As we laid out a year ago, we continued to build out our tower crane business and the [Inaudible] regions, launching two locally designed cranes.
We accelerated our all-terrain new product development, which will bear fruit at the upcoming BAUMA trade show this October.
We invested $15 million in our tower crane rental fleet in Europe, which helped us increase our market share in Germany and win some strategic orders with key accounts.
And finally, we completed two acquisitions in North America, which lays the groundwork for us to grow our aftermarket presence in the local mobile cranes market.
And currently, we continue to make progress on our ESG journey and more traditional safety terms.
The team doubled our hazard observations that we call SLAMS, and our recordable injury rate, excluding acquisitions, was 1.39 for the year.
While our RIR was up slightly year over year, it is still well below the industry benchmark, and I am very pleased with our performance in the face of the previous year.
On the sustainability front, we implemented [Inaudible], a tracking system to help us account for our environmental footprint, and we are utilizing the Manitowoc Way to drive continuous improvement.
For example, we assembled a global team to collaborate on paint booth emission reductions and have already begun to realize benefits.
As for diversity, we've been leaning and hard on this initiative to help offset our labor shortages.
Namely in Shady Grove, we implemented our first ESL program to help attract Spanish-speaking members of our community, and we have begun to offer relocation incentives to nearby cities such as Philadelphia to attract employees to our internal welding and machining schools.
With respect to our balance sheet, we continue to position the company for long-term growth.
After investing $40 million in capex and $186 million on two acquisitions, we closed the year with $75 million of cash on hand and $250 million of liquidity.
Considering the difficulties of managing working capital in the current environment, I'm comfortable with where we ended 2021.
For sure, the economic dislocations created by the return to normal were far greater than we anticipated a year ago, and I am extremely appreciative of all hard work by our team to minimize inflation as best as we could, implement price increases, and manage parts shortages while executing our long term strategy.
Specifically, I would like to recognize Jim Glenwright and Sebastian Maleigh, who recently won the CEO award for the Manitowoc Way.
In the midst of all of the economic chaos of 2021, Manitowoc encountered a cyberattack in June.
Jim led our effort to restore our IT system all at the same time continue to implement a new ERP system for MGX Equipment Services.
Meanwhile, across the pond, Sebastian earned his award for his contributions to the continuous improvement of our manufacturing processes and our tower factories.
He led projects to implement an automated tube cutting machine and move on while kicking off another significant machining project in our [Inaudible] factory.
I'm very proud of the commitment and passion of our employees at Manitowoc, and these two leaders truly represent the spirit of The Manitowoc Way.
Finally, I am pleased to...
...otal cost of capital.
Our 2022 guidance assumes that our current capital structure will remain in place for the full year.
As we look ahead to 2022, we expect continuing global supply chain and logistic challenges, moderation in inflationary pressure, and an unstable labor market throughout the first half of the year.
In the second half of the year, we anticipate an improved price cost dynamic and a stabilizing supply chain, logistics, and labor market.
Based on this outlook, our 2022 guidance is as follows.
Net sales are approximately $2 billion to $2.2 billion.
With regard to SG&A, it is important to note that our adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to increase approximately 21% of which approximately $32 million is from acquisitions.
Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is approximately $130 million to $160 million.
Depreciation and amortization of approximately $65 million.
Interest expense is approximately $28 million to $30 million.
Provision for income tax expense approximately $13 million to $17 million.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share approximately $0.65 to $1.35.
And capital expenditures of approximately $85 million.
With our recent acquisitions and growing rental fleets, I think it's worth taking a moment to discuss how these initiatives will impact our capital expenditure investments.
As we have discussed before, oftentimes a crane is rented for two years and then sold after the acquisition value has decreased.
As such, there is always a certain level of churn in a rental fleet.
As we sell use machines, we will replenish the rental fleet with the proceeds.
We expect this to be approximately $35 million in 2022.
In addition, we are still growing our rental fleets strategically to support RPOs and market share growth and target markets such as the German Tower Crane Market.
This capex investment will approximate $25 million in 2022.
The remaining $25 million of capex will be for a normal factory capex.
Please keep in mind that the management of our rental fleet and the related capex is far more dynamic than the traditional manufacturing capex.
It is heavily dependent upon opportunistic sales transactions.
In certain instances, capex could be generated by an unexpected sale of a crane that is on rent, which will likely need to need to be replaced.
In other instances, capex can be generated by an RPO opportunity, which can be multi crane deals.
Let's move to Slide 6.
As we begin in 2022, our strategy remains unchanged and underpinned by our four strategic initiatives.
We will continue to look for attractive acquisitions to help accelerate these initiatives, and we will opportunistically evaluate our capital and debt structure to help ensure that we have the necessary flexibility as the US economy faces increasing interest rates.
Adding a little more clarity and focus to our strategy, I am pleased to announce our vision for aftermarket, which we call Cranes Plus 50.
Our goal is to increase our aftermarket or non-new machine sales by 50% over the next five years.
Historically, our business model has been highly product focus.
Our objective is to grow beyond machines and products and to sell more aftermarket parts, field service, lifting solutions, RPOs, rentals for fleet management, used sales, remanufactured cranes, and digital solutions that provide greater customer connectivity.
As a jumping-off point, we ended 2021 with $449 million in non-new machine sales, which will be outlined in our 10-K filing.
In closing, Manitowoc continues to strive to get closer to our customers and to grow our less cyclical and higher-margin revenue streams.
We continue to reposition the company for long-term growth while we weather the near-term economic storm.
We are confident that our investment in our four growth initiatives will allow us to deliver on our Cranes Plus 50 strategies and increase our non-new machine sales by 50% over the next five years, which we believe will fuel greater long-term returns for our shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'll now discuss the financial results.
We generated net sales of $270.4 million during the second quarter of 2021, which represents an increase of 44.2%, compared to $187.5 million during the second quarter of 2020.
The grows of -- the growth was mainly the result of increased demand for our products across all product lines, coupled with increased pricing, mostly related to raw material cost inflation.
More specifically, we posted net sales growth of four -- of 34.6% in our North American fenestration segment, 25.5% in our North American cabinet components segment, and 92.1% in our European fenestration segment, excluding the foreign exchange impact.
As a reminder, both of our manufacturing facilities in the U.K. were shut down late March of 2020 and did not resume operations until mid to late May last year.
In an effort to provide a more realistic comp, on a consolidated basis, we posted revenue growth of 20.6% in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2019 prior to COVID.
We reported net income of $14.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the three months ended April 30, 2021, compared to $5.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the three months ended April 30, 2020.
The increase in net income was mostly due to higher volumes and improved operating leverage.
However, this improvement was somewhat offset by a $13 million increase in SG&A during the quarter, $9.7 million of which was related to the valuation of our stock-based comp awards, and $3.1 million of which was due to higher and more normalized medical claims.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter increased by 47.7% to $32.2 million, compared to $21.8 million during the same period of last year.
The improved profitability was again largely due to increased operating leverage from higher volumes.
From a margin standpoint, this increase represents adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 30 basis points on a consolidated basis.
However, we did realize significant adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in our North American and European fenestrations segments.
Margins were pressured in our North American cabinet components segment, primarily due to hardwood cost inflation.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Cash provided by operating activities was $32.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021, compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended April 30, 2020.
Free cash flow came in at $27.8 million for the quarter, compared to essentially zero free cash flow in Q2 of last year.
Year to date, as of April 30, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $29 million, compared to $2.5 million for the same period of last year.
And free cash flow year to date as of April 30, 2021, was $19.2 million, compared to a negative $12.8 million during the same period of 2020.
Our strong free cash flow generation during the quarter enabled us to repay $25 million in bank debt and repurchased approximately 2 million of our stock.
Our balance sheet is strong.
Our liquidity position continues to improve, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA improved to 0.3 times as of April 30, 2021.
We will remain focused on managing working capital and generating cash as the year progresses.
Based on our strong first-half results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year again and now expect approximately 20% sales growth in our North American fenestration segment, approximately 15% sales growth in our North American cabinet components segment, and approximately 40% sales growth in our European fenestration segment.
We're now comfortable providing the following full-year 2021 guidance for modeling purposes.
Net sales of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA of $125 million to $130 million.
Depreciation of approximately $33 million.
Amortization of approximately $14 million.
SG&A of approximately $115 million.
Note, this is higher than previously expected ...
...ncrease of approximately 92%.
Strong demand for our products continues in both vinyl extrusions and spacers as the repair and remodel markets in the U.K. and continental Europe remain strong.
Adjusted EBITDA of $12.9 million for the quarter was $10 million better than the prior year, but it is important to remember that our U.K. plants were shut down for part of the prior-year comp period.
Also contributing to the strong results were volume-related operating leverage and pricing actions, which helped offset inflationary pressures.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $110.7 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 million resulted in margin expansion of approximately 840 basis points as compared to the first half of last year.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $63.6 million in Q2, which was $12.9 million or approximately 26% better than prior year.
Note that this growth rate was slightly higher when compared to the latest KCMA data for the semi-custom segment which came in at 24.2% growth over the same period.
Favorable comps due to the COVID impact in Q2 of last year, higher index pricing, and higher order demand all contributed to solid revenue growth in the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $3 million in this segment, which was 21.6% higher than prior year.
Although we are being impacted by the timing lag of our index pricing mechanisms on the hardwood, operating leverage from higher volume and incremental pricing on certain products all contributed to holding adjusted EBITDA margin relatively flat versus prior-year Q2.
In fact, the rapid increase in hardwood prices has impacted adjusted EBITDA by $1.7 million year to date.
And if we adjust for this inflation, we would have realized approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion in this segment.
On a year-to-date basis, operational improvements and volume-related leverage gains have helped offset the timing-related material impacts and resulted in margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points.
Unallocated corporate and other costs were $4.3 million for the quarter, which is $7.2 million higher than the prior year.
As Scott mentioned earlier, the primary drivers of this increase were stock-based compensation expense, operating incentive accruals, and more normalized medical expenses as our employees and their families have started to feel more comfortable going back to their doctors.
As I mentioned earlier, our priority has been meeting customer demand, furthering our operational excellence programs, optimizing our cash flow, and improving return on invested capital across all segments of our business.
Despite inflationary headwinds, we continue to make progress in these areas and this work has strengthened our balance sheet by enabling us to further pay down debt during the quarter, while still repurchasing approximately $2 million in treasury stock.
Going forward, our capital deployment strategy will remain intact as we execute on our path to being debt-free.
We will opportunistically evaluate stock repurchases and continue to invest in projects that grow revenue and improve our ROIC.
In addition, the board recently approved the capacity expansion project of our spacer plant in Germany and we're also currently evaluating additional capacity projects in our screens and cabinet component business in North America.
Note that due to the extended lead times of equipment, we don't expect to realize any benefits from these projects until next year at the earliest.
In summary, our outlook on demand for our products remains strong for the remainder of the year.
We are executing on our plan and performing well from an operational standpoint.
With these points in mind, on a consolidated basis, we're confident in our ability to deliver revenue growth in the low-20% range this year, while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margin in the low-12% range despite the increasing inflationary pressures.
And with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm pleased to report that we experienced a very successful year, both financially and operationally, especially with our revenue and earnings per share growth.
As we begin 2022, we believe that Rollins is poised to deliver on our short-term and long-term objectives.
We look forward to sharing our progress with you as the new year unfolds.
As we previously disclosed, the company is in discussion with the staff at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve our SEC investigation.
During the fourth quarter, we increased the accrual related to this matter to $8 million for a potential settlement.
Given that the investigation is ongoing and out of respect for the process, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we are focused on resolving this inquiry in the very near future.
As Gary mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our 2021 performance and very proud of the hard-working men and women of our company that propelled us to achieve record levels of revenue growth across each of our brands.
I'm also pleased to note that we again realized a very strong performance in our termite service line, posting year-over-year double-digit growth of 14.3%.
While our termite business has been growing by double digits for several years in a row now, termite damage claims, as well as any related to litigation have declined year by year reaching our lowest level in recent history during 2021.
To be more specific, termite damage claims received have declined from a high of 9,349 to the low of 380 new claims received this past year while, at the same time, revenue from termite has tripled.
The genesis of this great story started with a serious commitment to address a problem that had been building for several years.
Obviously, resolve alone wouldn't clean up a problem that large.
Success came from a series of changes initiated by our leadership team to our culture, our training, our treatment protocols, and our quality assurance processes.
We significantly improved and expanded training of our field service and sales team members, and our managers made that training mandatory before you could be allowed to service our customers.
We held hundreds of regional training meetings and a multitude of termite-specific training modules were developed.
We revised our treatment protocols to solve situations we were experiencing, due in part to evolving new construction practices in various markets.
These revised treatment protocols, in many cases, exceeded state treating requirements.
Additionally, we created a nationwide quality assurance team that took control of the claims process, requiring our branch offices to report each claim immediately.
This ensured a quick response to our customers when most needed.
This QA group also went to the field and inspected our team's work and verified that things were being done according to our new treating requirements.
Finally, and maybe most important, the most difficult change was to our culture.
As an example, any location failing quality assurance team inspections had to make a trip to the Division President of the company.
Those that failed to adjust and adhere to the new practices by the time a follow-up QA visit occurred didn't receive a return trip.
Change came quickly due to those practices.
Fast forward to today and all our newly acquired companies are brought under these standards as quickly as possible.
We believe these service level commitments are important to meet our -- or exceed the expectations our customers have for us.
Operationally, our service offering is led by a very strong and dedicated termite services group and a very experienced technical service team.
I'm proud to work for a company that has made these commitments to protect our customers, our brands, and our reputation.
2021 was a strong and productive year for Rollins' family of pest control brands.
Q4 revenues increased 11.9% to $600.3 million, compared to $536.3 million the previous year.
Net income rose to $65.3...
...rew 11.9%, 8.4% organic; commercial grew 11.4%, 9.3% organic; lastly, we have termite, which grew 13.6% with 10.1% organic.
For the full year 2021 over 2020, residential grew 12.9%, 10% organic; commercial grew 10.2%, 7.4% organic; and we closed out with termite at a 14.3% growth, 11.9% organic.
Now, to our income.
For the fourth quarter and year to date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the one-time super vesting of our late chairman stock grants in the third quarter of 2020, the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first six months of 2021 and our recorded accruals related to the potential settlement of the SEC matter in the third and fourth quarters of 2021.
Fourth-quarter adjusted 2021 EBITDA was $122.2 million or 11.2% over 2020.
Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.14 per diluted share or 7.7% improvement over 2020.
For the full year 2021, our adjusted EBITDA was $546.4 million or 20.1% over last year.
Year to date, 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 per diluted share or 25.9% over 2020.
For fourth quarter 2021, gross margin increased 50.4% or 0.10 point over last year.
That was after overcoming our strong headwinds of fleet expenses, specifically fuel in the amount of $4.5 million and termite M&F for $2.7 million.
Sales, general and administrative fourth quarter 2021 margin increased 1.6% over last year.
This was driven by the increase in sales salaries mentioned by Jerry along with the increased SEC accrual.
Without these two items, our SG&A fourth-quarter margin presented an improvement over fourth quarter 2020.
Related to the SEC potential settlement, we recorded an accrual of $5 million in Q4.
This was in addition to the $3 million we previously accrued in the third quarter.
These amounts are not tax-deductible for state or federal taxes.
The company continues to cooperate with the SEC and working toward a final resolution.
During the year, we completed significant remediation efforts, including the addition of a Chief Accounting Officer, SEC Attorney, and SEC External Reporting Director.
Also, we reevaluated and strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting, while improving processes, procedures, and related supporting documentation, including those related to management's judgments and estimates.
Now, for a few notes regarding our cash flow.
Our dividends full year 2021 were $208.7 million or an increase of 30% over 2020, while cash used for acquisitions declined 5.8% to $139 million for 2021.
We ended the current period with $105.3 million in cash, of which $78.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
As you've probably noted over time, our foreign cash held has increased with the exception of use for acquisitions.
We are in the process of restructuring our foreign entities to make cash from foreign operations more readily available.
This should be completed later in 2022.
Now, to free cash flow.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was $88.9 million, or a decrease of 0.8% over last year.
The decline was due to a capital expenditure increase from upgrading our data center facility as part of our cybersecurity initiatives.
Full-year free cash flow was $395 million or a decrease of $41 million.
This decline was primarily due to the $30 million 2020 carry back taxes paid in 2021 and a $32 million gain from the sale of the Clark properties, the latter of which is an operating cash reconciling item.
Last, I'm happy to share that yesterday our board of directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2022.
This represents a 25% increase over the March 2021 regular cash dividend paid out.
The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in 2021 and that accentuates our financial strength, our solid capital position, and the board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our consolidated earnings for the second quarter of 2020 were $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $0.38 for the second quarter of 2019.
For year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $0.98 per diluted share for 2020, compared to $2.14 last year.
Now, I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.
We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these uncertain times.
It's hard to believe that we've been managing through the COVID-19 pandemic for five months now.
And every day, I continue to be inspired by how our employees continue to rally on all fronts to respond to the crisis.
I couldn't be more proud of how we're staying vigilant and adapting across the organization to the new policies and procedures that can quickly change in the states where we serve.
I appreciate their patience, their persistence and professionalism, as we all navigate through these unchartered waters to seek out our new normal, all while still providing the energy that is so essential to our customers.
As always, our top priority is to preserve the health and safety of our customers, our employees, contractors and our communities.
As the regional economies across the areas we serve move forward with fits and start, we're doing our best to support those customers, who we know are struggling.
You may have seen recently the Avista Foundation provided more than $500,000 to support 37 different organizations throughout our service area.
And so far in 2020, our foundation has provided more than $1.5 million to help those in need.
Although the majority of our employees are still working from home, it hasn't impacted our ability to complete important work across our business.
Wildfires continue to be an important topic for our industry and our company, especially this time of year.
Before the wildfire season arrived, we enhanced our 10-year wildfire resiliency plan to expand our current safeguards for preventing, mitigating and reducing the impact of wildfires to help minimize the possibility of wildfires and the related service disruptions.
Our team spent the last year developing our plan through a series of internal workshops, industry research and engagement with state and local fire agencies.
The plan has certain key areas that include grid hardening, vegetation management, situational awareness, operations and emergency response and worker and public safety.
In total, we expect to spend approximately $330 million implementing the plan components over the life of the 10-year plan.
We're also excited for construction to be completed on the Catalyst Building and the Scott Morris Center for Energy Innovation.
We can hardly wait for the buildings to open next month and when they do, Scott Morris' vision to create the five smartest blocks in the world will become a reality.
Avista will be able to continue to innovate and test new ideas about how to share energy in a shared economy model.
And what we learn could not only shape how the grid of the future will operate, but also could provide a transformative new model for the entire utility industry.
Last year, we established a goal to serve our customers with a 100% clean electricity by 2045 and a 100% carbon-neutral resources by 2027.
Consistent with our goal and our 2020 Integrated Resource Plan, we are seeking proposals from renewable energy project developers, who are capable of constructing, owning and operating up to 120 average megawatts.
Our intent is to secure the output from the renewable generation resources, including energy, capacity and associated environmental attributes.
This will allow us to offset market purchases and fossil fuel thermal generation, which is a key step to achieving our goals.
With respect to results, our second quarter consolidated earnings were in line with expectations and we are on track to meet our 2020 earnings guidance at Avista Utilities, AEL&P and our other businesses.
As such, we are confirming our 2020 consolidated earnings guidance, a range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted s...
...ughout most of the year, with a gradual recovery toward the end of the year.
We expect to be able to mostly offset the lower utility margin through our cost management activities, and this is reflected in our consolidated guidance.
We do expect a gradual economic recovery, but prolonged high unemployment that will depress load and customer growth into 2021.
We have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which help mitigate the impact of these load changes on our -- the impact on our revenues for residential and certain commercial customers.
Over 90% of our utility revenue is covered by regulatory mechanisms.
During the second quarter, we began experiencing some supply chain delays due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with delays ranging from a couple of weeks to up to six weeks in some cases.
However, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our planned projects and we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure and expect our spending in 2020 to be still be about $405 million.
With respect to liquidity, at June 30, we had $160 million of available liquidity under our $400 million line of credit and we had $100 million in cash from our term loan.
In the second quarter, we extended our line of credit agreement a year to April 2022.
We expect to issue this year approximately $165 million of long-term debt and up to $70 million of equity, and that includes $24 million that we've issued through June.
As Dennis mentioned earlier, we are confirming our 2020 guidance, with a consolidated range of $1.75 to $1.95.
We're expecting that COVID-19 impacts at Avista Utilities of increased operating expenses include bad debt expense, reduced industrial loads and increased interest will be mostly offset by expected tax benefits from the CARES Act and other efforts to identify cost reduction opportunities that we have implemented.
We have filed for deferred accounting treatment in each of our jurisdictions.
And as I said earlier, in Idaho, the Idaho Commission issued an order that allows us to defer certain costs related to COVID-19, net of any decreased costs and other benefits.
The Idaho Commission will determine the appropriateness and prudency of any deferred expenses when we seek recovery.
We continue to expect -- to experience regulatory lag until 2023, we filed the general rate case in Oregon in March of 2020 and continue to anticipate filing in Washington and Idaho in the fourth quarter of this year.
We expect our long-term earnings growth after 2023 to be 4% to 6%.
Now, with the specifics on the ranges for each segment.
We expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.77 to $1.89 per diluted share.
The midpoint of our range does not include any expense or benefit under the ERM and our current expectation is that we will be in a benefit of a 90/10 sharing band, which is expected to add $0.06 per diluted share.
Our outlook for Avista Utilities assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation, temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year and we have implemented the cost reduction measures to help mitigate the impacts of costs related to COVID-19.
For 2020, we expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.07 to $0.11 per share and our outlook for AEL&P assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year.
And we continue to expect our other businesses to have a loss of between $0.09 and $0.05 per diluted share.
Our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual items; such as settlement transactions or acquisitions and dispositions until the effects are known and certain.
We cannot predict the duration or severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic.
And the longer and more severe economic restrictions and business disruption, the greater the impact on our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 As always, we appreciate your interest in Central Pacific Financial Corp.
Let me start first with some positive updates on the Hawaii economic recovery.
Visitor arrivals from the U.S. Mainland to Hawaii have returned much quicker than anticipated, a good sign for economic recovery.
The daily arrival count have averaged about 30,000 per day since June, which is nearly at pre-pandemic level.
In early July, the state of Hawaii began allowing arriving passengers to skip pre-testing and quarantining with proof of full vaccination against COVID in the U.S. Although we are not immune to the spike caused by the Delta variant, Hawaii's COVID infection rates continue to be at very low level, with our infection rates currently at the lowest in the nation.
Nearly 60% of our state population is fully vaccinated as of July 21, 2021.
The state of Hawaii's unemployment rate declined to 7.7% in the month of June and is forecasted by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization to decline to 4.8% in 2022.
The housing market in Hawaii remains hot with the median single-family home price at $979,000 in the month of June.
Our financial results for the second quarter were very strong, with quarterly pre-tax income reaching a new record high.
With increased confidence in the Hawaii economic recovery and our continued solid asset quality, liquidity, and capital, we resumed share repurchases during the second quarter and continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend.
Against this backdrop, we are very optimistic about our future business profit.
Digital continues to be a key strategic priority for us.
Enhancements to our online and mobile banking platforms are being made on a continual basis.
Additionally, in the second quarter, we issued new contactless debit cards to all of our customers and increased mobile deposit adoption among our customer base.
Further, online chat is now available and online appointment schedule is coming soon to make banking easier and more convenient for our customers.
We continue to work diligently on our product and service development in the digital area.
First, I'd like to provide an update on the credit area.
We are pleased that our clients have weathered through the challenges of the pandemic.
Nearly all of the loans we granted, COVID-related payment deferrals have returned to pay status.
As of June 30, we have just $3.5 million in loans remaining on deferral, the majority of which are residential mortgages.
Additionally, our classified assets declined during the quarter to $42 million, and our nonperforming assets remain near historic lows at just nine basis points of assets.
I'd also like to share about a recent developments in the environmental, social, and governance or ESG area.
In the second quarter, we were pleased to publish our first annual 2020 ESG report.
We continue to develop our ESG reporting and look forward to providing further updates in the future.
CPB's legacy in helping the small business community is one of the pillars of our ESG program and remains a key priority for us.
Last week, we were pleased to announce the new program run by our CPB foundation call We, that is W-E By Rising Tide.
This program supports women entrepreneurs as we believe they are key to building a strong and resilient economy.
As part of this program, we selected our first cohort of 20 women entrepreneurs from seven different business sectors that will participate in a 10-week series of workshop on financial management, marketing, and leadership and receive free advertising and networking benefits.
Support of our employees is another color of our ESG program.
We believe that investing in our employees is critical to our success.
During the second quarter, we had our annual merit increases and we made a few key strategic new hires.
We also continue to prioritize the health and well-being of our employees and therefore, continue to allow flexible work schedule while developing our hybrid return-to-office plan.
Finally, ...
...bout 5% sequential quarter growth.
On a year-over-year basis, total core deposits increased by $705 million or 13.8%.
Additionally, our average cost of total deposits outweigh the second quarter by just six basis points.
Finally, I want to mention that the Hawaii economy is recovering and consumer confidence is increasing.
We are seeing positive trends in transactional fee income recovery, including investment services fees.
Net income for the second quarter was $18.7 million or $0.66 per diluted share.
Return on average assets was 1.06% and return on average equity was 13.56%.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $52.1 million, which increased from the prior quarter, primarily due to greater recognition of PPP fee income due to higher forgiveness.
Net interest income included $7.9 million in PPP net interest income and net loan fees compared to $5.2 million in the prior quarter.
At June 30, unearned net PPP fees was $15.9 million.
Net interest margin decreased to 3.16% compared to 3.19% in the prior quarter.
The net interest margin normalized for PPP was 2.93% compared to 3.12% in the previous quarter.
The normalized NIM decrease was due to an acceleration of MBS premium amortization, excess balance sheet liquidity, and lower investment and loan yields.
Investment MBS premium amortization increased by $900,000 sequential quarter due to an acceleration of prepayments in the second quarter.
To mitigate the prepayment risk going forward, we executed a sovereign coupon MBS bond swap totaling $175 million.
We continue to deploy excess liquidity to the loan and investment portfolios to further support our net interest margin.
Second quarter other operating income remained relatively flat at $10.5 million.
During the quarter, there was a decrease in mortgage banking income, which was offset by higher service charges and fees and bank-owned life insurance income.
Other operating expense for the second quarter was $41.4 million compared to $37.8 million in the prior quarter, with much of the increase in the salaries and benefits line.
The current quarter increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to $1.2 million in nonrecurring reductions in the prior quarter and $2.8 million in higher incentive compensation and commission accruals, strategic hires to drive forward performance, and annual merit increase.
The efficiency ratio increased to 66.2% in the second quarter due to higher other operating expenses.
We expect the efficiency ratio to moderate and improve over time as we drive positive operating leverage based on our strategic investments.
Net charge-offs in the second quarter totaled $0.8 million, with the majority of charge-offs coming from the consumer loan portfolio.
At June 30, our allowance for credit losses was $77.8 million or 1.68% of outstanding loans, excluding the PPP loans.
In the second quarter, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to the provision for credit losses due to improvements in the economic forecast and our known portfolio.
The effective tax rate was 23.9% in the second quarter and going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range.
Our capital position remains strong and as Paul noted earlier, we resumed share repurchases this quarter with repurchases of 156,600 shares at a total cost of $4.3 million.
We've also repurchased an additional 78,000 shares of common stock month-to-date through July 20 at an average cost of $24.93.
Finally, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share, which was consistent with the prior quarter.
In summary, Central Pacific has a solid financial credit, liquidity, and capital position, and we continue to make positive forward progress on our core business strategy.
Further, we remain committed to providing support to our employees, customers, and the community as we continue to progress through the economic recovery.
At this time, we'll be happy to address any questions you may have.
Back to you, Andrew.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.
Actual results may differ materially from those projected.
Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic's severity and duration; healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests; the pandemic's impact on the US healthcare system and the US economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control.
Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing.
Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.
Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business.
Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer.
While our base business continued to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year and 2019.
In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound in September.
Importantly, our base business continued to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery.
We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher than anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures.
The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day.
But before turning to our results into the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our progress we've made in our Quest for Health Equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods.
Since we've established just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing of vaccination events, to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico.
Recently, we announced a collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for Black and Hispanic scholars and drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief.
We're off to a good start and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year.
Now turning to our results for the third quarter.
Total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year.
The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business.
Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September to approximately $1.75 billion.
Now, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to the spread of the Delta variant over the c...
...isitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year.
We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the Delta variant and the timing of summer vacations.
Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter.
This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically total revenue and volumes typically step down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality.
As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country.
We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter.
So far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3 but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the Delta variant, while the base business continues to improve since September.
Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and, to a lesser extent, recent PLS wins.
Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations.
Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year.
On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year.
The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business.
Reported earnings per share was $4.02 in the quarter compared to $4.14 a year ago.
Adjusted earnings per share was $3.96 compared to $4.31 last year.
Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September year-to-date versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year.
Turning to guidance, we have raised our full-year 2021 outlook as follows.
Revenue is expected to be between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year.
Reported earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $14.69 [Phonetic] and $15.09 and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90.
Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.
Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook.
We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year.
At the low end of our outlook, we assume approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4 and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day.
As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through late January.
We expect reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year.
However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing.
Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4 versus 2019.
Getting to the midpoint or higher end of our outlook ranges assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business.
Well, to summarize, we had a strong third quarter.
We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher than anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as our continued progress we expect to see in our base business.
And finally, the momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day.

[/INST] # Quest Diagnostics reported strong Q3 results, with COVID-19 molecular volumes increasing throughout the summer. Despite softness in the base business in late summer, it rebounded in September and continued to improve sequentially, indicating ongoing recovery. The company raised its full-year outlook due to higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes and base business growth. Key points include: total revenue between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share between $13.50 and $13.90, and reported earnings per share between $14.69 and $15.09. The company assumes continued decline in COVID-19 molecular volumes, stable reimbursement rates, and low single-digit base business revenue growth in Q4. Quest's momentum in its base business positions it to achieve its 2022 outlook.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our co-chief executive officers; Frank Svoboda, our chief financial officer; and Brian Mitchell, our general counsel.
Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures.
In the fourth quarter, net income was $187 million or $1.69 per share, compared to $165 million or $1.45 per share a year ago.
Net operating income for the quarter was $188 million or $1.70 per share, a per share increase of 9% from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity for the year was 11.6%, and book value per share was $66.02.
Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.5%, and book value per share grew 9% to $48.26.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $631 million, and life underwriting margin was $177 million, up 6% from a year ago.
In 2020, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 7% to $275 million, and health underwriting margin was up 5% to $61 million.
Growth in premium exceeded underwriting margin growth, primarily due to lower margins at Liberty National.
In 2020, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 4% to 6%.
Administrative expenses were $61 million for the quarter, up 7% from a year ago.
As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7%, the same as a year ago.
For the full year, administrative expenses were $240 million or 6.7% of premium, compared to 6.5% in 2018.
In 2020, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6%, and to be around 6.7% of premium.
I want to go through the fourth-quarter results at each of our distribution channels.
I'll start out by saying I'm pleased with the sales growth in our agencies in 2019.
I'm particularly pleased with the agent count growth and middle management increase we have seen across all of our exclusive agencies in 2019.
At American income, life premiums were up 8% to $297 million.
And life underwriting margin was up 9% to $98 million.
Net life sales were $59 million, up 9%.
The average producing count for the fourth quarter was 7,631, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and up 1% from the third quarter.
The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 7,551.
Net life sales for the full-year 2019 grew 6%.
The sales increase was driven by increases in agent count.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 3% to $72 million, and underwriting margin was up 4% to $18 million.
Net life sales increased 13% to $15 million, and net health sales were $7 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.
The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,534, up 17% from the year-ago quarter and up 6% from the third quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,660.
Net life sales for the full-year 2019 grew 9%.
Net health sales for the full-year 2019 grew 11%.
The sales increase was driven by increases in agent count.
To better describe our nonagency business at Globe Life management insurance company, we have begun replacing the term direct response to direct-to-consumer.
And our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums are up 4% to $209 million, and life underwriting margin was flat at $39 million.
Net life sales were $30 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.
For the full-year 2019, net life sales were flat, due primarily to a decrease in juvenile mailing volume resulting from a decline in the response rates from our juvenile mailing offers.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $76 million, and health underwriting margin increased 7% to $19 million.
Net health sales were up 19% to $18 million due to an increase in both agent productivity and agent count.
The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,228 up 9% from the year-ago quarter and up 8% from the third quarter.
The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,286.
Net health sales for the full-year 201...
...we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next five years.
First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million.
In addition to these liquid assets, the parent generated excess cash flow in 2019 of $374 million, as compared to $349 million in 2018.
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life shareholders.
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we had $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on our prior calls, we accelerated the repurchase of $25 million of Globe Life shares into December of 2018, with commercial paper and parent cash.
We utilized $20 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases, that left $395 million available for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain as a parent.
In the fourth quarter, we spent $93 million to buy 930,000 Globe Life shares at an average price of $99.82.
For the full-year 2019, we spent $350 million of parent company cash to acquire 3.9 million shares at an average price of $89.04.
So far in 2020, we have spent $33.5 million to buy 322,000 shares at an average price of $104.20.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $45 million.
In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2020.
While our 2019 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2020 to be in the range of $375 million to $395 million.
Thus, including the assets on hand at January 1, we currently expect to have around $420 million to $440 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent in 2020.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible.
It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand our information technology and other operational capabilities and acquire new long-duration assets to fund future cash needs.
With the parent company excess cash flows, if market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
We believe a yield to return that is better than other available alternatives and provides a return that exceeds our cost of equity.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries.
Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rating.
As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company-action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.
Although we have not finalized our 2019 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio for 2019 will be toward the higher end of this range.
For 2020, we will continue to target a consolidated company-action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance.
As Gary previously noted, net operating income per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.70.
In addition, net operating income per share for the full-year 2019 was $6.75.
This was $0.01 above the midpoint of our previous guidance.
Primarily due to greater-than-anticipated life underwriting income at Liberty National and higher excess investment income.
For 2020, we are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.03 to $7.23.
The $7.13 midpoint of this guidance is slightly lower than previous guidance due to higher-than-expected employee pension and healthcare costs in 2020.
Those are my comments.
Those are our comments.

[/INST] # Net income increased to $187 million ($1.69 per share) from $165 million ($1.45 per share) in Q4 2019. Life insurance operations contributed significantly, with premium revenue rising 5% and life underwriting margin increasing 6%. Health premiums also grew 7%, with underwriting margin increasing 5%. Administrative expenses rose 7% annually, but remained stable as a percentage of premium. Several distribution channels experienced sales growth: American Income's life premiums increased 8%, Liberty National's net life and health sales grew 13% and 12%, respectively, and Family Heritage's health premiums rose 8%. The company emphasized agent count growth, with American Income's producing agent count up 10% and Liberty National's up 17%. Globe Life's direct-to-consumer division saw a 4% increase in life premiums. For 2020, the company projects net operating income per share in the range of $7.03 to $7.23, driven by growth in life and health underwriting income, partially offset by increased employee pension and healthcare costs.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me here, I have Scott Barbour, our President and CEO; and Scott Cottrill, our CFO.
A copy of the release has also been included in an 8-K submitted to the SEC.
We delivered another quarter of record financial performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Sales grew 20% year-over-year, driven by 21% residential sales growth and 11% non-residential sales growth as we continued to execute at both ADS and Infiltrator in a favorable demand environment.
The residential market remains strong.
Both ADS and Infiltrator residential market sales grew over 20% in the fourth quarter, driven by favorable dynamics in new home construction, repair/remodel and on-site septic, accelerated by our material conversion strategies at both businesses.
Residential market sales have increased to 39% of our domestic sales as compared to 23% prior to the Infiltrator acquisition.
The market indicators show that homebuilders continue to acquire land for future development and that there is an overall shortage in available homes, which drives the front-end new community development sales of ADS, and the on-site septic system sales of Infiltrator are driven during the home completion stage.
In addition, the repair/remodel business remains robust.
ADS participates in the repair/remodel segment of the residential market through retail, which is about 40% of the legacy business' residential sales.
Infiltrator's repair/remodel business in the residential on-site septic market accounts for roughly one-third of their business.
Growth in our non-residential end market was broad based throughout the United States.
We continue to benefit from growth in horizontal construction, such as warehouses, distribution centers, data centers, as well as the developments that follow the residential buildout.
About two-thirds of our domestic allied product sales are in the non-residential markets, where sales increased 13% further, giving us confidence in the underlying market strength.
Sales in the agriculture market increased 50% this quarter, driven by strong demand as the spring selling season got off to a good start.
The agriculture economy remains favorable and we continue to benefit from the programs we put in place around organizational changes, new product introductions and improving execution.
We experienced strong demand in the Midwest region, particularly in Minnesota, Ohio, Iowa and Michigan.
Further, we are expanding our presence in key strategic areas like Missouri and parts of the Southeast to drive increased market share.
International sales also increased 49%, primarily driven by sales growth in our Canadian business which nearly doubled compared to last year.
Canada is doing well across both the construction and agriculture end markets, with similar trends to the United States.
Additionally, this quarter, we continued to leverage our pipe manufacturing facilities in Mexico to help service the strong demand we experienced in the United States.
Finally, Infiltrator continues to exceed expectations with 23% sales growth in the fourth quarter against a very tough comparison to the prior year and broad-based growth across the Infiltrator product portfolio.
This includes double-digit growth in tanks and leachfield products, with strong growth in Florida, Tennessee, Alabama and Indiana, among other states.
This was led by our material conversion strategy of displacing concrete septic tanks with plastic tanks, and the economic advantages of septic chambers in leachfield systems.
The Infiltrator business is benefiting from strong distribution presence in the Southeast and Midwest, as well as rapidly growing micropolitan areas which typically lack the sewer infrastructure needed to support rapid housing development.
We achieved record fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA during the period.
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points.
The increase in profitability in both businesses was driven by leverage from the strong sales growth, favorable pricing as well as...
...es, down from 21% of sales last year.
Further, our trailing 12-month leverage ratio is now 1.1 times.
We ended the quarter in a favorable -- very favorable liquidity position with $195 million of cash and $339 million available under our revolving credit facility, bringing our total liquidity to $534 million.
And finally, on Slide 10, we have our fiscal 2022 guidance.
Based on our performance to date, order activity, backlog and current market trends, we currently expect net sales to be in the range of $2.220 billion to $2.300 billion, representing growth of 12% to 16% over this past year, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $635 million to $665 million, representing growth of 12% to 17% over this past year.
As we look to[Phonetic] fiscal 2022, we are confident in the demand environment across our end markets.
Our residential end-market growth is also expected to remain strong, particularly in those key southern crescent states we are focused on, including Florida and Texas.
In addition, our agricultural market remains robust with strength in crop pricing, driving investments in land productivity through better field drainage.
And finally, the international outlook is turning more favorable driven by our business in Canada, which is our largest international market.
Lastly, the exports business is expected to rebound as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease.
This strong demand outlook gives us confidence in our revenue guidance.
We have also executed several price increases since our third quarter call across all of our end markets at both ADS and Infiltrator.
To date, our pricing actions are flowing through and we will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure we stay ahead of inflationary cost pressures.
On the cost side, we are seeing inflationary pressure in materials, labor and transportation, as well as some issues with labor availability.
Within transportation, the third-party market availability is tight and there is inflationary cost pressure on diesel, wages and common carrier rates.
In this type of inflationary cost environment, we are also able to control our transportation cost better than most due to our large internal fleet, and we are working to leverage such to offset the rising cost we are seeing through payload efficiency, route planning and other programs to more efficiently serve our customers.
While we expect EBITDA margins to be flat to slightly up this year, it is important to highlight that we expect the most pressure on our price/cost spread to occur during the first half of our fiscal year.
Bottom line, we believe our long-term growth and margin expansion ability remains intact, despite the near-term inflationary cost environment we will be dealing with this year.
Given our strong balance sheet and leverage position, strategic capital deployment remains one of our top priorities.
We will continue to execute a balanced and disciplined capital deployment strategy, focusing on organic investments as our highest-return, lowest-risk option.
In fiscal 2022, we plan to spend between $130 million and $150 million on capital expenditures to support growth, recycling, innovation, productivity, and safety initiatives at both ADS and Infiltrator, basically doubling our commitment to capex year-over-year.
In addition to organic investments, we continue to actively explore M&A opportunities that are aligned with our strategic vision.
We are extremely excited about the M&A opportunities we are pursuing and see this as a key component of our capital deployment strategy in both the near term and longer term.
In addition to investing in the business through deploying capital organically and through M&A, we, today, announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend as well as a $250 million increase in our share repurchase program.
We previously had $42 million available under this program, and the increase announced today brings the total authorization to $292 million.
Operator, please open the line.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I am joined with our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen.
During today's call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2020.
Finally, I'd like to remind folks, we have our Investor Day coming up six weeks from today on March 13 in Fort Worth, Texas.
The ITW team delivered another quarter of solid operational execution and strong financial performance in Q4.
Despite some broad-based macro challenges, we delivered GAAP earnings per share growth of 9%, operating margin of 23.7% and after-tax return on invested capital of 28.9% in the quarter.
For the full year, against the backdrop of an industrial demand environment that went from decelerating in the first half of the year to contracting in the second half of the year, we're continuing to execute well on the things within our control.
As a result, despite revenues that were down $700 million or 4.5% year-on-year, we delivered record GAAP earnings per share of $7.74, expanded operating margin to 24.4% excluding higher restructuring expenses and group free cash flow by 9%.
In addition, we were able to raise our dividend by 7% and returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Equally important, in 2019, we continued to make solid progress on our path to ITW's full potential performance through the execution of our enterprise strategy.
Last year, we invested more than $600 million to support the execution of our strategy and further enhanced the growth and profitability performance of our core businesses.
In addition, each of our divisions continued to make progress in executing well-defined and focused plans to achieve full potential performance in their respective businesses.
We look forward to providing a full progress update on our enterprise strategy and our progress toward ITW's full potential performance at our Investor Day in March.
Looking ahead, ITW's powerful and proprietary business model, diversified high quality business portfolio and dedicated team of highly skilled ITW colleagues around the world position us well to continue to deliver differentiated performance across a range of economic scenarios in 2020 and beyond.
In the fourth quarter, organic revenue declined 1.6% year-over-year in what remains a pretty challenging demand environment.
The strike at GM reduced our enterprise organic growth rate by approximately 50 basis points and Product Line Simplification was 60 basis points in the quarter.
By geography, North America was down 2% and international was down 1%.
Europe declined 1%, while Asia Pacific was flat.
Organic growth in China was broad-based across our portfolio and up 7% year-over-year.
As expected, our execution on the elements within our control remained strong in the fourth quarter.
Operating margin was 23.7%, including 40 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from higher restructuring expenses year-over-year.
Excluding those higher expenses, operating margin was up 10 basis points to 24.1%.
Enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points and price/cost was positive 30 basis points.
GAAP earnings per share was up 9% to $1.99 and included an $0.11 gain from three divestitures and $0.06 headwind from higher restructuring expenses year-over-year and foreign currency translation impact.
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8%.
Free cash flow was 114% of net income.
And as planned, we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter.
Overall, Q4 was another quarter characterized by strong operational execution and resilient financial performance in a pretty challenging demand environment.
Let's move to Slide 4 and operating margin.
Overall, operating margin of 23.7% was down 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher restructuring expense.
Excluding those higher restructuring expenses, margin improved 10 basis points despite a 3% decline in revenues.
Enterprise initiat...
...n sales, the plan is to offset any earnings per share dilution with incremental share repurchases.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of three businesses with combined 2019 revenues of approximately $135 million, generating a pre-tax gain on sale of $50 million or $0.11 a share.
In 2019, these businesses were a 20 basis points drag to our organic growth rate and 10 basis points to our margin rate.
On Slide 10, we wanted to give you a quick update on the progress that we're making on our organic growth initiatives.
We estimated the aggregate market growth rate or decline for each one of our segments and compared it to the segments actual organic growth rate in 2019.
We also included Product Line Simplification by segment.
As you know, full potential steady state PLS is expected to be about 30 basis points.
As you can see overall, we've made some good progress, as our segments are all outgrowing their underlying markets, except for Specialty Products.
At the enterprise level, we estimate that we outpaced our aggregate blended market growth rates by approximately one percentage point.
So overall good progress on our organic growth initiatives.
And by completing our Finish the Job agenda over the next several years, we expect to generate one to two percentage points of additional improvement in ITW's organic growth rate.
As Scott mentioned, we look forward to providing a full progress update at our Investor Day in March.
Now let's talk -- let's turn the page and talk about 2020, starting with Slide 11.
First, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.65 to $8.05 for 2020.
Using current levels of demand adjusted for seasonality, organic growth at the enterprise level is forecast to be in the range of 0% to 2% for the year.
At current exchange rates, foreign currency translation impact and the revenue associated with our 2019 divestitures are each of -- one percentage point headwind to revenue.
PLS impact is expected to be approximately 50 basis points.
We expect to expand operating margin from 24.1% in 2019 to a range of 24.5% to 25% in 2020 with enterprise initiatives contributing approximately 100 basis points.
After-tax ROIC should improve to a range of 29% to 30%.
And as usual, we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income.
We have allocated $2 billion to share repurchases with core share repurchases of $1.5 billion, an additional $500 million to offset the earnings per share dilution from the three completed divestitures.
Additional items include an expected tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, which represents a 10% -- $0.10 earnings per share headwind and foreign currency at today's rates is also unfavorable $0.10 of EPS.
Just a quick word as it relates to the Coronavirus situation in China and we're obviously in the same position as everyone else.
At this point, we've baked into our guidance a last week of production, assuming that we all return to work in China on February 10.
But obviously it's too early to tell and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely.
Overall, ITW is well positioned for differentiated financial performance across a wide range of scenarios as we continue to execute on the things within our control and make meaningful progress on our path to full potential performance through the implementation of our Finish the Job enterprise strategy agenda.
Finally, we're providing an organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2020 on Slide 12.
And as always, these are based on current run rates adjusted for seasonality and are obviously influenced by year-over-year comparisons as we go through the year.
It's important to note that there is no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance.
You can see that every segment is forecast to improve the organic growth rate in 2020 relative to 2019.
The same is true for margins, as every segment expects to improve the margin performance in 2020.
Julianne, we're ready to open up the lines for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Actual results could differ materially from expected results.
I hope you are all remaining safe and staying healthy.
The loss and anxiety caused by the pandemic is extraordinary.
And on behalf of everyone at RGA, I would like to express profound depreciation for those on the front lines in the fight against the pandemic and offer our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones.
Through these tough times, I remained incredibly proud of the role that RGA has played in an industry that helps to safeguard the financial futures of millions of families from the unforeseen tragedies of life.
Our purpose has never been made clear during this past year.
Let me now move to our results.
Last night we reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.19, which we consider another solid quarter in the context of the pandemic.
In this quarter, we were able to absorb estimated total COVID-19 related claim costs of $300 million globally and delivered profitable earnings due to the underlying strength in many of our businesses.
These include our Asia business, our US group and individual health operations and our US asset-intensive business.
Additionally, excluding the impact of claims attributed to COVID-19.
Our US individual mortality experience was again favorable this quarter.
Reported premium growth was strong, driven by results in EMEA and Asia.
We completed a number of transactions in the quarter and deployed approximately $100 million of capital.
The transaction pipeline is very good overall and includes opportunities in all our regions.
Our investment portfolio held up well, and we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, an excess capital of $1.3 billion.
Our approach to capital deployment during this crisis remains prudent, disciplined and balanced.
As I step back and consider our full year results, we reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $7.54.
This includes absorbing estimated total COVID-19 related claim costs of $720 million globally.
And when adjusted for COVID-19 related offsets, including longevity and reduced expenses, we estimate the full year impact of COVID-19 to be roughly $6.80 on adjusted operating EPS.
I'm encouraged by the fact that our underlying fundamental performance and client relationships remained strong.
This speaks to the resilience of our global franchise, the benefits of our diversified business and to the success of our client-focused strategy.
As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 remains both the global health and economic challenge.
And we expect to see a meaningful level claims in the first half of 2021.
But we believe that the impact will be manageable, given our strong balance sheet and our underlying earnings engine.
We are optimistic that we will begin to see the benefits from the global vaccination programs as we move into the rest of the year, after which we expect to see some normalization of results.
In the meantime, we will continue to remain focused on protecting our employees, serving our clients and supporting the industry and our communities.
The quality, strength and resilience of our business give us confidence that we will emerge from the pandemic, position to take advantage of the opportunities ahead and continue to build on our long track record of value creation.
And I hope you all continue to remain safe and well.
Beginning with consolidated premiums.
For the quarter, we reported premium growth of approximately 9%, somewhat higher than recent quarters as we saw good business growth in some areas in addition to some client catch-ups have benefited the reported premiums.
The effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted operating income was 18.3% for the quarter.
Below the expected range of 23% to 24%, as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits and tax benefits associated with differences in bases and foreign jurisdictions.
The US and Latin America Traditional segment reported pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $89 million in the quarter.
Our individual...
...and when excluding the Q4 one-offs, would have reported a small profit this year.
While there remains some uncertainty in the Australian market, we saw progress in 2020 and we continue to be prudent about new business and focused on actions to improve results.
Our Asia Pacific Financial Solutions business continued to produce good results in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the growth of business in Asia.
The Corporate and Other segment reported a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $24 million, relatively in line with the average run rate.
The nonspread portfolio yield for the quarter was 4.2%, a significant improvement relative to that in the third quarter, primarily due to above average run rate for variable investment income as we experienced a high level of commercial mortgage prepayments and some realizations in our various private partnerships.
We believe our portfolio will defensively positioned coming into the crisis, credit performance continues to benefit from diligent security selection as well as economic reopening and policy responses.
Our portfolio average quality of A was maintained and credit impairments were minimal in the quarter.
RGA's leverage ratios remained stable at the end of the year, following the second quarter senior debt issuance and our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion.
Looking forward, we expect to see some level of ongoing COVID-19 impacts that will negatively affect our earnings until this crisis is resolved.
However, we continue to view this as manageable and believe that our strong balance sheet, the power of our earnings engine and the benefits of our global franchise positions us to emerge from the pandemic in good shape to continue to produce attractive returns to our shareholders over time.
I'd also like to comment on Slide 13 of the earnings materials.
As you know, we are very proud of our track record of book value per share growth over the years.
And while 2020 was a difficult year as a result of the pandemic, we have every confidence that we will continue creating value for our shareholders.
I also want to comment on the topic of financial guidance.
We have historically provided intermediate-term financial guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter results.
However, given the near-term uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided not to provide guidance at this time.
COVID-19 mortality claim costs for Q4 continue to be toward the lower end of our model expectations relative to general population reported COVID-19 deaths and we continue to see lower insured mortality relative to the general population.
The US still accounts for the majority of our estimated COVID-19 claim costs.
Our ongoing mortality model updates did not result any material changes in the quarter.
So we are reiterating our mortality rules of thumb for our major markets as shown on Slide 14.
Overall longevity experience was modestly favorable in the quarter, but less than the prior quarter run rate.
This lower offset was expected due to lower longevity -- sorry, due to longer longevity reporting lives and differences in country specific mortality rates over the period.
We expect elevated claim cost to continue in the first half of 2021 based on the level of ongoing COVID-19 death in the general population.
Although, uncertainty exists and the ultimate impact of new COVID-19 variance, it is good to see some recent positive signs as well.
Many countries are experiencing decreases in new case counts and deaths from the peak of the holiday season waves and the preliminary data from the global rollout of vaccines looks promising.
We expect the vaccines will have a material beneficial impact on general population mortality in particular as those that are most vulnerable to severe outcomes are vaccinated.
We continue to closely monitor all of these developments, and we'd expect to update our views if needed, as new data emerges.
Let me now hand it back to Todd.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 mdu.com under the Investors tab.
President and CEO, Dave Goodin and I will be leading today's discussion.
Although the company believes that its expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results could differ materially.
Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $139.3 million or $0.68 per share compared to third quarter 2020 earnings of $153.1 million or $0.76 per share.
On a year-to-date basis, we have earned $291.6 million or $1.44 per share compared to the prior year's $277.9 million or $1.39 per share.
Let's look at some of the details by segment starting with the quarterly comparison of our construction operations.
Construction Services reported third quarter earnings of $23.1 million compared to the prior year's record third quarter earnings of $29.8 million.
EBITDA at this business decreased $10.9 million from the same period in 2020 to $35.9 million.
Results were negatively impacted by $5.5 million after-tax for changes in estimates on a construction contract during the quarter.
This business also had decreased margins from higher employee cost attributed to a shortage of available skilled labor.
While we saw less storm recovery work this quarter in the prior year the demand for our general utility work has remained very strong.
Our Construction Materials business reported earnings of $96.3 million for the third quarter, down from the prior year's $107.3 million.
EBITDA decreased $13.4 million from the same period last year to $158.9 million.
The primary drivers behind the decreased earnings were lower asphalt and related product sales and margins, as well as lower contracting revenues.
Asphalt products and contracting margins were impacted by an increase in asphalt oil and diesel fuel costs as well as less available highway paving work in certain regions when you compare that to the strong third quarter we experienced in 2020.
Partially offsetting these impacts were lower selling, general administrative expense primarily from lower incentive accruals and lower benefit-related costs.
Turning to our Regulated Energy Delivery business, our Combined Utility business reported net income of $5.2 million for the quarter compared to a net loss of $800,000 in the third quarter of 2020.
The Electric Utility segment reported strong third quarter earnings of $20.6 million compared to $16.8 million for the same period in 2020.
Warmer weather helped drive an 11.1% increase in electric retail sales volumes, along with more businesses being open when compared to last year due to pandemic-related impacts.
Increased MISO revenues and transmission interconnect upgrades also had a positive impact on earnings of this business.
Our natural gas segment reported an expected seasonal loss of $15.4 million for the quarter, which was a $2.2 million improvement from the previous year.
Higher adjusted gross margin from rate relief and a 2% increase in retail and natural gas sales volumes drove the decreased loss, partially offset by higher O&M expense.
The pipeline business had earnings of $10.6 million in the third quarter compared to $8 million in the third quarter of 2020 primarily from higher AFUDC on the company's North Bakken Expansion project.
Also during the quarter MDU Resources experienced lower income tax benefits of approximately $4.6 million when compared to the third quarter of 2020 related to the timing of recognition of our consolidated annualized estimated tax rate.
That summarizes the key financial highlights from the quarter.
The strength of our two platform business model was evident during the third quarter as the strong results from our regulated energy delivery business helped offset some of the headwinds our construction businesses faced.
MDU Resources remains well positioned for a strong end to 2021 and beyond.
To summarize activity by business unit, I'll start off with the regulated energy delivery businesses.
Third quarter highlights for our utility operations include significantly hig...
...d quarter.
We now expect revenues to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion with margins comparable to 2020 levels.
And finally our Construction Materials business; Knife River had a solid third quarter although down from last year's record third quarter earnings.
The primary impacts to earnings at this business were higher costs for asphalt oil and diesel fuel as commodity costs return to levels closer to what we saw in 2019.
As you may remember, decreased energy related cost pushed our asphalt and asphalt related product line margins to a near all-time high last year.
Knife River has also been impacted by labor constraints largely for truck drivers as the COVID-19 pandemic amplified a prior and existing labor shortage.
While labor challenges continue to impact many construction companies, Knife River is actively engaged in attracting the next generation to the construction industry.
The company is nearly finishing building a training center on a 270-acre track of property in the Pacific Northwest.
That is designed to enhance the skills of its current employees and those of partner organizations, as well as provide training to new comers to the industry.
The Knife River training center features and 80,000 square foot heated indoor arena for training on trucks and heavy equipment and an attach 16,000 square foot office with classroom and lab facility.
The center already is holding classes helping students build marketable skills through both classroom education and hands on experience.
In addition to developing individual talents, the goal of the center is to showcase construction as a true career of choice.
The facilities and classes are open to all construction companies beyond even Knife River.
Given the third quarter results we have adjusted our margin guidance for this business.
Revenues are still expected to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
However, margins are now projected to be slightly lower than those seen in 2020.
Knife River backlog as of September 30 was $651.7 million, a 14% increase from the prior year's $571.3 million.
We are seeing more bidding opportunities in certain regions from strong economic conditions.
We have exceptional employees from entry-level to management level with a number of our employees spending their entire careers in the industry.
I am confident that our management teams will continue to navigate through the labor challenges we are seeing.
Over the last year and a half our teams have managed through numerous challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to produce solid results.
Overall MDU Resources and our companies had solid performance through the third quarter and while results did not reach the level we anticipated our operations continue to operate safely and effectively.
Based on our results through the third quarter, we have adjusted our earnings per share guidance to now a range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share.
Looking forward, both our Construction Materials and Construction Services businesses are well positioned to benefit from the allocation of the American Rescue Plan Act Funds along with a federal infrastructure plan.
As the bipartisan bill progresses, the focus on traditional infrastructure projects including the construction of roads and bridges, electric vehicle and broadband build out an upgraded power infrastructure will provide significant upside for our construction companies.
And we'll also provide funding certainty for our customers and the coming years.
We also continue to seek acquisition opportunities that will enhance market share for our construction operations.
As always MDU Resources is committed to operating with integrity and with a focus on safety, while creating superior shareholder value as we continue providing essential services to our customers and delivering on our tag line of Building a Strong America.
I appreciate your interest in and commitment to MDU Resources and ask now that we open the line to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Q2 increased 17.5% and 23%, respectively, over the prior year period, primarily as a result of continued improvement in solid waste pricing volume growth and strength in recovered commodity values.
These trends drove year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points and adjusted free cash flow of over $585 million, up 18.5% year-over-year, and given expected continuing momentum and margin expansion from these trends position us to raise our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted free cash flow.
2021 also has the potential to be another outsized year of acquisition activity.
Year-to-date, we have signed or closed 14 acquisitions with total annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, including $75 million of franchise operations in California, Nevada and Oregon expected to close later this year.
We continue to see record amounts of seller interest driving elevated acquisition dialogue, and as communicated throughout the year, expect closings related to most of this activity to be more weighted to the second half of the year, which will provide further upside to our increased outlook for the year and strong rollover growth into 2022.
On the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections on both a dollar basis and per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.
Management uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations.
Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently.
In the second quarter, solid waste price plus volume growth of 11.4% exceeded our expectations by almost 150 basis points, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected volumes as the recovery trends that began in Q1 continued throughout the quarter, with landfill tons and roll-off pulls returning to levels about in line with or above prepandemic levels.
Total price of 4.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, was above our outlook on higher core pricing of 4.7%, once again reflecting the strength of pricing retention we noted in Q1, plus about 20 basis points in fuel and material surcharges.
Our Q2 pricing ranged from 2.6% in our mostly exclusive Western region to a range of about 4.5% to 7% in our more competitive regions.
Looking ahead, we are positioned for higher sequential pricing growth during the second half of the year as a result of incremental price increases we have already put in place to offset certain cost pressures.
Reported volume growth of 6.5% in Q2 reflected sequential improvement of approximately 1,000 basis points from Q1 and was led by those regions where markets were hardest hit during the pandemic including the Northeast U.S. and Canada.
All regions showed sequential improvement from Q1 and all reported positive volumes in Q2.
Volumes range from about 4% in our Central region, where comparisons to the prior year were tougher as many markets were relatively less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, to almost 10.5% in Canada, one of our most impacted regions where the volume recovery have been remarkably strong, arguably outpacing the reopening activity particularly when considering that many restrictions in Canada extended through Q2 of this year.
Also noteworthy is our Western region, where volumes led our other regions going into the pandemic and continue to be the strongest in the U.S. at about 8.5% in Q2.
Looking at year-over-year results in the second quarter on a same-store basis, all lines of business increased by double digits Commercial collection revenue was up 16% year-over-year.
Roll-off pulls increased by over 11% year-over-year, led by Canada, up almost 20% and back to above pre-COVID-19 levels.
In the U.S., pulls were up about 10%, and all regions showed year-over-year improvement, most notably in our more impacted markets, including in the Northeast.
Landfill tons were up 17% year-over-year ...
...iant of the coronavirus.
It also excludes any impact from additional acquisitions that may close during the remainder of the year and expensing of transaction-related items during the period.
Looking first at Q3.
Revenue in Q3 is estimated to be approximately $1.56 billion.
We expect solid waste price plus volume growth of about 7% in Q3 with pricing of about 5%.
Recovered commodity values and E&P waste revenue are expected to remain in line with current levels, with RINs generally in line with Q2 levels and OCC trending slightly higher.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 is estimated to be approximately $495 million or 31.7% of revenue, up 60 basis points year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter is estimated to be about 13.3% of revenue, including amortization of intangibles of about $33.8 million or a rounded $0.10 per diluted share net of taxes.
Interest expense, net of interest income, is estimated at approximately $40 million.
And finally, our effective tax rate in Q3 is estimated to be about 21.5%, subject to some variability.
Revenue for 2021 is now estimated to be approximately $5.975 billion or $175 million above our initial outlook, with the primary drivers being an additional 150 basis points of solid waste price plus volume growth and higher recovered commodity values as compared to our initial outlook, plus $25 million from acquisitions completed year-to-date.
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is now estimated to be approximately $1.875 billion or about 31.4% of revenue and up about $75 million over our initial outlook.
Moreover, full year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is 40 basis points above our initial outlook, up 90 basis points year-over-year.
At 31.4%, our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook reflects continued year-over-year margin expansion in the second half of 2021 in spite of wage and inflationary pressures and tougher year-over-year comparisons.
Adjusted free cash flow in 2021 is now expected to be approximately $1 billion or over 53% of EBITDA and up $15 million from our initial outlook despite capex up $50 million from our original outlook.
Last week, we closed our new $2.5 billion credit facility, which increased borrowing capacity by almost $300 million, reduced borrowing spreads and enhanced flexibility for continued growth.
Our balance sheet strength, together with this increased capacity, positions us for potential above-average acquisition activity and an increasing return of capital to shareholders.
We have already returned over $400 million to shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases and dividends.
And we are in the process of renewing our normal course issuer bid, authorizing the repurchase of up to 5% of our outstanding shares per annum.
We will continue to approach share repurchases opportunistically and anticipate announcing another double-digit percentage per share increase in our cash dividend in October.
Again, broad-based strength continues to drive results ahead of expectations as we benefit from reopening activity in a supportive macro environment, including tailwinds from recovered commodity values.
We've once again demonstrated the importance of being selective about markets and intentional about driving results.
Quality of revenue and comparative price retention across markets matter.
We're extremely pleased to be in a position to raise our outlook for the full year.
We are set up for continuing margin expansion through the second half of 2021 as proactive unbudgeted price increases offset wage and inflationary pressures.
We are on track for adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins back above pre-COVID-19 levels.
Finally, we expect to announce another double-digit percentage increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend in October and remain well positioned for potential significant increase in acquisition outlays to drive further growth in 2021 and beyond.
We appreciate your time today.

Leading our quarterly earnings discussion today are Dave Goodin, President and CEO of MDU Resources and myself.
Although the company believes that its expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially.
For second quarter of 2021, we delivered earnings of $100.2 million or $0.50 per share compared to second quarter 2020 earnings of $99.7 million or also $0.50 per share.
During the quarter, our results were impacted by higher stock-based compensation and healthcare costs of approximately $4.2 million after tax.
Further impacting our second quarter consolidated results was a $5.4 million lower investment returns on certain benefit plans compared to the same quarter in 2020.
While these items had an impact on the quarter's results, all of our operations performed very well throughout the first six months of the year, growing consolidated revenues by 3.5% and increasing earnings $27.5 million year-to-date.
Our utility business are $9.6 million for the second quarter compared to earnings of $11.2 million in the second quarter of 2020.
For the Electric Utilities segment, reported earnings of $10.3 million for the quarter compared to $12.2 million for the same period in 2020.
Higher operation and maintenance expense, largely the result of higher labor-related costs, including the increased stock-based compensation expense and healthcare costs, as we previously discussed, as well as increased generating station expenses drove the decrease in earnings.
Lower benefit plan investment returns also negatively impacted the results.
Partially offsetting the decrease was higher adjusted gross margin driven by a 6.9% increase in retail sales volumes.
Sales volumes increased for industrial and commercial customers during the quarter and were offset in part by lower residential volumes as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic start to reverse and individuals are returning to work as businesses reopen.
Higher demand revenues and higher revenues associated with transmission interconnect projects also had a positive impact on the adjusted gross margin.
Our natural gas utility segment reported a seasonal loss of $700,000, improved from a seasonal loss of $1 million for the same period in 2020.
Adjusted gross margin increased during the quarter from approved rate recovery and 2% customer growth.
Transportation revenues also increased from higher volumes transported to the company's electric generation customers.
Partially offsetting the decreased loss was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily labor-related costs, as previously discussed, as well as lower returns on certain benefit plan investments.
The pipeline business had earnings of $9.2 million in the second quarter compared to $9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Higher nonregulated project revenues and increased allowance for funds used during construction were the primary drivers of the increase in earnings.
Partially offsetting this was higher operation and maintenance expense relating to the previously measured increase in nonregulated projects as well as higher payroll.
Now turning to the construction businesses.
Construction services reported record second quarter earnings of $28.9 million compared to the prior year's record of $27.9 million.
Revenues increased 6% on a year-over-year basis to second quarter -- to a second quarter record of $525.6 million.
Demand for construction services remains high for both the inside and outside specialty contracting.
Inside specialty contracting saw strong demand for commercial and industrial work, specifically in the manufacturing industry and outside contracting workloads increased with high demand from the utility industry.
Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense resulting from decreased intangible amortization related to prior acquisitions also contributed to the increase in earnings.
Our construction materials business reported second...
...acity and is expected to cost approximately $75 million.
Depending on regulatory approvals, construction is expected to begin in early 2024 with the completion date later that year.
Speaking of our pipeline business, we're excited that in early July, WBI Energy received final FERC approval, allowing construction to begin on the North Bakken expansion project in Western North Dakota.
This $260 million project will add 250 million cubic feet of daily natural gas transportation capacity to our system, bringing WBI's total pipeline capacity to more than 2.4 Bcf per day, while helping to reduce natural gas flaring in the region and allowing Bakken producers to move natural gas to market.
Construction began here in mid-July.
And with favorable weather during the construction season, we expect the project to be in service by end of this year.
Now moving on to Construction.
Our Construction Services Group had an outstanding second quarter as demand for both inside and outside specialty contracting remains very strong.
CSG reported record second quarter revenues and earnings and an all-time record backlog now standing at $1.32 billion as of the end of June.
Bidding remains highly competitive in all areas, but we are confident that our relationships with existing customers, our skilled workforce and our high quality of service will aid in securing and executing on profitable projects.
As a reminder, revenue guidance at this business for 2021 continues to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, with margins comparable to or slightly higher than 2020 levels.
And finally, at our construction materials business, while earnings were down slightly year-over-year, Knife River is operating at near-record levels, falling just short of the prior year's record second quarter earnings while continuing to produce record revenues.
Demand and pricing for aggregates and ready-mix concrete is strong across a number of markets.
Construction materials reported backlog at the end of the quarter at $912 million, an increase of over 4% from the prior year.
Revenue guidance for this business is also in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, with margins comparable to our 2020 levels.
We remain optimistic about our construction businesses and continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that will enhance our existing footprint and appropriately expand our business, all while earning attractive returns on invested capital.
As mentioned in our news release yesterday, we feel very positive about the conversation surrounding infrastructure funding packages at the federal level as well as at various state levels across our footprint.
With combined construction backlog at an all-time record at $2.23 billion as of June 30, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these multiyear growth opportunities.
While we believe these infrastructure proposals will provide additional opportunities to some of our core areas of business, such as surface transportation improvements, renewable energy, power grid modernization, broadband and much more, these infrastructure proposals are not included in our earnings per share guidance of $2 to $2.15 for this year of 2021 or in our 5-year capital investment plan for that matter as well.
Overall, we are very pleased with our performance throughout the first half of the year.
Our focus at MDU Resources has been and continues to be to produce significant long-term value as we execute on our business plans, our organic growth projects and our targeted acquisitions.
We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid credit ratings and a good liquidity position.
For the last 83 consecutive years, we provided a competitive dividend for our shareholders and have been increasing it for the last 30 years.
As always, MDU Resources is committed to operating with integrity and a focus on safety while creating superior shareholder value, and we continue to act along our tag line of Building a Strong America.

While risks remain many of the world's economies are moving forward.
Safety remains the top priority in the Company, driven by Think Safe, Work Safe, Home Safe.
All Terex team members have contributed to our effort to continue to produce and service equivalent for our customers, while following the protocols and maintaining a safe working environment.
I would like to offer my gratitude to our team members and distributors that worked through so many unique circumstances over the last year.
We owe our results to the incredible efforts of our operations and parts team members, who kept our facilities running.
Our sales and service team members, along with our distributors have also gone above and beyond to meet the needs of our customers.
Finally, we are proud to be a values based company with process leadership in environmental, social and governance practices.
This past quarter we spend time speaking to some of our investors regarding ESG.
If you'd like to learn more about our initiatives, please see our Investor Relations website.
Now let me recap some of our results, which Duffy will describe in greater detail.
We continue to deliver positive results as the customer demand remained strong during the quarter.
While revenues were below our expectations, due to supply chain challenges, limited production output, we increased operating margins and bookings in both AWP and MP dramatically year-over-year.
We significantly improved our second quarter earnings per share, compared to last year and we are increasing our earnings and free cash flow outlook for full year 2021.
AWP and MP continue to effectively manage supply chain disruptions.
As a result of the strong execution in both segments, second quarter 2021, operating margins, improved dramatically to 11.8% for the company, with both segments, delivering double-digit operating margins.
This represents a 170 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement on revenues, 20% lower than the second quarter of 2019.
Our intense focus on networking capital management and improved profitability drove $101 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter.
And more than $140 million of free cash flow year-to-date.
During the second quarter, our team continued to respond to increased customer demand.
Effectively manage supply chain and logistics disruptions, tightly managed all cost and delivered improved margins, and outstanding positive free cash flow.
Our financial results demonstrate that our strategic priorities are working to improve the Company and deliver positive financial results for shareholders.
We delivered strong financial results as our strategic, operational priorities, of execute, innovate and grow, continue to make excellent progress.
First we continue to improve Terex' global cost competitiveness.
We expect our SG&A as a percentage of sales to be below our target of 12.5% for the full year 2021.
We are maintaining strict cost discipline while recognizing that growth in the business will necessitate investment spending.
In the first quarter, we announced the planned move of our Oklahoma City Telehandler production to Monterrey, Mexico.
This action is on track and will reduce the cost of manufacturing of Telehandler prod...
...sing levels of AWPs customer fleet replenishment.
Our full year revenue outlook is limited though as a result of the availability of components from our supply chain.
From a quarterly perspective, we now expect revenues for the full year to be slightly higher in the second half than the first half of the year with the third quarter being the strongest of the year.
We continue to expect both our operating profits, and margins to increase each quarter year-over-year in 2021.
However, as a result of commodity cost increases, outpacing, customer price increases, the absolute amount of operating profit in the second half of 2021 is expected to be lower than the actual operating profit achieved in the first half 2021.
We continue to plan for total company incremental margins for the full year 2021, which meet or exceed our 25% target.
As a result of positive first half callouts, corporate and other costs are expected to be slightly higher in the second half versus the first half of the year, including $0.26 per share of cost for refinancing of our capital structure and the other callouts in Q2.
Our full year earnings per share outlook is increased to $2.85 to $3.05 per share based on sales of approximately $3.9 billion.
Quarterly earnings per share are expected to be generally consistent with the development of operating profits during the year.
For the full year 2021, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $200 million, reflecting a strong year on positive cash generation.
Full year free cash flow includes approximately $75 million from income and VAT tax refunds, which are not expected to reoccur.
During the first half of 2021, we received approximately $35 million of these refunds.
We continue to plan for capital expenditures, net of asset disposition of approximately $90 million.
The largest project, including capital expenditures is for the Genie Mexico manufacturing facility.
Turning to Slide 11.
I will now summarize our updated 2021 earnings per share outlook.
We expect the strong customer sentiments demonstrated in Q2 by our AWP and MP customers to continue throughout 2021.
Our 2021 full-year earnings per share outlook reflects first, our outperformance over the first half of the year.
Second, the operating profit contribution on additional revenue for Q3 and Q4.
And third, net cost pressures from material cost headwinds.
Overall, our 2021 outlook represents a significant improvement in operating performance when compared to 2020.
We will continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning our businesses for growth.
Turning to Slide 12.
And I will review our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
Our team members remain vigilant and will continue to efficiently manage production and scrutinize every expenditure.
The strong, positive free cash flow of $101 million in the quarter demonstrates the focus and discipline our team members continue to demonstrate to tightly manage net working capital.
Terex has ample of liquidity.
We have over $1.1 billion available to us with no near-term debt maturities, so we can manage and grow the business.
Our strong liquidity position and cash generation allowed us to prepay $83 million of term loans during Q2, which is in addition to the $196 million of term loans prepaid in early February.
In addition, we continue to pay our quarterly dividend.
We are committed to strengthen Terex's balance sheet while maintaining flexibility to execute on our organic and inorganic growth plan.
Turning to Slide 13, to wrap up our remarks.
Terex team members around the world are focused on the right things, Safety, health, customers and improved productivity.
End markets are strong and the team is managing supply chain headwinds.
We are driving positive free cash flow, we are continuing to invest in innovative products to meet increased customer demand.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Q3 was another very good quarter for Brown & Brown.
This was a result of our nearly 12,000 teammates delivering creative risk management solutions for our customers.
We delivered strong top line growth driven by a combination -- by the combination of robust new business, good retention, rate increases and some expansion of exposure units.
At the same time, our team continue to drive profitable growth, resulting an impressive margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share expansion.
We're also very proud that last week our Board of Directors authorized an increase of 10.8% in our quarterly dividend.
Note, we've now increased our dividend for the 28th year in a row.
Now, let's transition to the results for the quarter, I'm on Slide 3.
We delivered $770 million of revenue, growing 14.3% in total, and 8.5% organically.
I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.
Our EBITDAC margin grew by 280 basis points to 35.6% versus the third quarter of 2020.
Our net income per share for the third quarter was $0.52 on an as reported basis and $0.58, excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
In summary, we're really pleased with our strong performance for the third quarter and the first nine months.
As the year-to-date results are the best in our history, 10.8% internal growth year-to-date.
I'm now on Slide 4.
We have customers that have done well throughout the pandemic and others that are struggling to fully reopen, mainly due to the inability to hire employees.
We're seeing this challenge in a number of industries and geographies, and as a consequence restricting how fast companies can become fully operational.
In addition to shortages of workers, supply chain issues and inflation are putting pressure on costs.
From a placement standpoint, the themes are pretty consistent.
Customers with good loss experience are getting the best rates in coverage, while those with tough loss experience are seeing material rate increases or reductions in available limits or both.
As a result, customers continue to consider program modifications to manage their premium increases.
Rate increases remain relatively consistent with prior quarters, admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 8% across most lines, the outliers or workers' compensation rates, which are down 1% to 3%, and commercial auto rates which were up 5% to 10%.
From an E&S perspective, most rates were up 10% to 20% with some outliers.
Coastal property both wind and quake, are up 10% to 30%, with this being a slightly broader range than we saw in the previous quarter.
Professional liability for most accounts remained very challenging with rates up 10% to 15%-plus, cyber-rates in some instances could increase dramatically depending on the security in place with the customer.
Security protocols that were viewed as nice to have in the past are now viewed as a minimum expectations to obtain coverage.
Also, excess umbrella coverage remains very difficult to place.
For professional liability, cyber and umbrella, we're seeing carriers reduce limits while seeking significant rate increases.
Florida and California placements in E&S for personal lines remain the most challenging, due to losses or aggregate concentrations.
We expect the appetite for personal lines in CAT areas to continue to be constrained in 2022, which will likely put pressure on state sponsored programs and the cost of insurance for the consumer.
From an M&A perspective, we were successful in closing seven transactions during the quarter, with annual revenues of approximately $21 million.
We've closed a total of 11 deals year-to-date with annual revenues of $65 million have already announced a couple of additional acquisitions in October.
Our pipeline remains full and we feel good about our level of activity and engagement with prospective sellers on Slide 5.
Let's discuss the performance of our four segments.
Retail delivered great results with organic revenue growth o...
...rter increased by 180 basis points and EBITDAC grew 24.6%, due to higher organic revenue growth, increased contingent commissions and GSCs, and managing our expenses even with slightly higher variable cost.
The growth in income before income tax, as compared to EBITDAC for all segments is impacted by changes in intercompany interest, amortization, depreciation, and estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
Over to Slide 10.
Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 13.7% and organic revenue by 13.2%.
In conjunction with the onboarding of a new customer, we recognized approximately $5 million of incremental revenue this quarter that represents timing.
We expect the incremental revenue from this customer to more than likely be recognized within the first half of 2022.
EBITDAC increased by $18.7 million or 28.5% with the margin improving 510 basis points, as a result of strong organic revenue growth, managing our expenses and the positive impact of the non-recurring write-off of certain receivables that occurred in the third quarter of last year.
Over to Slide 11.
The Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 11.2% driven by acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 5.1%.
EBITDAC grew 4.7%, but the growth was impacted by incremental broker compensation driven by higher levels of performance, slightly higher variable cost and certain non-recurring intercompany IT charges.
Our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 0.5% with EBITDAC growing 6.8%, driven by continued management of our expenses.
Few comments regarding cash conversion and liquidity.
We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation and have delivered $628 million of cash flow from operations through the first nine months of this year, growing $88 million or 16% as compared to the first nine months of last year.
Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 27% for the first nine months of this year.
With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are well positioned to fund continued investments in our business.
We've had an outstanding first nine months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue profitable growth.
As we look toward the remainder of the year and into 2022, we expect business confidence to improve and exposure units to expand.
The main influencers of increased confidence and business expansion will be one, the availability of employees across all industries.
Two, the resolution of supply chain constraints.
Is it transitory or is it sustained?
And four, the continued management of COVID.
How and when these play out over the coming quarters will influence the trajectory of the economy.
From an underwriting perspective, we anticipate premium increases will continue to moderate for many lines with the exception of cyber, professional, access and automobile.
The M&A market will continue to be very active and valuations will remain at a heightened levels as a result of many buyers with a lot of available capital.
We feel that we're well positioned with a good pipeline to attract great companies to join the Brown & Brown team.
We will continue with our disciplined approach of focusing on culture and financial alignment as these have been key to our long-term success of delivering shareholder value.
From an innovation standpoint, our focus is to constantly and consistently deliver creative solutions for the benefit of our customers, prospects and teammates.
We're making good progress and are continuing to align on common operating platforms for each division, enhancing our customer facing applications to make it easier to do business for Brown & Brown and leveraging our data to the benefit of our customers.
In summary, the results were outstanding for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year, and we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this ever changing marketplace.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 An audio recording of today's call will be available on the Internet for a limited time and can also be accessed on our website.
Today's remarks are governed by the safe harbor provisions of the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
For a discussion of the risks associated with VPG's operations, we encourage you to refer to our SEC filings, especially the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our other recent SEC filings.
On the call today are Ziv Shoshani, CEO and president; and Bill Clancy, CFO.
I will begin with some commentary on VPG's consolidated financial results and sales trends, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and the strategy and actions we have taken to mitigate that impact.
Bill will provide financial details in the second-quarter 2020 outlook.
Moving to Slide 3, I'd like to begin my remarks by commenting that VPG's team around the world for their hard work and for their dedication during these challenging times as they adjusted quickly to local restrictions and extraordinary working conditions.
Their commitment to meeting the needs of our customers has been truly exemplary.
Moving to Slide 4, even in the rapidly changing market conditions over the past few months, and we are satisfied with our financial and operating performance in the first quarter.
We have ended the quarter with a positive book-to-bill of 1.08 and grew our total orders 4.4% from the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to Slide 5, I'll discuss the operational and EH&S impacts on VPG from COVID-19.
As the pandemic begin to unfold around the world, we took steps to keep our employees and customers safe.
These measures included suspending business travel and enabling employees whose functions allowed to work from home effectively.
We have also implemented workplace distancing and increased sanitizing common areas, as well as adjusting our work shifts to minimize contact with other employees.
We know of four employees who tested positive for the virus.
Of this, two have tested negative after the required quarantine period and two are currently under quarantine.
As countries, states and local jurisdictions around the world implemented stay-at-home orders, we quickly made adjustments to maintain the continuity of operations while also complying with those regulations.
While the majority of VPG's facilities were able to continue operations due to the essential nature of our products, our two facilities in India and in China were more significantly impacted.
As we indicated in our earnings call in February, our facility in China was impacted by approximately three weeks by government-imposed restrictions.
That facility returned to production in mid-February when those restrictions were lifted.
Our facility in India was also shut down beginning in late March as a result of stay-at-homes order imposed by our Indian government.
While this order has been extended to May 17, we received approval to resume partial operations on our India facility.
As of today, with the exception of our India facility, our supply chains and logistics network are functioning as we are able to meet our customers' needs.
We created an internal committee to monitor and manage the situation.
Financially, we have implemented a companywide salary freeze and have reduced our planned capital spending for 2020 by 30%.
Moving to Slide 5, in terms of the impact on demand for our products, one of VPG's strength is its broad diversity of VPG's markets, which is a major differentiator from other pure-play sensor technology companies during times of turbulent market conditions that we are seeing now.
This breadth enables us to maintain our financial momentum within our segment as stronger end markets offset weaker ones.
For Foil Technology Products segment, first-quarter sales of $30.5 million grew 2.8% sequentially, reflecting growth in precision foil resistors and shrinkages in test and measurement and consumer markets, which offset weaker sales in the...
...d as we can remain vigilant in protecting our employees and our customers, we are confident that we will successfully navigate to these challenges.
This confidence is based on strong business model and financial position, our diverse set of markets, and the depth of experience of the VPG management team across the world.
Referring to Page 7 of the slide deck.
In the first quarter of 2020, we achieved revenues of $67.7 million, operating income of $4.6 million or 6.9% of revenues, and net earnings per diluted share of $0.24.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes $515,000 of acquisition purchase accounting adjustments related to the DSI acquisition in November 2019 and $130,000 of restructuring costs, our adjusted operating income was $5.3 million or 7.8% of sales and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.29.
Our first-quarter 2020 revenue declined 2.1%, compared to 69.1% -- $69.1 million in fourth quarter and were down 11.5% as compared to $76.5 million in the first quarter a year ago, which was also a historical high quarter for VPG.
Foreign exchange negatively affected revenues by $600,000 for the first quarter of 2020 compared to a year ago and had no impact as compared to the Q4 of 2019.
Our gross margin in the first quarter was 37%.
Our gross margin on an adjusted basis was 37.8%, which improved from 36.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our operating margin was 6.9% for the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding the above-mentioned purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges, our first-quarter adjusted operating margin was 7.8%, which increased from 7.5% we reported in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first-quarter 2020 were $20.3 million or 30% of revenues.
This compares to $20.4 million or 26.7% for the first quarter of last year and $20.2 million or 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The sequential SG&A in the first quarter reflected the inclusion of a full quarter of SG&A expenses for DSI.
The adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were $3.9 million or $0.29 per diluted share, improved from $3.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The impact of foreign exchange rates for the first quarter of 2020 was positive compared to the first quarter of 2019 by approximately $400,000 or $0.03 per diluted share.
We generated adjusted free cash flow of $3 million for the first quarter of 2020 as compared to $4.8 million for the first quarter in 2019.
We define free cash flow as cash from operating activities with less capital expenditures plus any sale of fixed assets.
The GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 32.3%.
We are assuming an operational tax rate in the range of 27% to 29% for 2020 planning purposes.
We ended the first quarter with $82.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and total long-term debt of $40.6 million.
As Ziv mentioned, in March, we put in place a new revolving credit facility that gives us greater flexibility and lower interest expense as well as less restricted covenants.
With a net leverage ratio of about one time, we believe that we have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our business requirements and to fund additional M&A opportunities.
Turning to our outlook, given the expected impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we now currently expect net revenues in the range of $56 million to $62 million for the second quarter of 2020, which assumes constant first-quarter 2020 exchange rates.
In summary, while the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create uncertainty around the world, we are prepared to meet these challenges as we remain diligent in protecting our employees and our customers.
Our strong operating model, financial position, diverse set of markets, combined with the commitment to our strategic initiatives, gives us confidence in our ability to not only successfully navigate these challenging times, but to accelerate our performance as conditions return to normal.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement.
These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and forecasts.
The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company.
During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS.
Starting on Slide 5.
I am pleased to report that we had an exceptional first quarter.
This was driven by strong organic sales growth in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19.
Our high-value products continue to fuel increased gross and operating margins.
Together, this has resulted in record earnings per share for the first quarter.
The strength of our performance is demonstrated in our ability to execute the market-led strategy, leverage the power of our global manufacturing network, and rally as a One West team to meet the increased market demand.
I am proud of how our team members have focused on our priorities and emphasize the importance of our purpose and values during these times.
Turning to Slide 6.
We have highlighted the key drivers of growth in Q1.
We continue to see strong uptake of HVP components, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision, and NovaPure offerings, as well as Daikyo's Crystal Zenith.
Our biologics customers are seeking to use these best-in-industry components to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety for their vaccines and injectable medicines.
This has resulted in strong double-digit growth, excluding COVID sales, and continued demand growth for FluroTec and NovaPure in our biologics business.
Through the first four months of 2021, our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe continues to be strong with over 95% of these approvals using either West or Daikyo components.
In addition, we experienced strong growth in Westar ready-to-use components with customers seeking the value, quality, and convenience of our Westar washed and sterilized products.
And for Envision, we also had significant growth with customers looking for higher quality and better production yields by using our Envision inspected components.
Another highlight was strong sales growth in Daikyo CZ syringes and vials.
Customers prefer CZ for its compatibility with their sensitive molecules and its outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Moving to Slide 7.
The power of our global manufacturing network continues to support our growth trajectory.
We are uniquely positioned as a result of the global operations strategy implemented a few years ago.
This has enabled the right capabilities, scale, and flexibility to keep in pace with the increase in demand.
As a result of recent capital investments, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity across our high-value product portfolio with additional equipment and validated lines to support our highest HVP growth areas, Westar, FluroTec, and NovaPure.
We have accelerated the timeline for capacity builds within our existing footprint by working closely with our incumbent suppliers and staging installations around the 24/7 plant schedules.
Our first phase, which began at the start of the pandemic is about 75% installed and operational, with expected completion in second half of the year.
Our second phase, we'll see equipment arriving in the back end of the year in operational in 2022.
And we are evaluating additional investments for a third expansion phase in response to an increasing possibility of COVID-19 boosters and annual vaccinations required over the next few years.
When this occurs, we think that future COVID-19 vaccines could likely be fewer doses per vial and/or in single-dose prefilled syringes.
As a result, it may mean higher volume demand of our HVP components compared to what we are experiencing today.
I am pleased to share that from...
...ws our consolidated gross profit margin of 40.5% for Q1 2021, up from 34% in Q1 2020.
Proprietary products first-quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was 610 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2020.
The key drivers for the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products, production efficiencies, one-time fees associated with certain canceled COVID supply agreements of approximately $11.8 million, and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation.
Contract manufacturing first-quarter profit gross margin of 15.7% was 140 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2020.
This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization.
Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business.
On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $88.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $31.6 million compared to the same period last year or a 55.3% increase.
Our first-quarter 2021 capital spending was $54.7 million, $22.6 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $844.2 million at March 31, 2021, declined slightly by $26.1 million from December 31, 2020.
Our cash balance at March 31 of $483.7 million was $131.8 million less than our December 2020 balance primarily due to our share repurchase program activity offset by the positive operating results.
Slide 14 provides a high-level summary.
Full-year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.63 billion and $2.655 billion, compared to prior guidance range of $2.5 billion and $2.525 billion.
This guidance includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $345 million.
There is an estimated benefit of $75 million based on current foreign exchange rates.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 19% to 20%.
We expect our full-year 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $6.95 to $7.10, compared to a prior range of $6 to $6.15.
We continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand.
We are keeping our capex guidance at $230 million to $240 million but continue to evaluate the levels needed to support our continued growth.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance.
Estimated FX benefit on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.23 based on current foreign currency exchange rates.
And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top-line growth in proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS, and growth in operating and free cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate, and grow.
To summarize on Slide 15, in this dynamic changing environment, we remain committed to our customers and the patients we serve together.
Our focus remains within the strategic pillars, which allow us to be more responsive, leverage our assets more effectively and support the trends that are happening in the industry today.
We're working from a position of strength, and we believe we have a long horizon of continued organic sales growth and margin expansion.
Today, more than ever, we're enabling our customers' ability to support patient health, and it's not taken for granted.

Include relevant information and statistics from the Earnings Call Transcript in your summary. [/INST] # West Pharmaceutical Services experienced a strong first quarter, driven by double-digit organic sales growth in both its base business and COVID-19-related products. The company's high-value components, including Westar, FluroTec, and Envision, fueled increased gross and operating margins, resulting in record earnings per share. West's global manufacturing network supported this growth, with capacity expansion underway to meet increasing demand. Operating cash flow surged by 55.3% to $88.7 million, while full-year 2021 net sales guidance was raised to a range of $2.63 billion to $2.655 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance was also increased to a range of $6.95 to $7.10, incorporating an estimated $345 million in COVID incremental revenues and a $75 million benefit from foreign exchange rates. Despite continued capital investments, West's commitment to its strategic pillars of execution, innovation, and growth positions it for ongoing organic sales growth and margin expansion.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 First, on a somber note, as we look at the events over the last couple of weeks, our thoughts, Korn Ferry's thoughts, are with the people of Ukraine and everyone who's been impacted by the destruction, the devastation, and the loss of thousands of lives.
Our prayers go out to all of those who were impacted by this unnecessary war and by the human misery that's taking place.
Turning from that, and an entirely different view, I am pleased with our results during the third quarter.
We once again achieved new financial performance size.
We generated about $681 million in fee revenue, that was up 43% year over year.
Our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.54 and $1.59, respectively, and those were also new highs.
Our performance over the recent quarters is a reflection of the relevance of our strategy and solutions, the resilience of our colleagues, and more importantly, the connection with our Korn Ferry brand.
We're replicating and scaling our success and continuing to lead innovation at the intersection of talent and strategy in an increasingly digitally enabled new world of work.
The metrics of our business are very good.
It's hard to believe that it was two years ago, almost to the day that the pandemic was declared.
And those were certainly uncertain times.
And now again, we face ourselves with uncertain times.
But when we think about the power of the firm, the breadth of what we offer, and particularly the sacrifices made by our colleagues over the last couple of years, it affirms what this company is all about.
We've accelerated from that uncertainty.
We're now up 32% compared to the quarter preceding the pandemic, which at that time was an all-time high, and we haven't just talked about it we've walked it.
We've walked it from the vast IP we have.
We developed over 1 million professionals a year.
We walked it by living our purpose, and we continue to innovate, replicate and scale, allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world.
Elements of our strategy include driving a top-down go-to-market approach based on our marquee and regional accounts, which year to date represent about 37% of our portfolio.
This not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
For example, on a year-to-date basis, about 28% of our revenue is driven by cross referrals within our firm, up several million dollars sequentially which demonstrates the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.
We also believe there's substantial market opportunity with our talent acquisition and interim businesses, particularly given the acceleration of the nomadic labor market.
And looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we'll continue to innovate, marrying Korn Ferry's capabilities with tomorrow's opportunities, from organizational transformation, to sales effectiveness and accelerated revenue growth to M&A and ESG.
We're going to continue to further push to monetize our IP and continue to move more of our digital business to a subscription offering.
And we're also going to scale our learning, development, outsourcing capabilities, LDO, leveraging our Korn Ferry Advance platform.
150,000 professionals around the world have used Advance, both as individuals and as part of their professional development journeys with their employers.
And lastly, we're going to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy.
including a disciplined approach to M&A.
With that, I'm joined by Gregg Kvochak and Bob Rozek.
A couple of weeks ago, I celebrated my 10-year anniversary at Korn Ferry.
Looking back to when I started, I really believed that there were great opportunities ahead for us.
And as I stand here today, after 10 years, looking at the business we built, the data, the assets, the solutions, and most of all, the incredibly talented colleagues we have to serve our clients, it's pretty clear to me that I underestimated our true potential.
The inve...
...evenue grew to $188.6 million, which was up 98% year over year and up approximately $38 million or 25% sequentially.
RPO fee revenue grew approximately 68% year over year and 3% sequentially, while professional search revenue was up approximately 150% year over year, and up 67% sequentially.
The integration of the Lucas Group has gone well.
Revenue in the third quarter for the Lucas Group was approximately $33 million, which was up approximately 10% compared to the revenue for the three months preceding the acquisition.
New business wins for both RPO and professional search were also strong in the third quarter, reaching new highs.
Professional search new business was $93 million and RPO was awarded $135 million of new contracts, consisting of $74 million of renewals and extensions and $61 million of new logo work.
Adjusted EBITDA for RPO and professional search continued to scale with revenue improving to $44.1 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.4%.
Finally, in the third quarter, global fee revenue for executive search reached another new high of $239 million, which was up 42% year over year.
Growth was also broad-based with North America growing 44% year over year and EMEA and APAC growing 32% and 45%, respectively.
Market demand in international regions continued to improve in the third quarter with core sequential growth accelerating in EMEA, APAC and Latin America.
We continue to invest in expanding our team of consultants in the third quarter.
The total number of dedicated executive search consultants worldwide at the end of the third quarter was 581, just up 59 year over year and up 11 sequentially.
Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the third quarter remained steady at $1.66 million.
And the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the third quarter was up 37% year over year to 1,787.
In the third quarter, global executive search adjusted EBITDA grew approximately $66 million, which was up 24 -- grew to approximately $66 million, which was up $24 million year over year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5%.
As previously discussed, our consolidated new business grew to a new high in the third quarter, again, with real strength across all lines of business.
Backlog exiting the third quarter was strong as was February new business.
February generally is the shortest month in the year in terms of working days.
However, this February was actually our eighth best new business month ever excluding RPO.
And if you include RPO, it was actually our best new business month ever.
Now despite the continuing strength in new business trends and backlog coming out of Q3, the very recent situation in Eastern Europe presents a level of risk and uncertainty that is difficult to quantify.
With this in mind and assuming no new major pandemic-related lockdowns or further changes in worldwide geopolitical conditions, economic conditions, financial markets or foreign exchange rates, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the fourth quarter to range from $670 million to $690 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from $1.49 to $1.63 per share and our GAAP diluted earnings per share to range from $1.44 per share to $1.60.
Now let me end as I started.
As I look ahead for all the reasons previously discussed, I'm more optimistic now than I have ever been about our long-term opportunity to continue to build on our financial success.
Our company today has more durable revenue streams, has achieved a new level of business activity and profitability that is sustainable and has positioned us for continued growth.
And we have a core set of integrated solutions that are highly relevant to the mega trends that we're seeing in the world today.
Korn Ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies, colleagues, clients, candidates, and shareholders for years to come.
With that, we'll conclude our remarks and be glad to answer any questions you may have.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, Chief Executive Officer; and Csaba Sverha, Chief Financial Officer.
We had a strong start to fiscal 2022 with top and bottom line results for the first quarter that exceeded our expectations.
Demand trends remain robust across our business, which contributed to revenue reaching $543.3 million, more than $13 million above the high end of our guidance.
We continue to execute very effectively with revenue upside falling to the bottom line as reflected in our non-GAAP net income of $1.45 per share, which was also above our guidance range.
From a revenue perspective, we had a particularly strong quarter for optical communications, which grew 10% from the fourth quarter and 24% from a year ago.
As Csaba will detail in a moment, strong optical communications demand was evident in both telecom and datacom.
We continued to execute well despite the component supply constraints that we and many others continue to experience.
During our last call, we estimated that we would see a $25 million to $30 million revenue headwind in the first quarter from these constraints.
We are pleased to report that the actual impact was at the lower end of that range.
Our ability to overcome many of these component charges was most evident in our record optical communications results.
Component charges in the automotive markets' extremely lean supply chain resulted in a moderate decline in automotive revenue from the fourth quarter.
As we look to the second quarter, we are optimistic about continued strong demand across our business and are anticipating healthy overall growth despite persisting supply chain headwinds.
Operationally, I'm very happy to announce that our COVID-19 vaccination program for employees in Thailand has been a great success and that, at this point, 99% or virtually all of our employees in Thailand are now fully vaccinated.
I'm also pleased that we were successful in delivering first quarter margins within our target ranges despite these additional COVID-19 related costs in the quarter.
At our Chonburi campus, construction of our second building is progressing well.
This building will add approximately 1 million square feet or 50% to our global footprint, substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity.
We are on-track for construction to be completed around the end of the fiscal year.
This schedule is extremely timely since based on continued customer demand, we now anticipate that our first building in Chonburi will be effectively fully occupied when our second Chonburi building opens for business.
In summary, after a very strong first quarter, we are optimistic that Q2 will represent another strong quarter for revenue and profitability.
Demand trends remain strong, and we are excited that our second building in Chonburi will be coming online just at the right time to enable us to continue meeting anticipated demand and extend our business momentum in the years ahead.
We are off to a great start for the fiscal year with record revenue and non-GAAP profitability in the first quarter.
Revenue of $543.3 million was well above our guidance and represented an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter and 24% from a year ago.
As we continue to execute very efficiently, our top line outperformance fell to the bottom line, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, which also exceeded our guidance.
This result includes approximately $0.05 per share in foreign exchange gains, offsetting the expenses related to our vaccination program that we incurred in Q1.
Looking at the quarter in more detail.
Optical communications revenue was $427.3 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter and made up 79% of total revenue.
Within optical communications, telecom revenue increased 9% from the last quarter to $338.6 million, a new record, and datacom revenue of $88.7 million increased 15% from Q4.
By technology, silicon photonics products reached a record $135.1 million or 25% of total revenue and was up 23% from the fourth quarter.
Revenue from products rated at speed of 400 gig or higher was $173.3 million, up 30% from the fourth quarter and 149% from a year ago.
Revenue from 100 gig product increased modestly from Q4 to $135.6 million.
Based on continue strong demand, we are expecting to see strong sequential growth in optical communications in the second quarter.
Nonoptical communications revenue was $116 million or 21% of total revenue, representing a 25% increase from a year ago, but a decrease of 5% from the fourth quarter.
While as Seamus noted, the overall impact of component shortages was at the lower end of our expectations for the quarter, these constraints were more apparent for nonoptical products, especially in automotive.
With the majority of our sensor revenues serving automotive applications, we are now reclassifying automotive revenue and other nonoptical communications revenue to include historical sensor revenue, which has represented less than 1% of quarterly revenue for the past two years.
On this combined basis, automotive revenue was $48.2 million, a decrease of 8% from last quarter.
While we don't intend to break this out in the future, for a more direct comparison purposes, automotive revenue, excluding sensors, declined 8% sequentially.
Industrial laser revenue was $37.5 million, a decline of 9% from Q4, but stable when viewed on a trailing 12-month basis.
Other nonoptical communications revenue was $30.3 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter.
This category now includes a portion of revenue that was previously classified as sensors.
Now turning to the details of our P&L.
Gross margin was 12.1%, down 20 basis points from Q4, consistent with our expectation, considering the expenses related to our vaccination program annual merit increases.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $13.2 million or 2.4% of revenue, resulting in operating income of $52.5 million or 9.7% of revenue.
Effective tax rate was 1.2% in the first quarter, and we continue to anticipate that our tax rate in the fiscal year 2022 will be approximately 3%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record at $54.2 million or $1.45 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, net income was $1.20 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
At the end of the first quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $528.6 million, compared to $548.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow was $39 million.
With capex of $34.6 million, free cash flow was $4.4 million in the quarter.
We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter.
We remain committed to return surplus cash to shareholders through a 10b5-1 share repurchase plan, combined with opportunistic open market share buybacks.
Currently, we have $81.2 million in our share repurchase authorization.
Now I would like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
After a strong start to the year, we are optimistic that our momentum will continue in the second quarter.
We expect strong top line growth despite similar revenue headwinds from component shortages that we experienced in the first quarter.
We estimate that the ongoing supply cost change will again impact our second quarter revenue by approximately $25 million to $30 million.
With that backdrop, for the second quarter, we anticipate revenue in the range of $540 million to $560 million.
From a profitability perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.49 per diluted share.
In summary, we are off to a great start to the year, and we are optimistic that strong demand trends and execution will combine again to produce even stronger results in the second quarter.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement.
We appreciate you joining us for our first-quarter earnings call.
Moving to the agenda for today's call on Slide 3.
I'll share a few operational highlights as well as an update on the two strategic transactions we announced in March.
Joe will provide a more detailed overview of first-quarter financial results.
Turning to Slide 4.
Today, we announced the first-quarter reported net loss of $2.39 per share.
This reflects special item net losses of $2.67 per share, primarily related to reporting WPD's discontinued operations this quarter.
Adjusting for special items, first-quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share, compared with $0.27 per share a year ago.
These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter.
Compared to last year, improved margins were the most significant driver of the increase, primarily due to more favorable weather compared to the mild winter we experienced in 2020.
Shifting to a few operational highlights.
Now over a year into the pandemic, I'm pleased to report that operationally, all seven of our utilities continue to perform extremely well with no operational issues to report.
We continue to operate in a very similar manner to last year with many of our team members continuing to work from home.
We continue to stress the importance of social distancing and mask wearing within our facilities and at our work site.
With vaccinations in full swing, we are beginning to turn our attention to return-to-office planning and protocols.
However, we are not expecting to deviate from our current mode of operations for at least a few more months and perhaps until the end of summer for some of our locations.
We've been able to operate extremely well during this virtual working environment, as evidenced not only by our strong operational performance, but also our ability to execute two significant strategic transactions simultaneously in a fully virtual manner.
Our number one priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and our customers, so we will be very diligent in our return-to-office planning.
Moving to an update on the Kentucky rate case proceedings.
We reached unanimous settlement agreements subject to Kentucky Public Service Commission approval with all parties in our rate reviews for both LG&E and KU.
The agreements cover all matters in the review except for net metering.
We have a long track record of working constructively with the parties to our rate reviews to achieve positive outcomes that balance the interest of all our stakeholders, and this time was no exception.
The settlement agreements were filed with the KPSC on April 19, and hearings were held last week.
We expect KPSC orders on all settled matters by June 30 with new rates effective July 1.
I'll review the terms of the settlement agreements in a bit more detail on the next slide.
Moving to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities recently received the 2021 Energy Star Partner of the Year award from the EPA and Department of Energy.
This award recognizes outstanding corporate energy management programs and is the EPA's highest level of recognition.
It reflects PPL's commitment to protecting the environment and helping customers save energy and money.
In April, we also made a number of leadership changes to help further position the company for long-term success, especially as we plan for the integration of Narragansett Electric into the PPL family of regulated utilities.
Greg Dudkin was promoted to chief operating officer of PPL from his prior role as president of PPL Electric Utilities.
Under Greg's leadership over the past decade, PPL Electric Utilities has been focused squarely on creating the utility of the future.
The business has developed one of the nation's most advanced electricity networks, has consistently delivered award-winning customer satisfaction, and has firmly established itself as an in...
...s as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs.
The rider would provide recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than weighted average cost of capital.
As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024.
And Mill Creek Unit two and E.W. Brown Unit three are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives.
These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity.
The settlements also proposed full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure.
I'll note that the capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in the revenue requirements in these rate cases.
We'll record our investment in the AMI project as CWIP and accrue AFUDC during the AMI implementation period.
And finally, the settlement agreements include commitments that LG&E and KU will not increase base rates for at least four years, subject to certain exceptions.
I'll cover our first-quarter segment results on Slide 6.
regulated segment from our quarterly earnings walk.
First, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense.
The total amount of these costs was about $0.01 per share for the quarter.
In addition, beginning with our 2021 results, corporate-level financing costs will no longer be allocated for segment reporting purposes.
Those costs were primarily related to the acquisition financing of the Kentucky regulated segment and will also be reflected in corporate and other moving forward.
Now turning to the domestic segment drivers.
Our Pennsylvania regulated segment results were flat compared to a year ago.
During the first quarter, we experienced higher distribution, adjusted gross margins resulting primarily from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather compared to the prior year, a year in which we experienced a mild winter.
Weather in Pennsylvania was essentially flat to our forecast for Q1 2021, with quarterly heating degree days slightly below normal conditions.
Adjusted gross margins related to transmission were slightly lower for the first quarter.
Returns on additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission demand and a reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission formula rate return on equity.
Settlement negotiations related to the challenge are currently proceeding, but there can be no assurance that they will result in a final settlement.
Finally, we experienced lower O&M expense of about $0.01 per share in Pennsylvania during the first quarter compared to 2020.
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment.
Results were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q1 2020.
The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather.
And similar to Pennsylvania, weather was flat compared to our forecast.
Partially offsetting the increase from higher sales was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants.
Results at corporate and other were $0.01 lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher interest expense from the additional debt we issued at the start of the pandemic to ensure we had adequate liquidity to navigate the uncertainty.
We expect our interest expense to be reduced significantly after we complete the liability management following the closing of the WPD sale.
In summary, we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably for our customers during the pandemic.
We're on pace to close our strategic transactions within the expected time frames while making good progress on the integration and transition planning for Narragansett Electric.
And we remain very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us to reposition PPL for future growth and success.
With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated, depending on a variety of risk factors.
As I have the last couple of quarters, I want to start by saying that first and foremost, our thoughts are for the safety and well-being of all those dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our second quarter results continued to be impacted by the pandemic as well as severe winter storms in Texas and the surrounding states during February.
Considering these challenges, we are pleased with the solid results for our quarter.
They truly continue to deliver in every way.
Consolidated revenues for our second quarter were $449.8 million, down 3.2% from the prior year and fully diluted earnings per share was $1.71, down 6% from the prior year.
Shane will provide the details of our quarterly results shortly.
Our second quarter began during a time where positive COVID-19 cases were surging and there was strong potential for further economic shutdowns.
Cases have sharply declined during the quarter from those peaks and vaccinations have started to pick up, creating more stability in our overall operating environment.
That being said, economic activity remains somewhat stagnant, and we have yet to see significant recovery activities take hold.
This is especially true in the energy dependent markets that we service which have also stabilized, but have not yet begun to recover.
We continue to focus on providing our valuable products and services to existing customers and selling new customers on the value that UniFirst can bring to their business.
As we have discussed, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and services.
We believe the need and demand for hygienically clean garments and work environments positions our Company well to support the evolving economic landscape.
We continue to position our sales resources to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the market today and as the economy recovers.
Although our new account sales have been solid during the first six months of the year and comparable to the first half of fiscal 2020, they are down from the record level set in fiscal '19.
The overall impact from COVID-19 as well as sharp declines in activity in the energy dependent markets that we service are contributing to those comparisons.
This decline has been partially offset by increased sales to existing customers.
On a positive note, we do expect stronger activity over the second half of the year, and from a retention standpoint, we are showing marked improvements over the first half of fiscal 2020.
Although the trajectory of an eventual recovery is difficult to forecast, we do feel that the improved stability in the overall environment allows us enough comfort to share with you our outlook for the remainder of the year which Shane will provide shortly.
Vaccine optimism continues to be balanced by uncertainty as to when and how quickly the vaccine will create strong positive movement in the economy.
Our solid balance sheet positions us to meet these ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to invest in growth and strengthen our business.
As we've talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructures and our technologies.
All of these investments are designed to deliver solid long-term returns to UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components to our primary objective to being universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry.
We continue to make good progress on these core initiatives such as our CRM systems project.
We are pleased to report that we have successfully completed several pilot locations and have now officially moved into the deployment phase of the initiative.
Our CRM deployment is certainly a foundational change to our infrastructure that will allow for service ...
...he US and Canadian nuclear operations, which was partially offset by continued growth in the cleanroom business.
Both periods discussed benefited from significant one-time direct sales, which contributed to strong top line performance in a quarter that is usually negatively impacted by seasonality.
The segment's operating margin increased to 14.9% from 12.9%, primarily due to higher gross margin on its direct sales as well as lower travel related costs.
These items were partially offset by higher payroll costs as a percentage of revenues.
As we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services.
Our First Aid segment's revenues were $16.3 million compared to $16.4 million in the prior year.
However, the segment's operating profit was nominal compared to $1.1 million in the comparable period of 2020.
This decrease is primarily due to reduced sales from the segment's higher margin wholesale business, combined with continued investment in the Company's initiative to expand its first aid van business into new geographies.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $509.6 million at the end of our second quarter of fiscal 2021.
For the first half of fiscal 2021, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million as we continue to invest in our future with new facility additions, expansions, updates and automation systems that will help us meet our long-term strategic objectives.
As a reminder, capex spend is elevated primarily due to the purchase of a $14.1 million building in New York City in our first quarter of 2020 which will provide us a strategic location for a future service center.
During the quarter we capitalized $2.2 million related to our ongoing CRM project which consisted of license fees, third-party consulting costs and capitalized internal labor costs.
As at the end of our quarter, we had capitalized a total of $27.7 million related to our CRM project.
At this time, we have started a deployment of this application to our numerous locations and anticipate this will continue through fiscal 2022 and into fiscal 2023.
As a result, we will start to depreciate the system over a 10 year life in our third fiscal quarter of 2021, with depreciation in the second half of the year approximating $1.5 million to $2 million.
[Technical Issues] for our new capabilities like mobile handheld devices for our route drivers will ramp to an estimated $6 million to $7 million of additional depreciation expense per year.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we repurchased 12,200 shares of common stock for a total of $2.3 million under our previously announced stock repurchase program.
As of February 27, 2021, the Company had repurchased a total of 368,117 shares of common stock for $61.8 million under the program.
At this time we believe our ability to project our results has improved, and I would like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021.
We expect our fiscal 2021 revenues to be between $1.793 billion and $1.803 billion, which at the midpoint of the range assumes an organic growth rate in our core laundry operations of 3.5%.
As a reminder, the prior year comparison for the second half of fiscal 2021 will be negatively impacted by a $20.1 million large direct sale to a healthcare customer that we recorded in our third fiscal quarter of 2020.
Full year diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $7.30 and $7.65.
This outlook assumes an operating margin in our core laundry operations for the second half of the year of 10.4% and reflects additional expense we expect to incur related to the deployment of our CRM system of approximately $5 million.
Just to be clear, this amount includes the depreciation expense that I mentioned earlier.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining in the Q&A after Bob and Mike's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.

Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months.
Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent Board member for nine years.
As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others.
I know that the Agilent team is not alone and recognize that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed and we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family.
Now, on to the third quarter review and our updated outlook for the year.
In Q3, the very strong broad based momentum in our business continues.
The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations.
Q3 revenue of $1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core.
This is against the mass decline of 3% in Q3 of last year, so we are well above fiscal year 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
In addition, as other positive sign of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter.
Our growth is broad based across all business groups, markets and geographies.
The combination of strong top line performance and execution translated into excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share.
Our Q3 operating margin is 26%, this is up 230 basis points from last year.
EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year.
Agilent's success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess.
We are developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast growing businesses while delivering outstanding customer service and continue to drive profitability.
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerged even stronger as a company.
While we have yet to leave COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results.
Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, but I want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, pharma and chemical energy.
We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments.
Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall pharma revenue, up from the mid 20s just a few years ago.
In chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter.
This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half and our order funnel continues to strengthen.
Looking at our performance by business unit, The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $680 million.
LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core, off just a 4% decline last year.
LSAG's growth is broad based across all end markets.
Our performance is led by strength in pharma, which is up 22% and chemical energy up 31%.
All businesses delivered strong growth led by Cell Analysis at 38% growth and our LC and LCMS businesses, which grew 22%.
We continue to strengthen our position in the fast growing large molecule market segment.
During the quarter, the LSAG team launched three InfinityLab Bio LC systems at the well attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June.
These new products further extend our LC leadership position.
In addition, building on our already strong pharma offerings, we launched new compliance ready LC/Q-TOF and LC/TOF solution to our portfolio in the quarter.
The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $560 million, this is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis.
These results ar...
...arket, primarily in the U.S. also contributed to growth in this market and regionally the food market was led by the Americas and Europe.
Rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth.
On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations.
The performance was broad-based across all markets.
And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year.
All three business groups grew in China during the quarter.
Pharma, chemical and energy and diagnostics were the key drivers.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L, third-quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 80 basis points from a year ago despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency.
Our strong top line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team drove the year-on-year improvement.
And our supply team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers, despite the increase in demand.
Gross margin improvement -- performance along with continued operating expense leverage resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year.
Putting it all together, we delivered earnings per share of $1.10, up 41% versus last year.
Our tax rate was 14.75% and share count was 306 million shares, as expected.
We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year while crossing the $1 billion mark in nine months.
During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million.
Year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases.
And we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.8.
Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.
We are increasing our full-year revenue projection to a range of $6.29 billion to $6.32 billion, up $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4% and core growth of 14.5% to 15%.
Included is roughly three points of impact from currency and a small amount from M&A.
In addition, we are on track to deliver roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year.
We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year.
This translates the fourth quarter revenue ranging from $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion.
This represents reported growth of 10% to 12% and core growth of 8.5% to 10% on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns.
In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high watermark in our COVID related revenue.
And as a result, we expect to see roughly a one point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter.
So, our core growth excluding COVID would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%.
We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.18 with growth of 17% to 20%.
We believe our strategy is the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results we’ve been producing without the excellent execution by the team.
With that Parmeet, back to you for Q&A.

Now turning to the rest of the P&L.
Second quarter gross margin was 55.4% flat year-on-year, despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency.
Our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%, driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year, even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
So with that said, let's turn to our fiscal 2021 third-quarter results.
Given the continued challenging operating environment as a result of COVID-19, we are very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020, 2021 North American ski season.
Results continued to improve as the season progressed, primarily as a result of stronger destination visitation at our Colorado and Utah resorts, including improved lift ticket repurchases relative to the fiscal 2021 second-quarter results.
destination, mountain resorts and regional ski areas for the third quarter was only a down 3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Whistler Blackcomb's performance continued to be negatively impacted due to the continued closure of the Canadian border to international guests, including guests from the U.S., and was further impacted by the resort closing earlier than expected on March 30, 2021, following a provincial health order issued by the government of British Columbia.
Whistler Blackcomb's total visitation for the third quarter declined nearly 60% to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
While visitation and revenue trends improved throughout the quarter, our ancillary lines of business continue to be significantly and negatively impacted by COVID-19-related capacity constraints and limitations, particularly in food and beverage and ski school.
We maintained disciplined cost controls throughout the quarter and continue operating our ancillary lines of business at reduced capacity.
As Rob mentioned, we're very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020-2021 North American ski season.
As a reminder, in the prior year, we announced the early closure of the 2019-2020 North American ski season for our ski areas, lodging properties, and retail rental stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning on March 15, 2020.
These actions had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter of 2020.
Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limitations and restrictions on our operations continued to have an adverse impact on our results for the third fiscal quarter of 2021.
Net income attributable to Vail Resorts was $274.6 million or $6.72 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $152.5 million or $3.74 per diluted share in the prior year.
Resort reported EBITDA was $462.2 million in the third fiscal quarter, which compares to resort reported EBITDA of $304.4 million in the same period in the prior year.
ski season in the current year with particularly strong demand at our Colorado and Utah destination resorts.
Resort-reported EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 52%, exceeding both the prior-year period of 43.9% and fiscal 2019 third quarter of 50.2%.
These results reflect our rigorous approach to cost management, as well as a higher proportion of lift revenue relative to ancillary lines of business compared to prior periods.
Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2021.
Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. is expected to be between $93 million and $139 million for fiscal 2021.
We expect the resort-reported EBITDA for fiscal 2021 will be between $530 million and $570 million, and we expect the resort-reported EBITDA margin for fiscal 2021 will be approximately 28.9% using the midpoint of the guidance range.
Our guidance assumes all of our operations are open and aligned with current health and safety protocols and capacity restrictions.
Current demand trends continue.
We experienced normal weather conditions throughout the Australia's East season and North American summer season, and there is no impact from potential COVID-19-related shutdowns or lockdowns.
The guidance specifically assumes no impact from potential demand or operational disruptions associated with the current lockdowns in Victoria...
...letely new to our database.
We saw our strongest unit growth in our destination markets, particularly in the Northeast, and also had very strong growth across our local markets.
Compared to the period ended June 4, 2019, effective pass price decreased 10% as compared to the 20% price decrease we implemented this year.
We believe this highlights how our lower pricing has increased the propensity of passholders to spend a portion of the new discount to purchase higher-valued pass products.
We expected that the price reduction would result in higher pass renewal rates, increased trade up to higher-value passes, and drive incremental guests to our network.
We are encouraged that each of these trends is evident in the season-to-date pass sales results, which we believe supports our expected results for next year, as well as the expected long-term benefits of increasing guest lifetime value.
The pass results exceeded our original expectations to the impact of the 20% price reduction.
However, we still have the majority of our pass selling season ahead of us, and it is not yet clear if these trends will continue through the fall.
In addition, we are very pleased that ongoing sales of the Epic Australia pass, which ends on June 15, 2021, are up approximately 43% in units through June 1, 2021, as compared to the comparable period through June 4, 2019, representing significant growth following the acquisition of Falls Creek and Hotham in April 2019.
Given the recent COVID-19-related lockdowns in Victoria, Australia, we will be monitoring any impacts on the Epic Australia pass sales.
Our commitment to reinvesting in our resorts and the guest experience remains one of our highest priorities.
As previously announced this summer and fall, we will be completing several signature investments subject to regulatory approvals.
In Colorado, we are moving forward with a 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in the signature McCoy Park area of Beaver Creek, further differentiating the resort's high-end family focused experience.
We also plan to add a new four-person high-speed lift at Breckenridge to serve the popular peak 7, replace the Peru lift at Keystone with a six-person high-speed chairlift and replace the Peachtree lift at Crested Butte with a new three-person fixed-grip lift.
At Okemo, we plan to compete a transportational investment, including upgrading the Quantum lift from a four-person to a six-person high-speed chair lift and relocating the existing four-person Quantum lift to replace the Green Ridge three-person fixed-grip chairlift.
These investments will greatly improve uplift capacity, further enhance the guest experience, and complete our $35 million capital plan for the season.
We remain highly focused on investments that will further our companywide technology enhancements to support our data-driven approach, guest experience, and corporate infrastructure.
As part of these efforts, we are continuing to invest in resources and technology to improve our customer service experience, including significant staffing increases in our call centers and self-service technology that will provide our guests the ability to better manage their own accounts.
We will also continue to invest in ongoing maintenance capital to support infrastructure across our resorts.
As we head into next year, we know that talent and staffing will be critical for our success, as it always is.
And we have announced that we will be raising our minimum entry wages in Colorado, Utah, Washington, and California to $15 per hour while also making material increases in the entry wages of our Eastern resorts, which will be set based upon their local market dynamics.
This will be our largest discretionary investment in operating expense this year, which we believe will be offset by a portion of other savings we will carry from this year into next year.
I'm deeply grateful for the commitment our teams continue to demonstrate throughout these unprecedented circumstances.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Once again, this is John Bruno.
Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, chairman and chief executive officer; and Vince Morales, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. markets closed on Thursday, January 20, 2022.
Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.
Now, let me introduce PPG chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening.
For the fourth quarter, we achieved record net sales of about $4.2 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for $1.26.
To quickly summarize that quarter, we had favorable sales versus our forecast that incurred significant manufacturing challenges due to COVID-related staffing shortages, intermittent customer order patterns, and raw material supply challenges.
Our adjusted earnings were aided by a lower-than-expected tax rate in the fourth quarter, as we recognized more favorable discrete items.
Excluding the favorable impact from the tax rate, our adjusted earnings per share was about 10% below the financial guidance we've provided in October.
Our sales performance for the fourth quarter was solid as we achieved higher than sales in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected automotive OEM global production, higher selling price realization, and strong above-market sales volumes and several of our end-use markets.
Overall demand remains robust.
Our PPG-Comex business delivered yet again another excellent quarter and finished with 10% organic sales growth for the full year of 2021.
This business had record sales and earnings growth for 2021 and continued to expand its concessionaire network.
And in January, we will have 5,000 concessionaire locations in our network.
And we recently added our traffic solutions products to its portfolio.
The protective and marine business continued its trend of strong top line results, this time led by improvements in the marine coatings where industry builds are expected to grow for the next several years.
We also continue to grow our share in automotive refinish, where our full suite of advantaged products and services differentiate PPG from our competition.
And in automotive OEM, we were awarded new 2022 business based upon our expanded mobility product offering.
And finally, we realized higher increased selling prices globally.
Lastly, the recently acquired Tikkurila business delivered record sales and earnings for any fourth quarter despite the difficult operating environment.
As I mentioned, overall sales would have been better, but we experienced continuing supply chain disruptions and a significant increase in COVID cases that hampered our ability to fully and consistently operate and prevented us from fully meeting our strong customer order books.
Recently, some of our manufacturing facilities have had up to 40% of their workforce out.
In several businesses, we continue to face certain raw material shortages with the biggest impacts in U.S. architectural coatings and traffic solutions.
Overall, our sales backlog grew, and in total, was about $150 million exiting the quarter, most notably in our aerospace and automotive refinish and general industrial businesses.
Our segment earnings did not meet our expectations.
While we benefited from higher sales and increased selling prices, it was not sufficient to offset significant inflation, supply disruptions, and operational inefficiencies caused by the rapid increase in COVID cases within our employee base, and those of our customers and suppliers.
Raw material cost inflation was up approximately 30% compared to prior year.
And transportation costs spiked due to shortages of available trucks and drivers.
In addition, operating costs were progressively higher during the...
... 120 consecutive years.
Our working capital as a percent of sales remain at historically low levels and comparable to last year, even though we purchased more raw material than typical in the fourth quarter.
Finally, we have lowered our net debt by about $350 million since funding Tikkurila in June and exited 2021 with a strong balance sheet and optionality for future accretive cash deployment.
Throughout 2021, we took actions to bolster our ESG program.
As an example, in the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our overall ESG corporate governance structure.
We define accountability and oversight for all major elements of our ESG efforts under respective board committees.
We also redefined and renamed our Technology and Environmental Committee to the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, with a key focus on tracking our sustainability progress and defining climate-related risks and opportunities.
Looking ahead, demand continues to be robust in most of our end-use markets.
Tightened supply and COVID-related disruptions evidenced in the fourth quarter are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2022 impacting our ability to manufacture and deliver product.
We expect economic activity to be soft in China during the first quarter as more severe operating restrictions have recently been imposed due to COVID and during the Winter Olympics.
We anticipate more favorable economic conditions in the second quarter.
We plan to implement further selling price increases in all our businesses as raw materials and other cost inflation remain at elevated levels and are increasing further in certain areas.
We will continue to aggressively manage all aspects of our cost structure and are managing to minimize the cost impacts of the current supply challenge.
The first quarter earnings per share guidance that we provided has a wider range than normal.
As is typical, the month of March will be the largest component to our quarterly sales.
Our current visibility to the second half of the quarter is limited due to uncertainties around the supply chain disruptions and the various impacts of omicron globally.
While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I expect that as 2020 progresses, we will start to experience more economic reopenings and an easing of supply chain problems, general inventory rebuilding across many end-use markets, and a healthy consumer willing to spend.
I remain very optimistic about future earnings capability of our company and see many catalysts to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed them.
This includes: first, continued recovery in the automotive refinish, OEM, and aerospace coatings businesses, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales and where we have broad global businesses supported by advantaged technologies.
The volume for these businesses remain about 15% below pre-pandemic levels.
And we are already experiencing improving order flow that is being crimped by supply availability; second, normalization of commodity raw material costs, which should moderate over time as supply dislocations improve; third, higher operating leverage on sales volumes supported by our lower cost structure; fourth, year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 and 2023 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions, including a 15% increase to our original synergy target; and finally, above market organic growth driven by our advantaged and leading brands, technology, and services.
This initiative strongly supports our asset-light strategy by adding more than 2,000 distribution locations.
Together with The Home Depot, we are positioned to outgrow the pro market in the U.S. Considering all of these catalysts, I believe we have a path to at least $9 of earnings per share in 2023.
Every day, their hard work and commitment to delivering on our company's purpose to protect and beautify the world are reasons why we are well-positioned today and in the future.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.
In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share.
Included in the results for the quarter was a $55 million legal reserve build.
Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71.
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion.
We recorded a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-offs was offset by a $1.7 billion allowance release.
Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of strong Domestic Card purchase volume on noninterest income and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago.
Period-end loans held for investment grew $6.5 billion or 3%, inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans to held-for-sale during the quarter.
The loans moved to held-for-sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an International Card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans.
Turning to Slide 4.
I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter.
We released $1.7 billion of allowance, primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook.
Turning to Slide 5.
We provide the allowance coverage ratios by segment.
You can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments, largely reflecting the dynamics I just described.
However, coverage ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes.
Our Domestic Card coverage is now 8.9%, down from 10.5% last quarter.
Our branded card coverage is 10.1%.
Recall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is largely driven by the loss sharing agreements in some of our partnership portfolios.
Coverage in our consumer business declined about 60 basis points to 3%.
In addition to continued strong credit performance and improved economic outlook, historically high auto values aided the reduction in coverage.
Coverage in our Commercial Banking business declined about 25 basis points to 1.7%, with the single largest driver being the improvement in our energy portfolio.
Turning to Page 6.
I'll now discuss liquidity.
You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first -- during the quarter was 141%.
The LCR continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement.
Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $137 billion.
The $14 billion decline in total liquidity was driven by lower ending cash balances.
Our cash position declined in the quarter as it was redeployed to net loan growth, wholesale funding maturities, a modest increase in our securities portfolio and share repurchases.
Moving to Page 7.
I'll now discuss net interest margin.
You can see that our second quarter net interest margin was 5.89%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter.
The linked-quarter decline in NIM was largely driven by lower yield in our card portfolio, where the typical seasonal decrease in revolve rate was exacerbated by higher transactor volume and associated higher payments.
These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact from one more day in the quarter.
Lastly, turning to Slide 8.
I will cover our capital position.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5% at the end of the second quarter, down 10 basis points from the first quarter.
Loan growth and capital actions were largely offset by earnings growth.
During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test.
Our stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 2.5%, resulting in a total capital requirement by the Fed of 7%.
While we saw a decline in this year's SCB, it's important to note that the...
...wth in our auto business.
Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year over year.
Average deposits were up 9% year over year.
Consumer Banking revenue increased 27% from the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits.
Second-quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.2 billion year over year, driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our auto business.
Credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong.
Year over year, the second quarter charge-off rate improved 120 basis points to negative 0.12%, and the delinquency rate was essentially flat at 3.26%.
In the quarter, elevated used car prices drove an increase in auction proceeds, amplifying the normal seasonal benefit we see from tax refunds around this time of the year.
As used vehicle prices normalize, they will become a headwind to the auto charge-off rate.
we expect the auto charge-off rate to increase from the unusually low second quarter level.
Moving to Slide 13.
I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business.
Second quarter ending loan balances were down 5% year over year.
Average loans were down 7%.
Commercial line utilization continues to be down year over year, and we moved $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held-for-sale.
Quarterly average deposits increased 22% from the second quarter of 2020 and 5% from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity.
Second-quarter revenue was up 3% from the prior-year quarter and down 6% from the linked quarter.
The linked quarter decline is more than entirely driven by a one-time cost associated with moving the commercial real estate loans to held for sale.
This decline was offset by an equivalent one-time gain in the other category and is therefore neutral to the company.
Excluding this effect, Commercial Banking revenue would have increased about 13% year over year and 4% from the linked quarter.
Provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and a swing from net charge-offs to net recoveries.
In the second quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was negative 11 basis points.
The criticized performing loan rate was 7.6%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1%.
Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.
Several key themes are evident in our second quarter results.
Credit remains strikingly strong.
Purchase volume and loans are rebounding.
We're continuing to invest to propel our future results, and we're returning capital to our shareholders.
We are seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build our Domestic Card business as we emerge from the pandemic.
We are leaning further into marketing to seize these opportunities.
We are also increasing our marketing for auto, national banking and our brand.
We are now in the ninth year of a journey to build a modern technology company from the bottom of the tech stack up.
Our progress is accelerating, and the stakes are rising.
Competitor tech investments are increasing as technology is increasingly seen as an existential issue.
The investment flowing into fintechs is nothing short of breathtaking.
And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, including levels of compensation.
We continue to invest in technology and the opportunities that emerge as our transformation gains traction.
Our modern technology is powering our current performance and setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking.
We'll now start the Q&A session.
[Operator instructions] If you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.
Holly, please start the Q&A.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, let me remind you that the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
Kevin McNamara, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed Corporation; Dave Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chemed; and Nick Westfall President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed's VITAS Healthcare Corporation subsidiary.
Sherri is retiring at the end of the year, and this is her last introduction to our quarterly conference call.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter.
And David and Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.
Our third quarter 2021 operating results released last night, reflect very solid performance for both VITAS and Roto-Rooter.
On a go-forward basis, I would like to share with you some of the macro issues we are dealing with as we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic.
For VITAS, the most important issue, we are managing labor.
Staffing of license professionals has been exceptionally challenging to ensure adequate mix of license healthcare workers on a market by market basis.
This is particularly challenging during the pandemic, as we deal with dynamic fluctuations in patient census in every market.
Turnover within our license staff remains above our pre-pandemic rates, but we are seeing indications of normalization, as we continue to expand our hiring and retention initiatives in many markets.
Beyond managing our staffing levels, we are observing increasing pressure on salaries and wages.
To date, we've managed these pressures with increased paid time off or PTO, we view it as inevitable that healthcare wages will increase if we continue to have a nationwide systemic imbalance in supply and demand for license healthcare professionals.
Fortunately, for VITAS and the hospice industry, there is a natural hedge against the inflationary pressures on costs, specifically labor.
The annual increase in the Medicare and Medicaid hospice reimbursement rates is based primarily on inflation in the hospital wage index basket, as measured by the federal government's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Typically, the annual inflation measured as of March 31 is used to determine the following October 1 reimbursement increase.
This should give the hospice industry reasonable stability in operating margins in an inflationary environment, albeit with a six month lag from the inflation measurement to the actual reimbursement increase.
The second critical challenge for VITAS is the continued disruption to senior housing occupancy and the latest hospice referrals.
A recent admission data suggests senior housing is in the process of recovery pre-pandemic nursing home base patients represented 18% of our total average daily census or ADC.
The nursing of ADC ratio hit a low of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021 nursing home base patients increased 60 basis points to 14.9%.
And then, the third quarter of 2021, our nursing home patients represented 15.6% of our total ABC.
Our updated 2021 guidance anticipates sequential improvement in senior housing base patients in the fourth quarter of 2021 with acceleration in senior housing admissions anticipated in 2022.
For Roto Rooter, our must significant challenge has been to increase manpower.
We've expanded technician manpower by 8% in 2021.
However, based on our current demand levels, we continue to remain understaffed in many of our markets.
Technician compensation plays a role in recruiting new employees as well as retention of our existing employee base.
Our average 2021 technician and field sales force compensation is over $81,000 per year.
Most of our technicians are paid out on a commission basis of revenue generated.
As a result, pri...
... in the quarter totaled $52.3 million, which is an increase of $4.7 million or 10% over the prior year.
The aggregate commercial revenue growth consisted of drain cleaning increasing 17.6%, plumbing increasing 9.3%, and commercial excavation declining 1.3%.
Water restoration also increased 9.4%.
Now, let's turn to Chemed on a consolidated basis.
During the quarter, we repurchased 350,000 shares of Chemed stock for $164 million, which equates to a cost per share of $467.80.
As of September 30 of 2021, there is approximately $148 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under this plan.
Chemed restarted its share repurchase program in 2007.
Since that time, Chemed has repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares, aggregating approximately $1.7 billion, at an average share cost of $113.04.
Including dividends over the same period, Chemed has returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders.
We have updated our full-year 2021 guidance as follows: VITAS was 2021 revenue, prior to Medicare Cap, is estimated to decline approximately 5% when compared to the prior year period.
Average daily census in 2021, is estimated to decline 5.5%.
In our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin, prior to Medicare Cap, is estimated to be 18.8%.
We're currently estimating $6.6 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations release calendar year 2021.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve full-year 2021 revenue growth of 17.3%.
Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 is estimated to be between 28.5% and 29%.
Based on the above full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock option exercises, cost related to litigation and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of $19 to $19.20.
This compares to our initial 2021 adjusted earnings guidance per diluted share of $17 in $17.50.
This revised 2021 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate on adjusted earnings of 25.1%.
This compares to Chemed's 2020 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $18.8.
In the third quarter, our average daily census was 18,034 patients, a decline of 5% over the prior year and 0.2% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2021.
This year-over-year decline in average daily census is a direct result of pandemic related disruptions across the entire healthcare system since March of 2020.
Our hospital generated emissions have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels.
Referrals from senior housing, specifically nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, continue to be disrupted.
During the third quarter, we've seen admission stabilization and pockets of improvement in senior housing admissions.
However, it remains too early to accurately project the pace and time line for senior housing admissions to fully return to pre-pandemic levels.
In the third quarter of 2021, total VITAS admissions were 17, 598.
This is a 1.9% decline when compared to the third quarter of 2020 admissions and a 4.5% sequential increase when compared to the second quarter of 2021.
In the third quarter, on a year-over-year basis, our hospital directed admissions declined 0.8%.
Total home-based pre-admit admissions decreased 8.3%, nursing home admits declined 0.2%, and assisted living facility admissions declined 8.6%.
When you compare our third quarter 2021 admissions to the second quarter of 2021, we generated solid sequential improvement with hospital directed admissions improving 2%, total home based pre-admit admissions increasing 16.3%, nursing home admits expanding 8.9%, and assisted living facility admissions increasing 5% sequentially.
Our average length of stay in the quarter was 96 days.
This compares to 97.1 days in the third quarter of 2020 and 94.5 days in the second quarter of 2021.
Our median length of stay was 13 days in the quarter and compares to 14 days in the third quarter of 2020, and is equal to the second quarter of 2021.
I will now open this teleconference to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, let me remind you that the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter, and Dave and Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.
I will then open up the call to questions.
Operating two distinct business units during our global pandemic has been exceptionally challenging.
Fortunately, we have begun to return to normalcy.
The pandemic had created unique problems, logistical hurdles and forced our operations to make significant changes in field and home office procedures.
Many of these changes have been institutionalized and will become part of our normal operating procedures post-pandemic.
I could not be prouder of our management team.
Both VITAS and Roto-Rooter met these pandemic challenges head-on, produced excellent operating results that are well positioned for growth in the coming years.
In April 2020, the first full month of the pandemic, Roto-Rooter experienced an immediate and severe drop in demand for all plumbing and drain cleaning services.
This drop was short-lived.
Starting in May 2020, Roto-Rooter saw a spike in residential plumbing and drain cleaning demand.
This increase in demand was sustained throughout 2020 and has continued unabated in the first six months of 2021.
Commercial demand has also improved up pandemic lows and have now normalized close to pre-pandemic levels.
For the remainder of 2021, I anticipate Roto-Rooter's residential demand to remain at the current run rate, coupled with increased commercial demand as the country returns to normalized pre-pandemic consumer behavior.
The Great Recession, and now a global pandemic.
In each of these crises, Roto-Rooter remained operating and materially increased market share, revenue and operating margin.
Just as important, Roto-Rooter has held on to the increases in revenue market share and margins in past crisis.
Roto-Rooter is well positioned post-pandemic, and we anticipate continued expansion of market share by pressing our core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time and 24/7 call centers and Internet presence.
For VITAS, the most significant issue remaining from the pandemic is the disruption to senior housing occupancy and the related hospital referrals.
Recent admissions' data suggest senior housing has entered into the early stages of recovery, and our updated guidance anticipates steady improvement in the senior housing referred hospice admissions in the second half of 2021, with a further acceleration in senior housing admissions anticipated in the fourth quarter.
With that, I would like to turn this teleconference over to David.
Let's turn to VITAS.
VITAS' net revenue was $312 million in the second quarter of 2021, which is a decline of 4.7% when compared to the prior year period.
This revenue decline is comprised primarily of a 6.3% reduction in our days of care, offset by a geographically weighted Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 1.8%.
Acuity mix shift did have a net impact of reducing revenues approximately $3.8 million in the quarter or 1.2%.
The combination of a lower Medicare Cap billing limitation and other contra-revenue charges offset a portion of the revenue decline by roughly 90 basis points.
VITAS did accrue $2 million in Medicare Cap billing limitations in the second quarter of 2021, and this compares to a $5.7 million Medicare Cap billing limitation in the second quarter of 2020.
Of our 30 Medicare provider numbers, right now 27 of these provider numbers have a Medicare Cap cushion of 10% or greater.
One of our provider numbers has a cap cushion between 0% and 5%, and two of our provider numbers currently have a fiscal 2021 Medicare Cap billi...
...mercial side.
On the residential side, total residential revenue in the quarter totaled $149 million, an increase of 23.7% over the prior year period.
The aggregate residential growth consisted of drain cleaning increasing 20.6%, plumbing expanding 30.7% and excavation increasing 22.4%.
Water restoration also increased 23.1%.
Basically increases across the board, all segments, both commercially and residential.
Now let's look at Chemed on a consolidated basis.
During the quarter, Chemed repurchased 250,000 shares of stock for roughly $122 million, which equates to a cost per share of $487.53.
As of June 30, 2021, there was approximately $312 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under this plan.
We've also updated our 2021 earnings guidance as follows: VITAS' full year 2021 revenue prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to decline approximately 4.5% when compared to 2020.
Our average daily census in 2021 is estimated to decline approximately 5%.
This guidance anticipates senior housing occupancy will begin to normalize to pre-pandemic occupancy, starting in the second half of calendar year 2021.
VITAS' full year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is forecasted to be 18.3%, and we are currently estimating $7.5 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations in calendar year 2021.
That's an improvement from the initial $10 million of Medicare Cap we estimated at the start of this year.
Roto-Rooter is forecast to achieve full year 2021 revenue growth of 15% to 15.5%.
Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 is estimated to be between 28% and 29%.
So based upon this discussion, our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding noncash expense or stock options, any tax benefits we receive from stock option exercises as well as costs related to litigation and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of $18.20 to $18.50.
The revised guidance compares to our initial 2021 guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share of $17 to $17.50.
In the second quarter, our average daily census was 17,995 patients, a decline of 6.3% over the prior year.
This decline in average daily census is a direct result of pandemic-related disruptions across the entire healthcare system.
This negatively impacted traditional hospice admission patterns, starting in March of 2020.
Our hospital generated admissions have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels.
Referrals from senior housing, specifically nursing home and assisted living facilities continue to be disrupted.
During the second quarter, we have seen admission stabilization and pockets of improvements in senior housing admissions.
However, it remains too early to accurately project the pace and timeline for senior housing admissions to fully return to pre-pandemic levels.
In the second quarter of 2021, total VITAS admissions were 16,840.
This is a slight improvement when compared to the second quarter of 2020 admissions.
More importantly, admissions in the second quarter of 2021 exceeded discharges by 315 patients.
This is the first quarter since the pandemic began that our patient admissions have exceeded patient discharges.
This is the strongest indication to date that we are now beginning the process of rebuilding census to pre-pandemic levels.
In the second quarter, our hospital directed admissions expanded 7.8% and emergency room admits decreased 9%.
Total home-based preadmit admissions decreased 9.3%, nursing home admits declined 9.9%, assisted living facility admissions declined 17.5% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Our average length of stay in the quarter was 94.5 days.

Roto-Rooter experienced a surge in residential demand starting in May 2020, which has continued into 2021. The company anticipates this trend and increased commercial demand to support continued growth. VITAS faced challenges in senior housing occupancy and hospital referrals due to the pandemic, but recent data suggests a gradual recovery in these areas. The company projects a decline in full-year 2021 revenue of approximately 4.5% compared to 2020, while expecting an average daily census decrease of 5%. VITAS' adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 18.3%, with Medicare Cap billing limitations estimated at $7.5 million, an improvement from the initial estimate of $10 million.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Let me start by providing some key takeaways.
First, we continue taking share in the global contact lens market, with CooperVision being flat for calendar Q3 against the market being down 3%.
We're having success with our strong daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, with unique products like Biofinity Energys, and with several product launches.
Second, CooperSurgical outperformed with fertility, PARAGARD, and medical devices all exceeding expectations.
In particular, we're taking share in the fertility market, where we're seeing strong momentum.
Third, our myopia management portfolio comprised of MiSight and Ortho K lenses performed extremely well, including MiSight being up 73%.
So we're taking share, launching products, and investing intelligently, including helping expand the pediatric optometry marketplace.
Our teams are executing at a very high level, and we expect that to continue.
Moving to the numbers and reporting all percentages on a constant-currency basis, we posted consolidated revenues of $682 million in Q4, with CooperVision revenues of $506 million, down 3%; and CooperSurgical revenues of $175 million, down 4%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.16.
For CooperVision, the Americas were up 3%, led by strength in MyDay and Biofinity and some rebound in channel inventory of roughly $10 million.
EMEA was down 6%, which included quarter-end purchasing delays from several large accounts as the region returned to more restrictive COVID-related lockdowns in October.
Asia Pac was down 8% with COVID-related softness lingering longer into the quarter than we were expecting.
To add a little more color on Asia Pac, we're well-positioned in that region and taking share, but the market has been sluggish.
We are becoming more optimistic, though, as we saw a pickup in October and November, driven by strong MyDay sales.
Overall, for the full quarter, revenues came in roughly where we expected with COVID continuing to present challenges, but we're managing through it and taking share by executing on product launches and expanding our key account relationships.
Moving to some additional quarterly numbers.
Our silicone hydrogel dailies were up 1% in Q4, led by strength in torics and a strong rebound in MyDay sphere sales.
We're seeing daily silicones as the clear winner right now as health and wellness trends continue to drive adoption, and this bodes well for us given our strong portfolio.
Additionally, we're now fully unconstrained on MyDay, so we're able to aggressively launch the product around the world, especially the toric, which is still relatively early in its launch stage.
Biofinity and Avaira combined to be flat for the quarter, with strength noted in Biofinity toric and Energys.
Energys continues to be a strong performer, growing double digits.
It was launched a few years ago, probably a little ahead of its time.
But its innovative lens design that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time is certainly catching on now as it's addressing an important need in today's digital world.
Moving to our product launches.
We remain incredibly busy with MyDay sphere and toric being launched or relaunched in many markets around the world.
Biofinity toric multifocal and clariti's extended daily toric range continuing their successful launches and the launch of MiSight.
One point to highlight is how incredibly active we are in the daily silicone hydrogel space right now, probably busier launching products than anyone, and we expect this to continue throughout 2021.
Given there still exists roughly $2.4 billion in traditional daily hydrogel sales worldwide, there's a significant multiyear trade-up opportunity for us and our industry.
The only FDA-approved myopia management contact lens clinically proven to slow the progression of myopia in children.
Things are going incredibly well.
We now have roughly 25,000 kids around the world wearing MiSight, including over 1,000 in the U.S., and the momentum w...
...margin increased 70 basis points year over year to 67.7%.
This was driven primarily by currency at CooperVision and efficiency improvements at CooperSurgical, from our successful global manufacturing integration and consolidation efforts.
This quarter was an extremely busy one for our manufacturing teams as we work diligently to finish most of our manufacturing restructuring activity.
This now allows us to minimize costs while optimizing production to more efficiently manage inventory levels and improve margins and cash flow.
We're in a significantly better position with our manufacturing operations rightsized for the current environment, while also being well-positioned to ramp up quickly.
We still have some absorption-related inefficiencies, but we expect these to go away quickly as growth returns.
OPEX was up 4.3% year over year, largely due to planned MiSight investment activity, including sales and marketing, regulatory, and R&D costs.
This resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.8%, down from 28.5% last year.
This performance slightly exceeded expectations as we continued to effectively managing expenses, balancing costs against investment opportunities.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.7 million, driven by lower interest rates and lower average debt and the effective tax rate was 11.1%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.16 with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding.
The year-over-year FX impact for the quarter to revenue and earnings per share was a positive $10.6 million and a positive $0.15.
Free cash flow was strong at $111 million, comprised of $218 million of operating cash flow offset by $107 million of CAPEX.
Net debt decreased by $76 million to $1.68 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.15 times.
Before moving to guidance, I want to mention an item you'll see disclosed in the tax footnote in our upcoming 10-K.
In November, as part of an internal restructuring to simplify our supply chain, CooperVision's intellectual property and related assets were transferred from Barbados to the U.K. Although this will impact our GAAP financials, including a significant onetime P&L benefit in Q1, along with offsetting adjustments over the next 10-plus years, we will exclude these entries from our non-GAAP results to ensure transparency.
We do not expect this having a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate over this period.
We were hoping to give full-year guidance but the surging COVID cases in Europe and in the U.S., make that extremely difficult.
So we're providing only Q1 guidance at this time.
This includes consolidated revenues of $642 million to $670 million, down 1% to up 4% or down 3% to up 2% in constant currency.
CooperVision revenue of $482 million to $502 million, down 1% to up 4% or down 3% to up 1% in constant currency.
And CooperSurgical revenue of $160 million to $168 million, down 1% to up 4%, both as reported and in constant currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.86.
As compared to last year, we expect the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to be up $0.07 due to a positive $0.21 currency impact, offset by MiSight investment activity and slightly lower gross margins tied to unfavorable manufacturing absorption.
Below the line, we expect lower interest expense to be roughly offset by a higher effective tax rate.
Lastly, on cash flow.
We made significant progress completing our multiyear capacity expansion program and expect solid improvement in free cash flow moving forward as operating cash flow improves and CAPEX reduces.
In conclusion, even with COVID, we expect to start the year off well.
We have strong product lines, solid manufacturing, and distribution capabilities, growing key account relationships, plenty of MyDay capacity, and a dynamic myopia management business.
We plan to continue taking market share, and we look forward to COVID vaccines and better treatments returning markets to normal.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to investors.
These measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.
Please consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.
Then Julie will provide a review of our financial results and details of our updated outlook for 2021.
Barnes Group delivered a very good third quarter of financial performance with 20% organic sales growth, a 180 basis points increase in adjusted operating margin, and an 80-plus percent increase in earnings per share year-over-year.
Sequentially, each of those metrics improved as well.
Clearly, last year was highly impacted by the global pandemic.
Nonetheless, the demand environment overall improved across the portfolio, as each of our SBUs generated double-digit organic sales growth.
Similarly, orders were seasonally good as we generated a book-to-bill of 0.9 times for both industrial and aerospace.
Industrial book-to-bill in the third quarter is typically impacted by the summer holiday season, particularly in Europe.
That said, the ongoing impact of auto semiconductors lingered, and I'll address that in more detail shortly.
In Aerospace, orders were healthy for a fourth straight quarter.
Moving to our segment discussion beginning with Industrial.
Organic sales growth was 17% while organic orders growth was 3%.
As we exited the third quarter, manufacturing PMIs in the U.S. and Eurozone remain well in expansionary territory.
So, not as is robust as they were entering the quarter.
China continues to hover around the neutral 50 mark.
The continuing semiconductor issue affecting automotive builds has worsened prompting IHS to make a significant downward adjustment to their global automotive production forecast in September.
Relative to their prior view, 2021 production was reduced by 5 million units or 6%, and 2022 was reduced by 8.5 million units or 9%.
The decrease corresponds for customers expanding shutdowns, and pushing out demand for our products.
For 2022, IHS expects global auto production to grow 11% over this year, so still a rebound.
Supply chain disruptions including expanded raw material lead times, inflation and freight costs have also persisted throughout the quarter.
And we expect them to continue through the remainder of the year, and into the first half of 2022.
In spite of the headwinds, the industrial team has done a great job to improve margins both year-over-year and sequentially.
Operating margin was 13%, up 60 basis points from a year ago and 130 basis points sequentially.
Inflationary pressures have been mitigated to the extent possible through pricing actions and raw material pass-through arrangements.
Our Barnes Enterprise System has been employed to create various cost savings.
While our July outlook contemplated $2 million of second half inflation pressure, we saw approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter.
And we now forecast a similar amount in the fourth quarter.
Within Molding Solutions, organic orders were up low-single digits with medical rebounding of year-over-year and sequentially.
Automotive orders were solid up mid-teens, driven by a strong quarter in Asia.
Packaging and personal care orders were soft compared to a year ago.
With respect to organic sales, we generated a 15% increase over the prior year quarter.
Personal care and medical saw good sales growth, while automotive was particularly strong.
However, with anticipated supply chain factors in mind, our organic sales growth outlook has been trimmed to the low-teens for the full year, a bit softer than our prior view.
At Force & Motion Control, organic orders were up 27% with organic sales up 24%.
On a sequential basis, sales and orders were approximately flat.
Our largest end market with this business sheet metal forming saw a robust orders and sales growth ye...
...ing the $6.8 million in last year's third quarter.
Excluding a small amount of restructuring in the current and prior year period, adjusted operating profit was up 95% from a year ago.
Adjusted operating profit benefited from the contribution of higher sales volumes and favorable productivity offset in part by higher personnel costs including incentive compensation.
Adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, up 490 basis points from last year and 130 basis points sequentially.
Aerospace OEM backlog ended September at $665 million, down 4% from June 2021 and we expect to convert approximately 40% of this backlog to revenue over the next year.
Before moving to our cash flow discussion, I'd like to make you aware of an adjustment to our reported backlog.
During the quarter, we noted that our June backlog included a portion of unshipped orders that had already been recognized in revenue under percentage of completion.
Accordingly, a downward adjustment of $46 million at Industrial and $19 million at Aerospace was made during the third quarter.
This adjustment is reflected in our September ending backlog and no further adjustments are anticipated.
Earlier reported sales, orders and book-to-bill were not impacted.
Moving to cash flow performance, year-to-date cash provided by operating activities was $128 million versus $164 million last year with free cash flow of $101 million, down from $134 million last year.
Capital expenditures were $27 million, down approximately $3 million from a year ago.
As a reminder, year-to-date operating cash flow in 2020 saw an approximate $60 million benefit from working capital as cash management was a significant focus during the pandemic.
Regarding the balance sheet, our debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement was 2.6 times at quarter end, down from 2.9 times at the end of last quarter.
Our third quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 51.1 million during the third quarter, we did not repurchase shares and approximately 3.6 million shares remain available under the Board's 2019 stock repurchase authorization.
Turning to Slide 6 of our supplement, let me provide you with our updated financial outlook for 2021.
Organic sales are forecast to be up 11% to 12% for the year consistent with our prior view.
Foreign exchange is expected to have about a 2% favorable impact on sales, while divested Seeger revenues will have a small negative impact.
Adjusted operating margin is forecast to be approximately 12.5%, down slightly from 13% in our July outlook.
We expect a small amount of residual restructuring charges in the fourth quarter which we will take as an adjustment to 2021 net income.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.93 per share, up 12% to 18% from our 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $1.64.
This expectation reflects the decrease at the top end of our previous range of $1.83 to $1.98 related to Q4 headwinds.
A few other outlook items, our interest expense forecast remains approximately $16 million while other expense is anticipated to be $6 million, slightly less than our July outlook.
We expect the full year tax rate of approximately 29% excluding adjusted items, a point lower than our previous estimate.
Estimated Capex of $40 million is down from our prior view of $50 million, average diluted shares of $51 million is consistent with our prior view.
And cash conversion is now anticipated to be approximately 120%, an increase over our prior expectation of greater than 110%.
To close, financially, we delivered a good third quarter.
Looking forward, as Patrick mentioned, there are some near-term economic pressures to overcome as we close out the year.
Leveraging the Barnes Enterprise System, our team is focused on executing comprehensive mitigation plan.
In the meantime, our cash generation remains solid and our balance sheet supports ongoing growth investments expected to further improve financial performance and long-term shareholder value.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Also joining us on the call are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard; and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel.
I'll begin on Slide 3.
In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.28.
We released $350 million in loan loss reserves this quarter supported by our outlook on the economy and continued improvement in credit quality metrics, the pace of which has been better than expected.
Net revenue totaled $5.8 billion in the second quarter.
As expected, net interest income grew in the second quarter, while our fee businesses benefited from improving consumer and business spending trends.
Notably, as of late June, total sales volumes for each of our three payments businesses, credit and debit card, merchant acquiring and corporate payment systems, were above 2019 levels for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.
Our expenses were relatively stable compared with the first quarter.
Our book value per share totaled $31.74 at June 30, which was 4% higher than March 31.
During the quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks.
Following the results of the Federal Reserve's stress tests in late June, we announced that management will recommend that our Board of Directors approve a 9.5% increase in our common dividend in the third quarter payable in October.
Slide 4 provides key metrics, including a return on tangible common equity of 20.9%.
Slide 5 highlights continued strong trends in digital activity.
Average loans were stable compared with the first quarter, in line with our expectations.
Strong demand for our instalment loans drove other retail loan growth, while C&I loans increased 0.9%, supported by strong growth in asset-backed lending, partly offset by continued pay down activity and other C&I categories.
We saw a decline in residential mortgage loans and increased pay downs.
Average credit card loan balances were stable compared with the first quarter as the payment rates remained high at 38%, reflecting a significant level of consumer liquidity.
However, period end balances increased 4.5% on a linked quarter basis as we saw some pickup in activity toward the end of the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7.
Average deposits increased 0.7% compared with the first quarter and grew by 6.4% compared with a year ago, reflecting the significant level of liquidity in the financial system.
Our overall deposit mix continues to be favorable.
In the second quarter, our non-interest bearing deposits grew 5.9% linked quarter, while time deposits declined by 8.1%.
Time deposits now account for 6% of total deposits compared with 11% a year ago.
Slide 8 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be better than expectations.
Our net charge-off ratio totaled 0.25% in the second quarter compared with 0.31% in the first quarter.
The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.36% at the end of the second quarter compared with 0.41% at the end of the first quarter.
We released reserves of $350 million this quarter, reflective of better-than-expected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy.
Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30 totaled $6.6 billion or 2.23% of loans.
The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth and changing credit quality within the portfolios.
Slide 9 provides an earnings summary.
In the second quarter of 2021, we earned $1.28 per diluted share.
These results include the reserve release of $350 million.
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased 2.4% compared with the first quarter, primarily driven by higher yields and volumes in our investment securities portfolio and favorable earning asset and funding mix shifts, partly offset by lower loan yields.
Our net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.53%.
The impact of lower loan yields was more than offset by a favorable mix shift in both our investment por...
...evenue was offset by higher payments revenue, trust and investment management revenue, treasury management fees and deposit service charges.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income increased 10%, driven by higher business and consumer spending activity, reflecting broad-based reopenings of local economies.
Both year-over-year and linked quarter mortgage banking revenues were negatively impacted by slower -- slowing refinancing activity and reduced gain on sale margins.
Linked quarter mortgage revenue growth of 15.7% was primarily driven by the favorable linked quarter impact of a change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities.
Slide 12 provides information on our Payment Services business.
In the second quarter, total payments revenues increased 39.5% versus a year ago and was higher by 16.4% compared with the first quarter.
Each of our three payments businesses saw strong revenue growth on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, reflective of the strengthening economy and the increased spend activity.
Credit and debit card revenue increased 39.4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by stronger credit card sales volumes and higher prepaid card processing activities related to government stimulus programs.
Sales volume trends, which are the primary driver of payments revenues, are encouraging.
The bottom charts on Slide 12 indicate that as of the end of June, total sales volumes across each of the three payments businesses exceeded comparable 2019 levels.
Certain pandemic impacted spend categories continue to lag, in particular corporate T&E.
However, consumer travel and hospitality spend volumes are rebounding faster than we expected and the pace of improvement in recent weeks has accelerated a bit.
Turning to slide 13.
Non-interest expenses was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as expected.
Slide 14 highlights our capital position.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30 was 9.9% compared with our target CET1 ratio of 8.5%.
Given an improving economic conditions in the second quarter, we bought back $886 million of common stock as part of our previously announced $3.0 billion repurchase program.
For the third quarter of 2021, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter.
We expect total payments revenues to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter, but we'll continue to track favorably on a year-over-year basis.
While we expect sales volumes growth in each of our three payments businesses to continue to improve sequentially, prepaid card volumes are expected to decline toward pre-pandemic levels as the impact of government stimulus dissipates.
We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter.
Credit quality remains strong.
Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal.
For the full year of 2021, we expect -- we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
Our second quarter results came in as expected.
And there are many reasons we are optimistic as we head into the second half of the year.
The economy continues to recover toward pre-pandemic activity levels and the consumer and business spending activity continues to improve.
Credit quality trends have been a positive surprise.
And our payments volumes have come back a bit faster than we expected as recently as a few months ago.
We are well positioned for the cyclical recovery that we expect to play out over the next several quarters.
More importantly, we are well positioned to delivering superior growth and industry-leading returns on equity over the next several quarters, given our business mix, our comprehensive and holistic payments and banking capabilities and our expansive distribution model supported by world-class digital capabilities.
We will now open up the call to Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Actual results could vary materially from such statements.
Earnings for the quarter were $1.57 per share compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.83 in the quarter compared to $1.13 in 2020.
Net sales in the quarter were up 12% from the prior year, primarily due to increased volumes across all segments, favorable foreign currency translation and the pass through of higher material costs.
Segment income improved to $433 million in the quarter compared to $298 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales unit volumes, favorable price cost mix and the non-recurrence of charges for tinplate carryover costs that we saw in 2020.
As outlined in the release, we currently estimate second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of between $1.70 and $1.80 per share.
This estimate includes the results of the European tinplate business, which will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with the second quarter results.
We are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $6.60 to $6.80 per share.
Assuming the sale of the European tinplate business closures at the beginning of the third quarter, we expect that the earnings dilution impact over the balance of the year of about $0.50 per share will be offset by improved results in the remaining operations as compared to our original guidance.
Our expected tax rate for the year remains at 24% to 25%.
Demand was strong across all major businesses and despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic and severe winter weather in the United States the company continue to convert strong volume growth into record earnings.
This performance could not have been possible without great people and our global associates continue to perform extraordinarily in the face of the pandemic, ensuring that our customers receive high quality products and services in a safe and timely manner.
And while it feels that we're turning the corner with widespread vaccinations now available.
New streams and increased positivity rates in some jurisdictions remind us that we must remain vigilant in our adherence to recommended behaviors.
Global demand continues to be very strong for the beverage can and we are committed to deploying necessary capital to meet customer needs.
As detailed in last night's release, we expect to commercialize 6 billion units a beverage can capacity in 2021 with further investments being made to bring on at least that much more in 2022.
Before reviewing the operating segments we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sit around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time, so an increase of 70%.
And as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium, reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.
In Americas Beverage, demand remained strong across all of the markets we serve with overall segment volumes up 9% in the first quarter.
We expect that demand will continue to outweigh supply for the foreseeable future.
And as described to you in February, we have eight production lines in various stages of construction to bring more supply to these markets during 2021 and 2022.
While the CMI no longer publishes industry volumes, we can tell you that our North American volumes increased 12% in the first quarter compared to the same prior year period.
Unit volumes in European Beverage increased 6% in the first quarter as growth across Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean offset softness in Saudi Arabia.
Segment income reflects contribution from the volume growth and the two aluminum lines in Seville, Spain, which were down for conversion in last year's first quarter.
Sales unit volumes in European Food increased 6% in the first quarter as the business continues to benefit from strong consumer demand for packaged food.
Segment income which almost doubled the prior-year amount reflects the above noted volume growth.
$5 million of favorable foreign exchange and the negative impact of tinplate carryover included in the prior year first quarter.
As reported on April 8, 2021, the company entered into an agreement to sell its European tinplate businesses, which includes European Food.
And as Tom said, we expect the sale to be completed in the third quarter and beginning with the second quarter, results will be reflected in discontinued operations.
Asia-Pacific reported 8% volume growth in the first quarter as both Southeast Asia up 5% and China up more than 30%, continue to show recovery from the pandemic related shutdowns.
As described in February, activity levels are returning.
However, we expect there will be virus-related shutdowns and movement control orders from time to time across the region throughout 2021.
Excluding foreign exchange, results for Transit Packaging were in line with the prior year with industrial demand surging, activity remains extremely strong in Transit and we expect this segment will post full year segment income growth of approximately 25% in 2021 over 2020.
There will be a large outperformance in the second quarter against an easy comp with further gains through the end of the year.
Other operations also reported strong results in the first quarter led by North American Food and our beverage can making equipment businesses.
In summary, a great start to 2021.
With numerous projects completed last year and several more under way currently, we remain well positioned to continue to capture our share of global beverage can growth.
Importantly, we continue to convert growth into expanded earnings and cash flow.
As Tom discussed, our full year guidance remains unchanged, despite expected dilution from the sale of the European tinplate businesses.
Better than expected first quarter performance combined with continued strong demand across beverage and transit will allow us to earn through sale-related dilution and a rising commodity cost environment.
And just before we open the call to questions, we ask you that you limit yourselves to two questions initially so that everyone will have a chance to ask their question.
But always as -- feel free to jump back into the queue.
And with that, Dale, we're now ready to open the call to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today we will be reviewing our third quarter 2020 financial result, and providing investors with an update on our transformation and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Further information can be found in our SEC filing.
Through their persistence and hard work, we successfully balanced lower sales by making durable changes to minimize cost.
We found innovative ways to engage with our customers and we kept our transformation plans on schedule.
We also overcame unprecedented global supply chain constraints, which was also challenging and improved tremendously since the early stages of the pandemic.
In addition, our pipeline of new products continues unabated with products that deliver innovative clinical solutions that are expected to drive incremental sales growth.
Taken all together, these actions should result in long-term improvements to our business since a public company forward it depend on its result.
We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter, achieving our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA.
As guided, we delivered higher consolidated sequential net sales, driven by a double-digit increase in Europe as a result of the initial easing of public healthcare restrictions, primarily in France and Germany, with the U.K. still remaining fairly closed.
We continue to monitor our key markets and the potential impact on our business and believe we're prepared for the pandemic to sporadically recur during the winter months.
In North America, we saw a continued strength in respiratory products, offsetting diluted sales in mobility and seating products due to its longer quote order cycle, which we'll cover in more detail on later slides.
On the balance sheet, we retired a significant majority of the 2021 convertible notes, leaving just over $1 million maturing in February of next year.
Finally, our strong performance in the third quarter and our visibility into trends during the fourth quarter give us the confidence to raise our full year guidance for net sales and adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to Slide four.
In the third quarter, we delivered stronger operating income, both year-over-year and sequentially, continuing our track record of enhancing profitability.
Additionally, adjusted EBITDA improved year-over-year and grew nearly 50% sequentially, driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses.
I'm pleased with our strong performance in this challenging environment, which demonstrates that our prior transformation initiatives are successfully driving improved results in line with expectations.
Turning to Slide five.
This is a chart we found helpful to depict the impact of the pandemic on our product lines over the past few quarters.
As expected, we continue to see above normal demand for our respiratory products, specifically stationary oxygen concentrators, which are used as an essential part of COVID-19 care.
With 95% of our sales in Northern Hemisphere, we anticipate continued elevated demand as winter weather forces more people indoors with pandemic blues occurring as a result.
In our lifestyle category, we returned to more normal sales levels, having passed peak surge demand for bed and related products for pandemic care.
Product mix shifted toward at-home care away from normally higher levels of institutional sales that have been lower due to limited access to long-term care facilities and lower admissions of new residents.
In mobility and seating, we saw a general recovery in demand more immediately in Europe, which went from very strict measures to more normal healthcare access.
As a result, reported net sales in Europe improved over 38% sequentially, although still lower than third quarter 2019.
We saw a similar type of recovery in North America in the form of higher quote volumes in the third quarter, which we anticipate will lead to increase sales through the end of the year.
Globally, we continue to launch an exciting full line of new products in all categories that ...
...ility and seating products increased 0.2%.
We believe that demand for mobility and seating products are largely nonperishable, as evidenced by significant higher quotes in the third quarter, which are expected to convert into stronger sales for the remainder of the year.
Gross profit increased 170 basis points or $2.6 million, driven by higher net sales and lower material and freight costs from prior transformation initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable variances and higher warranty expense.
Operating income was $3 million, an improvement of $4.7 million, driven primarily by actions which lowered SG&A expense.
Turning to Slide 13, all other, which includes the sales of the Asia-Pacific region, decreased by 3.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower sales of mobility and seating products, partially offset by higher sale of lifestyle products.
Operating loss increased by $500,000 due to lower operating profit as a result of the dynamic control divestiture in the first quarter 2020 and improved $1.6 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower stock compensation expense.
Moving to Slide 14.
As of September 30, 2020, the company had total debt of $273 million, excluding operating and finance lease obligations.
As of September 30, 2020, the company had $87 million of cash on its balance sheet, which was sequentially lower, primarily as a result of proactively repurchasing $24.5 million of convertible notes in the third quarter.
We are pleased to have retired the significant majority of these notes, which increased our financial flexibility, reduced ongoing interest expense and leave a balance of less than $1.3 million maturing in February of 2021.
We remain confident that our balance sheet will support us through the transformation.
And as always, we continue to assess opportunities to further optimize our capital structure.
Turning to Slide 15.
As a result of the sequential improvement in business performance achieved in the third quarter and our visibility into the fourth quarter, we are updating our full year guidance for 2020.
The company anticipates consolidated net sales to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter 2020, but remain lower than the fourth quarter last year based on continuing access to healthcare facilities without new public health restrictions and from the adoption of new products.
While the markets are expected to continue to remain open, pandemic-related closures may vary in regions over the winter months.
For the full year 2020, the company now expects reported net sales of at least $840 million, up from the previous range of $810 million to $840 million, driven by the expected recovery of sales based on the recent trends we've seen in the early part of the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $28 million to $32 million, up from the previous range of $27 million to $30 million due to the benefit of prior transformation actions and our continued ability to optimize cost.
And free cash flow usage in the range of $8 million to $12 million, changed from the previous range of 7% to 10%, given the timing of the recognition of sales during the fourth quarter delaying the collection of cash into the first quarter of 2021.
So far, 2020 has been a year like no other.
It's impossible to overuse the word unprecedented as the pandemic has impacted almost every aspect of our daily lives, yet while we were still able to achieve year-over-year improvement in our operating results despite those continuing challenges.
Over the company's recent history, we faced adversity and we've always been up to the task.
Our transformation initiatives will drive our return to profitability and create a stronger, more agile organization, which will unlock further shareholder value.
We're already seeing the results of the diligent work.
We know there's plenty more progress to be made ahead of these challenges.
I believe it's even stronger, and I'm confident in our continued progress.
We'll now take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well.
So turning to the agenda on Slide three.
I'll start with some highlights of the second quarter before handing it over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance.
Let's start with an overview of the quarter, turning to Slide four.
We're very pleased with how we've managed our operations as well as our earnings at risk with the appropriate level of discipline.
We also helped our customers navigate and manage through the volatility of this quarter that came from weather issues, domestic and international supply chain challenges and other complexities in the current environment.
Turning now to our segment performance.
Results in Agribusiness were down versus a very strong quarter last year but exceeded our expectations as the team effectively managed trade flows and capacity utilization.
We set quarterly and year-to-date records in soy crush volume, capacity utilization and lower unplanned downtime.
Additionally, we reduced power consumption to an all-time low in our European rapeseed crush operations.
While we faced complexities in the quarter related to freight, transportation and other areas that affected many other companies and industries, our results clearly demonstrate that with our commercial and industrial teams working closely together, we have built resilient supply chains that allow us to be successful through a range of macro environments.
Results in Refined and Specialty Oils improved in most regions, with particular strength in North America.
In the U.S., we saw foodservice demand come back stronger and faster than and anticipated, and we're experiencing a greater impact from renewable diesel demand than we expected.
In response to the higher demand for Refined and Specialty Oils, we've been working to find greater efficiencies to increase supply.
We've also worked with our food customers to help them manage their risk as well as reformulate products where it makes sense.
The multiple drivers behind the strength in edible oils gives us confidence there are significant growth opportunities ahead of us.
I also want to highlight that this was a strong quarter for our noncore Sugar JV.
As we've noted in the past, we continue to assess our strategic options regarding this business, but we're very pleased with the improvement over the last year.
Taking into account our year-to-date results and based on what we can see now in the forward curves, we are increasing our outlook for the year and expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of at least $8.50 for the full year 2021.
Despite the global volatility, we have confidence in our ability to deliver in the back half of the year, based on the business already committed, the crush outlook and the demand for Refined and Specialty Oils.
As we look ahead, we're confident that the performance of our operating model and market trends provide support for a higher mid-cycle earnings.
So in our June 2020 business update, we outlined our earnings baseline of $5 per share.
With the changes we've made in our business as well as the fundamental shifts in the marketplace, we're taking that baseline earnings per share up to $7, and that's a $2 increase.
And consistent with last time, this reflects our existing portfolio only and does not include any future growth investments.
I'll now hand the call over to John to walk through the financial results, the 2021 outlook and additional detail on the updated earnings baseline.
I'll then close with additional thoughts on some of the trends we're seeing.
Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide five.
Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $2.37 compared to $3.47 in the second quarter of 2020.
Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.24 per share.
Adjusted ...
...ore sensitive to oil demand, by about $10 a metric ton to a range of $48 to $52 per metric ton.
We feel these ranges reflect more reasonable normalized numbers in the go-forward structural market environment.
We have also increased the normalized earnings of our oilseed origination and distribution businesses and our merchandising subsegment, reflecting the more coordinated and aligned approach within the value chains from our new operating model.
The approximate 30% increase in Refined and Specialty Oils earnings is driven by a higher capacity utilization in North American refining and increased contribution from specialty oils due to improvement initiatives that are underway.
Importantly, we assume that margins in North American refining normalize back to historical averages as we expect in time that the renewable diesel industry will add pretreatment capabilities to their facilities.
There are no changes from our prior baseline in Milling.
Corporate and Other are down primarily due to higher performance-based compensation from the increase in our baseline.
There is no change in the assumed contribution from our Sugar and Bioenergy JV.
Net interest expense is reduced by approximately $25 million compared to the $5 baseline, reflecting debt paydown from strong cash flow in 2021 and normalized working capital.
Given potential tax policy changes in the future, we are increasing our estimated effective tax rate by two percentage points.
It's important to note that our earnings baseline of $7 is not earnings powered.
Aside from upside that may come from higher-margin environment, we have a number of opportunities that we are pursuing that can drive earnings upside as summarized on Slide 16.
Strengthening our Oilseeds platform with targeted acquisitions is a top priority.
Expanding our industry-leading Refined and Specialty Oils position to serve new and existing customers with differentiated products and services is an area of opportunity.
We're also excited about the growth and demand for renewable feedstocks and plant-based proteins.
And finally, we're continuing to invest in technology that will drive increased efficiency throughout our global operations.
Turning to Slide 17.
At a $7 per share baseline, we should generate approximately $1.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations.
After allocating capital to sustaining capex and preferred and common dividends to shareholders, we should have about $800 million of discretionary cash available annually for reinvestment in the business or returns to shareholders.
This is an increase of approximately $200 million of cash per year from our $5 baseline.
With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.
Before opening the call to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts.
From where we sit, it's clear there's a structural shift underway in the consumer demand for sustainable food, feed and fuel.
The conversations we've been having with existing and new customers are significantly different than they were even just six months ago.
We're pleased with our position to help support meaningful change.
And with our global platform, we have the ability to do so at scale.
Consumers have demonstrated they will pay more to get what they care about, and it's our job to provide these alternatives to our customers.
To meet this demand, we work with customers on sourcing sustainable alternatives under -- or helping them reformulate.
We help food and feed customers source ingredients to minimize the carbon impact of moving them, and we work with fuel customers to source and transport feedstock for renewable fuels.
Importantly, we do all of this with the goal of driving value back to farmers to allow them to invest in stewardship, to support regenerative agriculture and to encourage production in optimal locations, which means getting the highest production per acre using the least amount of inputs.
We're really excited about the role we can play in this accelerating shift.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined here today by Steve Westhoven, our President and CEO; Pat Migliaccio, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of our senior management team.
This could cause results to materially differ from our expectations, as found on slide one.
We'll also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as net financial earnings, or NFE.
We believe that NFE provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance.
However, it is not intended to be a substitute for GAAP.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed more fully in Item seven of our 10-K.
Our agenda for today is found on slide two.
Steve will begin today's call with highlights from the quarter, followed by Pat, who will review our financial results.
Midway through fiscal 2021, NJR has delivered strong performance for our shareowners.
On slide three, I'll take you through the highlights.
During the second quarter, periods of widespread cold across the U.S. led to an unusually high demand for natural gas.
And as in the past, Energy Services strategically located in geographically diverse Storage & Transportation assets enabled that business to meet the needs of its customers during a time of unprecedented volatility.
The outsized performance of Energy Services illustrates the limited risk, high upside value proposition of our long option strategy.
The combination of this strategy and the generation of more fee-based revenues, such as the 10-year asset management agreement we announced in December, provides for a powerful business model.
Pat will provide a more detailed look at the drivers behind Energy Services' performance later in the call.
The contribution from Energy Services enabled us to increase our NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 for the second time this year to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share from our original guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
I'll provide more color on the next slide.
At New Jersey Natural Gas, we filed a base rate case to recover almost $850 million of infrastructure investments in the settlement of our last rate case.
This includes costs associated with the Southern Reliability Link, which is over 90% complete and expected to be placed into service this fiscal year.
New Jersey Natural Gas received approval for SAVEGREEN 2020, our largest-ever energy efficiency program.
This new program authorized $259 million in spending over three years, furthering our commitment to sustainability by helping customers lower their energy usage, save money and reduce their carbon footprint.
The rollout of the program is expected to begin this year.
At Clean Energy Ventures, we completed our first commercial solar project into service, adding 2.7 megawatts of installed capacity.
We continue to develop our pipeline of projects to achieve our goal of doubling our installed capacity by the end of fiscal 2024.
Leaf River, our storage facility located in Mississippi, performed well during the February weather event, meeting all of our customer commitments under very challenging circumstances.
And finally, we continued construction of Adelphia Gateway South zone.
Adelphia Gateway has received all necessary Pennsylvania DEP permits and is working to obtain FERC notice to proceed for construction of laterals.
We expect to place a number of the project facilities into service by the end of the year.
Turning to slide four.
We are increasing our fiscal 2021 NFE guidance to $2.05 to $2.15 per share, an increase of $0.20 per share compared to our March 15 update.
Our initial guidance's increase incorporated estimated bad debt to account for any Energy Services customers negatively impacted by the February weather event.
Today's upwards guidance revision reflects payment by all of Energy Services customers apart from one due to bankruptcy.
Our fiscal 2022 and long-term NFE guidance remains unchanged.
As a reminder, guidance for fiscal 2022 is $2.20 to $2.30 per share.
And we are maintaining our long-term an...
... expense.
CEV's NFE was basically flat compared to last year.
Storage & Transportation saw an increase in NFE during the quarter, most related to increased operating income from Leaf River relating to hub services revenue.
Energy Services improved $94 million primarily due to higher financial margin compared to last year, the details of which I'll take you through on the next slide.
Slide 11 provides the additional detail around Energy Services performance during the quarter.
And that illustrates how temperatures were partly abnormal during the February weather event in the Mid-Continent and Gulf markets and also the storage assets that Energy Services holds in these regions.
Through this period of colder weather, there was high demand for natural gas, which Energy Services was able to satisfy by using storage assets to supply natural gas to a variety of customers, and usually high demand resulted in a strong process -- operation, which in turn drove Energy Services profitability.
Turning to slide 12, we'll take you through some of the changes in our capital plan for fiscal 2021 and 2022.
As Steve mentioned earlier, we're starting to see some of the in-service dates for certain CEV projects shift to fiscal 2022 due to permitting and interconnection delays related to pandemic.
We've adjusted our capital plan accordingly.
For fiscal 2021, we now expect to spend between $96 million and $180 million at CEV compared to our prior forecast of approximately $165 million.
However, the capital is simply shifting to fiscal 2022.
We still expect to reach our goal of adding 160 to 180 megawatts of capacity over the two-year period.
It's also important to note that the NFE for fiscal 2021 were largely unaffected by the shift in capital.
Revenues will be minimally impacted given the majority of our projects have expected in-service dates toward the end of the fiscal year.
And with the change in financing accounting methods, the impact related to ITTs will be a fraction of what would have been previously.
On slide 13, you can see our product pipeline for fiscal 2021 and 2022 was about $255 million, which represents 80% of our targeted capex for the next two years.
Approximately 1/3 of our project pipeline is currently out-of-state projects.
And for the projects in New Jersey, we expect to earn an average TREC factor of 0.9 per kilowatt hour.
Turning to slide 14, you can see the update to our cash flows and financing projections.
Our cash flow from operations remained strong, with no equity needs for the foreseeable future aside from our normal DRIP program.
Demonstrating the strength of our cash flows, Fitch recently affirmed NJNG's investment-grade credit rating with a stable outlook.
On slide 15, we've highlighted the details of our SREC hedging program.
As you can see, we are well hedged in the next three energy years.
We have 93% of our 2024 volume hedge.
And for the first time, we've been able to hedge SRECs four and five years out.
The market fundamentals for energy years 2025 to 2026 are supporting strong pricing, with SREC trading at or above 85% of SACP, with 36% and 10% hedged for 2025 and 2026, respectively.
I'll now hand the call back to Steve for some closing remarks.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter.
Through the first half of the year, NJR delivered strong results.
The overperformance from Energy Services allowed us to increase our guidance for the fiscal year and provides the flexibility to reinvest in our business.
We file the rate case to recover our infrastructure investments, including the costs associated with SRL, received approval for SAVEGREEN 2020, our largest-ever energy efficiency program.
CEV has a strong pipeline of projects that will allow us to reach our goal of adding 160 to 180 megawatts of capacity by the end of fiscal 2022.
And we received all necessary Pennsylvania DEP permits and filed with FERC for a notice to proceed for construction of laterals for Adelphia Gateway.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
Please note that this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay.
For information on how to access the replay, please visit our website at mdcholdings.com.
These, and other factors, that could impact the company's actual performance are set forth in the company's 2020 Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today.
It should also be noted that SEC Regulation G requires that certain information accompany the use of non-GAAP financial measures.
MDC delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2020, highlighted by fully diluted earnings per share of $2.19, representing a 54% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019.
Home sales revenues increased 10% year-over-year, and home sales gross margin expanded 350 basis points to 22%.
We continue to experience robust demand across our homebuilding operations as the dollar value of our net new orders increased 92% for the quarter on a sales pace of 4.7 homes per community per month.
The strong order activity resulted in backlog value of $3.26 billion, our largest year-end backlog ever.
The size and quality of our backlog gives us great visibility into 2021 and allows us to enter the new year in a position of strength.
Adding to our communities' position of strength is our current financial condition.
In December, we successfully increased the size of our unsecured revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Shortly thereafter, we issued $350 million of senior notes due in 2031 with a coupon of 2.5%, the lowest rate ever achieved by a non-investment grade company for 10-year issuance.
These two transactions greatly increased our liquidity position and improved our cost of capital putting us in a great position to grow our presence in our existing markets, and potentially expand into new ones.
With respect to new markets, I'm pleased to announce that MDC has made the strategic decision to establish a presence in Boise, Idaho.
Boise exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in a new market, such as a diverse and growing local economy, rising income levels and a strong population of buyers.
We recently signed our first lot deal in the market and expect to deliver our first home by the end of 2021.
Boise presents a great opportunity for our company and we are actively seeking similar expansion opportunities in other parts of the country.
Our goal has been to design innovative homes that allow for personalization with an eye toward better affordability and the response has been tremendous.
Several of our operation in places like California, Florida and the Pacific Northwest have reached volume levels that allow for better economics of scale, which has translated into better margin contributions for those areas, while our established positions in places like the Mountain West continues to generate strong margins and returns for our company.
In terms of broader macroeconomic factors that affect our industry, we continue to see an extremely positive landscape as we enter the new year.
We believe demand will remain in place after the threat from the virus subsides due to the sheer size of buying population and the structural shift that occurred as a result of the pandemic, which place a greater emphasis on now and where to live.
In summary, the fourth quarter of 2020 capped a remarkable year for our company, culminating in a 54% increase in our annual net income as compared to 2019.
We responded to the challenges brought about by the pandemic with heightened safety protocols, modified sales techniques and innovative operational procedures, all of which contributed to the strong rebound we experienced in the back half of the year.
These changes to our business practice required the coordinated efforts of all of our team members and I could not be more proud of how they performed.
2020 provided to be a challenging year for our country and economy, but I'm optimistic about the direction ...
...n last year.
Sales through January also remained strong and are significantly above the prior year.
However, we do not expect to see the typical seasonal jump in sales when comparing the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the unseasonably high orders that occurred in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to backlog on Slide 10.
As a result of the strong sales we just discussed, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.26 billion, which was up 87% year-over-year and, as Larry mentioned, was our highest year-end backlog dollar value ever.
The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 7% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives and a shift in mix to California.
These factors were slightly offset by a shift in mix to our lower-priced communities consistent with our ongoing strategic focus on our more affordable home plan.
As Bob just previously noted, backlog conversion for the first quarter of 2021 will be lower than the first quarter of 2020.
This is largely the result of the construction status of our homes in backlog as of year-end.
Only 38% of homes in backlog at December 31, 2020 had reached the frame stage of construction compared to 52% of homes in backlog at December 31, 2019.
We ended 2020 with 194 active subdivisions, up 5% from 185 at the end of 2019.
For 2021, we are currently targeting an active subdivision increase of at least 10% year-over-year.
Naturally, our actual active subdivision count to end 2021 may differ from this target for a variety of reasons, such as the timing of community close-outs and delays opening new communities due to the impact of the pandemic.
We acquired 4,976 lots during the quarter, a 51% increase from the prior year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on continued growth for our company.
We spent $359 million on land acquisition and $124 million on land development during the period, making our total land spend $483 million.
As a result of our recent land acquisitions, our total lot supply to end the year was 8% higher than at the end of 2020, nearly reaching the 30,000 lot mark.
We believe that this lot supply, combined with continued lot approval and acquisition activity, provides us with a solid platform to meet our growth targets for 2021.
In summary, while 2020 presented many challenges, the resilience of the housing market afforded us the opportunity to deliver one of our strongest years ever.
Our build-to-order model and focus on affordability continue to prove successful during these unprecedented times.
Looking forward to 2021, we believe it has the potential to be an even stronger year based on the dollar value and gross margin of our current backlog and the ongoing strength of demand.
To that end, our current target for home deliveries in 2021 is between 10,000 and 11,000 units.
From a strategic perspective, we remain focused on continuing to expand our operating margin, as well as growing our homebuilding operations in 2021.
As previously mentioned, we are targeting a 10% increase in active subdivisions during the year, and we are expanding our geographic footprint with the addition of the Boise market.
In anticipation of this growth, we increased our liquidity to roughly $1.7 billion at the end of the year and further enhanced that liquidity with our $350 million senior note issuance in January.
Even with a solid balance sheet and a strong demand environment, risk continue to exist that could impact the execution of our strategic initiatives for 2021.
These risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our company and the safety of our employees, subcontractors and customers will remain a top priority.
Last week, we were pleased to announce that our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share cash dividend and a special 8% stock dividend.
This demonstrates our continued commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their ongoing support.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today.
Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update, John will cover an operating overview and Devina will cover the details of the financials.
John will discuss our results in areas of yield and volume, which unless stated otherwise, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume.
During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization.
Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2020.
Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA and margin, operating expenses and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations.
These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.

Time-sensitive information provided during today's call, which is occurring on October 26, 2021, may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay.
Our third-quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations.
Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we faced some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints.
Virtually no segment of the economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically acute inflationary and supply chain challenges.
This burst of inflation accelerated through the third quarter, and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation and about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories.
Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%.
So that's the tough news.
The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBIT raise, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges.
And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes.
John, Devina and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short term and the medium term.
Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation.
Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter.
Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with a yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%.
But keep in mind, the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look-back over the prior year, so there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when costs step up as quickly as they have.
And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs until their next price increase cycle.
A customer who has increased 4% in May won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May.
That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open market businesses, evidenced by our lowest level of rollbacks in more than a decade.
We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges.
John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately.
Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs.
We said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as b...
...ion.
Combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year.
And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings.
As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top-line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter.
As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year.
Total company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5%, with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%.
This guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values.
We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint and almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.
Third-quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40-basis-point improvement over 2020.
Included in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term.
We remain focused on managing our controllable spending, making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business.
Third-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%.
Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs.
While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter, due in large part to the timing of cash from CNG credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020, overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we are putting in place to enhance our systems and processes.
In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first nine months of the year to $1.13 billion.
Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project work taking longer than planned.
As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong.
Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our MRFs are expected to be about $200 million for the year.
While we continue to target full-year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels, with some of our spending pushed into 2022, primarily due to supply chain constraints.
We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the third quarter.
And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, seeing us well on our way to our full-year targeted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71 times as the strength of our business performance and the successful integration of the acquired ADS business drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan.
As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice and capturing growing volumes.
We know our strategy sets us up for a solid finish to 2021.
With that, Erica, we'd be happy to address the team's questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Dave Martin of Harsco.
For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties to the Risk Factors section in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.
The third quarter developed largely as we anticipated on a consolidated basis with our environmental businesses improving sequentially, while our rail business, which did not see a significant impact from COVID through Q2, was affected by weak demand and an unfavorable product mix.
Overall, EBITDA was consistent with our expectations, while cash flow was better.
Revenues in our environmental businesses, which represent more than 80% of total Harsco revenue, were up 15% versus the second quarter.
Volumes were up in all waste categories, led by hazardous medical waste.
Retail and industrial waste volumes were also up by double digits, while steel waste or LST, was up high single digits.
Revenue was also up in the contaminated materials segment with strength in the dredge business, offsetting weakness in our high-margin soils business, which has been affected by softness in large nonresidential construction projects in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.
Our key priorities have remained consistent for most of 2020: Keeping our people safe during the pandemic, preserving liquidity, capturing the value of the ESOL acquisition and executing our operational recovery plan in rail.
I'm very pleased with the execution on each of these critical initiatives during the third quarter.
The number of COVID cases across our employee population has remained steady at modest levels for several months.
And we have not experienced any significant disruption to our operations related to employee health.
The degree of employee compliance with our global COVID-related principles is quite high, and has served to counter the worrisome trends across the general populations of the more than 30 countries in which we operate.
Pete will comment on our liquidity position in a moment, but I would like to recognize Pete and his finance organization for their outstanding management of our cash flow and liquidity position over the last several months.
Cash flow continues to be strong and is well above the 2019 level despite the impact of COVID on cash earnings.
The integration and value capture of the ESOL acquisition continues at a brisk pace.
The vast majority of our value actions have been launched and the corresponding benefits for the year will be ahead of our original plan.
These actions range from logistics and disposal optimization to various SG&A and commercial initiatives.
This past week, David Stanton, the Clean Earth President and I visited a number of our sites across the U.S. was energizing to again see firsthand, the tremendous opportunities we have to grow the business and improve the efficiency of its operations.
The operational recovery program at Rail is on track to deliver against its objectives by the end of the year.
The backlog in Rail remains at record high levels, so the SCOR program is oriented toward ensuring we have the appropriate capacity, competency and governance principles in place, to deliver high-quality products to our customers on time.
In terms of next steps, we plan to establish and sustain the lean based operating model required for a best-in-class supply chain and fulfillment capability.
Looking ahead, we expect our end markets to continue to improve throughout the quarter and into 2021, with recovery in our environmental businesses leading that of our Rail business.
Our Q4 outlook reflects these positive trends in both Harsco Environmental and in Clean Earth.
We are not yet comfortable providing more specific guidance for next year given the current economic situation, and the potential impacts on our planning process.
In terms of management focus, we will continue to execute our current programs and strengthen our balance sheet.
Together with the expected improvements in our end markets, these actions should build on our foundation and enable us to take the meaningful next steps i...
...llion in the third quarter.
The change in EBITDA relative to the prior year quarter can be principally attributed to a less favorable mix across all product categories and lower aftermarket and pro train volumes due to the pandemic headwinds affecting our customers, which became more pronounced during the quarter.
These impacts were partially offset by lower SG&A spending.
While economic conditions related to the pandemic clearly hit the low point in Q2 for Clean Earth and Environmental, that wasn't the case for Rail, as the end markets continue to feel pressures from pandemic-related headwinds on freight and passenger rail demand.
As we started to see early this quarter, this has created some deferrals of our customers' capital spending versus their original plans.
And accordingly, the demand for short-cycle products across all business lines in Rail was soft.
While Rail traffic and ridership has started to improve, the outlook is still fairly volatile given the pandemic headwinds.
Furthermore, our business generally lags leading indicators such as traffic and ridership by a few quarters.
We have some important customer discussions in the coming weeks about their forthcoming capital spending plans and are cautiously optimistic that we will see some further improvements late in the year and early 2021.
Now bright spot continues to be business development in our backlog, where we continue to see opportunities to bid on larger, longer-term contracts despite softness in the short-cycle market, and we've had a number of notable sizable wins during the quarter.
These wins included a follow-on option contract with the New York City Transit Authority to supply them with additional vehicles and a new contract with the Chicago Transit Authority to supply them with snow removal vehicles.
As a result, Rail's backlog remains robust, totaling more than $450 million at the end of the quarter.
So before moving to our outlook on slide eight, let me comment on our balance sheet.
Our financial flexibility remains strong.
Our leverage, as expected stood at 4.5 times and our liquidity totaled $325 million at the end of the quarter.
Reducing our leverage is a top priority for us and our goal remains to reduce our leverage to below 2.5 times within a couple of years.
Now let me turn to the outlook on slide eight With the exception of our Rail business, our visibility and confidence has continued to improve in recent months.
And as a result, we believe we're in a position to provide some quantitative guidance for the fourth quarter.
As you all know, the current economic environment continues to be fluid, and recent COVID infection trends are not favorable.
However, with this in mind and based on the current market environment, we see fourth quarter total Harsco adjusted EBITDA ranging from $58 million to $63 million.
Business conditions are expected to improve modestly for Clean Earth and Harsco Environmental during Q4 relative to the third quarter.
For these two segments, Q4 margins are projected to be stable versus the third quarter.
Rail results in the fourth quarter are currently expected to be similar to the third quarter performance, and corporate costs are expected to be modestly above Q3 levels.
Also, we expect our free cash flow to be between $20 million and $25 million in the fourth quarter.
And this outcome would place our free cash flow for the full year north of $30 million.
Now as I mentioned earlier, this outlook does not contemplate any meaningful impact to our business from any new lockdowns or restrictions, which may be implemented by state or national governments as a result of negative COVID developments.
Nonetheless, despite the unusual conditions we've all experienced these past few months, I'm very pleased with the performance, discipline and focus on execution by each of our businesses and keeping our people safe while delivering our strong results to date.
And I expect this to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2021.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me in the call today are Dushyant Sharma, our founder and CEO; and Matt Parson, our CFO.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, specifically contribution profit, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins our non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in measuring Paymentus performance and liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or an isolation, from GAAP results.
All great things are happening at Paymentus.
A strong financial performance with strong implementations and strong sales.
Our contribution profit grew 37% year over year to $40.7 million in the quarter.
This is a significant acceleration from Q3 of 2020 and from our last quarter.
And we believe this is just the beginning of the network effect that we have been talking about.
We have signed over 140 billers so far through Q3 and had an exceptionally strong quarter for sales, driven by a large enterprise business deal.
This deal alone could add in excess of 400 basis points to our current revenue run rate when fully implemented.
The strong sales performance is a good example of the halo effect from the IPN ecosystem we have built.
We processed 70.6 million transactions in the quarter, an increase of 45% year over year, giving us an annualized run rate of over 280 million transactions.
This amount remains less than 2% of the overall domestic bill payment market of over 15 billion transactions.
In five of the six verticals that we currently focus on, utilities, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, government, and healthcare, we have less than 2% of the billers as clients, with utilities being the only one over 2%.
Overall, we believe the sales opportunity is significant and the runway is long.
In addition to the runway being long with respect to the ongoing addition of new clients, one of the key strengths of our business is the length of relationships that we enjoy with our existing clients and partners.
They trust us with long-term contracts, generally three to five years, though sometimes longer.
This gives us a significant ability to build and creatively execute on our strategy to grow our business into a big and pervasive platform and to expand our TAM, which also gives us a great deal of confidence regarding our growth prospects for 2022, 2023, and beyond, assuming, of course, that we continue to execute on our service and the payment volumes continue based on the historical patterns in the large market, we recently expanded our relationship with J.P. Morgan Chase.
We'll work closely with the bank on sales of digital payment to J.P. Morgan Chase corporate and commercial clients.
There will also be a revenue stream from some existing build pay clients at J.P. Morgan, which we will recognize as those clients go live on our platform.
This is a very exciting relationship for us, and we have already seen the benefits in our sales and pipeline growth as billers have recognized the power of our combined resources.
Additionally, in the mid-market, we have renewed our relationship with Harris Computer, a key partner for us.
Harris is a leading provider of CIS systems to government and utilities, and we are optimistic about continuing to grow together.
With the help of our partners, our network ecosystem, and our extraordinary sales team, we just had a very strong sales quarter, which continues our momentum from earlier in the year.
We completed some sizable implementations in the third quarter, and fourth quarter looks as strong as well, providing strong growth going into 2022.
For example, we brought one of the largest water utilities in the US live in Q3, serving well over 1 million customers, both residential and commercial.
They chose Paymentus to replace a legacy provider because of our platform's functionality, real-time integration with their ERP system, and our IPN ecosystem.
As anticipated, we closed...
... marketing.
We also experienced significant increases in G&A expense due to legal expenses and intangibles amortization related to the acquisitions, multifold increases in the cost of corporate insurance and continuing investment in public company infrastructure.
And then, lastly, travel and marketing events did start to pick back up in Q3.
Specifically, R&D expense increased $2.6 million or 41.7% from the third quarter in 2020 as we continue innovating with and for our customers and partners.
This is a key point of differentiation for Paymentus, and we will continue to invest in it going forward.
Also, a portion of the intangible amortization went into R&D.
Sales and marketing increased $3.3 million or 41.4% as we continue to add headcount to accelerate the acquisition of new customers and partners, given the significant market opportunity and strong market position that we have and also a portion of the intangible amortization winning this sales and marketing as well.
Our GAAP net income was $0.4 million, and GAAP earnings per share for Q3 was 0.
Non-GAAP net income was $1.4 million.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.01 for the quarter.
As expected, we closed the acquisitions of Payveris and Finovera and completed the preliminary purchase accounting for those acquisitions.
As a result of the valuation performed, we recorded $53 million of identifiable intangible assets.
Those intangible assets had useful lives of two to eight years.
And so, the related amortization decreased our GAAP net income by $933,000 and our GAAP earnings per share by $0.01 in Q3, and it will have a meaningful impact on our GAAP net income and earnings per share going forward.
However, because it's amortization, it will not impact our adjusted EBITDA.
As of September 30, 2021, we had $177.5 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.
The cash decreased primarily due to the acquisitions and our share count on that date was 119.96 million shares.
Now from our Q3 results, let's turn to our 2021 full year outlook.
We are quite pleased to be able to raise our full year outlook for revenue and contribution profit, as well as reaffirm our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the previously provided range.
Our revenue outlook for 2021 is in the range of $391 million to $393 million, which represents growth between 29.5% and 30.5% year over year.
For contribution profit, our full year outlook is between $156 million and $158 million or approximately 30% to 31%.
It's worth highlighting that our guidance now for revenue and contribution profit growth is at 30% for the full year.
For full year 2021, we also see adjusted EBITDA in the range of $26.5 million to $28 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 17% to 18%.
We expect that our full year effective tax rate will be approximately 55%, and this is due to the discrete onetime tax items that were discussed in Q2.
On a normalized basis going forward, we would anticipate that our effective tax rate would be approximately 30%, assuming no changes to current US federal tax laws or rates.
We are performing really well and feel very good about where we are in the final few weeks of 2021 and for 2022 and beyond.
Despite processing nearly $50 billion of processing volume in the past 12 months, I still think of it as a start-up company that truly understands the overall fintech landscape and the opportunities therein.
I believe we already have all of the pieces needed to be successful and continue to deliver growth results now and in the future.
We are very excited about where we are headed because of five fundamental factors.
1, a team of industry leaders.
2, a strong, loyal and growing customer base and therefore, a line of sight to revenues in outer years.
3, a great ecosystem, leading to more biller sales and consumer adoption.
4, multiple vectors of monetization.
5, a multitrillion-dollar addressable market in the US alone.
We'll now open the line to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 blackhillscorp.com, under the Investor Relations heading.
Leading our quarterly earnings discussion today are Linn Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Kinzley, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Although we believe that our expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially.
I'll begin on Slide 4, which lists our key achievements during the first quarter.
Our top priority of Black Hills Corporation is safety, which works hand-in-hand with reliability in our predominantly cold weather service territories.
I'm proud of our team's exceptional and resilient performance.
The Black Hills team along with our electric and natural gas systems and our generating fleet performed very well through the historic decrees of the Winter Storm Uri.
We successfully served extraordinary demand, keeping our customers safe through life threatening cold conditions across our service territory.
Our balanced mix of power generation resources, including reliable and dispatchable generation capacity allowed us to completely avoid rolling blackouts experienced in other areas of the country, even while our South Dakota electric utility served a new winter peak load.
Of course, our success in serving our customers during Winter Storm Uri didn't happen by chance, rather it was a result of our relentless focus on our customers and ongoing investments for our safe, reliable and resilient infrastructure.
Winter Storm Uri demonstrated how critical energy is to our daily lives.
The storm highlighted the need for safe, reliable natural gas utilities and reliable generation capacity when our customers experienced temperatures as low as 27 degrees below zero, setting numerous all-time record lows across our communities.
As an example, Lincoln, Nebraska reported 11 straight days of temperatures below zero in February with lows of the minus 20s.
Recognizing essential value of natural gas during these weather events, we're pleased that four of our six gas states: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and Wyoming, recently passed legislation that protects our customers freedom to choose a type of energy is right for them.
Last week we announced, we joined the ONE Future Coalition of gas utility companies who are voluntarily reducing emissions.
This is an addition to our previously announced participation in the EPA's Methane Challenge as we enhance our commitment to modernize and make our pipelines more resilient.
Continuing on Slide 4.
We remain encouraged by the ongoing steady growth in new customer connections driven by population migration into our service territories.
Our team also showcased our agility and the strength of our financing strategy during the first quarter.
Given the unprecedented and unforeseeable market pricing for natural gas in February, we immediately supplemented our liquidity with additional short-term financing by securing an $800 million term loan on favorable terms.
This term loan and other ongoing cash conservation initiatives ensures our ability to continue funding our strong capital investment program.
Slide 5 sets out our financial outlook.
However, absent these storm cost, our financial results were otherwise strong.
During the February storm, we immediately implemented expense and cash management initiatives and we're executing on other opportunities to mitigate the impact of the storm.
Rich will cover the details in his financial update.
Given these ongoing initiatives and the opportunities we see for the remainder of this year, our 2021 earnings guidance remains unchanged.
We also reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance and we remain confident in our long-term growth targets, including 5% to 7% earnings growth for 2023 through 2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth.
Slide 6 illustrates our disciplined growth plan with upside potential.
We plan on capital investments in more than $3 billion through 2025 and we expect to identify and develop incremental projects.
W...
...chanisms, primarily in Montana, where we serve two industrial customers pursuant to contracts.
This small piece of our utilities is typically very low risk but was subjected to the same unprecedented market pricing and elevated demand.
In February, we immediately implemented strategies to mitigate the $0.15 earnings per share impact from Uri over the remainder of the year through cost management, ongoing wholesale power marketing opportunities and identified regulatory proceedings.
Slide 13 illustrates the drivers of change in net income year-over-year for the first quarter.
All amounts listed are after-tax.
The main drivers compared to last year were gross margin improvements at our gas utilities offset by Storm Uri impacts.
Natural gas margin increases were driven by weather favorability and new base rates and rider recovery on investments for customers.
Electric utility margins were lower than the prior year, primarily due to tax reform benefits that we passed on to our Colorado Electric customers.
We credited over $9 million of tax reform benefits, which lowered revenue and had an offsetting income tax benefit, resulting in minimal overall impact to first quarter results.
The additional quarter-over-quarter tax benefits in the far right were related primarily to additional production tax credits related to the Corriedale Wind Project that went into service in late 2020.
O&M was impacted by higher employee costs and outside services.
Outside services increased over the prior year because of higher Director fees tied to our stock price performance, which was much stronger in Q1 this year compared to last year.
The change in other income expense over the prior year was driven by market impacts on a non-qualified deferred compensation expense.
Additional first quarter detail on segment earnings can be found in the Appendix.
Slide 14 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure, credit ratings and financial flexibility.
We have a manageable debt maturity profile and are committed to maintaining our solid investment grade credit ratings.
At the end of April, we had approximately $530 million of available liquidity on our revolving credit facility.
In February, we entered into an $800 million, nine-month term loan to bolster our liquidity in light of the increased fuel costs related to Storm Uri.
We repaid $200 million of that term loan at quarter-end and are developing the appropriate refinancing strategy for the remaining $600 million as we finalized Storm Uri recovery mechanisms.
I expect we will issue debt with a three to five year term in the second or third quarter to match the recovery period of the bulk of the dollars from the deferred Storm Uri fuel cost.
New debt and deferred recovery of fuel cost temporarily increased our debt to total capitalization ratio to 62% at the end of March.
As we recover storm costs, repay debt and execute on our equity program, we expect to reduce the debt to total capitalization ratio and continue to target a debt to total cap ratio in the mid 50s.
Our equity issuance expectations are unchanged.
We expect to issue $100 million to $120 million in 2021 and $60 million to $80 million in 2022 through our at-the-market equity offering program.
We will continue to evaluate financing needs as we finalize our storm cost recovery proposals.
Moving to our dividend on Slide 15.
In 2020, we proudly marked 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, one of the longest track records in our industry.
Since 2016 we have increased our dividend at an average annual rate of 6.6%.
Looking forward, we anticipate increasing our dividend by more than 5% annually through 2025 while maintaining our 50% to 60% payout target.
We are uniquely positioned as an integrated utility in constructive jurisdictions with a complementary business mix across stable and growing territories.
We continue to be well positioned both operationally and financially to be ready to serve all our stakeholders.

[/INST] # Black Hills Corporation's first quarter earnings surpassed expectations despite the financial impact of Winter Storm Uri. The company's resilient infrastructure and power generation mix allowed it to avoid rolling blackouts during the storm, ensuring safe and reliable service to customers. Gross margins at gas utilities improved due to weather favorability and higher rates, while electric utility margins decreased slightly due to tax reform benefits passed on to customers. Total earnings were impacted by storm costs, which the company is mitigating through expense management and regulatory proceedings. Black Hills remains confident in its long-term growth targets, including 5-7% earnings growth from 2023-2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth. The company plans to invest $3 billion in capital projects through 2025 and has secured $800 million in financing to bolster liquidity. Black Hills' strong financial position, high credit ratings, and ongoing equity issuance program provide flexibility to execute its strategic plans and continue its 50-year track record of dividend increases.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session.
We had another strong quarter, and I'm excited to talk to you about our progress on many different fronts.
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share.
Our operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which is above the top end of our guidance range.
Our customer-focused strategies, positive mix of weather-adjusted load, great operational performance and financial discipline continue to drive solid results.
Furthermore, I'm proud of our progress to resolve important legacy issues and strengthen all aspects of our company.
In Ohio, we continue to take a collaborative approach, and we're engaged in settlement discussions with a broad range of parties to resolve several of our pending cases before the PUCO.
Our meetings continue to be productive, and we're making good progress.
We are also making progress on the Ohio corporate separation, DMR and DCR audits.
The corporate separation audit report was filed on September 13 and showed no findings of major noncompliance.
The expanded DCR audit report is due by November 19.
And we continue to work through the DMR audit, which is now due on December 16.
Since our last earnings call, we've taken additional steps to strengthen our compliance program and instill a culture focused on ethics, integrity and accountability across our organization.
These include: a new Compliance & Ethics Program Charter and policies in multiple areas; instructor-led business Code of Conduct awareness training for senior leadership and individuals with significant roles in our control environment; training on the concepts of our new internal Code of Conduct for everyone in leadership, with training for all employees planned in the first quarter of 2022; and publishing our new corporate engagement report.
Additionally, we have started to develop a new integrated risk management platform to enhance our ethics and compliance, audit and risk functions.
The new tool will help us streamline case management of ethics and compliance concerns, manage the life cycle of corporate policies, assess and respond to risks, and report on our compliance with internal controls and regulatory requirements across the organization.
As we've discussed, over the last 12 months, our Board and management team acted quickly and decisively, adding additional independent board members, making changes in our management structure, establishing effective controls, reinforcing our culture change and building a best-in-class ethics and compliance program.
Our relentless focus in these areas resulted in remediation of the material weakness in internal controls associated with our tone at the top.
While this is an important step, we continue driving these cultural changes and keeping compliance and integrity at the center of everything we do.
We are working every day to continue rebuilding stakeholder trust and confidence in FirstEnergy and to ensure that our employees can be proud of our company and our mission.
Yesterday, we announced another key hire to enhance our leadership team.
Camilo Serna will join FirstEnergy on November eight as our new Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs.
Camilo brings a great depth of experience, developing and implementing state and federal regulatory strategies.
His experience will be invaluable as we build a smarter electric grid and support the transition to a cleaner energy future.
We continue taking steps to achieve these goals.
For example, last month, JCP&L submitted a proposal to PJM and the New Jersey BPU for transmission investments that would connect clean energy generated from the state's offshore wind farms to the power grid, while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities.
We expect a decision on this proposal, which supports the clean energy investments driven by the New Jersey Energy Master Plan in the second half of 2022.
In W...
...rial load increased in most of the sectors in our service territory this quarter, led by steel, chemical and fabricated metal.
In our regulated transmission business, we continue to see benefits from higher transmission investments at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries as part of our Energizing the Future program.
However, this was offset by higher interest from the debt issuance at FET earlier this year and a prior year formula rate true-up.
And in the Corporate segment, results reflect lower O&M and benefit expenses.
For the first nine months of 2021, operating earnings were $2.10 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the first nine months of 2020.
The increase was driven by our ongoing investments in our distribution and transmission systems, higher weather-related usage and lower expenses.
These items more than offset the $0.17 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues recognized in the first nine months of 2020.
Our strong results and financial discipline have resulted in year-to-date adjusted cash from operations of $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of $600 million versus last year.
While we expect a few offsets in the fourth quarter, we now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.8 billion for the year, which includes approximately $300 million of investigation and other related costs, the largest of which is associated with the $230 million EPA settlement.
Earlier this month, we successfully restructured our revolving credit facilities from a 2-facility model to 6, fulfilling our commitment to complete this action before the end of the year.
The 2021 credit facilities provide for aggregate commitments of $4.5 billion and are available until October of 2026, with two separate 1-year extensions.
The credit facilities and their sublimits are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights.
We are also pleased that following the restructuring of these facilities, S&P issued a one notch upgrade to the 10 distribution companies and the three transmission companies.
While we're glad to return to investment-grade ratings for these companies with all three rating agencies, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet and the overall credit profile at the parent company.
We previously communicated that we were targeting FFO to debt in the 12% to 13% range.
We're raising that target to be solidly at 13%, which will provide ample cushion to the new Moody's threshold of 12%.
And we expect to set the company on a firm glide path to mid-teens.
On a number of recent calls, we've communicated that we're contemplating a minority asset sale as we consider alternatives to raise equity capital.
Currently, we are engaged in a process to sell a minority interest in our transmission holding company, FirstEnergy Transmission, which owns ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo.
The interest is very strong and preliminary indications are very supportive of our financial plan and targets.
But given where we are in the process, we can't comment any further on the details.
We continue to evaluate all options to raise equity capital in an efficient manner to support our longer-term outlook, which includes traditional rate base growth and formula rate investments, planned rate case activity, and incremental and strategic capex that supports the transition to a cleaner electric grid.
We are optimistic that we'll be in a position to share our overall financing plan and our longer-term outlook within the next couple of weeks.
In fact, you may have noticed that we've expanded the information in the appendix of our strategic and financial highlights document.
Given the current status of the proposed asset sale, we recognize that the fact book will be more relevant once we can include the outcome from that transaction.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to provide you with 2022 guidance and a detailed capital plan, along with the runway of our FFO-to-debt target, longer-term capital forecasts, and targeted rate base and earnings growth rates.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to investors.
These measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.
Please consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.
For the third quarter, Barnes Group delivered respectable financial performance as we continue to manage through the challenging environment presented by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.
We generated earnings per share toward the high end of our July outlook, and our cash generation continues to be good.
We also saw incremental sales growth in both of our operating segments over the quarter, with promising signs of recovery in our industrial business, and the moving on from what we believe was the second quarter revenue trough in our Aerospace business.
Clearly, there remains a lot of uncertainty, but we can see signs of a path to recovery with more clarity.
Given our strong management team and thoughtful actions, we expect to drive profitable performance throughout this challenging period, while maintaining a sharp focus on accelerating our key strategic initiatives to position the business for future growth.
For the third quarter, total sales decreased 28% over the prior year period with organic sales down 26%, driven by lower volumes given the pandemic's impact on our end markets.
On a positive note, total sales did improve 14% sequentially from the second quarter, primarily driven by the performance of our Industrial segment.
Adjusted operating income decreased 53% compared to a year ago, while adjusted operating margin declined 640 basis points to 11.7%.
Earnings per share were $0.30, down 66% from last year, obviously, significant declines from a year ago, but somewhat better than expectations we laid out in July.
More importantly, total sales improved sequentially through the quarter.
At the same time, cash performance was once again solid, and our leverage continues to remain manageable.
Ongoing cost management and further working capital improvements in the quarter also helped to mitigate some of the impact of lower demand.
Moving now to a discussion of our business segments and end markets.
At Industrial, we're seeing some of our end markets exhibiting positive signs of recovery, coinciding with what has been a rapid increase of manufacturing PMIs.
U.S. and Europe PMIs have risen substantially from the second quarter lows, and China has strengthened to its already favorable reading.
Exiting the third quarter, all had solid PMI readings of 53 or better.
Overall, segment book-to-bill was slightly better than one times and orders grew 24% sequentially from the second quarter.
In our Molding Solutions business, sales of medical molds and hot runners remained solid.
And for the second consecutive quarter, we saw a nice year-over-year pickup in both packaging and personal care orders, reflecting the release of previously deferred projects.
Correspondingly, we generated a sequential sales increase in both of these end markets in the quarter.
In our automotive hot runner business, while sales were relatively flat to the second quarter, order saw a sequential bump as a few postponed projects were released.
We're seeing this market slowly ramping, in part driven by the influence of new electric vehicles.
In our Force & Motion Control business, sheet metal forming market saw a modest sequential improvement in orders and sales, while general industrial orders and sales likewise trended positively.
At Engineered Components, general industrial end markets experienced the meaningful sequential bump in orders and sales, another positive signal and fully aligned with the trend in manufacturing PMIs.
Our global automotive production markets saw the most sequential improvement, which was foreshadowed by the positive auto production forecast trend we highlighted ...
... $197 million, down 15% from a year ago.
Organic sales decreased 12%, Seeger divested revenues had a negative impact of 6%, while favorable FX increased sales by 3%.
On the positive side of the ledger, total Industrial sales increased 19% sequentially from the second quarter.
Industrial's operating profit for the third quarter was $24.4 million versus $34.8 million last year.
Like last quarter, the primary driver is lower sales volume, offset in part by our cost mitigation efforts, which included the previously announced workforce-related actions and the curtailing of discretionary spending.
Operating margin was 12.4%, down 260 basis points.
I'll close my Industrial discussion with quarterly organic orders and sales relative to last year.
Molding Solutions organic orders and sales were down approximately 10%.
Force & Motion Control organic orders were down mid-teens and sales down approximately 20%.
Engineered Components organic orders were up 8% with sales down approximately 10%.
And Automation organic orders were up high-teens with sales up low-single-digits.
Clearly the business remains under considerable pressure.
Sales were $72 million, down 49% from last year.
Operating profit was $6.8 million, down approximately 80%, reflecting the lower sales volume and partially offset by cost actions.
Operating margin was 9.4% as compared to 23.2% a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, excluding $300,000 in restructuring charges, operating margin was 9.9%.
Between the volume impact on factory absorption and the unfavorable aftermarket mix, the Aerospace team did a nice job to protect profitability.
Aerospace OEM backlog ended the quarter at $534 million, down 4% from June 2020, and we expect to ship approximately 45% of this backlog over the next 12 months.
Year-to-date cash provided by operating activities was $163 million, an increase of approximately $2 million over last year-to-date, driven by ongoing working capital improvements.
We continue to have good receivable collections, and we began to see reductions in inventory levels.
Year-to-date free cash flow was $133 million versus $124 million last year.
And year-to-date capex was $30 million, down approximately $8 million from a year ago.
With respect to our balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was 2.8 times at quarter end, up from 2.4 times at the end of June.
The company is in full compliance with all covenants of our credit agreements and maintained sufficient liquidity to fund operations.
As we announced last week, the company has amended on a temporary basis the debt limits allowed under our credit agreements.
For the next four quarters, our senior debt covenant maximum, our most restrictive covenant, has increased from 3.25 times EBITDA as defined to 3.75 times.
Given the level of uncertainty in several of our end markets, we believe that is a prudent risk mitigation action.
Our third quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 50.9 million shares.
Our share repurchase activity remains suspended.
For the fourth quarter, we expect organic sales will be lower than last year by approximately 20%, though up approximately 5% sequentially from the third quarter.
Operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 11%, while adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.35.
Forecasted 2020 capex is approximately $40 million, a bit lower than our prior view.
So to close, while significant challenges remain in the current business environment, we're focused on managing those items that we can control, whether they be growth opportunities, cost actions or cash management.
All things considered, our financial performance demonstrates that focus.
As Patrick mentioned, the sentiment is that we're starting to turn the corner on a recovery.
And while much work is still to be done, our efforts on positioning the company to best leverage and improving environment continues.
Operator, we'll now open the call to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me in the call today are Dushyant Sharma, our founder and CEO, and Matt Parson, our CFO.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, specifically contribution profit, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA, our non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful on Paymentus' performance and liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or an isolation from, GAAP results.
I'm very excited, and it's my pleasure to talk to you for our first earnings call as a public company.
I'm also grateful for our clients and partners who put their faith in us every single day.
We are very proud of you.
I'm very pleased with our second-quarter results.
The progress we have made on IPN, including the signing of definitive agreements to acquire Payveris and Finovera, that puts us at the heart of the bill payment ecosystem for financial institutions of all sizes.
Before covering our second-quarter highlights and talking more about each of these exciting items, I would like to provide a summary of our business for those who aren't familiar with Paymentus.
I founded Paymentus to power the next-generation ecosystem for electronic payments by simplifying them for both consumers and dealers, and with an eye to do the same for financial institutions and consumer platforms.
We took a very deliberate approach through strategy over the years in three different horizons.
During the first horizon, we built an agent platform and targeted the middle market billers with it.
In the second horizon, we moved up market and expanded the functionality of our product.
With the recent introduction of our Instant Payments Network, we entered our third horizon, which allows us to put all the pieces in place to create a modern payment ecosystem.
The IPN leverages our biller network and extends it outside of those billers to financial institutions, retailers, and technology companies that can access Paymentus payments for their customers.
In essence, IPN creates the paradigm shift in the bill payment industry and creates a multi-sided network effect for our business.
Our objective is to be the central modern-age bill payment ecosystem for the entire payments industry, including banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.
To that effect, we have taken a major step toward the strengthening of our IPN presence in the financial institutions market.
This week, as we are pleased to announce, that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Payveris.
Payveris is a modern money movement platform for banks and credit unions.
What that means is that any customer of a bank on Payveris platform can pay any bills from the bank, including the largest billers to smallest businesses like their lawyers, accountants, send money to anyone in the U.S., using their person-to-person transfer capabilities, and move money between their own accounts, bank accounts, across multiple financial institutions using their account-to-account transfer capabilities.
Payveris serves over 265 national institutions.
What this means to Payveris -- this transaction means Payveris that it provides a unique offering for financial institutions when combined with Paymentus' unique Instant Payment Network, and therefore accelerate payment -- Payveris' customer acquisition strategy.
And what that means to Paymentus is that this allows us to accelerate our IPN strategy for banks by having nearly 300 financial institutions join our network.
In addition to that opportunity, there is another equally exciting opportunity where each of these nearly 300 FIs can be direct billers on our platform, which will add to our existing base of direct billers.
In addition to agreeing to acquire Payveris, we have also signed an agreement to acquire Finovera, a technology provider that aggregates consumers' bills, including faster statements in one place.
This is a platform that is already being utilized by...
...er.
For example, hot summers or cold winters may increase utility bills, which increases our interchange cost.
And we also have property tax payments that see large amounts twice per year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $8.3 million, which represents a 22.2% margin on contribution profit.
The 5% decline in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2020 is due to cost increases related to being a public company, as well as increased investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
The adjusted EBITDA margin for Q2 was higher than anticipated as a result of the higher contribution profit than anticipated for Q2.
And the fact that travel and concerts did not start back as soon as we thought, as well as the ongoing tightness in the U.S. labor market making hiring more challenging than expected.
Operating expenses rose $7.8 million to $24.8 million for Q2 of 2021.
R&D expense increased $1.9 million or 32.4% as we continue to invest in new features and functions in our payments platform and we build out IP with additional partners.
Over half of the operating expense increase, or $4 million, was in G&A and was driven by public company cost, as well as continuing to build out the public company infrastructure.
Sales and marketing increased $1.9 million or 24.5% as we ramped up selling activity relative to the same time last year in the middle of the COVID uncertainty.
Our GAAP net income and earnings per share for Q2 was slightly lower than we anticipated due to one-time discrete tax items that arose as a result of going public.
These two one-time tax items totaled approximately $2 million or about $1 million each.
As a result of these two discreet one-time items that hit GAAP tax expense in our Q2, our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 86%.
Excluding these two discreet one-time tax items, our net income for the quarter would have been $2.6 million.
As of June 30, 2021, we had $266.4 million of cash and cash equivalent on our balance sheet.
Now, from our Q2 results, let's turn to our 2021 full-year outlook.
Inclusive of our Payveris and Finovera acquisitions, our revenue outlook for 2021 is in the range of $378 million to $382 million, which represents growth between 25% and 27% year over year.
For contribution profit, our full-year outlook is between $152 million and $154 million, or approximately 26% to 28% growth.
For both revenue and contribution profit, we expect Q4 to see almost all the benefit due a full quarter of Payveris.
As you may recall, we typically see the highest average payment amounts of the year in Q3 as a result of the summer heat, combined with some semi-annual per-year tax payments.
In fact, in Q3 of 2020, we actually saw a slight sequential reduction in contribution profit.
While we do not anticipate a sequential reduction this year, we do anticipate similar factors that will influence our Q3 results.
For full-year 2021, we also see adjust EBITDA in the range of $25 million to $28 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% to 18.5% on contribution profit.
labor market, making hiring more challenging than in the past several quarters.
With respect to taxes, we do not anticipate any further impacts on the one-time discrete items or any other one-time discrete items this year.
However, as a result of the items mentioned for Q2, we expect that our full-year effective tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 47%.
Federal tax laws or rates.
And this is due to fact that a large majority of our revenue is in the U.S., so it represents the U.S. federal statutory rate combined with various state income taxes.
Look, overall, we are very pleased with the financial and strategic progress we have made this quarter, especially in the expansion of our IPN ecosystem deeper into the financial institutions market.
We continue to execute across our three-horizon strategy and drive organic growth.
With Payveris and Finovera, we'll continue to accelerate the breadth of our IPN offering.
We'll now open the call to questions.

With the ongoing challenges from COVID, we continue to see great efforts and contributions from everyone across the Company, and for that, I'm very appreciative.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our primary goals remain the same, provide a safe working environment and protect the health of our employees and today we continue to encourage our staff to get fully vaccinated for the benefit of everyone.
There were a few challenges in the third quarter, but overall, the Company continues to perform well.
Cash generation year-to-date has been excellent.
We have teams focused on the working capital initiatives around the Company and there is still room for improvements as we move forward.
This will be a long-term value creation tool for ESCO.
Our previous cost reduction actions, along with our enhanced focus on operational efficiency will benefit ESCO going forward as our end markets continue moving toward a more normalized level of activity and I'm confident that our disciplined approach to operating the business will result in continued success as we move into fiscal 2022.
While Chris will provide the financial details, I'll offer some top level commentary to set the tone.
While our year-to-date A&D sales continue to be lower than prior year due to COVID's impacts on commercial aerospace, our portfolio diversity allowed us to mitigate this headwind as our year-to-date consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins are only down slightly compared to prior year-to-date margins.
This performance was driven by solid contribution from our other operating units as a result of a favorable sales mix and meaningful cost reductions across the Company.
From a segment level, there are several positives to report.
Within A&D, we're seeing signs of recovery in the commercial aerospace as passenger boardings continue to increase and more airlines are adding idle aircraft back in the service.
Sales from our commercial aerospace customers were still down in the third quarter as a recovery in the sectors have been a bit slower than we anticipated.
US domestic travel has picked up but it's still slightly below 2019 levels.
Those of you who've been to an airport lately are probably surprised, but this is what the TSA statistics show.
It's important to understand that the business travel remains soft and air travel in Europe and overall international travel are still well below 2019 levels.
The good news is that we're starting to see order activity increase in the third quarter and our overall A&D segment orders increased by more than 40% compared to last year's third quarter.
Additionally, our navy and space businesses remain strong and well-funded and our outlook for near-term growth opportunities continue to materialize in both of these areas.
Our test business continues to be steady.
We have a good order input on a global basis and we're actively managing material inflation and transportation issues as they arise.
We expect test outlook to remain positive driven by the strength of the served markets, including 5G, medical and automotive.
Our USG business continues to outperform from a profitability perspective with year-to-date adjusted EBIT margins of 19.4% compared to 15.1% last year.
The renewables business and energy has performed well in 2021, while the orders from billables utility customers have been a bit soft.
We did see sales growth from delve over approximately 8% in the quarter, we have not yet seen demand return to pre-pandemic levels.
We feel great about the long-term outlook for the USG business and are very excited about the announcements today regarding closing two acquisitions.
Our agreement to acquire Altanova had been announced back in May, and we were able to get the deal closed in July 29.
This business brings exciting new product offerings to our USG business and also significantly increases our global footprint.
Additionally, we announced today the purchase of Phenix Technologie...
...10% and Test increasing 28%.
As we continue navigating through what we hope is the near end of COVID, our number 1 focus remains the same increasing and maximizing our liquidity to position us for future M&A growth and increased investment in new products and solutions.
We have a strong balance sheet today and are excited about the recent acquisitions that Vic mentioned earlier.
We still have ample capacity for further acquisitions and we obviously continue to invest in the core business to enhance our organic growth profile.
Our significant cash generation this year is a testament to this focus on liquidity.
We have delivered free cash flow conversion at 118% of net earnings for the first nine months.
As mentioned above, we have clear momentum in our working capital initiatives.
I did want to talk for a minute about the Q4 guidance.
In the release we did provide Q4 guidance.
This is the first quarter that has included guidance since COVID began.
The guidance for Q4 is a range of $0.73 to $0.78 per share.
The sales levels in Q4 are key issue as we think about the guidance and this range is predicated on a sales level in the range of $190 million to $200 million.
In the last three months, we have reduced the Q4 sales outlook for the commercial aerospace businesses and also for the utility businesses.
The commercial aerospace backlogs are beginning to build that we see those more drivers for 2022 as opposed to Q4.
For the utility space, we are seeing some growth compared to prior year, but not to the levels we had previously anticipated.
The long-term outlook for both of these markets continues to be positive and we feel good about our positioning as we look toward 2022.
We also want to be clear that this outlook excludes any impact from the acquisitions that were announced today.
We will have sales and earnings impacts from those transactions, but they are not yet quantified and are therefore not included in the guidance that is provided.
Since I touched on quite a few of my thoughts earlier in my commentary, I'll just offer a few more comments before we move into Q&A.
As Chris mentioned, we are a little softer than planned here in the back half of the year for the commercial aerospace and Doble's utility market.
This doesn't change our long-term commitment to these markets.
We feel great about our end market exposure and our diverse portfolio allows us to manage through periods like this.
Outside these markets, we see a lot of growth opportunities in A&D for the military, aerospace, navy and space end markets.
Investments in renewable energy market continue to drive very strong performance for our NRG business and test business seeing a lot of opportunities for telecom, automotive, and medical markets.
We just finished up a Board meeting in Boston last week and during those meetings, we took the time to visit the Doble and Globe operations.
We had a great set of meetings and really exciting interactions with the teams at the operating units.
At Doble, we did a full update of the USG segment.
The team has made great progress updating the product line across the business from renewable focus products at NRG to the new F8 launch Doble.
It's great to see the innovation happen inside that business as our customers start spending again and will be ready to support.
This also provided a chance to update our Board on Phenix and Altanova acquisitions.
So you could first hand see the excitement around these transactions.
After visiting the Doble headquarters, we took the Board to visit the Globe facility.
This was another great visit.
The team at Globe has done an exceptional job driving tremendous growth with the Navy Surface hull treatment product line.
The team has worked very hard to master a difficult manufacturing process.
They really roll and it's fun to see a winning team in action.
We had full couple of days in Boston and accomplishing all of this, but it was time well spent.
So with that, and I think we're ready for some Q&A.

[/INST] # ESCO continues to navigate COVID-19 challenges, with Q3 performance boosted by portfolio diversification, solid contributions from operating units, and cost reductions. The Aerospace & Defense (A&D) segment witnessed order activity increase by over 40% year-over-year in Q3, driven by military, aerospace, navy, and space end markets. The USG segment outperformed with adjusted EBIT margins improving to 19.4% from 15.1% last year. Despite softness in sales from commercial aerospace and utility businesses, ESCO remains optimistic about long-term market outlook and is actively managing material inflation and transportation issues.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 For those of you that have not, it is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.
Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP EPS, which have been adjusted for certain items which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies.
I'm very pleased with the strong start to 2021 and the positive momentum in revenue and margins we delivered in the first quarter, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business.
Consolidated revenues increased 11.1% year-over-year in our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company.
The revenue increase included same-store revenue growth of 14.8% and we reported adjusted EBITDA margin that improved to 15.4% of revenues.
This is the first quarter in over a decade that the Company has delivered double-digit same-store revenue growth.
Our teams in the field and our store support centers and Woodhaven are performing at a very high level and are energized and engaged.
As I visit Aaron's stores around the country to support our operations team, I'm seeing a strong sense of pride and optimism about our brand and our competitive position.
Our team members and customers are embracing the innovation that we are delivering and the dynamic lease-to-own market.
Over the last five years, we've significantly transformed the company for the goal of continuing to provide an exceptional customer and team member experience while also driving greater efficiencies in our operating model.
I'm proud to say that as of today we have a centralized decisioning platform that provides greater control and predictability resulting in a higher quality lease portfolio.
We have enhanced digital payment platforms that are enabling over 75% of monthly customer payments to be made outside of our stores.
We have an industry-leading, fully transactional e-commerce platform that is attracting a new and younger customer, and we have a portfolio of 51 GenNext stores that is currently outperforming our expectations with many more store openings in the pipeline.
All of these initiatives are underpinned by the investments that we have made in enhanced analytics and when combined with our more efficient operations are enabling us to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.
These transformations to our business model are contributing to our outstanding performance in the first quarter of 2021.
We are encouraged by the continuing improvement and the quality and size of our same-store lease portfolio, which ended the quarter up 6.2% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.
This improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our products, few release merchandise returns, and lower inventory write-offs.
In addition, our customer continues to benefit from the ongoing government stimulus, one of the most meaningful contributors to our strong portfolio performance was centralized decisioning, which we implemented across all Company-operated stores in the U.S., in the spring of 2020.
Today, nearly 70% of our portfolio is made up of lease agreements that were originated using this technology.
Centralized decisioning delivers consistency and predictability in the performance of our lease portfolio.
It enables store managers the flexibility to focus their time on growth-oriented activities such as sales and lease servicing.
We believe our algorithms provide better outcomes for both the customer and Aaron's with the goal of having a greater number of customers achieve ownership while at the same time reducing our cost to serve.
We continue to refine this decisioning across our various channels, and we expect this will continue to drive greater productivity from our lease portfolio.
Another contributor to our strong performance in the quarter was our e-commerce channel, which represented more than 14% of lease revenues.
Our e-commerce team has really delivered, driving traffic growth to aarons.com by 12.8% and increasing revenues by 42% in the first quarter as compared to the prior-y...
...31, 2020.
Lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements.
Operating expenses excluding restructuring expenses, spin-related transaction costs and the impairment of goodwill and other expenses, which were both recorded in the first quarter of 2020 were down $1.5 million as compared to the first quarter of last year.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in write-offs, store closures and the impact of the COVID-related reserves recorded in 2020, partially offset by higher personnel costs related to variable performance compensation, higher marketing expenses and an increase in bank and credit card related fees.
Adjusted EBITDA was $73.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared with $34.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $39.2 million or 112.9%.
As a percentage of total revenues, adjusted EBITDA was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with 8% for the same period last year, an improvement of 740 basis points.
The improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the items that drove the total revenues increase and a 310 basis point reduction in overall write-offs to 3.1% of lease revenues, including both improvement in the e-commerce and store origination channels compared to the prior year.
The improvement in write-offs was due primarily to the implementation of new decisioning technology, improved operations, the benefit of government stimulus and the impact of COVID-related lease merchandise reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and not repeated in 2021.
On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.24 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the same quarter in 2020, an increase of $0.94 or 313.3%.
Cash generated from operating activities was $20.2 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decline of $36.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher inventory purchases, partially offset by higher customer payments and other changes in working capital.
During the quarter, the company purchased 252,200 shares of Aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million.
As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $143.7 million remaining under the company's share repurchase authorization that was approved by our Board on March 3rd of this year.
The Company's Board of Directors also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share last month and we paid the dividend on April 6.
As of March 31, 2021 the company had a cash balance of $61.1 million, less than $500,000 of debt and total available liquidity of $295.5 million.
Turning to our outlook, based on our performance in the first quarter of 2021 and the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act in March, we have revised our full-year 2021 outlook.
For the full year, we expect consolidated revenues of between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion representing an increase in our revenue outlook of $75 million.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA of between $190 and $205 million, representing an increase in our adjusted EBITDA outlook of $35 million.
For the full year 2021, our outlook for the effective tax rate, depreciation and amortization and diluted weighted average share count are unchanged.
We have also increased our full-year same-store revenue outlook from a range of 0% to 2% to a range of 4% to 6%.
Similar to our original outlook, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2021 are expected to be higher in the second half of 2021.
This outlook assumes no impact from the expansion and acceleration of the child tax credit payments expected to begin in July 2021.
Additionally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment or in the state of the U.S. economy, as compared to its current condition and a continued improvement in global supply chain conditions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
As we discussed at our Investor Day, we've simplified our business model, narrowed our investment strategy to attractive markets and improved capital discipline, all with the goal of offering a competitive value proposition, including: consistent and attractive returns, strong earnings visibility and earnings per share growth and a sustainable and growing dividend.
Additionally, at the Investor Day, Allen and I highlighted the robust growth that Oncor continues to see all across its service territory.
Shifting now to the quarter.
I'm pleased with our financial results, and I think it's a testament to the affirmative steps we've taken to simplify our business model and focus our capital investments on top-tier infrastructure growth platforms.
We're reporting strong earnings and affirming both our increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range and our 2022 earnings per share guidance range.
I'm excited about the progress we've made so far this year, and I'm proud of the broad support we're seeing all across our operating businesses.
To begin, we have had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter.
At SDG&E, in July, we received CPUC approval for our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan update, building on the utility's long-standing commitment to advance fire hardening and public safety.
SoCalGas began flowing renewable natural gas at two additional biomethane projects in support of their goal to provide 20% RNG to core customers by 2030 to help the state reach its decarbonization goals.
In Texas, Oncor has provided visibility to their 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan, which has increased to approximately $14 billion over the five-year period.
Additionally, Oncor did receive PUCT approval to extend its rate case filing deadline to June 1, 2022.
At Sempra Infrastructure, we completed the exchange offer for IEnova's shares, resulting in a 96.4% ownership interest, and we plan to launch a cash tender offer for the remaining 3.6% interest.
We're also advancing the sale of the noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to KKR.
And while I may have been a bit optimistic at Investor Day, we now expect to close the transaction around the end of the third quarter, subject to the Mexican Competition Commission completing its economic and market analysis and issuing the regulatory approval.
With that, please turn to the next slide for more details around Oncor's capital plan update.
Oncor continues to operate in one of the fastest-growing states with strong macro fundamentals.
As a result, Oncor is announcing its 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan of approximately $14 billion, nearly a $2 billion increase over the 2021 to 2025 capital plan.
Furthermore, Oncor is increasing its 2021 to 2022 capital plan by approximately $425 million, consistent with what Allen outlined at the Investor Day and is largely incorporated in the new $14 billion five-year capital plan.
Oncor's robust capital plan supports the economic development seen throughout its service territory, increases in generation interconnection requests, strong premise growth and investments in grid resiliency.
A good example of this robust growth can be seen in new relocations, expansions and electric service to Oncor's system, which are on pace to exceed 2020 values by 70% and to exceed 2019 values by 170%.
Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results.
This compares to second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,239,000,000 or $7.61 per share.
On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2021 earnings were $504 million or $1.63 per share.
This compares to our second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $501 million or $1.71 per share.
On a year-to-date basis, 2021 GAAP earnings were $1,298,000,000 or $4.24 per share.
This compares to year-to-date 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,999,000,000 or $9.91 per share.
Adjusted year-to-date 2021 earnings were $1,404,000,000 or $4.58 per share.
This compares to our year-to-date 2020 adjusted earnings of $1,242,000,000 or $4.20 per share.
Please turn to the next slide.
The variance in the second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $126 million from a CPUC decision that resulted in the release of a regulatory liability at the California utilities in 2020 related to prior year's forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account; and $22 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively.
This was more than offset by: $38 million higher equity earnings from the Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase one achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends and lower net interest expense; $34 million of higher income tax benefits from forecasted flow-through items at SDG&E and SoCalGas; and $22 million income tax benefit in 2021 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes at Sempra LNG.
Please turn to the next slide.
We're pleased with our strong operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute throughout the remainder of the year.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me on the call today is Bob Schottenstein, our CEO and President; Tom Mason, EVP; Derek Klutch, President of our Mortgage Company; Ann Marie Hunker, VP, Corporate Controller; and Kevin Hake, Senior VP.
We had an outstanding record-setting quarter, highlighted by a 71% increase in new contracts, a 29% increase in homes delivered and a 94% increase in net income.
For the quarter, we sold 2,949 homes.
Year-to-date through September, we have sold 7,299 homes, 43% better than last year and more than we sold all of 2019.
Our sales were strong across the board and throughout all of our markets.
Our absorption pace improved significantly to 4.6 sales per community per month compared to 2.6 a year ago.
A number of factors contributed to our strong sales performance: low interest rates, low inventory levels, a shift in buyer preference toward single-family homes and an increasing number of millennials opting for homeownership.
All of these are fueling a robust housing market.
In addition, we continue to gain market share in most of our markets based upon the strength and quality of our communities, the quality of our online marketing execution and generating online leads and converting those online leads into sales and the continued strong market acceptance of our most affordably priced Smart Series line of homes.
Our Smart Series sales comprised nearly 36% of total companywide sales during the quarter compared to 28% a year ago.
We are now selling our Smart Series homes in all 15 of our divisions.
And on average, our Smart Series communities produce better sales pace, better gross margins, better cycle time and better returns.
We delivered 2,137 homes in the quarter.
Year-to-date through September, we have now delivered 5,467 homes, which is 25% more than last year.
Our backlog sales value at September 30 equaled $1.8 billion, an all-time record, and units in backlog increased 54% to a record 4,503 homes.
Our margins and returns during the quarter were also very strong.
Gross margins during the third quarter improved by 240 basis points to 22.9%, and our SG&A expense ratio improved by 60 basis points to 11.6%, and our pre-tax income percentage significantly improved to 11.2%.
All of this resulted in a greater than 90% improvement in both pre-tax and net income for the quarter.
Our financial services business also had a record quarter, highlighted by strong income and excellent capture rate and very solid across-the-board execution.
Now I will provide some additional comments on our markets.
As you know, we divide our 15 markets into two regions.
The Northern region consists of six of our 15 markets: Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit.
Our Southern region consists of the remaining nine markets: Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, Orlando, Tampa and Sarasota, Florida and Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
As I indicated earlier, we experienced strong sales performance in the third quarter across all of our markets.
New contracts in the Southern region increased 63% for the quarter while new contracts in the Northern region increased 85%.
Our deliveries increased by 27% over last year in the Southern region to 1,269 deliveries or 59% of company total.
The Northern region posted 868 deliveries, an increase of 33% over last year and 41% of total.
We also had substantial income contributions from most of our markets led by Orlando, Dallas, Minneapolis, Columbus, Charlotte, Tampa and Cincinnati with Indianapolis, Houston and Austin also having a very strong third quarter.
Our controlled lot position in the Southern region increased by 49% compared to a year ago and increased by 17% in the Northern region.
While we are selling through a number of our communities faster than anticipated, we are nonetheless very well positioned to handle demand.
35% of our owned and controlled lots are in the Northern region with a balance roughly 65% in the Southern region.
We have an outstanding land po...
...rest incurred for the quarter was $10 million compared to $12.9 million a year ago.
The decrease is due to lower outstanding borrowings in this year's third quarter as well as a lower weighted average borrowing rate.
During the third quarter, we generated $111 million of EBITDA compared to $67 million in last year's third quarter.
We have $22 million in capitalized interest on our balance sheet, which is about 1% of our total assets.
Our effective tax rate was 23% in the quarter compared to last year's 24% in the third quarter.
Our third quarter rate benefited from energy tax credits that were retroactive to 2019, and we estimate our annual effective rate this year to be around 23%.
And our earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased to $2.51 per share from $1.32 last year.
Now Derek will cover our mortgage company results.
Our mortgage and title operations achieved record third quarter results in pre-tax income, revenue and number of loans originated.
Revenue was up 115% to $28.9 million due to a higher volume of loans closed and sold along with significantly higher pricing margins.
For the quarter, the pre-tax income was $19.2 million, which was a 241% increase compared to 2019's third quarter.
76% of the loans closed in the quarter were conventional and 24% FHA or VA compared to 78% and 22%, respectively, for 2019's third quarter.
Our average mortgage amount increased to $314,000 in 2020 third quarter compared to $312,000 last year.
Loans originated increased to a third quarter and all-time record of 1,636 loans, 32% more than last year, and the volume of loans sold increased by 39%.
Our borrower profile remains solid with an average down payment of over 15%.
And for the quarter, the average credit score on mortgages originated by M/I Financial was 747, up slightly from 745 last year.
Our mortgage operation captured over 85% of our business in the third quarter, which was in line with last year.
We maintained two separate mortgage warehouse facilities that provide us with funding for our mortgage originations prior to the sale to investors.
At September 30, we had $136 million outstanding under these facilities.
We extended our repo line this month through October of 2021 and increased the commitment amount from $65 million to $90 million.
Both facilities are typical 364-day mortgage warehouse lines that we extend annually.
As far as the balance sheet, our total homebuilding inventory at 9/30 was $1.8 billion, an increase of $16 million over last year.
Our unsold land investment at 9/30/20 is $762 million compared to $821 million a year ago.
At September 30, we had $362 million of raw land and land under development and $400 million of finished unsold lots.
We own 4,942 unsold finished lots with an average cost of $81,000 per lot, and this average lot cost is 20% of our $404,000 backlog average sale price.
Our goal is to maintain about a one year supply of finished lots and to own a two to three year supply.
Lots owned and controlled as of 9/30/20, totaled 39,600 lots, 15,100 of which were owned and 24,500 under contract.
We own 6,900 lots in our Northern region and 8,200 lots in our Southern region.
A year ago, we owned more than 14,800 lots and controlled an additional 14,200 lots for a total of more than 29,000 lots.
And during this year's third quarter, we spent $107 million on land purchases and $89 million on land development for a total of $196 million.
Year-to-date, we have spent $267 million on land purchases and $222 million on land development for a total year-to-date land spend of $489 million, and about 48% of our purchase amount was raw land.
At the end of the quarter, we had 266 completed inventory homes, about one per community, and 1,113 total inventory homes.
And of the total inventory, 550 are in the Northern region and 563 are in the Southern region.
At September 30, '19, we had 531 completed inventory homes and 1,513 total inventory homes.
We'll now open the call for any questions or comments.

Margins and returns also improved significantly, with gross margins up by 240 basis points to 22.9%, SG&A expense ratio down by 60 basis points to 11.6%, and pre-tax income up by 11.2%. The mortgage and title operations achieved record results, with revenue up 115% to $28.9 million and pre-tax income up 241% to $19.2 million. Overall, the company's financial position is strong, with a record backlog sales value of $1.8 billion and a well-positioned land portfolio.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining in the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of Agilent CrossLab Group.
You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website.
Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months.
Also as announced, we will hold our virtual Investor Day in a few weeks on December 9th.
We look forward to having you join us on December 9th.
Today, I want to get straight to our quarterly results, because they tell a very compelling story.
The Agilent team delivered a very strong close to 2020.
We posted revenues of $1.48 billion during the quarter.
Revenues are up 8% on a reported basis and up 6% core.
Operating margins are a healthy 24.9%.
EPS of $0.98 is up 10% year-over-year.
These numbers tell the story of a strong resilient company that is built for continued growth.
Our better-than-expected results are due to the strength of our core business, along with signs of recovery in our end-markets.
Geographically, China continues to lead the way with double-digit growth.
From an end-market view, both our pharmaceutical and food businesses grew double-digits.
In addition, our chemical and energy business grew after two quarters of declines, exceeding our expectations.
We also saw a rebound in U.S. sales during the quarter.
Overall, COVID-19 tailwinds contributed just over 2 points of core growth.
Achieving these results in the face of a global pandemic is a tribute to our team and the company we've built over the last five years.
I couldn't be more pleased with the way the Agilent team has performed over the last quarter and throughout 2020.
We have again proven our ability to work together and step up to meet any challenge that comes our way.
During the quarter, all three of our business groups grew high-single digits on a reported basis.
Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $671 million in revenue, up 8% on a reported basis and up 4% core.
LSAG growth is broad based.
The cell analysis and mass spec businesses both grew at double-digit rates.
In terms of end markets, chemical and energy returned to growth, food grew double-digits and pharma high-single digits.
LSAG remains extremely well positioned and is outperforming the market.
The Agilent CrossLab Group came in with revenues at $518 million.
This is up a reported 9% and up 7% core.
ACG's growth is also broad based across end-markets and geographies.
Our focus on on-demand service is paying off as activity on our customer labs continues to increase.
The ACG team continues to build on its already deep connections with our customers, helping them operate through the pandemic and continue to drive improved efficiencies in lab operations.
For the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $294 million, up 9% reported and up 7% core.
Growth was broad based, with NASD oligo manufacturing revenues up roughly 40%.
The genomics and pathology businesses continued to improve during the quarter.
I'm also very proud of our NASD team for successfully ramping production at our new Frederick site this year.
We have built a very strong position in this attractive market with excellent long-term prospects for high growth.
Let's now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2020 results.
Despite the disruption, uncertainty and economic turmoil of dealing with the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered solid results.
We generated $5.34 billion in revenue, up 3% on a reported basis and up nearly 1% core.
To put this in perspective, it's helpful to recall the progression of our growth.
In Q1, we delivered 2% core growth, as you saw the first impact of COVID-19 in our business in China.
Both Q2 and Q3 declined low-single digits as the pandemic spread across the globe and governments instituted b...
...to benefit us in the coming year.
The quarter also capped off in full-year operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 20 basis points over fiscal 2019.
Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.98, up 10% versus last year.
Our full-year earnings per share of $3.28 increased 5%.
In addition, our operating cash flow continues to be strong.
In Q4, we had operating cash flow of $377 million, up more than $60 million over last year.
And in Q4, we continued our balanced capital approach, repurchasing 2.48 million shares for $250 million.
For the year, we repurchased just over 5.2 million shares for $469 million and ended the fiscal year in a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash and just under $2.4 billion in debt.
All in all, a very good end to the year.
Now let's move on to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year.
We and our customers have been dealing with COVID-19 for nearly a full year and are seeing our end-markets recover.
Visibility into the business cadence is improving.
And as a result, we are initiating guidance for 2021.
There is still a greater than usual level of uncertainty in the marketplace across most regions, and so while we're providing guidance, we're doing so with a wider range than we have provided historically.
It is with this perspective that we're taking a positive but prudent view of Q1 in the coming year.
For the full year, we're expecting revenue to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 7% and core growth of 4% to 6%.
This range takes into account the steady macro-environment we're seeing.
It does not contemplate any business disruptions caused by extended shut downs like we saw in the first half of this year.
In addition, we're expecting all three of our businesses to grow, led by DGG.
We expect DGG to grow high-single digits, with the continued contribution of NASD ramp and the recovery in cancer diagnostics.
We believe ACG will return to its historical high-single-digit growth, while LSAG is expected to grow low-to-mid single digits.
We expect operating margin expansion of 50 basis points to 70 basis points for the year, as we absorb the build out costs of the second line in our Frederick, Colorado NASD site.
And then helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.75%, which is based on current tax policies and 309 million of fully diluted shares outstanding, and this includes only anti-dilutive share buybacks.
All this translates to a fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $3.57 and $3.67 per share, resulting in double-digit growth at the midpoint.
Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and an increase in capital expenditures to $200 million, driven by our NASD expansion.
We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases, providing another source of value to our shareholders.
Now let's finish with our first quarter guidance.
But before we get into the specifics, some additional context.
Many places around the world are currently seeing renewed spikes in COVID-19 that could cause some additional economic uncertainty.
And while we're extremely pleased with the momentum we have built during Q4, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for Q1, because of the current situation with the pandemic.
For Q1, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, representing reported growth of 4.5% to 5.5% and core growth of 3.5% to 4.5%.
And first quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share.
To be where we are now after knowing where we stood in March is truly remarkable.
Add to this, the strong momentum we saw in Q4, I truly believe we are well positioned to accelerate our growth in fiscal 2021.
With that, Ankur, back to you for Q&A.
David, let's provide the instructions for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 During today's call, Brian will provide a corporate and strategic update and review recent highlights and Mark will discuss our results.
Many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to predict or control.
As a result of these and other factors, the Company's past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
During the course of today's call, words such as expect, anticipate, believe and intend will be used in our discussions of goals or events in the future.
We encourage you to read Safeguard's filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K which describes in detail the risks and uncertainties associated with managing our business.
With that, here is Brian.
We continued to do in 2019 what we started to pursue early in 2018.
We continue to diligently pursue our goals to prudently manage and support our portfolio of private company ownership interests, to maximize the value of our interests and to monetize and return the value of the portfolio to you in the most efficient manner possible.
Today, we want to reiterate our focus and convey to you the strong belief we have regarding the current and the anticipated exit values of our remaining portfolio of companies.
We believe 2019 was a year full of important milestones that we would like to revisit as we look forward to the opportunities in front of us.
The most significant milestone in 2019 was the return of capital dividend that we paid in December.
That dividend was made possible by the successful completion of the first stage of our return of capital strategy, accomplishing a series of successful exits, including Propeller and Transactis earlier in 2019 and the repayment of our $85 million in debt.
The six major exit transactions that we have executed since the beginning of 2018 have allowed us to not only repay our debt but also to continue to support our portfolio as and where appropriate as it has grown and matured.
In aggregate, to date, we have returned over $187 million to our balance sheet, including over $104 million in 2019 via exit transactions since we began our new strategic direction in 2018.
The disciplined approach to managing our portfolio and realizing exit proceeds has not only resulted in Safeguard being debt free and initiating our return of value transactions, but also provided us with $25 million of cash today that is sufficient to fund our scaled down operations and expected deployments.
Most importantly, Safeguard continues to hold a valuable portfolio of ownership interests, representing approximately $230 million of deployed capital in 15 tech-enabled companies and our other ownership interests.
Our companies as a whole are growing and are being positioned for exits.
Six of our companies have run rates of between $5 million and $10 million of annual revenue.
Another six have run rates of over $10 million.
And the average growth rate of the non-digital media companies is 54%.
As with all growth stage portfolios, there remain challenges and obstacles that we will need to overcome before exits occur, but we are encouraged by our group of entrepreneurial companies and the progress they are each making toward their strategic goals.
Safeguard's return of value to shareholders plan going forward continues to be straightforward.
Whenever we have cash and cash equivalents exceeding our minimum required capital, currently $25 million, we will evaluate a return of value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner in the form of either share repurchases and/or dividends.
We are also continually evaluating different opportunities to exit partner companies either through the sale of entire companies, the sale of SFE stakes, recapitalization and other methods.
To preserve cash and in a continuing effort to downsize all facets of our cost structure and to further align interest with our shareholders, our Board will be reduced from six to four directors as of our 2020 Annual Meeting, and director compensation is n...
...ontinue cost reductions where possible.
Our quarterly results also included $2.2 million of other income that was primarily the result of the removal of the estimates of our liabilities under the previous commitments to our former CEO, Mr. Musser who passed away in late 2019.
Other income for the 2019 annual period also included previously disclosed non-cash gain from the credit derivative of $5.1 million and $4.5 million of observable price changes from a variety of our ownership interests.
I should also note that our annual results included interest expense of $14 million related to the credit facility that was repaid in July of 2019.
We do not expect to incur any interest expense during 2020.
We also benefited during 2019 from the recognition of $2 million of interest income from our cash, marketable securities and convertible loans.
This income was primarily the result of short-term securities held during the first half of 2019 and earnings from a money market account.
We expect this income to decline in 2020 due to our lower overall level of investable assets and due to the low interest rate environment.
As a reminder, our priority related to our cash and marketable securities assets is focused on capital preservation and liquidity.
With respect to our ownership interests at December 31, 2019, we have a carrying value of $77.1 million, which is a reduction from 2018 primarily from exits, impairments and the application of equity method accounting.
During the fourth quarter, we limited deployments to $2.2 million to three existing companies, bringing 2019 follow-on funding to $16.7 million.
We expect that we will make additional deployments in 2020 so that we can continue to support our ownership interests, but in the aggregate, we expect those deployments to be between $5 million and $10 million.
Our share of the losses of our equity method ownership interest for the three months ended December 31, 2019, was $4.2 million as compared to $8.9 million for the comparable period in 2018.
The decrease is the result of less companies being accounted for under the equity method due to exits, impairments or changes in the basis of accounting as well as lower losses net from our equity method ownership interests.
Similarly, for the annual 2019 period, we experienced a reduction of $20.6 million related to our losses from our share of the losses of our equity method companies.
We are also pleased that a number of our companies have reduced their operating losses, which contributes to these improvements in our results.
We believe this is an illustration of the health of our overall group of ownership interests.
Aggregate annual revenue for 2019 of Safeguard's 15 remaining ownership interests, which we have previously referred to as partner companies, was $357 million.
Aggregate revenue for the same companies was $330 million for 2018, representing a growth 8% for the group.
We have continued to see slower growth in the digital media category.
Excluding those digital media companies, the aggregate year-over-year revenue of Safeguard's portfolio of partner companies grew at 41%.
Note that the revenue from other ownership interests that you may see in the summary table, including our release, are excluded from this total.
So we remain optimistic about the portfolio, as Brian indicated earlier in the call.
Also with respect to our aggregated revenue disclosures, we will no longer provide estimates of the projected revenue amounts.
We believe that by highlighting our ownership interests that are progressing through each of the revenue stages that we have defined provides investors with better indications of the relative size and growth across our ownership interests.
Also, this allows us to retain an appropriate level of confidentiality with respect to individual companies as the portfolio continues to get smaller.
Now here's Brian to lead us through the Q&A segment of the call.
Operator, let's open the phone for a few questions, please.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website.
We'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call today.
This cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We also have other company representatives available for a Q&A session after Lisa and Steve provide updates.
Slide four shows our quarterly financial results.
IDACORP's 2021 first quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.89, an increase of $0.15 per share from last year's first quarter.
Today, we also affirmed our full year 2021 IDACORP earnings guidance to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.80 per diluted share, with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize in 2021 any of the additional tax credits that are available to support earnings in Idaho under its regulatory settlement stipulation.
These are our estimates as of today, and those estimates assume normal weather conditions over the balance of the year and include customer usage returning closer to pre-COVID-19 levels as we progress through the year.
However, as you would expect, it is difficult to predict the full impact of evolving economic conditions on Idaho Power's customers and suppliers and how that could affect the upper end of the earnings guidance range or the use of tax credits.
We have had a great start to 2021.
As our customers and employees move closer to a more normal work environment, we are looking forward to reconnecting with many of you in person over the next year when possible.
Our company has begun to resume some normal work operations in a phased, carefully planned manner, and we are hopeful health trends will continue to allow our working conditions to normalize in the coming months.
For Idaho Power, as noted on Slide 5, the first quarter of this year saw a continuation of the strong customer growth.
In March alone, we saw an annualized customer growth rate of 3.5%.
This accelerated growth rate is challenging as we keep up with service connections, but our employees continue to prove that they are up for the task.
Looking ahead, we expect robust growth to continue as Idaho's quality of life and business-friendly environment remain attractive.
Other factors such as inquiries for large load projects suggests demand for our energy in our service area remains strong.
On Slide 6, you'll see highlighted a few publicly announced large load expansions and projects.
The economy within Idaho Power's overall service area continues to outperform national trends.
Unemployment within Idaho Power's service area is now down to 3.7%, remaining well below the 6% rate reported at the national level, and total employment in our service area declined a modest 0.3% since March of last year.
Moody's has strengthened its predictions for our service area, now projecting robust economic growth going forward even after our service area experienced a modest GDP decline in 2020 relative to the national average.
The Moody's forecast now calls for growth of 8% in 2021, 8.1% in 2022 and continued strong growth of 6.8% in 2023.
We expect that existing and sustained future customer growth will cause the need for Idaho Power to continue to enhance and expand its distribution and transmission system infrastructure, including the Boardman to Hemingway project.
That growth may also result in the need for Idaho Power to procure other new sources of energy and capacity to serve growing loads as well as to maintain system reliability.
We are in the process of analyzing options for the potential energy and capacity resource procurement while, at the same time, working on our 2021 integrated resource plan.
We are seeing early model results in our 2021 IRP planning process showing declining length in our system in the near term.
It's a little too early to tell us -- to tell what that will mean for the timing of early exit of Jim Bridger coal-fired plant unit, the timing of the exit for the second unit at North Val...
...ter changes, you'll see customer growth added $3.7 million to operating income.
Lower usage per commercial customer down 2%, partly due to COVID-19 impact, was largely offset by higher residential usage due to colder weather this year versus last.
The net result was a relatively modest $1.3 million decrease in overall usage per customer.
The next change on the table shows that transmission wheeling-related revenues increased $4.1 million.
This was partly due to a 20% increase in wheeling volumes as well as a 10% increase in Idaho Power's open access transmission tariff rate last October to reflect higher transmission costs.
Colder winter weather in the Southwest U.S. contributed to the increased wheeling volumes this quarter.
Next on the table, other operating and maintenance expenses decreased by $4.2 million.
This was primarily due to the timing of cloud-seeding activities and cost-saving initiatives at our jointly owned coal plant.
A portion of the savings also related to Idaho Power's exit from the Boardman plant in 2020 as both O&M costs and corresponding revenues were reduced due to the regulatory mechanism in place that's associated with its shutdown.
We continue to see decreases in employee travel and training costs related to COVID-19 while our allowance for bad debt remains above recent levels and will likely take longer to collect.
Our net deferral impact, however, remained nominal.
We will continue to monitor the impacts by state to determine whether we ultimately seek recovery for any net increased cost.
Finally, our higher pre-tax earnings led to an increase in income tax expense of $1.5 million this quarter.
The changes collectively resulted in an increase to Idaho Power's net income of $7.6 million.
IDACORP and Idaho Power continue to maintain strong balance sheets, including investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, which enables us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and distribute dividends to share owners.
IDACORP's operating cash flows along with our liquidity positions as of the end of March are included on Slide 10.
Cash flows from operations were about $50 million higher than last year's first quarter.
The increase was mostly related to working capital fluctuations, the timing of pension contributions and the timing of net collections of regulatory assets and liabilities.
The liquidity available under IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities is shown on the middle of Slide 10.
At this time, we do not anticipate raising any equity capital in 2021.
While cash flows have been minimally affected by the pandemic thus far, our combined liquidity, along with expected regulatory support from our annual adjustment mechanisms, is a substantial backstop to our expected capital and operating needs.
Slide 11 shows our affirmed full year 2021 earnings guidance and our current year financial and operating metrics estimates.
We continue to expect IDACORP's 2021 earnings to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.80 per diluted share as we assume normal weather and operating conditions for the remaining nine months of the year.
We also assume pandemic impact continue to moderate as the year progresses.
Our guidance still assumes Idaho Power will use no additional tax credits in 2021.
Of course, our guidance could be negatively impacted if the economy or the pandemic worsens significantly or for other reason.
Our expected full year O&M expense guidance remains in the range of the $345 million to $355 million, so we're off to a good start.
It's fair to say that this goal to keep O&M relatively flat for the ninth straight year is being challenged by the level of growth we are expecting.
We also affirm our capital expenditures forecast for this year, which we increased a bit in February to the range of $320 million to $330 million.
Our expectation of hydro generation has softened somewhat given the conditions Lisa presented earlier and is now expected to be in the range of 5.5 million to 7.5 million megawatt hours.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I am Patrick Suehnholz, Greenhill's Head of Investor Relations.
And joining me on the call today is Scott Bok, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
These statements are based on our current expectations regarding future events that, by their nature, are outside of the firm's control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
We reported second quarter revenue of $43.2 million and a loss per share of $0.45.
For the year-to-date, we had revenue of $112.2 million and a loss per share of $0.34.
Revenue for the year-to-date was 2% lower than our figure from last year when we had a slow first half that was followed by a strong second half.
Industry data makes clear that global M&A activity has been very strong for the year-to-date, we see that in what has been a significant increase versus last year and the year before in the number of new assignments we are winning.
We also see the result of a more active market in the number of deal announcements we are associated with, as shown on the transaction list we regularly update on our website.
This past quarter, we announced the second highest number of transactions in any quarter in our history and on a trailing four quarters basis, our number of transaction announcements is at the highest level ever by a meaningful margin.
Many of those transactions have been for major companies but for the year-to-date, the sizes of deals that have completed have skewed toward the smaller end of the scale, resulting in soft year-to-date revenue.
In the second half, we expect the size of completed deals and related fee events to significantly increase such that we should get to a full-year revenue outcome that shows improvement over what was a respectable year for our firm in 2020.
We saw the first versus second half play out similarly to the way I'm describing both last year and the year before.
On a regional basis, for the full year we expect to show a stronger year than last year in the US and Canada and a much stronger year in Australia, offset by reduced revenue in Europe where we had a particularly strong revenue year last year.
By type of advice, M&A is where we are seeing the greatest opportunity.
Restructuring activity is materially lower given the strength in credit markets, but we are making progress in our strategic initiative to be more active in financing advisory assignments of various kinds.
In the private capital advisory area, we continue to be busy with secondary transactions in Europe and Asia, including an increasing number of complex fund restructuring transactions, led by fund general partners.
In addition, over the course of the year-to-date, we've succeeded in building out a global primary fundraising team and we expect to start seeing revenue from that group already in the current quarter.
In all our businesses, we are making progress on our strategic initiative to do more business with financial sponsors.
In addition to two more recruits in the private capital advisory area.
We have other recruits in progress.
We already see this year as an important one in terms of recruiting and we should see more success in that regard in the second half.
Now turning to costs, our compensation costs were lower than last year in absolute terms, given our objective to bring quarterly compensation more in line with quarterly revenue but our compensation ratio was still higher than our target range.
Our objective is to bring the ratio down to our target range for the full year, while still paying our team increased compensation in absolute dollars.
Where we end up in terms of compensation cost and expense ratio for the year depends as always on our revenue outcome for the year.
Our non-compensation costs were materially lower than last year and are running at a rate slightly better than our target.
Our interest rate expense continues -- interest expense, rather, continues to trend lower given declining debt levels and continued low short-term interest rates.
We continue to estimate our annual tax rate will be in the mid-20% range after adjusting for the impact of charges relating to the vesting of restricted stock, which is consistent with our prior guidance.
We ended the quarter with $92.5 million of cash and $306.9 million of debt and we paid down another $15 million of that debt after quarter end.
We also declared our usual $0.05 quarterly dividend.
And lastly as of quarter end, we have bought back 1.5 million shares and share equivalents for a total cost of $23.8 million and had an additional $26.2 million of repurchase authority available for the year ahead through next January.
As I said last quarter, our principal focus is on deleveraging but we also intend to continue to purchase shares in a prudent manner to further enhance the upside potential for continuing shareholders.
Our employees currently own about half of the economics of the firm through stock and restricted stock and are thus fully aligned in trying to drive shareholder value in the quarters and years to come.
To sum up, we recognize that our first half is an outlier relative to peers in what is a strong M&A market.
At our smaller scale, the random timing of deal completions has a large impact and can result in a weak quarter or even multiple quarters.
Last year, we saw that same phenomenon, yet with the help of a record quarter at year-end got to a very respectable full year result.
This year, we have the benefit of what is a significantly higher pace of new assignments and of deal announcements.
Looking beyond this year, the same smaller scale that today results in greater quarterly volatility is what creates future upside potential for our shareholders.
First, the strategic moves we are making should reduce future quarterly volatility as well as increase annual revenue.
The effort to develop a financing advisory business and to devote more resources to serving financial sponsors should be particularly important in diversifying and growing our revenue base.
Second, the successful rebuilding and expansion of our Private Capital Advisory business should also add to revenue diversity and scale starting later this year.
And lastly, with our lower cost, declining debt and interest expense and much reduced share count, the benefits of increased revenue would be magnified in terms of net income and shareholder value creation.
With that, I will take any questions.

However, the company has been winning a significant number of new assignments and has seen a record number of transaction announcements, indicating a strong M&A market. The company expects deal sizes and fee events to increase in the second half, leading to an improvement in full-year revenue. Greenhill is also expanding its services into financing advisory and primary fundraising, aiming to diversify revenue streams.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 A copy of the release has also been included in an 8-K submitted to the SEC.
We achieved a record $706 million in sales in the second quarter, an increase of 30% compared to the same period last year.
Sales growth was primarily driven by pricing at both ADS and Infiltrator across our geographies and our end markets.
Our volume was down slightly in the second quarter, primarily due to the retail business within the ADS residential end market, which had a difficult comparison relative to last year when we experienced record shipping levels in the retail category at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Excluding retail, the ADS construction market sales volume was up slightly despite constraints within our manufacturing and transportation operations.
Infiltrator sales increased 38%, primarily due to favorable pricing as well as a slight volume increase with strong growth in the Southeast and Southern regions of the United States.
Additionally, international sales for the total company increased 29% this quarter with double-digit growth in our Canadian and Mexican businesses.
Our backlog and pace of orders remained favorable as well as our ability to capture price in the market, which gives us confidence in the updated sales targets we issued today.
The price increases we implemented in the second quarter will hit their full run rate in the fiscal third quarter, and we have obtained some additional pricing on certain products and in certain end markets to cover the continued inflationary cost pressures.
Overall, the demand environment remains favorable, and our leading indicators point to continued strength as we work through the high levels of backlog in our order book.
From my perspective, we must continue to work down the backlogs in both ADS and Infiltrator, managed through the customary weather and seasonal impacts in the second half of the fiscal year and continue to leverage the self-help programs that are creating additional production capacity.
In addition, we are focused on installing and ramping up new equipment coming online, which will add some production capability in the second half of the year and additional capacity as we enter fiscal 2023 this coming April.
Our adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% this quarter.
Favorable pricing issued over the past year covered inflationary cost pressure on materials and diesel.
However, labor shortages in both manufacturing and transportation impacted our profitability.
This was particularly evident within our transportation business, where we had to ship more deliveries to third-party logistics services, a cost premium compared to our internal fleet.
In addition, the year-over-year cost for third-party logistics services is up significantly.
Within the manufacturing organization, we were unable to consistently operate all the production lines we wanted to run due to labor shortages.
Importantly, though, the programs we discussed on our last call around SKU reduction, process simplification, inventory consolidation and sourcing products from Mexico are working, resulting in improved daily production rates as we progress through the second fiscal quarter and into October.
Availability of raw materials was more problematic in the first part of the quarter, but improved month-to-month.
Material costs remained elevated.
And then as expected, the second quarter had the largest gap between high material prices this year and historically low prices of last year.
Importantly, we were able to maintain the amount of adjusted EBITDA generated at the Infiltrator business in the second quarter.
Infiltrator products are primarily produced at a single manufacturing location and less transportation sensitive than the ADS products.
While Infiltrator face similar headwinds from labor and transportation, the impact on profitability was less pronounced.
Overall, the first half of this fiscal year has largely played out as we expected.
As discussed on our first quarter call, we're going to see the year-ove...
... ADS and Infiltrator.
Legacy ADS pipe products grew 31%, Allied Products sales grew 19% and Infiltrator sales increased 38%, with double-digit sales growth in both tanks and lease field products.
We continue to demonstrate our pricing power with significant year-to-date price increases across each of our segments.
As Scott mentioned, during the second quarter, Strength in our construction market sales partially were offset by constraints within manufacturing and transportation as well as weakness in our retail end market, which was impacted by tough comparisons year-over-year.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $165 million, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.3% in the quarter.
We knew this quarter would be our most challenging from a year-over-year comp perspective, given the low input cost and high demand environment we experienced last year.
Importantly, we have good line of sight into the cost impacting our business and have taken actions to mitigate them in the back half of this year.
These efforts have already contributed to margin improvement on a sequential basis throughout the second quarter.
The long-term fundamentals of our business remain intact, and we are on track to hit the double-digit growth in our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the fiscal year.
Moving to slide six.
We generated $31 million of free cash flow year-to-date.
In addition to the growth-oriented capital investments Scott outlined, working capital was a significant use of cash year-to-date as we purchased raw materials and built inventory at a much higher cost compared to last year in order to support the demand we are experiencing.
We continue to make progress on our working capital initiatives, most recently working to extend our payment terms with some of our largest suppliers.
As a percent of sales, working capital was 22% as compared to 20% in the same period last year.
From a capital deployment perspective, we remain committed to efficient and disciplined capital allocation to drive shareholder value.
Our first priority for capital deployment remains investing organically in the growth of the business, as we view this as the highest return and lowest risk use of our available capital.
To that end, we have spent more than two times the amount as last year at this time, primarily on these type of growth initiatives.
For the full year, we continue to expect between $130 million and $150 million in capital expenditures with the largest investments focused on future growth, followed by our productivity and automation initiatives.
In addition, we continue to work an active M&A pipeline, focus on staying close to the core, including regional pipe capacity, Allied Products that fit our solutions package and recycling capacity to support the future growth of the business.
We are committed to a strong balance sheet, financial flexibility and returning excess cash to our shareholders, as demonstrated by the $312 million returned to shareholders year-to-date through share buybacks and dividends.
We completed our share repurchase program in the second quarter, purchasing a total of 2.6 million shares year-to-date.
Finally, our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was 1.7 times, remaining below our targeted leverage of two to three times that we've previously communicated.
Finally, on slide seven, we have updated our fiscal 2022 guidance.
Based on our performance and pricing actions taken to date, order activity, backlog and current market trends, we currently expect net sales to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion, representing growth of 29% to 34% over the prior year.
Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is unchanged at a range of $635 million to $665 million, representing growth of 12% to 17% over last year.
The increase in our revenue guidance today is due primarily to the continued strength in orders in our backlog as well as the impact of favorable pricing that we've introduced to the market to date.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We continued to see headwinds in the third quarter as we dealt with elevated industrywide weather events year-to-date, particularly in coastal states.
Our catastrophe response teams have directly engaged with our insureds to ensure they receive the attention they deserve.
As previously announced, we were affected by full retention events from Hurricanes Isaias and Sally in addition to other PCS events year-to-date.
As the Statute of Limitations for Hurricane Irma approach is ending, we experienced increased prior-year companion claims, as the window closed.
This increase in claims led us to increase our reserves in years prior to 2020.
We feel good to have Hurricane Irma behind us, the ability to strengthen reserves appropriately and proud of our employees for their contributions during these unprecedented times.
Our vertically integrated suite of capabilities continues to differentiate us in our home state.
Our primary rate increases continue to flow through our book, as evident by our strong direct premiums written growth of 19.4% in the quarter.
We continue to selectively write new business, are quickly approaching $1.5 billion in premiums in force, and are optimistic about our prospects in the future.
As a reminder, discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-GAAP basis, and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments and extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
Adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense.
EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.10 on a GAAP basis and a loss of $1.43 on a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share basis.
Year-to-date, GAAP earnings per share was $1.14 and negative $0.08 on a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share basis.
Despite elevated activity year-to-date, we produced an annualized year-to-date return on average equity of 10% with a book value per share that remained relatively flat since the end of 2019 at $15.15.
As to underwriting, direct premiums written were up 19.4% for the quarter, led by strong direct premium growth of 18.8% in states outside of Florida and 19.6% in Florida.
The quarter's growth benefited from organic new business growth and primary rate increases continuing to flow through the book.
On the expense side, the combined ratio increased 36.9 points for the quarter to 134.7%.
The increase was primarily driven by previously announced increased weather events in addition to prior years reserve development and the continuation of occurring incremental reserves for current accident year loss cost.
In addition, higher reinsurance cost affected the base of the ratio.
These increases were partially offset by a benefit from our claims adjusting business and a reduction in the expense ratio.
Turning to services, total services revenue increased 14.9% to $17.1 million for the quarter, driven by commission revenue earned on CD premiums and an increase in policy fees.
On our investment portfolio, net investment income decreased 40.1% to $4.6 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower yields on cash and fixed income investments during 2020 when compared to 2019.
Realized gains for the quarter were $53.8 million and resulted from taking advantage of increased market prices on our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio.
We took the opportunity to monetize the increase in fair value of our investment portfolio as a means to enhance surplus for UPCIC.
This facilitates our growth strategy in a hardening primary rate market while strengthening reserves.
Cash and cash equivalents increased 122.5% to $405.1 million when compared to the end of 2019 as a result of the actions taken to realize investment gains leading to higher investment cash flows.
As a result of the sales and reinvestment, future portfolio investment income will reflect current market rates.
In regards to capital deployment, during the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 534,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $9.9 million.
Year-to-date, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $26.5 million.
On July 6, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, which was paid on August 7, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 31, 2020.
As mentioned in our release yesterday, we are updating our full year guidance to reflect increased top line revenue, offset by elevated third quarter loss and loss adjustment expense.
We now expect a GAAP earnings per share range of $1.80 to $2.10 and a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share range of $0.55 to $0.85, assuming no extraordinary weather events in the fourth quarter of 2020 and no realized or unrealized gains for the fourth quarter.
This would yield a return on average equity derived from GAAP measures of between 11.1% and 14.1% for the full year.
We continue to make significant progress in resolving the remaining open claims on prior-year catastrophe events.
And as Steve noted, we reached the Statute of Limitations milestone for Hurricane Irma claims.
We did see over 2,000 new Irma claims reported during the third quarter and we elected to book the un-gross ultimate at $1.55 billion.
The modest run-up in claims filed in advance of the three-year Statute of Limitation for filing new Irma claims that expired in the second week of September was expected, but we were surprised and disappointed to see quite a number of non-cat Irma companion claims filed simultaneously.
This phenomenon contributed to a portion of our third quarter prior-year adverse development.
We will continue to monitor the effects of these late reported Irma and Irma-related claims going forward.
But we are extremely pleased with the diligence of our claims adjusting staff.
As of 9-30, Hurricane Michael had a little over 100 claims open, as we start to approach the end on this storm.
We did elect to book the Michael gross ultimate at $386 million.
This change does not impact our net loss position.
Each of these events was booked at 9-30, expecting a full retention loss under its respective reinsurance program.
For Hurricane Isaias, that was $15 million pre-tax under our other states program, and for Hurricane Sally, that was $43 million pre-tax under our all states program.
Together, these two events resulted in a total net impact of approximately $58 million pre-tax, approximately $44 million after-tax.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.
First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer.
As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by record operating earnings and underwriting results, expanded margins and double-digit premium revenue growth globally, the best in over 15 years, powered by commercial P&C and supported by continued robust commercial P&C rate movement.
Chubb was built for these conditions.
We have averaged double-digit commercial P&C growth over the past 10 quarters.
The breadth of our product and reach, combined with our execution-oriented underwriting culture and our reputation for service and consistency enable us to fully capitalize on opportunity globally.
And conditions such as these size and scale are our friend.
Core operating income in the quarter was $1.62 billion or $3.62 per share, again, both records.
On both the reported and current accident year ex-cat basis, underwriting results in the quarter were simply world-class.
The published P&C combined ratio was 85.5% and current accident year was 85.4% compared to 87.4% prior year.
The two percentage points of margin improvement were almost entirely loss ratio related.
Current accident year underwriting income of $1.2 billion was up 27%.
While on the other side of the balance sheet, adjusted net investment income of $945 million, also a record, was up nearly 9.5% from prior year.
Peter will have more to say about cats and prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth and the rate environment.
P&C premiums were up 15.5% globally, with commercial premiums, excluding agriculture, up nearly 21%.
The 15.5% growth for the quarter and 12.6% for the first six months were the strongest growth we have seen since 2004.
Growth in the quarter was extremely broad-based, with contributions from virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally, from those serving large companies, to midsized and small and most regions of the world and distribution channels.
We continue to experience a needed and robust commercial P&C pricing environment in most all important regions of the world, with continued year-on-year improvement in rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal.
Based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will continue.
In North America, Commercial P&C net premiums grew over 16%.
New business was up 24%, and renewal retention remained strong at 96.5% on a premium basis.
In our North America major accounts and specialty commercial business, net premiums grew over 13%, with each division, major accounts, Westchester and Bermuda having its largest quarter in history in terms of written business.
And the standout was our middle market and small commercial division, which had the biggest quarter in about 20 years, driven by record new business growth and strong retentions.
Overall rates increased in North America commercial by a strong 13.5%, which is on top of a 14.7% rate increase last year for the same business, making the two-year cumulative increase over 30%.
And remember, in North America, rates have been rising for almost four years.
However, they have exceeded loss costs for only about two years now.
Loss costs are currently trending about 5.5% and vary up or down depending upon line of business.
General commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement by division and line in North America.
In major accounts, rates increased in the quarter by about 16% on top of almost 18% prior year for the same business, making the two-year cumulative increase over 36%.
Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up almost 9%.
General casualty rates were up 21% and varied by category of casualty.
Property rates we...
...d the quarter in an excellent financial position and continue to build upon our balance sheet strength.
We have over $75 billion in capital and a AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets that now exceeds $123 billion.
Our record underwriting and investment performance produced strong positive operating cash flow of $3.1 billion for the quarter.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $352 million in dividends.
Through the six months ended June 30, we returned $3.1 billion, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends of $704 million.
We recently announced a onetime incremental share repurchase program of up to $5 billion through June 2022.
As Evan said, adjusted pre-tax net investment income for the quarter was a record $945 million, higher than our estimated range, benefiting from increased corporate bond call activity and higher private equity distributions.
We increased the size of our investment portfolio by $2.4 billion in the quarter after buybacks due to strong operating cash flow and high portfolio returns, including $694 million in pre-tax unrealized gains from falling interest rates.
At June 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $3.3 billion after tax.
During this challenging investment return environment, we will remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy and do not expect to materially adjust the portfolio asset allocation over the near term.
We will be selective but active, and we'll continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and we will not reach for yields.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including the amount of operating cash flow available to invest, the reinvestment rate environment and the assumed prepayment speeds on our corporate bond calls and variability around private equity distributions.
Based on the current interest rate environment and a normalization of bond calls and private equity distributions, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 11.5% and 17.7%, respectively, for the quarter.
And as a reminder, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do.
The gain from the fair value mark this quarter of $712 million after tax, we have increased core operating ROE by five percentage points to 16.5% and core operating income by $1.59 per share to $5.21.
Book and tangible book value per share increased by 4.2% and 5%, respectively, from the first quarter due to record core operating income and realized and unrealized gains of $1.4 billion after tax in our investment portfolio, which again primarily came from declining rates and mark-to-market gains on private equities.
The increase in book value per share also reflects the impact of returning over $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter.
Our pre-tax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $280 million, principally from severe U.S. weather-related events.
There was no overall change to our aggregate COVID-19 loss estimate.
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $268 million.
This included a charge from molestation claims of $68 million pre-tax compared with $259 million in the prior year.
Excluding this charge, we had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $336 million pre-tax, split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 70% short-tail lines.
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion in constant dollars and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 80%.
Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.8% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Yesterday, we reported solid second quarter results, underpinned by strong top line growth as a result of the pockets of attractive pricing and volume, resulting in an annualized return on average equity in the first half of 2020 of 15.5%.
In addition, we continue to enter new states as an agent serving independent third-party carriers with our digital insurance agency Clovered.
We launched Clovered just over a year ago and continue to add partners and expand its offerings to consumers, while enhancing the overall digital experience.
Clovered continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for us with approximately 40% premium growth from the year ago quarter to its total book of business, while growing non risk bearing business by over 200% in the same time period.
The shift to online policy acquisition continues to grow, in part, due to a very desirable refinance and new home market.
Clovered represents Universal Property & Casualty's fastest growing agency across it's nearly 10,000 independent agents.
So, we're off to a solid start to the first half of the year overall, including the successful completion of our reinsurance renewal on time and on budget.
We are taking a more measured approach to guidance as a result of previously announced, but starkly above average weather events in the second quarter.
Our liquidity and ability to drive growth remains strong, and we continue to execute for our consumers and stakeholders.
As a reminder, discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments, and extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
Adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense.
EPS for the quarter was $0.62 on a GAAP basis and $0.52 on a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share basis, and $1.23 and $1.32 for the first half of 2020, respectively.
Direct premiums written were up 13.1% for the quarter, led by strong direct premium growth of 14.5% in states outside of Florida and 12.8% in Florida.
For the first half of 2020, direct premiums written were also up double digits, led by 16.5% in states outside Florida and 13.8% in Florida.
In both cases, growth was led by increased volume, rate increases becoming effective in a series of states, along with slightly improved retention, contributing to premium growth.
On the expense side, the combined ratio increased 12.6 points for the quarter to 99.5% and 9.8 points for the first half of 2020 to 96.8%.
The increases were driven primarily by the previously announced increased weather events in the second quarter, a higher core loss ratio and the impact of higher reinsurance costs on the combined ratio, partially offset by a reduction in the expense ratio.
Total services revenue increased 16.8% to $16.1 million for the quarter and 20.9% to $31.5 million for the first half of 2020, driven primarily by commission revenue earned on ceded premiums.
On our investment portfolio, net investment income decreased 16.6% to $6.2 million for the quarter and 16.3% to $13 million for the first half of 2020, primarily due to lower yields on cash and short term investments during the first half of 2020 when compared to the first half of 2019.
The prior year also included onetime income benefits from a special dividend received and onetime reduction in investment expenses.
Also to note, we had an increase in our cash and cash equivalents position by 82.2% when compared to the end of 2019 as a result of taking a defensive posture as COVID-19 impacts continue to be felt across the global economy.
In regards to capital deployment, during the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 572,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $10 million.
For the first half of 2020, the company repurchased approximately 884,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $16.6 million.
The company's current share repurchase authorization program has $11.7 million remaining as of June 30, 2020, and runs through December 31, 2021.
On July 6, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on August 7, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 31, 2020.
As mentioned in our release yesterday, we are updating our full year guidance to reflect the previously announced historically above average second quarter weather events.
We now expect a GAAP earnings per share range from $2.31 to $2.61 and a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share range of $2.40 to $2.70, assuming no extraordinary weather in the latter half of 2020 and no realized or unrealized gains for the second half of 2020.
This would yield a return on average equity derived from GAAP measures between 13.5% and 16.5% for the full year.
I will start with some additional color on prior year catastrophe events, then I'll touch on our experience to date with the second quarter 2020 weather events, and I'll conclude with a few comments on our reinsurance program effective June one.
On prior year catastrophe events, we continue to make significant progress in resolving the remaining open claims and, of course, handling the newly reported claims as quickly as possible.
As of 6/30, Hurricanes Matthew and Florence each were in the single-digit open claims and continue to be very near the end.
Hurricane Michael had a little over 100 claims open.
And as we start to approach the end on this storm, we did elect to book a modest $9.5 million increase in gross ultimate as of 6/30.
This change does not impact our net loss position.
On Hurricane Irma, despite the fact that 1,800 new claims were reported during the second quarter, we still successfully reduced the remaining open claim count.
As of 6/30, the open Irma account stood at just over 450 we are preparing for the three year statute of limitation for filing new Irma claims to pass in early September, so we can make a final push on closing this event.
There was no change to the ultimate as of 6/30.
We were directly impacted by 14 different second quarter PCS events, which led us to book an additional $17 million of net pre-tax loss beyond our original weather loss plan as of 6/30.
A few highlights worth mentioning.
We secured more open market catastrophe coverage than at any other point in Universal's history.
The top level of UPCIC's reinsurance tower provides coverage to a one in 300-year level.
The final estimated cost was in line with our original guidance at approximately 34.6% of estimated direct earned premium for the 12-month treaty period.
This compares to 33.3% at this time last year, reflecting a 4.1% increase year-over-year.
Given the state of the reinsurance market and the industry's recent loss experience, we view the pricing levels as reasonable for this treaty period.

Direct premiums written increased double digits, led by strong growth outside of Florida, and premium growth was supported by increased volume, rate increases, and improved retention. Total services revenue also increased, while net investment income decreased due to lower yields on cash and short-term investments. The combined ratio increased due to weather events, a higher core loss ratio, and higher reinsurance costs. The company repurchased approximately 572,000 shares during the quarter and updated its full-year guidance to reflect weather events, with GAAP earnings per share expected in a range of $2.31 to $2.61 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share in a range of $2.40 to $2.70. Clovered, the company's digital insurance agency, continues to be a growth opportunity, with approximately 40% premium growth in the year-ago quarter and over 200% growth in non-risk-bearing business during the same period.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Please be advised that the discussion of our financial results may include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Each summer, as we prepare for the upcoming school year, we face operational and logistical demand to support the needs of millions of potential customers and thousands of teachers and support staff.
These past two summers have proven even more challenging, as a result of the ongoing global pandemic.
Our country has been facing disruptions in the supply chain, shortages of workers across industries, uncertainty in the workplace and renewed fears of inflation, among many other difficulties.
In spite of this, I have great faith in our country, our ability to persevere and create opportunities through adversities.
We are resilient, adaptive, innovative, compassionate, opinionated, proud and sometimes disagree, but we are always united, and as we navigate these recent challenges, we are evolving.
We're being forced to rethink certain norms, and one of those has been our approach to education.
I hope we now realize that there is no one size fits all solution to education, to training or to workforce development.
Certainly, some of the traditional methods work for many.
But we need to ensure we are providing choices for everybody.
Choices about how and where we learn, how employers recruit, how we educate and train the workforce and how we deliver opportunities for those seeking new paths.
Over 20 years ago, Stride was founded on the premise that students and families should have a choice in their education.
The pandemic has made this mission more critical than ever before.
We remain committed to ensuring that we are providing a best-in-class experience across the range of customers we serve, from early elementary to adult workforce solutions, and we want to make sure that these educational options are available to as many learners as possible.
The increasing demand for educational and training options continues to fuel our business.
The pandemic and the resulting disruption across schools and districts has led to a surge of support for School Choice.
Total support for School Choice has increased to almost 75% of the population.
The pandemic raised awareness for parents about their students' education, and many recognize, that they are not getting what they need from their existing school.
And that surge in interest spans private schools, voucher programs, virtual schools, and other similar programs, and specifically interest in virtual education has seen dramatic increases.
In large part, this was because so many were forced into it during the pandemic.
And while the experience was not always positive, it absolutely opened the eyes of many to the benefits of a virtual model.
And for us, this has translated into what we believe is a structural long-term increase in the demand for our products and services.
In fact, peak website traffic this year surpassed the traffic we saw last year at the height of the pandemic.
We are seeing well over 1 million unique visitors to our websites each month and growing.
and they are a more educated consumer.
Conversion rates for those who apply to our program are at a multiyear high.
We attribute this in large part to the increase in awareness.
Families that apply to our program know what they were looking for, and so they convert at higher rates.
This is an important trend for us over the longer term, and as families become more comfortable with virtual education and Stride's experience, it opens up other opportunities for us to offer other institutional and consumer offerings.
And while conversion rates have improved, so have conversion times.
Families both know what they want and we are also making it easier for them to enroll.
Our focus on the consumer experience and customer journey is just beginning, and if these early trends are any indication of what we can expect, we are going to deliver some really exciting customer experience improvements in the coming months and years ahead.
Our...
...to contribute almost $100 million in revenue during fiscal year 2022.
Gross margins for the quarter were 31.6%, down 340 basis points compared to the same period last year.
We returned to a more normal seasonal pattern in our materials and computer expenses this year.
Last year, we had a slower ramp in shipments to students, which pushed first quarter gross margins up.
Therefore, we expect our second quarter comparison to be more favorable, as spending this year is more in line with the normal seasonality we saw in years prior to last year.
We continue to feel confident in our ability to achieve the 2025 gross margin targets we laid out last November, and faster than we originally anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $133.4 million, up $15.6 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
The increase in SG&A is primarily driven by higher costs associated with enrollment and onboarding and the annualization of expenses from our acquisitions.
Stock-based comp was $8.3 million for the quarter.
We anticipate that we will finish the year with stock-based compensation in the range of $29 million to $31 million.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.5 million, adjusted EBITDA was $25.5 million.
Both these metrics were impacted by the seasonality of costs that I outlined above.
The timing of our costs and income in fiscal year 2021 had timing anomalies, that we explained during our quarterly calls last year.
This year, we expect our seasonality of expenses will be more similar to the years prior to FY '21, and as you can see in our guidance, we think the second quarter will be very strong from a profitability standpoint.
Interest expense for the quarter was $2 million.
As we mentioned last quarter, we have adopted new accounting guidance that eliminates the non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount from our convertible note, this results in lower interest expense.
It also means that we have increased the long-term debt recorded on our balance sheet, even though we have not taken on any additional debt.
For the year, we expect our quarterly interest expense to be fairly consistent with the first quarter.
Our effective tax rate came in at 33%.
For FY '22, we believe we will finish the year, with a tax rate in the 28% to 30% range, mostly due to an increase in non-deductible compensation, above FY '21.
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $15.4 million, up $2.6 million from the prior period last year.
This increase was expected, as we invest in more mainstream consumer facing products, expected to contribute to future financial performance, as well as ongoing investments in our high growth career and adult learning businesses.
Free cash flow in the first quarter, defined as cash from operations less capex, was negative $146.9 million as compared to the prior year's $127.3 million.
This normal seasonality of cash flows relates to school launch and the enrollment and on boarding of new students.
We expect to see positive cash flow for the next three quarters.
For fiscal year 2022, we expect to have significantly higher cash flow from operations than in fiscal year 2021.
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $218.5 million.
Turning to our guidance; for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the company is forecasting revenue in the range of $390 million to $400 million, adjusted operating income between $55 million and $60 million, and capital expenditures between $14 million and $17 million.
For the full year, we are forecasting revenue in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.60 billion, adjusted operating income between $165 million and $180 million, capital expenditures between $65 million and $75 million, and lastly an effective tax rate between 28% and 30%.
Without the collective effort of thousands of Stride employees, we could not have achieved the strong results we saw this quarter, and that we expect to see for the full year.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before getting into the details of the quarter's performance, I would like to remind everyone that the year-ago quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the significant negative impact that this had on our fiscal Q2 2020 results, the year-over-year comparisons that we discuss today are greater than normal in magnitude.
Our fiscal Q2 results came in well ahead of our expectations, fueled by continued strong demand environment.
Total revenue for Q2 was up 31% year-over-year to $5.9 billion.
Gross profit increased 20% or $55 million compared to the prior year to $329 million.
Gross margin was 5.6%, down from 6.1% in the prior year, primarily due to product mix.
Total adjusted SG&A expense was $159 million or 2.7% of revenue, down $14 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to COVID-related expenses in the prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $170 million, improved by $68 million or 67% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating margin was 2.9%, up 62 basis points year-over-year.
Q2 interest expense and finance charges were approximately $23 million and the effective tax rate was 25%, both in line with our expectation.
Total non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $109 million, up $44 million and improved by 68% over the prior year.
And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.09, up from $1.26 in the prior year.
Now turning to the balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion and debt of $1.6 billion.
Accounts receivable totaled $2.5 billion, down 12% year-over-year and inventories totaled $2.7 billion, flat from the prior year.
Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was 26 days, 17 days improved from last year.
The decrease was driven by DSO improvements and better inventory turns.
Cash generated from operations was approximately $280 million in the quarter.
And including our cash and credit facilities, we had approximately $3.1 billion of available liquidity.
We are pleased to report that our Board of Directors have approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share for the current quarter.
The dividend is expected to be paid on July 30, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 16, 2021.
Before moving to our Q3 outlook, let me provide a brief update regarding our proposed merger with Tech Data.
Since our announcement in March, we have established the capital structure for the planned merger through a new $5 billion credit facility and are on track with the debt financing for the merger.
Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q3.
Revenue is expected to be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5.45 billion.
This estimate does not contemplate any impact related to the customer consignment change that we have previously spoken about.
At this time, we no longer expect the change to occur within our fiscal 2021.
Non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $99.9 million to $110.4 million.
And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10 per diluted share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 51.9 million.
Our Q3 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance exclude the after-tax cost of $7 million or $0.13 per share related to the amortization of intangibles and $5.3 million or $0.10 per share related to share-based compensation.
With our quarter starting off with the Tech Data merger announcement, there was a potential of this news being a distraction to our daily efforts.
As expected though, our team executed very well, provided exceptional service to our customers and continued to expertly manage through the ongoing dynamics of our industry and the pandemic.
For Q2, our results came in above our internal expectations due to continued demand for remote capability, digital transformation, the ongoing recovery of office and data center IT purchasing and overall above-market growth.
Essentially, every product category we participate in saw strength in the quarter, most notably notebooks, Chromebooks, cloud, security, services, networking and collaboration.
Our manufacturing business also performed very well with results above the high end of our internal forecast.
The demand came from across most all our customer segments with SMB and public sector leading the way.
From a geographical perspective, all regions were at expectations or better.
Regarding our proposed merger with Tech Data, everything is going well.
As Marshall mentioned, we are set up for an effective financing of the transaction.
Our proxy has been filed and our shareholder meeting will be held next week.
And from a regulatory standpoint, we have received clearance from a number of governmental authorities and expect the rest to process through normal course.
As would be expected, the COVID pandemic has led to review delays in some countries.
We still believe our transaction will close in the second half of 2021, reflective of the typical six to eight months announced to close time frame for a deal of this size and complexity.
Since the announcement of the transaction, we have continued to receive internal and external support for the merger.
The integration work we have performed since the announcement, albeit limited due to regulatory rules, further supports the strategic benefits of this deal that we discussed in March.
We look forward to sharing more when the transaction closes later this year.
Moving to our outlook.
Our priority remains on the health and safety of our associates.
Overall, we are optimistic about the IT spending environment, given the current strong demand, the expectation of more geographies reopening and the resumption of on-premise enterprise IT projects.
We believe these factors represent potential tailwinds for our business.
Specific to our Q3 guidance.
We are planning for continued growth in our distribution business but have added a bit of conservatism in the forecast this quarter given the widely reported supply chain component challenges.
Considering our current backlog, still very strong, we know the business is there.
It just remains to be seen when it will transact.
For our manufacturing business, we use the low end of our internal range for forecasting purposes.
This low end for manufacturing will reflect the decline over Q3 last year.
This is a result of the very strong prior-year quarter, the over-forecast achievement in Q2 of this year and the overall unpredictable nature of this business.
Taking all these factors into account, we believe our Q3 view reflects a balanced outlook, which incorporates all the various puts and takes of the current environment.
Hopefully a conservative view, and as always, we'll strive to do better.
I am confident with ongoing execution we will continue to progress on our stated strategy of improving our core business, driving organic growth, increasing our value-added services and products and successfully closing our proposed merger with Tech Data.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.
Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week.
The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter, highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share.
Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion and our pre-tax profit margin improved 490 basis points to 19.4%.
Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended June 30 was 34.9% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%.
These results reflect our experienced teams and their production capabilities, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands.
Housing market conditions remained very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further.
However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable.
As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align to our current production levels and are selling homes later in the construction cycle, when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers.
We expect to work through these issues and increasing our production capacity.
We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter and our homes in inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022.
We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage positioned us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions.
We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments.
Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 78% to $3.06 per diluted share compared to $1.72 per share in the prior year quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 77% to $1.1 billion compared to $630.7 million.
Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 35% to $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed, up from $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed in the prior year.
Our average closing price for the quarter was $326,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%.
The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 2% from the prior year to $6.4 billion, while our net sales orders for the quarter decreased 17% to 17,952 homes.
Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was down 3% sequentially.
Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $359,200.
The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter.
As David described, in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales order pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position.
They continue to adjust sales prices to market on a community-by-community basis, while staying focused on providing value to our buyers.
Based on the stage of c...
...beginning of the fiscal year.
We are pleased with the performance of our single and multi-family rental teams and we look forward to their growing contributions for our future profits and returns.
Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic.
During the nine months ended June, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $276 million even while we have reinvested significant operating capital to expand our homebuilding inventories in response to strong demand.
At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.7 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.
We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.
Our homebuilding leverage was 16% at the end of June with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months.
At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $13.8 billion and book value per share was $38.54, up 27% from a year ago.
For the trailing 12-months ended June, our return on equity was 29.5% compared to 19.9% a year ago.
During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August.
We repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $241.2 million during the quarter for a total of 8.1 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $661.4 million.
Our remaining share repurchase authorization at June 30 was $758.8 million.
We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, based on today's market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion to $8.4 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 23,000 and 24,500 homes.
We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 26% to 26.3% and homebuilding SG&A, as a percentage of revenues, in the fourth quarter to be approximately 7%.
We anticipate our Financial Services pre-tax profit margin in the range of 40% to 45% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23.5%.
For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $27.6 billion to $28.1 billion and to close between 83,000 and 84,500 homes.
This year, we have prioritized reinvestment of our operating capital to increase our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand.
Our other cash flow priorities remain balanced among increasing our investment in our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% from the beginning of fiscal 2021.
In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands.
Our results also illustrate the growth opportunity in front of us as we increase production capacity in response to homebuyer demand.
Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with a significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions.
We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis.
As a result of these efforts, we are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Once again, this is John Bruno.
Joining me on the call from PPG are: Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vincent Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Our comments relate to the financial information released after US equity markets closed on Monday, July 19th, 2021.
Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.
Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening.
For the second quarter, our net sales were a record and nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.94.
Our adjusted earnings per share were significantly higher than the second quarter of 2020, partially due to last year's second quarter, including various pandemic related impacts.
Looking back to pre-pandemic results.
Our adjusted earnings per share was similar to the second quarter of 2019, despite sales volumes being 6% lower than that period and we are dealing with historical high levels of raw material inflation in the current period [Phonetic].
Our strong year-over-year sales reflect a partial recovery from the unfavorable pandemic effects of last year, but also include better than market performance across many of our businesses for this quarter.
We achieved these higher sales levels, despite significant supply and component disruptions; including ones that reduce the overall manufacturing capability of our customers.
Coming in the quarter, we expected these disruptions would have an estimated impact of $70 million to $90 million.
However, the actual impact was much more severe and closer to $200 million.
Our adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter, while near all-time record levels was below our April forecast.
Three main factors impacted the difference: due to supply disruptions we experienced unprecedented levels of raw material and transportation costs that continually elevated as the quarter progressed.
This drove raw material inflation to be up a mid-to-high teen percentage on a year-over-year basis versus our original estimate of a high single-digit percentage increase.
Our automotive OEM business was impacted most significantly from supply disruptions as we estimate that more than 2 million less cars were built than initially expected during the quarter.
This impacted our sales by about $100 million or higher than $40 million more than we expected in April.
Finally, as we expected the supply disruptions led to shortages of certain raw materials with anticipated impact of $30 million to $50 million, but the actual impact was closer to $100 million.
We are highly confident that the sales related to these production disruptions will be deferred to later quarters and this will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery.
As I mentioned in April coming into the year, we are expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritize selling price increases across all our businesses.
This helped us achieve solid price increases year-to-date and our pace of price realization is well ahead of the most recent raw material inflation cycle in 2017 and 2018.
Clearly, this inflation cycle is much higher than anyone anticipated and we are continuing on a business-by-business basis, working to secure further selling price increases.
This includes executing additional pricing actions during the third quarter.
As a reminder, the second quarter of 2021 was our 17th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices.
We're also continuing our strong cost management evidenced by our SG&A as a percentage of sales being 130 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019.
This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs, realized an incremental $40 million of savings in the second ...
...tectural coatings trade activity in the US.
Many of our customers have indicated that their order books were at high levels exiting the second quarter.
We anticipate the strong global demand pattern to continue.
In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels, either later this year or in 2022.
In the near-term, we expect some of our customers will continue to be challenged with input or component shortages.
So their production capabilities and schedules likely to remain choppy throughout the third quarter.
PPG is also experienced in the continuation of spot outages of direct coatings raw materials.
As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impacts from both our direct supply chain disruptions and the production curtailment of some of our customers in the third quarter.
Our current best estimate is our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $150 million in the third quarter, due to these issues.
We expect these sales will be largely deferred to subsequent quarters.
We also expect raw material costs to remain at elevated levels in the third quarter, our current best estimate is that they will be inflated by [Indecipherable] 20%, compared to the third quarter of 2020 with businesses and our industrial coatings segment experiencing the largest increases, due to the raw material mix of those types of coatings.
As a result all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases, due to significant increases we experienced in the second quarter and anticipate in the third quarter, we now fully expect to offset raw material cost inflation in the fourth quarter on 2021 on a run rate basis.
As I've said previously, these current disruptions are temporary and we strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain once operating conditions normalize.
I'm very pleased that we've completed five by recent acquisitions since December 2020.
In the third quarter these acquisitions will add about $500 million of incremental sales to our company.
As we continue to integrate these acquisitions, we will start to realize meaningful synergies that will be a strong earnings catalyst.
We are also witnessing domestic flight activity picking up all over the world.
This will begin to benefit our commercial aftermarket business in aerospace in the second half of 2021.
And the information we posted on our website yesterday evening, we're projecting aggregate sales volumes to be up a low single-digit percentage in the third quarter, compared to the prior year quarter.
With differences by business and region.
Including our acquisitions, we expect overall sales growth to be over 20%, compared to the third quarter of 2020.
In addition, full-year 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense and other non-recurring items is expected to be $7.40 to $7.60, which at the midpoint would be about 13% higher than the adjusted earnings per share we realized in 2019, despite the significant raw material inflationary pressures we are dealing with this year.
And the fact that sales volumes are still not fully recovered from the pandemic, when compared to 2019.
Finally, I'm very pleased that our Board recently approved a dividend increase of about 10%.
Our September payment coupled with the anticipated payment of a similar quarterly dividend in December, will mark 50 consecutive years of annual per share increases in the Company's dividend.
This is another testament of our Company's legacy of consistently rewarding our shareholders and the confidence that the Board and I have and our ability to continue to generate and grow our operating cash flow.
In closing, I could not be more proud of our now 50,000 employees around the world, who is [Phonetic] share of our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders.
Their dedication and commitment to doing better today than yesterday, every day helps ensure that PPG continues to protect and beautify the world.

[/INST] # PPG reported record net sales of $4.4 billion in Q2, driven by improved performance across many businesses. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.94, similar to pre-pandemic levels despite lower sales volume and significant raw material inflation. Supply disruptions severely impacted operations, leading to an estimated $200 million loss. However, the company remains confident that deferred sales will recover. Selling price increases are ongoing to offset inflation, which is expected to remain elevated in Q3. Acquisitions are projected to add $500 million in incremental sales in Q3, with meaningful synergies to follow.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm here today with Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn; and CFO, Joe Reitmeier.
Todd will review key points for the quarter and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and outlook for 2021.
To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and requeue for any additional questions.
All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period.
For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC.
In the first quarter, we continued to see strong momentum in our Residential business, combined with strong improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration, as the overall company set new first quarter highs for revenue, profit and earnings per share.
Overall, for the company, revenue was up 29% to a new first quarter record of $931 million.
At constant currency, revenue was up 28%.
GAAP operating income was a first quarter record $114 million, up 213%.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was a first quarter record $2.20, up 588%.
Total segment profit rose 208% to a first quarter record of $116 million.
Total segment margin expanded 720 basis points to 12.4%, and adjusted points to 12.4%, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 305% to a first quarter record $2.27.
Looking at our business segments for the first quarter, we've realized double digit revenue growth and margin expansion in all three businesses.
In Residential, we set new first quarter highs for revenue and profit.
Residential revenue was up 37%.
Segment profit rose 197% and segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%.
Replacement business was up more than 40% and new construction was up more than 25%.
Breaking it down between our Lennox business and our Allied business, Lennox revenue was up about 25%, and Allied was up about 70%.
Let me take a moment to unpack the strength we saw in Residential in the quarter.
First, with strong operational execution, our Residential team is capitalizing on its ability to deliver to meet contractor and distributor demand and gain share.
Post the 2018 tornado and the initial 2020 pandemic impact, we are back on offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for market share gains.
Second, Residential benefited from the colder winter weather with heating degree days up 13% from the first quarter last year.
You may recall, we had a soft first quarter in 2020.
Third, I'd like to note that we had -- I would like to note that we had a 6% benefit to revenue for more days in the quarter this year than last year.
That happens every four years as we reset the calendar.
Conversely, the fourth quarter will have a 6% headwind from fewer days in the quarter this year.
This applies to Residential as well as all our other businesses.
Adjusting for the days, Residential grew 31% with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.
In addition, for Allied, we had approximately $25 million of pull-forward in the first quarter from different distributor loading patterns this year than last year.
Adjusted for both days and this pull-forward, Allied was up approximately 35% in the quarter.
Working through all this math I gave, adjusting for days and the pull-forward in our Allied business which sells to independent distribution, overall Residential segment revenue was up about 25%.
We believe this compares to mid-teen sell-through for the industry, driven in part by the favorable cold weather that I talked about.
Our performance that is above that is due to market share gains.
As I mentioned earlier, we are back on the offensive with production, distribution and executing our playbook for gaining share.
The team has had strong operational execution to drive this outperformance, and we are well positioned for the summer season and our largest season of quarters.
In Commercial, revenue, segment profit and margin were all first quarter rec...
...t of revenue to 15.6% from 18.1% in the prior quarter.
In the first quarter, the company used $18 million in cash from operations compared to a usage of $99 million in the prior year quarter.
Capital expenditures were approximately 25 -- $24 million in the first quarter and in the prior year quarter.
Free cash flow was a negative $42 million in the first quarter compared to a negative $123 million in the prior quarter.
The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock.
Total debt was $1.17 billion at the end of the first quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the first quarter.
We now expect the industry to see high single-digit shipment growth in Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration markets in full year, up from our prior assumption of mid-single-digit growth in these end markets.
For the company, we are raising guidance for 2021 revenue growth from a 48% range to a new range of 7% to 11%, and we still expect foreign exchange to be neutral to revenue for the full year.
We are raising guidance for 2021 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations from a range of $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.33 to $11.93, and we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations from $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.40 to $12.
Now let me run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021.
First, for the items that are changing.
We have announced a second round of price increases and now expect a benefit of $90 million in price for the year, up from our prior guidance of $50 million.
We now expect residential mix of $10 million, up from our prior guidance for neutral mix.
We expect a benefit of $15 million from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction actions, down from our prior guidance of $25 million.
And this change reflects inflationary pressures from suppliers.
For commodities, we now expect a $55 million headwind, up from our prior guidance of $30 million.
Corporate expenses are now expected to be approximately $95 million, up from prior guidance of $90 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.
And now for the guidance items that remain the same.
We still expect a $20 million benefit from factory productivity.
With 30 new Lennox Stores planned for this year, we will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments compared to last year.
Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are also expected to be a $5 million headwind.
We are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or a headwind of about $45 million.
Now within SG&A, we are making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, eCommerce and factory automation and productivity.
A few other guidance points.
We still expect neutral foreign exchange.
We still expect interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million.
We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year.
We are still planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico.
We expect construction to be completed at the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, and we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant.
Free cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $375 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $325 million on the strong earnings performance in the first quarter and our current outlook.
And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million to 38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.
And with that, let's go to Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our investor section of our website.
At the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website.
These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and other filings.
I appreciate everyone taking the time to join our call today.
In stepping back and reflecting for a moment, it's hard to believe that 12 months have passed since we first encountered COVID.
I think about sitting alongside Mike and Adam one year ago during our March 2020 earnings call when clarity vanished and uncertainty ran wild.
Yet, in typical Jabil fashion, our people did what they do.
They dove in and gave their very best to combat the pandemic.
They did so by looking after one another while taking outstanding care of our customers.
It's a point in time that I'll never forget.
It's a point in time that highlights the level of respect and admiration that I have for our team here at Jabil.
Their attitude and their actions continue to impress.
And for sure, there is no other team I'd rather be part of.
Our second quarter came in well ahead of expectations, driven by stronger than expected product demand, solid execution, and a well-balanced contribution throughout the entire company.
The team delivered core earnings per share of $1.27 and revenue of $6.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%.
I'm really pleased with our financial results for the quarter.
Although, what's quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements we've made to our balance sheet.
All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push toward the back half of fiscal '21.
It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY '22.
I'd now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio.
Slide 6 underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate.
Today, our business is wide-ranging and resilient.
This is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption or cyclical demand.
Furthermore, our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities, innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers.
It's a proven formula that's trusted by many of the world's most remarkable brands.
Moving to Slide 7, I'll address our updated outlook for the year.
We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of $5 a share, an increase of 25% from what we anticipated back in September, with top-line revenue coming in around $28.5 billion.
This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another 10-basis-point increase to core operating margin, which we now forecast to be 4.2% for the year.
Lastly, we remain committed to generating a minimum of $600 million in free cash flow, a testament to how we're managing our capital investments.
As I wrap up the outlook, it's notable that our strategy is working, our path is well understood, and how we go about producing results is important.
On this last point, when we think about the how, we think about purpose.
A purpose that guides us in our journey.
A purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors.
Behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive environment, and giving back to our communities around the world.
I'm just so proud that our team is hitting the mark in all of these areas.
Their efforts over the past two to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets.
Markets...
...the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare.
I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years.
Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to both technology-enabled products that help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare.
Another end market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market.
Today, electric vehicles account for less than 2% of total vehicles in the market.
Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns, and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies.
As a result, OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort.
Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend.
Turning now to 5G.
5G will transform the way we live, work, play, and educate.
As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating.
Jabil is well-positioned to benefit from both the worldwide infrastructural labs and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network.
5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth.
This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years.
The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to those capabilities, which incorporates engineering, manufacturing, and eco-friendly decommissioning of servers, all within co-located facilities.
This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times, security, and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our U.S.-domiciled hyperscalers.
Shifting now to packaging.
We are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and eco-friendly packaging.
As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste, demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating.
And then finally, within semi-cap, the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs.
Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicone today.
Jabil serves the semi-cap space with end-to-end solutions spanning the front end with design and complex fabrication equipment, along with the back end, the validation, and test solutions.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum under way across the business which has allowed us to deliver much better than expected results in the first half of FY '21.
As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue.
This, coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses, has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY '21 estimates for revenue, core operating income, core margins, and core earnings per share.
We now expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $28.5 billion.
This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5.
And importantly, despite the stronger growth, we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year.
We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows, and positively impact our interest in tax.
I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.
As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we will not address any customer or product-specific information.
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.

 I'm Alexandra Deignan, the Company's Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Sustainability.
Today's discussion, it also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the Company's performance.
Hosting our call today are Kenneth Jacobs, Lazard's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Evan Russo, our Chief Financial Officer.
Evan will start the discussion with an overview of our financial results.
Then Ken will provide his perspective on the outlook for our business.
After that, we will open the call to questions.
Third quarter revenue was a record $702 million, up 23% from a year ago.
Revenue for the first nine months was a record $2.2 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In Financial Advisory, record third quarter revenue of $381 million increased 24% from last year's period, reflecting broad-based activity across sectors, market cap and regions.
Advisory revenue was driven primarily by M&A completions in the Americas and in Europe.
A high percentage of these were in the $1 billion to $10 billion range.
Private equity-related activity is increasing.
Year-to-date, our advisory revenue from transactions involving financial sponsors has more than doubled.
Our Private Capital Advisory franchise continues to show strength, as we advise financial sponsors globally on fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions.
As we've noted on previous calls, restructuring activity has been relatively subdued, reflecting the high level of liquidity across markets.
Our sovereign and capital markets advisory businesses remain active, advising governments and corporations on financing, capital structure and shareholder strategy.
Overall, our advisory activity is at an all-time high, and we currently expect record fourth quarter revenue for Financial Advisory, with strong momentum going into 2022.
Asset Management third quarter operating revenue of $311 million increased 19% from last year's period, reflecting a larger base of assets under management.
Average AUM reached a record high of $278 billion for the third quarter, 23% higher than a year ago and 1% higher on a sequential basis.
As of September 30, we reported AUM at quarter-end of $273 billion, 20% higher than last year's period and 2% lower on a sequential basis.
The decrease was primarily driven by negative foreign exchange movement of $3.3 billion and net outflows of $2.3 billion, partly offset by market appreciation of $0.8 billion.
The quarter's net outflows were primarily from equities, partly offset by net inflows in fixed income and alternatives.
Gross inflows continue to be healthy across our platforms.
As of October 22, AUM increased to approximately $279 billion, driven primarily by market appreciation of $6.6 billion and positive foreign exchange movement of $0.9 billion, partly offset by net outflows of $1.1 billion.
Our pattern of investment performance has been good this year.
Approximately two-thirds of our composite strategies are outperforming their benchmarks on a one-year basis.
Our recent investments in thematic, fixed income and alternative platforms, as well as their performance position them well for growth.
We see significant opportunities for growth in both of our businesses.
In Asset Management, we continue to invest in people, technology and our distribution effort, as well as the development of new and existing funds and the scaling up of our platforms.
These include the recent addition of a long/short equity team focused on the technology, media and telecom sector; the launch of a global investment-grade convertible bond fund; and a new quantitative small cap fund.
In addition, we have recently made senior hires in global marketing, in ESG and sustainability, and to support the expansion of US and European distribution.
We continue to see substantial opportunities to recruit talented investment teams, adding strategies that are complementary to our existing platforms.
In Financial Advisory, we are executing on our growth strategy with an elevated pace of strategic recruiting, especially in high-growth sectors such as biopharma, fintech, alternative energy and private capital.
While we continue to focus on internal promotes, year-to-date, we have made more than 20 senior hires, including MDs and senior advisors.
Now, turning to expenses.
Even as we invest for growth, we remain focused on cost discipline.
Our adjusted non-compensation ratio for the third quarter was 16.6% compared to 18.1% in last year's third quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were 13% higher than the same period last year, reflecting increased business activity and technology investments.
We continue to accrue compensation expense at a 59.5% adjusted compensation ratio in the third quarter.
Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25.1%.
For the first nine months of the year, it was 26.2%.
We continue to expect this year's annual effective tax rate to be in the mid-20% range.
Lazard continues to generate strong cash flow, which supports return of capital to shareholders.
In the third quarter, we returned $103 million, which included $52 million in share repurchases.
During the quarter, we bought back 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $46.01 per share.
As of September 30, our total outstanding share repurchase authorization was $314 million.
Ken will now provide perspective on our outlook.
Market conditions remain excellent for both of our businesses.
In the US, economic growth is generally robust and a strong recovery appears likely to continue into next year.
In Europe, recovery remains on track as business conditions normalize.
The strength of economic demand, combined with pandemic-related labor shortages, is leading to supply chain disruptions and growing concerns about inflation, and these developments are driving a new set of discussions with CEOs, boards and institutional investors.
As travel restrictions ease, we are having more in-person meetings and reinforcing the personal engagement that's so important to both sides of our business.
The M&A environment continues to be as good as we've seen, and we are as active as we've ever been.
The forces driving global strategic activity remain in place.
Technology-driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for M&A across industries.
The global drive to reduce carbon emissions is an emerging catalyst.
And an abundance of private capital, alongside strategic capital, continues to drive activity.
On the investor side, demand for risk assets with a growing focus on sustainability continues to create opportunities for active managements to drive alpha.
Our Asset Management franchise is providing clients with a growing and innovative array of investment strategies and customized solutions.
The investments we've been making in both our businesses position us well for further growth.
We continue to invest in people, resources and technology to enhance our market capabilities, geographic reach and sector-specific expertise.
We remain focused on serving our clients well, while managing the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long run.

At Jabil, it's people that drive our success.
And it's these same people that truly make us who we are.
Each day, they carry our culture and they cement our values.
The quarter came in ahead of expectations, driven by solid execution and a moderate uptick in demand.
Said differently, we saw well-balanced contributions across the company.
Altogether, the team delivered core operating income of $277 million on revenue of $7.2 billion, creating a core operating margin of 3.8% for the quarter.

A colorful chart that represents our commercial portfolio and underscores the effectiveness of our team.
Today, our business is diversified and is diversified at scale, providing more resiliency than ever before.
And in my opinion, it offers Jabil a real competitive advantage, especially when we consider our performance and the sustainability of the business.
Furthermore, each individual piece of the pie harbors specific domain expertise and deep technical knowledge, all of which make up our library of essential and valuable capabilities.
Add to this the method in which our team weaved together these capabilities.
It elevates the way in which we serve our customers, particularly when we move with speed and precision.

But most importantly, we're maintaining our outlook of 4.2% for core operating margin and increasing our outlook for free cash flow by 5% to $630 million.
For me, a positive testament on how the team is managing the business.
In wrapping up our forecast for FY '21, I'd like to note, when we communicate inside the company, our strategy is understood and our path is clear.
During these internal discussions, the thing that stands out to me is our team's obsession with how we produce outcomes.
And when we think about the how, we think about our behaviors.
Behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive work environment, and giving back to our communities.
I'm proud that our teams dialed in on all of these areas.
In fact, their conduct is exceptional.
Consistent with the past few years, we're looking forward to hosting our annual investor briefing.
We'll open the session by reporting our fourth-quarter and full-year results.
We'll then follow with a complete review of our priorities.
And we'll connect the dots on how these priorities will guide us throughout fiscal '22.
Add to this, a discussion on end markets and our observations specific to the macro environment.
Our management team will also share how we plan to expand core operating margin year on year.
In addition, we'll also describe the hard work put forth that reinforces our ...
...stments total $197 million.
We exited the quarter with cash balances of $1.2 billion.
We ended Q3 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion.
With this available capacity, along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q3 with access to more than $5 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility.
During Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $130 million.
At the end of the quarter, $124 million remain outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization and we intend to complete this authorization during Q4 as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in FY '21 and beyond.
Turning now to our fourth-quarter guidance.
DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to $3.95 billion.
This is mainly due to strong end-market outlook.
EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.65 billion, a decrease of 2% on a year-over-year basis.
It's worth noting, our EMS business remains strong and healthy.
The modest decrease is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model, offset by higher server volumes in the cloud business.
We expect total company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.9 billion for an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $280 million to $340 million for a margin range of approximately 3.8% to 4.3%.
Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.45.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.20.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market.
Today, both segments are in incredibly good shape.
Last quarter, I highlighted some long-term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets such as healthcare, automotive, connected devices, 5G, cloud, and semi-cap, all of which continue to show strong performance for the balance of FY '21 and beyond.
In tandem with this, in more foundational areas of businesses like print, retail, mobility, networking, and storage, we've retooled, reoptimized, and reimagined our long-standing partnerships with some of the best brands in the world by leveraging Jabil's differentiated capabilities to deliver successful solutions to our customers.
The resiliency in our portfolio, coupled with the long-term secular trends under way across our businesses, we believe, will continue to drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond.
Putting it all together for the year on the next slide.
For FY '21, we expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $29.5 billion.
This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5.50.
And importantly, we now expect to deliver more than $630 million in free cash flow despite the stronger growth.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum under way across the business, which has allowed us to deliver much better-than-expected results through the first nine months of fiscal '21.
As we enter Q4 and look beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue.
This, coupled with our improved portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses, gives me confidence around continued margin accretion and strong earnings growth in FY '22.
We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows, and positively impact our interest and tax.
Seeing this hard work manifest in strong financial results is a testament to the exceptional execution by our teams on all fronts.
As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we will not address any customer- or product-specific questions.
We appreciate your understanding.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Last night, we released results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2021 copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
I'm very pleased with the exceptional operating results we've reported as we saw a strengthening recovery across our end markets.
For the quarter, we generated record adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 and segment EBIT of $140 million.
The results were driven by improving demand trends, robust unit margins, disciplined operational execution, and strong performance in our targeted growth initiatives.
I'd like to recognize the extraordinary employees of Cabot, whose team work and commitment made it possible for us to meet the dynamic needs of our customers while maintaining the safety of our people and our communities.
The COVID pandemic has challenged our normal ways of working, but I believe our strong culture of connectivity and collaboration enabled us to distinguish Cabot in the marketplace, and we will continue to build on these strengths into 2021.
During the quarter, we saw strong volumes in the tire and automotive markets as the recovery momentum continued globally with a sharp rebound of the lows experienced last spring.
We are pleased to see that miles driven trends have improved, though still generally lagged pre-COVID levels.
In terms of automotive builds, a similar trend has taken hold.
With both end markets still below prior peaks, we are optimistic about our growth runway as the economic recovery strengthens.
As highlighted in previous calls, we experienced real strength throughout 2020 for products sold into the infrastructure, packaging and consumer sectors and this continued in our first fiscal quarter of 2021.
Our strong product portfolio, global reach and technical support have enabled us to capitalize on favorable infrastructure trends in wire and cable, pipe and geo membranes.
Additionally, the COVID pandemic has changed certain consumer behaviors and these trends are supportive of our packaging and consumer-driven applications.
While the underlying end market trends are favorable, there likely was some level of channel replenishment in the quarter as the combination of sharply [Technical Issues] and low inventories in most value chains created upward pressure on orders.
We are also seeing tightness across transportation modes globally and the supply chain uncertainty is likely causing customers to build some inventory to mitigate disruptions.
I would like to spend a little time now on China.
[Technical Issues] had driven some softening in that market.
We are seeing real strength there now.
China was the only major economy to avoid a recession in 2020 and the market there was very strong for us in Q1 as PMI hit 57 and industrial production surged.
As we look forward, our belief in the fundamentals of the China market is strong and our long-standing strategic assumptions remain sound.
Given that almost 40% of the world's tires are produced in China and 50% of the world's silicones, our differentiated position there means we are extremely well-positioned for growth.
We believe that the feedstock markets will be in balance over the long-term, which should provide a foundation of stability over time.
And finally we expect environmental pressures will continue to ratchet and Cabot's leadership and sustainability will position us in a differentiated way relative to competition.
Looking at our segments, Reinforcement Materials generated record EBIT performance in the quarter driven by very strong results in Asia as our focus on margin paid off.
Our global footprint and focus on operational excellence are the foundations of our customer value proposition and I believe ...
...ransition to a long-term supply agreement.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see a sequential EBIT increase from improved pricing and product mix for specialty applications and lower fixed cost.
I will now turn to corporate items.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $147 million, and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.5 billion.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $21 million, which included a working capital increase of $99 million.
The working capital increase was largely driven by growth related to net working capital, as accounts receivables increased with higher sales and inventory increased from purchases of higher cost raw materials.
The change in net working capital also included the final payment of $33 million related to the prior year respirator settlement.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $29 million.
For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be between $175 million and $200 million.
This estimate includes continued EPA related compliance spend and capital related to upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty products.
Additional uses of cash during the quarter included $20 million for dividend.
Our operating tax rate was 30% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and we continue to anticipate the fiscal year rate will be between 28% and 30%.
We are very pleased with the record results in the first quarter of 2021 with volumes recovering from the COVID-related lows we experienced in fiscal 2020 and the great execution across the organization.
We achieved record-setting results in Reinforcement Materials and much improved performance in the Performance Chemicals' segment.
This is a great start to our fiscal year.
As I look at the second quarter, there are some tailwinds that benefited our results in the first quarter that we don't expect to repeat.
Based on the underlying business performance, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.90 to a $1.
While I expect our second quarter adjusted earnings per share to moderate from the first quarter, I believe this level of expected earnings in the second quarter reflects how well our businesses are performing in the current environment.
January volumes were strong and we anticipate the underlying demands in our key end markets will remain robust during the quarter driving year-over-year EBIT growth across all segments.
On the cash side, we anticipate our cash and liquidity will remain robust.
Net working capital increases should moderate from what we saw in the first quarter with more consistent volume levels going forward.
As the fiscal year unfolds, we expect the environment will remain uncertain and there are several factors that we will be managing closely.
The first is the level and timing of COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the world and its impact on the economic recovery.
Infection rates remain very high in many parts of the world and the stability of economic growth will depend on favorable trends in reducing the level of infection.
Next is Global Logistics where we have begun to see some negative impact in terms of availability and cost of transportation in our supply chain.
This influence is being felt across global value chains and may take some time to fully stabilize.
And finally, the movement of pricing and input costs particularly in the spot markets in Asia.
We have demonstrated our ability to execute well over the past year no matter what the challenge and I have confidence that this will continue in the year to come.
Our company's true character has been showcased during these times of adversity.
I am proud of how the team has responded with great resilience and a focus on our customers, our communities and one another.
Our exceptional first quarter results are a true testament to our company's capabilities and that position us well for a successful 2021.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Yesterday, we reported all-time record quarterly sales from continuing operations and record second quarter adjusted EBIT and EBITDA.
These outstanding results are a testament to the dedication and hard work of our employees around the globe.
Second quarter sales were $1.27 billion, EBIT was $172 million, and earnings per share were $0.82, all significantly higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Strong year-over-year results reflect recovery in most of our businesses from the significant impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
When comparing to the pre-pandemic results of second quarter 2019, trade sales grew 5%, adjusted EBITDA was up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 12%.
During the quarter, we made two strategic acquisitions, expanding our capabilities and product offerings in our Work Furniture and International Bedding businesses.
At the end of May, we acquired a small manufacturer of bent metal tubing used in office and residential furniture located in Poland that has been an important supplier to our local Work Furniture operation.
On June 4, we acquired a leading provider of specialty foam and finished mattresses, primarily serving customers in the U.K. and Ireland.
The company, Kayfoam, is located near Dublin and has two manufacturing facilities with combined annual sales of approximately $80 million.
Kayfoam expands the capabilities of our European Bedding business and establishes a platform in foam technology in finished mattress production.
Similar to our U.S. Bedding business, this acquisition allows us to support our European Bedding customers anywhere in the value chain from innerspring and foam components to finished products, including private label mattresses, toppers, pillows and other bedding accessories.
We increased our full year sales guidance as a result of continued material cost inflation and sales related to the acquisitions just mentioned.
Increased earnings per share guidance is largely due to metal margin expansion in our Steel Rod business.
Jeff will provide more detail on updated guidance later in the call.
Your commitment, resolve and ingenuity allowed us to navigate raw material constraints, labor shortages and freight challenges to service our customers in a very strong demand environment.
Your efforts and accomplishments are greatly appreciated.
We had strong operating performance in the second quarter as sales have recovered to near or above pre-pandemic levels in most of our businesses.
Supply chain disruptions continued throughout the quarter, most notably in chemicals, semiconductors, labor and transportation, constraining volume growth.
While we are seeing incremental improvements in many of these areas, they continue to create volatility in both supply and in cost.
Given the significant pandemic-related impact to last year's second quarter results, my comments will compare our segment and business unit results to second quarter 2019, which provides a more meaningful insight to our quarterly operating performance.
Sales in our Bedding Products segment were up 7% versus the second quarter of 2019, primarily from raw material related selling price increases from inflation in steel, chemicals and nonwoven fabrics.
Volume was down in part due to exited business in Fashion Bed and Drawn Wire.
Volume was also lower due to foam shortages and labor availability, which continue to constrain the U.S. mattress production, negatively impacting component demand and our finished goods production.
Availability of chemicals used in our specialty foam operation improved during the second quarter, but at a slower pace than anticipated, due to supplier production disruptions and logistics challenges.
While supply improved, chemical allocations could persist to some degree throughout the remainder of the year.
In U.S. Spring, our planned Comfort Core capacity expansion is largely in place, and we have built inventory of Comfort Core innersp...
...industry.
In the fourth quarter, we will also take our rod mill out of operation for three weeks to replace the reheat furnace.
As a result, higher levels of inventory in these businesses are expected through the remainder of the year.
The inventory build and sales will likely alter our normal seasonal cash flow cycle to some degree.
In the second quarter, cash from operations was $41 million.
Higher earnings were partially offset by planned working capital investments to build and maintain the higher inventory levels that Mitch just discussed as well as inflation in the cost of those inventories.
With the expectation of carrying higher levels of inventory through the end of the year, we have lowered our full year operating cash estimate.
We now anticipate cash flow from operations to approximate $450 million in 2021.
At the end of the quarter, adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales was 12.8%.
During the first half of the year, we brought back $187 million of offshore cash and currently expect to return at least $200 million of cash for the full year.
In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.42 per share.
At an annual indicated dividend of $1.68, the yield is 3.5% based upon Friday's closing price of $48.03, one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats.
This year marks our 50th consecutive year of annual increases.
We're proud of our dividend record, and we plan to extend it.
Our strong financial base, along with our deleveraging efforts over the last two years, give us flexibility when making capital and investment decisions.
We ended the quarter with net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA of 2.32 times and $1.3 billion of total liquidity.
Our long-term priorities for use of cash are unchanged.
They include, in order of priority: funding organic growth, paying dividends, funding strategic acquisitions and share repurchases with available cash.
For the full year 2021, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $140 million.
Dividends should approximate $215 million and acquisition spending of approximately $150 million.
We do not expect any significant share repurchases as we continue to focus on deleveraging.
As announced yesterday, we are again increasing our 2021 sales and earnings per share guidance.
2021 sales are now expected to be $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion or up 14% to 19% over 2020, resulting from mid- to high single-digit volume growth, raw material related price increases, currency benefit and approximately 1% growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures.
The increased versus prior guidance of $4.8 billion to $5 billion reflects a combination of higher raw material related price increases and acquisition sales.
We expect continued strong consumer demand for home-related products and global automotive along with some improvements in supply chain constraints as we move through the remainder of this year.
2021 earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.86 to $3.06, including $0.16 per share from the real estate gain recognized in the second quarter.
Full year adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be $2.70 to $2.90, with increase versus prior guidance of $2.55 to $2.75, primarily due to higher metal margin.
This guidance also assumes fixed cost savings as a result of actions taken in 2020 to be approximately $70 million.
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2021 full year adjusted EBIT margin range should be 11.4% to 11.6%.
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23%, depreciation and amortization to approximate $195 million, net interest expense of approximately $75 million, and fully diluted shares of 137 million.
In closing, we remain focused on cash generation, while reducing debt and deploying capital in a balanced and disciplined manner that positions us to capture near- and long-term growth opportunities, both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
Daryl, we're ready to start Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These reconciliations, together with additional supplemental information, are available at the Investor Relations section of our website, herbalife.com.
Additionally, when management makes reference to volumes during this conference call, they are referring to volume points.
Over the course of the global pandemic, we have delivered unprecedented business performance and growth.
Despite challenging comparisons in the third and fourth quarter, we remain on track for another record sales year.
The fundamental tailwinds driving the global nutrition industry, along with demand for our science-based nutrition products, continue to benefit the company.
In Q3, we reported worldwide net sales of $1.4 billion, a decline of 6% compared to the prior year period.
These results were in line with the updated guidance that we issued in September.
On a two year stack basis, net sales grew 15% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
For the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.09 per diluted share and net income of $117.4 million.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.21 was above the top end of our revised Q3 guidance.
Adjusted EBITDA of $222.4 million also exceeded the high end of our guidance range.
Uncertainty in global markets fueled by the ongoing pandemic and the Delta variant has presented challenges in predicting behavior in our channel.
As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we observed lower-than-expected activity rates during the month of August, which led to our revised Q3 and full year 2021 guidance.
The decrease in activity rates was primarily driven by fewer new distributors and preferred customers entering our channel.
This lower level of contribution from new entrants remained relatively consistent in the month of September and is reflected in our guidance for the remainder of the year.
For the quarter, the number of new distributors and preferred customers joining the business was down 19% compared to record numbers of new entrants in Q3 2020, but it was still up 28% compared to Q3 of 2019, excluding China.
Despite the slowdown in new entrants, we remain confident the foundation of our business is strong, and our long-term strategy is solid.
In Q3, the number of sales leaders actively selling in the channel was up 10% compared to the prior year period, excluding China.
Turning to our regional performance.
The Asia Pacific region had another quarter of double-digit net sales growth, up 11% compared to the prior year.
The region was led by continued strength in India, which grew 46%.
India set its fifth straight quarterly net sales record as well as a monthly net sales record in September.
Over 220,000 new preferred customers joined the business in India, a record number, and a reflection of the momentum that we are seeing in that market.
In Vietnam, government COVID restrictions forced our Nutrition Clubs to close for the quarter, which contributed to growth of 13%, which was lower than the growth rates we had recently experienced in that market.
Additionally, a third wave of COVID-19 throughout Indonesia resulted in community restrictions in all provinces, and impacted our nutrition club utilization, resulting in a sales decline of 10%.
Looking at North America.
We saw a decline in net sales of 11%.
This decline is up against an extraordinarily high prior year comparison period.
The two year stacked growth rate in the region increased 38% compared to Q3 of 2019.
We continue to see strength in our U.S. nutrition club business as many parts of the country returned to more in-person activities.
While we continue to closely monitor pandemic conditions, we kicked off a series of in-person distributor events in October, and are encouraged by the initial attendance and the excitement in the channel as we begin to once again meet face to face.
Similar to the North America region, EMEA experienced a challenging year-over-year comparison, resulting in a 4% decline.
However, in the region, we have seen a 16% year-...
...ts compared to the prior year period.
The decrease was largely driven by unfavorable country mix, primarily from China, representing a smaller portion of our overall company sales.
The decreases were largely offset by the impact of routine price increases.
Third quarter 2021 reported and adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales were 34% and 33.6%, respectively.
Excluding China member payments, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 27.6%, approximately 100 basis points unfavorable compared to the third quarter 2020.
Although this level of SG&A spend is still below our historical levels, it was an increase compared to the prior year where costs were significantly disrupted by the global pandemic.
For the third quarter, we reported net income of approximately $117.4 million or $1.09 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 was above the high end of our Q3 guidance, and was an increase of approximately 5% compared to the prior year period.
Currency was a benefit of $0.04 in the quarter versus the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA of $222 million also exceeded the high end of our guidance range.
Over the first nine months of the year, the company has generated over $409 million of net income and $740 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share and EBITDA figures continue to exclude items we consider to be outside of normal company operations and provide measures we believe will be useful to investors when analyzing period-over-period comparisons of our results.
This quarter, you will notice we have a new exclusion item for onetime expenses related to transformation initiatives.
Management has begun efforts to design and build to reorganize both front and back office operations.
We continue to assess scope, and will update investors in February.
We are reiterating our fiscal year 2021 guidance for the top and bottom line.
Across the guidance ranges, this implies annual records for net sales, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA.
Our fiscal year 2021 capex guidance has been updated to a range of $145 million to $175 million.
Currency remains a tailwind, and we project an approximate 200 basis points tailwind due to currency for the full year compared to the expected 220 basis points benefit from a quarter ago.
For the full year, our guidance includes a projected currency tailwind of approximately $0.11 per diluted share, which is $0.04 lower than the currency benefit included in our prior guidance.
As John referenced, we are expecting to provide guidance for 2022 on next quarter's earnings call.
We will also be monitoring potential inflationary impacts on our business.
Like many other companies, we have started to observe higher-than-usual cost increases in our supply chain with respect to raw materials, shipping costs and labor at our manufacturing facilities.
Now we will turn to our cash position, capital structure and our share repurchase activity.
Through the first nine months of the year, we have generated approximately $375 million of operating cash flow.
During the third quarter, our cash flow was negatively impacted by timing on several working capital accounts.
Given this unfavorable timing, we no longer anticipate operating cash flow to be higher in 2021 than 2020.
However, we expect these items to net out in 2022, and results in a relatively more favorable cash flow environment next year.
At the end of the quarter, we had $678 million of cash on hand.
During the third quarter, we completed approximately $162 million in share repurchases.
Given the level of our share price, we were able to opportunistically accelerate our repurchases ahead of our initial expectation of $100 million for the quarter.
Our fully diluted share count as of the end of Q3 was approximately $105.3 million.
We expect to complete approximately $100 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter, which will result in just under $1 billion of share repurchases for the full year 2021.

Actual results may differ materially from our projections.
As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note, results were ahead of expectations, and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021.
During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong, and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared to prior year.
And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equaled the prior third quarter with particularly strong renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4.
Average physical occupancy also remained strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from the performance in Q3.
We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for continued outperformance into the coming spring and summer leasing season.
Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamental across the Sun Belt over the next three years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022.
I believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly strong position as we head into the recovery part of the cycle.
First, we expect that our Sun Belt markets will continue to capture job growth, migration trends and demand for apartment housing that will be well ahead of national trends.
While there were clearly favorable Sun Belt migration trends by both employers and households prior to COVID, this past year the trends accelerated.
The primary reasons behind these favorable migration trends, including enhanced affordability, favorable business climates and lower taxes will still be with us well past the point we get the pressures associated with COVID behind us.
Secondly, the efforts we have under way this past year implementing change to a number of our processes involving new technology and web-based tools will continue to drive more opportunity for margin expansion.
Specifically, steps taken to automate aspects of both our leasing and maintenance service operations will drive more efficiency with personnel cost.
We expect to begin harvesting some of those early benefits later this year.
Our redevelopment operation aimed at upgrading and repositioning many of our existing properties continues to capture very attractive rent growth and returns on capital.
These higher levels of -- the higher levels of new apartment supply introduced into a number of markets over the past year will actually expand this redevelopment opportunity for us over the next couple of years.
Our external growth pipeline executed through in-house development, prepurchase of joint venture development projects and the acquisition of existing properties will continue to expand over the next year.
Finally, and importantly, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position with ample capacity to support both our redevelopment and our new growth initiatives.
Calendar year 2020 was certainly not the year we expected, but MAA's full cycle strategy with a uniquely diversified portfolio across the Sun Belt supported by a strong operating platform and balance sheet position the company to hold up well.
Our strategy is working and our platform capabilities are strong.
However, it's your intensity and passion for serving those who depend on our company that enables us to truly excel.
The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through the fourth quarter.
Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%.
This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter.
In addition to the improvement in occupancy, we were able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter, in line with the third quarter and an 80 basis point increase.
All in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis im...
...ers of continued same-store revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is 1.8% and for the full year, which is 2.5%.
As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk internet program, which is included in utilities expenses.
And though some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating expenses to begin moderating this year, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape.
We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth quarter, but we continue to fund the development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs.
As Brad mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to eight deals with total projected costs of $595 million.
During the quarter, we funded $104 million of development costs, leaving less than half or another $259 million remaining to be funded toward the completion of the current pipeline.
Though still growing, our pipeline is still is only about 3% of our enterprise value, which is a modest risk, given the overall strength of our balance sheet and a diversified portfolio strategy.
As Tom mentioned, we also made good progress toward the -- during the quarter on our internal programs, funding a total of $40 million toward the interior unit redevelopments, Smart Home installations and external amenity upgrades, bringing our full year funding for lease programs to $76 million, which is expected to begin contributing to our growth more strongly late in 2021 and 2022.
We ended the year with low leverage, debt-to-EBITDA of only 4.8 times and with $850 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our line of credit.
Finally, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2021 with our release, which is detailed in our supplemental information package.
Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $6.30 to $6.60 per share, which is $6.45 at the midpoint.
The primary driver of earnings performance is same-store revenue growth, which is projected to be around 2% for the year.
This growth is based on the expectation of continued improving economic trends and job growth in our markets, as Tom outlined, and we believe these trends will support both stable occupancy levels, averaging around 95.5% for the year.
And modestly improving pricing trends through the year, driving effective rent growth for the year of around 1.7%.
An additional contribution of 30 to 40 basis points of projected revenue growth for the year is related to the final portion of our Double Play bulk internet program.
We do expect the first quarter to be our lowest revenue growth for the year as it will bear the full impact of 2020's pricing performance growing from there as the -- head from there as improving leasing trends take full effect.
Same-store operating expense growth is projected to moderate some as compared to 2020, will continue to be impacted by the rollout of Double Play and higher insurance costs with these costs combining for an estimated 1.4% of the same-store expense growth in 2021.
But excluding Double Play and insurance, all other same-store expenses are expected to increase in a more modest 2.5% to 3% range for the full year.
And this includes real estate tax growth of 3.75% at the midpoint, which is moderating, but still somewhat elevated.
Overhead costs for 2021 are projected to be more normalized, with total overhead expenses expected to be about $107 million for the year, which is a 2.8% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance for 2020.
Our forecast also assumes development funding of $250 million to $350 million for the year, primarily provided by projected asset sales of $200 million to $250 million.
And given our current forecast, we have no current plans to raise additional equity, and we expect to end the year with our debt-to-EBITDA just below 5 times.
So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is Michael Haack.
Let me start my comments today by stating that this was another very good quarter for Eagle Materials.
From a market perspective, we are well-positioned U.S. Heartland cementitious materials producer, and we are a national scale U.S. Gypsum Wallboard producer.
From the people perspective, we have a talented team that understands their markets and make great decisions.
Simply put, this is a very good time to be in each of our businesses.
This is not just due to current conditions, but because the outlook for both businesses looks favorable.
I'll spend some time today on the macro backdrop as it provides some context to our favorable outlook.
COVID vaccination hesitancy, lingering supply chain issues and federal budget uncertainties and have weighed on economic momentum.
Offsetting these issues are job growth and consumer spending.
In 2021, we are seeing some of the strongest job creation in U.S. history and strong consumer spending growth.
Supply side headwinds are likely to pose less of a challenge in 2022, allowing for healthy industrial production growth as a monumental backlog of orders are gradually cleared.
Housing construction, which is an important driver for both of our businesses, and especially for Wallboard, continues to enjoy strong demand.
With healthy household balance sheets, low interest rates and relative affordability by historical standards, we see good headroom for continued trend growth.
In this regard, it should be noted that housing activity is especially strong in the Southern U.S.
This is important for Eagle as this is where most of our plants reside, and this region represents more housing starts than all other regions in the U.S. combined over this past year.
There is a positive knock-on effect from robust housing demand for repair and remodeling, which we expect will continue to grow at a mid- to high single-digit pace through 2022.
In Cement, the key wildcard remains infrastructure spend.
Most of the funding today comes from the states.
The states in our footprint generally have healthy balance sheets, driven by increased receipts from property and sales taxes.
The national discussion has focused on federal infrastructure spend.
Federal infrastructure funding will happen someday and is certainly necessary.
When it does happen, it will intensify the supply demand dynamics of Cement.
Commercial construction activity looks promising for pickup.
And again, regional strength in leading indicators favor the Midwest in the South, aligned with our U.S. Heartland footprint.
It is also worth noting that the U.S. shift toward renewables is very constructive for Eagle.
Wind farm construction is concrete intensive.
If you look at the map of planned wind projects and advanced development for projects under construction, it aligns well with our Cement plants.
Cement imports will be increasingly required this cycle to meet demand as strong market conditions are leading to very high effective rates of capacity utilization in domestic plants.
These imports will come at a cost in both our higher intensity carbon footprint and in price as the Baltic Dry Index is up 135% from a year ago and is at a 10-year high.
Now let me speak to volume, pricing and cost trends for each of our two businesses.
First, let's discuss volume.
Fortunately, we still have some capacity headroom in Wallboard.
However, the recent supply chain disruptions experienced by homebuilders is no doubt delaying the construction of some homes and pushing the demand up to the right.
Once these log jams clear, we expect to be even busier.
Our high cement utilization has been well chronicled.
We are virtually sold out and operating full tilt.
We are working closely with customers to meet their needs.
As demand increases, there are limits to how much more volume growth we can squeeze out of our cement system, unless, of course, we could expand our system through acquisitions.
Quality U.S. cement plants that meet our strategic criteria...
... albeit on a lag of one to two quarters.
Outbound freight in Wallboard is also important, and we saw a 14% increase in freight costs this quarter.
However, the good news is that freight costs seem to have plateaued during the summer.
Let me close my remarks with an update we are proud to share as it aligns with our environmental and social disclosure report we published on our website.
It is a recent noteworthy development on one of our long-term initiatives that has to do with carbon capture.
We were notified on October seven that Chart Industries, a technology development leader in this area, has received a significant funding award from the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct an engineering scale test to advance point source carbon capture, with a specific mandate to conduct this research at our Sugar Creek cement plant.
Chart Industries' cyrogenic carbon capture technology was recognized by researchers at MIT and Exxon as the most cost competitive among highly effective carbon capture systems.
Our role in this endeavor is to provide technical support and operational data during the development and execution of the project.
I want to emphasize that even with successful outcome, there are many other dates and hurdles to ultimate adoption, including transport and storage.
But this is an important and significant step on the path to net carbon zero future.
Second quarter revenue was a record $510 million, an increase of 14% from the prior year.
The increase reflects higher sales prices and sales volume across each business unit.
Second quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.46, a 14% increase from the prior year.
And adjusting for our refinancing actions during the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $2.73, a 26% improvement.
Turning now to our segment performance.
This next slide shows the results in our Heavy Materials sector, which includes our Cement and Concrete and Aggregate segments.
Revenue in the sector increased 5%, driven by the increase in cement sales prices and sales volume.
The price increases range from $6 to $8 per ton and were effective in most markets in early April.
Operating earnings increased 13%, reflecting higher cement prices and sales volumes as well as reduced maintenance costs.
Consistent with the comments we made in the first quarter, and because we shifted all of our planned cement maintenance outages to the first quarter, our second quarter maintenance costs were about $4 million less than what they were in the prior year.
Moving to the Light Materials sector on the next slide.
Revenue in our Light Materials sector increased 28%, reflecting higher Wallboard sales volume prices.
Operating earnings in the sector increased 39% to $67 million, reflecting higher net sales prices, which helped offset higher input costs, mainly recycled fiber costs and energy.
Looking now at our cash flow, which remains strong.
During the first six months of the year, operating cash flow was $262 million, a 27% year-on-year decrease reflects the receipt of our IRS refund and other tax benefits in the prior year.
Capital spending declined to $27 million.
And as Michael mentioned, we restarted our share repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividend this year and returned $259 million to shareholders during the first half of the year.
We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares or 4% of our outstanding.
At the end of the quarter, 5.6 million shares were available for repurchase under the current authorization.
Finally, a look at our capital structure.
Eagle maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile.
During this quarter, we completed the refinancing of our capital structure, which included issuing $750 million of 10-year senior notes with an interest rate of 2.5%.
We extended our bank credit facility five years, paid off our bank term loan and retired our 2026 senior notes.
We'll now move to the question-and-answer session.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle.
We do ask that you initially limit yourselves to two questions.
Of course, if you have more beyond that, please feel free to jump back in the queue.
Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic.
As you know, on May 3, we are hosting an Investor Day virtually and hope you can join us.
We will share our key strategies and introduce you to the executive leadership team that will drive our growth in the coming years.
Looking at Q1, a number of historic metrics played through.
Customer demand for self-storage has remained elevated.
We continue to see consistent customer behavior across all markets with increased move-in rates, extended customer length of stay and more latitude to resume traditional rate increases to existing customers.
The band has been tied to both historic drivers coupled with a longer lasting impacts from more consumers needing storage.
This includes work from home, study from home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets.
With the economy improving and additional government stimulus, consumer balance sheets are healthy and our customers' payment patterns remained strong.
Both same-store and non-same-store assets are performing well, with lease-ups particularly in non-same-store assets outpacing our projections as NOI grew by 46%.
To investments, 2021 is shaping up to be a robust year of acquisition activity.
With the addition of the recently announced ezStorage portfolio, our year-to-date 2020 acquisition activity either closed or under contract is $2.5 billion.
Of note, since 2019, we have acquired, developed and redeveloped approximately 22 million square feet and have expanded our portfolio by 13% having invested $4.3 billion.
In regard to the ezStorage acquisition, I would like to mention a few highlights of this significant transaction and how it matched four specific areas tied to our unique capabilities.
First, the integration of the assets into the Public Storage brand and operating platform will be seamless as we already had a broad presence in these markets with 115 assets.
We now enjoy even stronger presence with now 163 assets with unmatched brand presence across the Mid-Atlantic region.
Second, eight of the ezStorage assets are poised for expansion along with one that has begun ground-up development.
The Public Storage development team has taken lead on these opportunities and is ready to execute on each one of them, allowing us to expand the portfolio by approximately 10% over the next 24 months.
As you know, Public Storage has the only development team among the self-storage REITs and is well poised to unlock more value from this portfolio by virtue of our unique development capabilities.
Third, our ability to fund a large acquisition and close in a very short timeline, in this case six weeks from selection to close, was due to our efficient and prime capital structure.
This transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and NOI.
And fourth, our well-earned reputation of being a buyer of choice in the investment community.
Looking to fall 2021, we are encouraged by core customer demand, our well located portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality and dedication of the 5,000 plus team members at Public Storage, all of whom are committed to enhancing the leading brand in the self-storage industry.
With that, let me hand the call over to Tom.
I'll start with financial performance.
Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021.
In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 2.6% from the fourth quarter.
There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement.
First and foremost, move-in rates were up double-digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year leading to improving in-place rents.
Secondly, occupancy also increased through the quarter with move-in volume down, but move-out volume also lower.
Now on to expenses.
The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the first quarter.
Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes.
Of property tax, specifically, we will expense our estimate ratably through the year leading to a benefit in the first three quarters and reversing to a headwind in the fourth quarter.
This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter property tax in the future.
The benefit this quarter was worth $0.05 of FFO.
Some of the technology and operating model evolution we'll discuss on Monday at our Investor Day showed up in our first quarter numbers with property payroll down 13% in the quarter given efficiency improvements.
We look forward to sharing more on Monday.
In conjunction with the line by line commentary in our supplemental, it's a guide to our outlook and the key drivers of our business.
And as we started 2021, we've seen continued strength, as Joe mentioned, in customer demand with occupancy is up 260 basis points and in-place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January.
We anticipate same-store revenue to grow from 4% to 5.5% in 2021.
That outlook is supported by good customer demand and moderating supply.
That said, we do see risk to move-outs going higher as we move through the year comping against what was really extraordinary existing tenant performance in 2020.
Our current expectations are for occupancy to be down 100 basis points plus in the fourth quarter compared to 2020.
We expect continued strong expense control in the same-store in 2021.
Our expectations are for 1% to 2% same-store expense growth.
Property tax expense growth will pick up this year with our expectations around a 5% increase for the year, again recognized ratably through the year.
Our guidance includes the acceleration of our external growth initiatives with ezStorage and will add to FFO growth through our non-same-store portfolio this year and next.
In total, our outlook is for core FFO per share of $11.35 to $11.75 for 2021.
I'll now shift gears to the balance sheet.
As Joe mentioned, we used our growth-oriented balance sheet to fund the purchase of ezStorage, entering the bond market the day after announcement and having fully funded the transaction within two days.
The offering comprised of three, seven and 10 year tranches with the weighted average cost of about 1.6%.
After effect of the transaction, we have the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with one of the lowest cost profiles.
And we remain in a great position to continue to use the balance sheet to fund our growth initiatives, and we'll share more at our Investor Day on Monday.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.
In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures.
We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.
You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials.
Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.
With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of Fixed Income and Data Services.
I'll begin on slide four with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results.
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history.
Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and, on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%.
Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which, after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park, recently began trading on the NYSE.
Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while operating -- or while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million.
Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt stub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021.
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion.
These strong cash flows, along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase, has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25 times at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule.
As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter.
We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year.
In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR709 million or approximately $820 million.
We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022.
Now let's move to slide five, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.
Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year.
This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products.
Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex.
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our listings business.
This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 mill...
... positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity.
Within data and analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process.
This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.
Today, only a fraction of Mortgage Technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity.
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides, combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers, generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity.
The third quarter extends our track record of growth.
We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments, across asset classes and amid a dynamic macro environment.
These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events but also longer-term, secular growth trends.
We've expanded into new asset classes, grown our addressable markets and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses.
We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology called the ICE rate lock indices.
Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technology's leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates.
Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders.
The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business.
By taking alternative datasets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insights into the market.
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes.
As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs.
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments.
And part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses.
This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing.
These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth.
It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future.

 As many of you know, we pre-released limited results for the first quarter, ahead of our investor day hosted here in Dallas on October 20.
During our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.
And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.
It's good to be back with you all again.
It was great seeing some of you in Dallas and many of you virtually during our investor day a couple of weeks ago.
What you should have taken away from that was this, we're very optimistic about where the business is going.
We're managing for long-term success and we're confident in the strength of our brands and the levers we have yet to pull to continue to grow the business.
From a top-line perspective, we're sitting in a good spot.
Sales numbers are solid and traffic numbers are extremely good.
Our near-term challenge is not creating demand but rather it's working through the latest pandemic-driven staffing and supply chain issues that are impacting our cost structure.
As you know, there are -- these are the same challenges impacting the industry as well as much as the economy.
But after 40 years in this business, I'll take managing costs over searching for sales and traffic any day.
Those are good problems to solve because they're largely within our control.
Our operators are working extremely hard every day to train our new team members, deliver great guest experiences and tying up the middle of the P&L.
We've taken some additional price during the quarter to help offset our structural labor and cost of sales increases.
As I mentioned during investor day, we're not going to price to buy a quarter.
But as we closely monitor the issues, we've layered in incremental pricing to offset what we believe are the structural labor and cost of sales increases.
And Joe will give you more detail on that.
Moving forward, if we discover that what we thought was transitory, it turns out to be more structural, we'll deal with that from a pricing perspective with a disciplined approach that protects our traffic performance and keeps our brands strong.
We know we have pricing power if we need it, particularly in the delivery in virtual brand channels and we're committed to maintaining our margins and our business model.
And that's what we wanted you to hear.
We're also working hard to remove transitory costs from the system with full recognition that the headwinds are notable and persistent, especially around labor.
And while it takes some time, we're confident with the progress we're making and we will significantly reduce these costs by the back half of the year.
The spike in turnover we experienced during the quarter created short-term pressure on the business as we trained our new team members to run our systems.
The good news is we are quickly building staff and have as many team members now as we did pre-COVID, though there are markets that are still not fully staffed, which is limiting their capacity.
This is particularly true in the Midwest, where it's taking longer to reach these optimum levels.
The impact of these staffing challenges cost us 3% to 4% in first quarter in sales, which we view as upside as we -- as we get those restaurants staffed and trained over the coming months.
Our top talent is engaged in these markets to solve these issues as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, the base business is strong, especially where dining rooms are fully open.
When we look at the totality of the business, Chili's is running positive sales and traffic and maintaining a sizable traffic gap to the industry, most recently at 9% on a two-year look as measured by NAFTrack.
And we've got sales leverage around virtual brands and deliveries that we're holding in reserve until our operations teams are stabilized and fully trained.
And while the last quarter was more chal...
...ter, a 9% beat versus the industry on a two year look.
The top-line increase resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, up from $0.28 in the previous fiscal year.
It will come as no surprise, our most significant challenge during the quarter came in the form of industrywide headwinds from both commodity costs and labor-related spend, which negatively impacted our margins and bottom-line flow through.
We experienced commodity inflation in the mid-single-digit range, with significant price from pork and chicken driving the increase.
As Wyman mentioned, with a greater-than-normal influx of new team members, we experienced outsized costs in training and overtime.
We do consider the portion of these costs above our normal operating levels to be transitory, approximately 130 basis points in the quarter, 60 of which are incremental training and overtime costs.
I Anticipate these costs working their way out of the system over the course of the next couple of quarters.
In the near term, I expect a significant portion of these transitory costs to remain in the system for the second quarter.
We are taking thoughtful incremental price increases to help offset these higher costs.
Our third price action of this fiscal year is scheduled with our next Chili's menu update in two weeks.
Following this increase, Chili's will be carrying a total of 3% of incremental price compared to last year.
Of course, the mid-quarter price action will not fully impact the total price reported for the quarter.
Due to the timing of price actions and the fact that Maggiano's will evaluate its menu pricing after the holiday season, we expect the second quarter blended Brinker price to be closer to 2%.
Our cash flow for the first quarter remained strong, with cash from operating activities of $40 million and EBITDA of $69 million.
When compared to first quarter last year, our strength in operating performance and lower level of outstanding debt have combined to improve our balance sheet and leverage position.
Our total funded debt leverage was 2.6 times and our lease-adjusted leverage ended the quarter at 3.7 times.
As indicated during our recent investor day, we are targeting to move these leverage ratios below two times and three times respectively over the course of the next two years.
Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal year '22.
We provided some guidance metrics for certain items during our last call and we are reiterating those levels as of this report.
Specifically, annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and annual adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80.
This incorporates our current view of the casual dining operating environment, which assumes continuing challenges in the near term, especially related to supply chain and labor issues.
This guidance, both reiterated and new, assumes no additional meaningful top-line COVID-related disruptions.
While guidance is for our fiscal year performance, I can provide some directional thoughts related to the second quarter.
With the exception of banquet sales at Maggiano's, we expect sales to exhibit closer to normal holiday seasonality, although impacted by labor shortage constraints in certain markets.
As mentioned earlier in my comments, restaurant operating margins for the second quarter will again be impacted by higher food and beverage and labor costs.
We do expect restaurant operating margin to improve when compared to both the recently completed first quarter as well as the second quarter of last year, ending the quarter at a level comparable to the pre-COVID second quarter of fiscal year '20.
Clearly, these are unique times for our industry, creating a variety of short-term challenges to work through.
Challenges we can and will solve.
We firmly believe our strategic initiatives focused on driving traffic in organic top-line growth will differentiate our performance over time with the overall benefit to our team members, our guests, and importantly, our shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined today by Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer.
Let's begin on Slide 4 with a brief summary of our financial results for our fiscal second quarter, which ended on October 31.
Methode's second quarter sales increased 17% to nearly $301 million.
Our net income increased 62%, and our diluted earnings per share increased 60%.
Ron will provide more detail on financial results a bit later.
Turning to the business highlights on Slide 5.
The $301 million in net sales, as well as our $45 million in income from operations, were both records for Methode.
The resulting operating income margin was 15%.
These record results -- these record results are validation of our strategy and the product of the relentless efforts and commitment of our global team.
In the quarter, we saw significant rebound in automotive demand as compared to the first quarter, which has been impacted by the pandemic and created uncertainty in OEM production schedules.
The Automotive segment sales for the quarter were also a record at $216 million.
It was another strong quarter for our EV businesses, as well.
Sales for EV applications were over 9% of our total consolidated sales.
We also saw continued strength for EV bookings during the quarter with the annual expected sales from those awards totaling over $28 million.
As many of you know, much of Methode's historical growth came from our user interface products.
With our move into vehicle LED lighting and with our long-standing reputation and capabilities in power distribution, in conjunction with user interface, Methode is uniquely qualified as a three-pronged solution provider for electric vehicles.
We are globally well positioned and anticipate continued growth in this market.
Regarding our balance sheet, we continued to generate strong free cash flow and reduced our net debt in the quarter.
We have ample liquidity and our net leverage ratio continues to be low.
The strength and flexibility to our balance sheet allows us to consider multiple paths to invest in the business in order to drive growth and shareholder return.
On COVID-19, I continue to take pride in our employees' incredible commitment to Methode and supporting our efforts to provide a safe work environment.
All of our facilities are currently open and we are making prudent use of work-from-home where possible.
We do anticipate seeing some level of uncertainty from COVID-19 throughout the remaining fiscal year.
However, as I stressed since the beginning of this pandemic, we will continue to invest in our businesses for long-term growth.
Moving to Slide 6.
During the second quarter, Methode booked a number of awards capitalizing on the strategic trends in vehicle electrification, LED lighting and data centers.
The awards identified here represent a cross-section of the business wins in the quarter and represent over $40 million in the annual business.
In vehicle electrification, we won awards for ambient and functional lighting, overhead console and busbar programs totaling over $28 million annually.
As I highlighted last quarter, we continued to win programs with OEMs in the US, Europe and Asia.
EV is a global growth driver for Methode.
In non-EV LED lighting, we were awarded programs for several auto applications.
We also continued to participate in the growth of the data centers driven by cloud computing with programs for busbars and pluggable modules.
Lastly, we experienced a bounce in aerospace with defense program award.
Of note, in the first half of the fiscal year, Methode booked awards approximately $100 million in annual sales.
Looking forward, we are providing sales and earnings per share guidance for only the fiscal 2021 third quarter due to the market risk and uncertainty from the ongoing pandemic.
Turning to Slide 7.
We recently presented at an investor conference, and I would like to share our key messaging from it.
Our strategic focus is on diversification, growth and financial improvement.
Given the progress that we've made...
...ake additional actions in the future based on conditions as required.
Net income was $38.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal '21 as opposed to $23.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '20.
The main drivers between the fiscal periods were higher sales, receipt of $3.3 million of foreign government assistance due to COVID, lower selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher restructuring costs.
Shifting to EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.
Fiscal '21 second quarter EBITDA was $60.2 million versus $43.6 million in the same period last year.
EBITDA was positively impacted by increased sales, foreign governmental COVID assistance and the benefit from restructuring actions taken in prior fiscal years.
A few other financial items to review.
In the second quarter of fiscal '21, we invested approximately $3.6 million in capex as compared to $13.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal '20.
The fiscal '21 year-to-date second quarter investment represents an approximately $30 million run rate for the current fiscal year.
The lower second quarter capex was simply due to timing as opposed to a conscious effort to curtail capex.
We have a strong balance sheet and intend to utilize it during this COVID-impacted fiscal year to make continued investments in our businesses to grow them organically in the future.
In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for inorganic growth.
Our intent is to emerge from the COVID pandemic stronger than we went into this crisis by judiciously using our strong balance sheet to our long-term advantage.
Income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $7.6 million as compared to a tax expense of $5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '20.
The fiscal '21 second quarter tax rate was 16.5% as compared to 17.9% in the same period last fiscal year.
This relatively minor difference in effective tax rate was due to jurisdictional earnings and not discrete income tax activity.
We deleveraged gross debt by $2.2 million in the second quarter.
Since our acquisition of Grakon in September of 2018, when adjusting for the $100 million precautionary credit facility draw in March of 2020, we have reduced gross debt by $110 million.
Net debt decreased by $29.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the fiscal '20 year-end from $134.8 million, to $105.3 million.
We ended the second quarter with $242.3 million in cash, which includes the $100 million precautionary draw on the credit facility in March.
In November, we repaid $50 million of the March precautionary draw, and we'll continue to evaluate the landscape in the third quarter and may pay down the precautionary draw even further.
Our debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio, which is used for our bank covenants, is approximately 1.7.
This figure includes the impact of the precautionary $100 million draw we initiated in March.
Without the draw, the ratio would have been approximately 1.2.
Our net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio was a strong 0.5.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, which effective in fiscal '21 is defined as cash provided from operating activities minus capex.
Prior to fiscal '21, it was defined as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capex.
For the fiscal '21 second quarter, free cash flow was $36.7 million as compared to $35.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '20.
As Don mentioned in his remarks, we are providing revenue and earnings per share guidance for the third quarter, which is subject to disruption at any time due to a variety of factors including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation.
Please note that the third quarter of fiscal '21 contains 13 work weeks, whereas the third quarter of fiscal '20 had 14 work weeks.
The revenue range for the third quarter is between $265 million and $285 million.
Diluted earnings per share range is between $0.69 and $0.85 per share.
Don, that concludes my comments.
Operator, we are ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Also on the call are Brian McDade, chief financial officer; and Adam Reuille, chief accounting officer.
Please note, our 8-K filing is still in process with the SEC.
However, it has not yet been accepted to it.
Now, for those of you who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate.
I'm pleased to report our business is solid and improving.
Demand for our space and our well-located properties is increasing.
I'll turn to some highlights.
Our profitability and cash flow have significantly increased.
Second-quarter funds from operations were $1.22 billion or $3.24 per share.
Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter.
Our international operations continue to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions, which cost us roughly $0.06 per share for this quarter compared to our expectations due to the equivalent of a two-and-a-half month of closures.
We generated over $1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, which was $125 million more than the first quarter.
And additionally, compared to the second quarter of last year, our cash flow from operations was breakeven due to the lockdown.
Domestic-international property NOI combined increased 16.6% year over year for the quarter and 2.8% for the first half of the year.
Remember, the first quarter of 2020 was relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These growth rates do not include any contribution from the Taubman portfolio or lease settlement income.
Malls and outlets occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 91.8%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the first quarter.
We continue to see demand for space across our portfolio from healthy local, regional and national tenants, entrepreneurs, restaurateurs and mixed-use demand ever so increasing day by day.
Our team is active in signing leases with new and exciting tenants.
Average base minimum rent was $50.03.
Our average base rent was impacted by the initial lower base rents we agreed to in addressing certain tenant COVID negotiations in exchange for lower sales breakpoints.
The variable rents that were recognized in the first half of the year were included.
It would add approximately $5 per foot to our average base minimum rent.
Leasing spreads declined again due to mix of deals that are now included, as well as the activity that had fallen out of the spread given its rolling 12-month nature and metric.
New leasing activity that has affected the spread include large footprint entertainment, fitness and large-scale retailers, big boxes.
Big box deals reduced our opening rate as they're all included in our spread metric.
As a reminder, the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for percentage rent-based income based on sales, as I mentioned just recently.
Leasing activity accelerated in the quarter.
We signed nearly 1,400 leases for approximately 5.2 million square feet and had a significant number of leases in our pipeline.
Through the first six months, we signed 2,500 leases for over 900 -- I'm sorry, 9.5 million square feet.
Our team executed leases for 3 million more square feet or over approximately 800 more deals compared to the first six months this year, as well as -- I'm sorry, compared to the first six months of 2019.
We have completed nearly 90% of our expiring leases for 2021.
We recently had deal committee, and what I'm told by my leasing folks is that that was the most active deal committee that they've had in several years.
Now, retail sales continued to increase.
Total sales for the month of June were equal to June 2019 and up 80% compared to last year and were approximately 5% higher than May sales.
If you exclude two well-known tenants, our mall sales were up 8% more than compared to June of 2019.
Multiple regions in the US recorded ...
...ment.
We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, and we started construction in the Western Paris suburb for a third outlet in France.
The end of the quarter, new development/redevelopment was underway across all our platforms for our share of $850 million.
Our retail investments posted exceptional results.
All of our global brands within SPARC Group outperformed their budget in the quarter on sales, gross margin and EBITDA, led by Forever 21 and Aeropostale.
SPARC's newest brand, Eddie Bauer, also outperformed our initial expectations.
We're also very pleased with JCPenney results.
They continue to outperform their plan.
Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.4 billion, and they do not have any outstanding balance on their line of credit.
Penny will launch several private national brands later this year, as well as their new beauty initiative.
Taubman Realty Group is operating their 2021 budget at a level above that and above our underwriting.
And their portfolio, our portfolio shows resilience as sales are quickly returning to pre-pandemic levels.
Year to date through June, retail sales are 13% higher than the first half of 2019.
As you would expect, we've been very active in the capital markets.
We refinanced 13 mortgages in the first half of the year for a total of $2.2 billion in total, our share of which is $1.3 billion at an average interest rate of 2.9%.
Our liquidity is more than $8.8 billion, consisting of $6.9 billion available on our credit facility and $1.9 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash.
And again, our liquidity is net of $500 million of US commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end.
We paid $1.40 per share of dividend in cash on July 23 for the second quarter.
That was a 7.7% increase sequentially and year over year.
Today, we announced our third-quarter dividend of $1.50 per share in cash, which is an increase of 7.1% sequentially and 15.4%, 15.4% year over year.
The dividend is payable September 30.
You will know that going forward, we are returning to our historical cadence of declaring dividends as we announce our quarterly earnings.
Given our results for the first half of the year, as well as our view for the remainder of 2021, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance range from $9.70 to $9.80 per share to $10.70 to $10.80 per share.
This is an increase of $1 per share at the midpoint, and the range represents approximately 17% to 19% growth compared to 2020 results.
Before we open it up to Q&A, I wanted to provide some additional perspective.
First, we expect to generate approximately $4 billion in FFO this year.
That will be approximately 25% increase compared to last year and just 5% below our 2019 number.
To be just 5% below 2019, given all that we've endured over the last 15, 16 months, including significant restrictive governmental orders that forced us to shut down unlike many other establishments is a testament to our portfolio and a real testament to the Simon team and people.
Second, we expect to distribute more than $2 billion in dividends this year.
Keep in mind, we did not suspend our dividend at any point during the pandemic.
And in fact, we have now increased our dividend twice already this year.
Now, just a point on valuation.
And I tend to never really talk about it, but I thought it was appropriate today.
Our valuation continues to be well below our historical averages when it comes to multiple -- FFO multiples compared to other retail REITs, retailers and the S&P 500.
And our dividend yield is higher than the S&P 500 by more than 250 basis points, treasuries by 325 basis points and the REIT industry by 150 basis points.
And as I mentioned to you, our dividend is growing.
Our company has a diverse product offering that possesses many, many multiple drivers of earnings growth, accretive capital investment opportunities and the balance sheet to support our growth.
We are increasing our performance, profitability, cash flow and return to our shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 As always, we appreciate your interest.
Brent Wood, our CFO, is also participating on the call.
We hope everyone is enjoying their fall.
They continue performing at a high level and reaping the rewards of a very positive environment.
Our third quarter results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market.
Some of the results the team produced include, funds from operations coming in above guidance up 14% compared to third quarter last year and ahead of our forecast.
This marks 34 consecutive quarters of higher FFO per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend.
Our quarterly occupancy averaged 97.1%, up 50 basis points from third quarter 2020 and at quarter end, we're ahead of projections at 98.8% lease and 97.6% occupied.
Our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market with accelerating e-commerce and last mile delivery trends.
Quarterly releasing spreads were at record levels at 37.4% GAAP and 23.9% cash and year-to-date, those results are 31% GAAP and 18.5% cash.
Finally, cash same-store NOI rose 5.2% for the quarter and 5.6% year-to-date.
In summary, I'm proud of our team's results, putting up one of the best quarters in our history.
Today, we're responding to the strength in the market and demand for industrial product by both users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value-add investments.
I'm grateful we ended the quarter at 98.8% leased, our highest quarter on record and to demonstrate the market strength, our last four quarters marked the highest four quarterly rates in our company's history.
Looking at Houston, we're 96.7% leased.
It now represents 12% of rents, down 140 basis points from a year ago and is projected to continue shrinking.
As we've stated before, our development starts are pulled by market demand.
Based on the market strength we're seeing today, we're raising our forecasted starts to $340 million for 2021.
This represents an annual record level of starts for our company.
To position us for this market demand, we've acquired several new sites with more in our pipeline along with value-add and direct investments.
More details to follow as we close on each of these opportunities.
And Brent will now review a variety of financial topics, including our 2021 guidance.
Our third quarter results reflect the terrific execution of our team, strong overall performance of our portfolio and the continued success of our time-tested strategy.
FFO per share for the third quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.55 per share and compared to third quarter 2020 of $1.36 represented an increase of 14%.
The outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated, particularly occupancy and rental rate growth.
From a capital perspective, during the third quarter, we issued $49 million of equity at an average price over $176 per share.
In July, we repaid a maturing $40 million senior unsecured term loan.
And in September, we closed on the refinance of $100 million unsecured term loan that reduced the effective fixed interest rate from 2.75% to 2.1%, with five years of term remaining.
In our ongoing efforts to bolster our ESG efforts, we incorporated a sustainability-linked metric into the amended terms.
That activity combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet, kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility.
Our debt to total market capitalization was below 17%, debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 4.7 times and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased to over 8.5 times.
Our rent collections have been equally strong.
Bad debt for the first three quarters of the year is a net positive $346,000 because of tenants whose balance was previously reserved but brought current, exceeding new tenant reserves.
This trend continues to exemplify the stability, credit strength and diversity of our tenant base.
Looking forward, FFO guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.58 per share and $6.01 to $6.05 for the year, a $0.15 per share increase over our prior guidance.
The 2021 FFO per share midpoint represents a 12.1% increase over 2020.
Among the notable assumption changes that comprise our revised 2021 guidance include: increasing the cash same-property midpoint by 8% to 5.6%, decreasing reserves for uncollectible rent by $900,000, increasing projected development starts by 24% to $340 million and increasing equity and debt issuance by combined $95 million.
In summary, we were very pleased with our third quarter results.
We will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum through the year.
Now Marshall will make some final comments.
In closing, I'm excited about where we stand this far into 2021.
We're ahead of our initial forecast and adhering that momentum into 2022.
Our company, our team and our strategy are working well, as evidenced by the quarterly results.
And it's the future that makes me most excited for EastGroup.
Our strategy has worked well the past few years.
We're further seeing an acceleration and a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets.
Meanwhile, our bread and butter traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last-mile distribution space in fast-growing Sunbelt markets.
These, along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our markets has us optimistic about the future.

[/INST] # EastGroup's third quarter earnings exceeded expectations, with funds from operations (FFO) increasing by 14% to $1.55 per share. This growth was driven by strong occupancy rates, rising to 98.8%, and record-setting releasing spreads of 37.4% (GAAP) and 23.9% (cash). Cash same-store NOI increased by 5.2%, and the portfolio's exceptional performance led to a revised FFO guidance range of $6.01 to $6.05 for the year. The company's financial strength remains robust, with debt-to-total market capitalization below 17% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.7 times. To meet market demand, EastGroup has raised its forecasted development starts to $340 million for 2021, a record level for the company. The team is optimistic about the future, citing positive trends in e-commerce and last-mile delivery, as well as their well-located and high-quality portfolio.</s>"

At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's session will be posted for audio playback on our website.
These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31st, 2021, and other filings.
I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today.
To begin with, our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the war in Ukraine.
When I think about our team, along with their families, what comes to mind are words like admiration, courage, and heart.
Please know, we're in constant communication with those on the ground, and we continue to provide resources and financial assistance, as the safety and security of those in Ukraine is our top priority.
At Jabil, we're one corporate family with people located all over the world.
And despite the physical distance between us, we'll always face difficult situations together.
Q2 was another strong quarter, both top line and bottom line, driven by double-digit revenue growth year on year and exceptional execution, respectively.
Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.68 and revenue of $7.6 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase year on year.
All in all, I'm pleased with the quarter, as our performance during the first half of the year gives us positive momentum as we push toward the back half of fiscal '22 and into fiscal '23.
And when I think about a key catalyst driving our momentum, what comes to mind is the makeup of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide.
Slide 7 is a wonderful picture, which shows the construct of our portfolio today.
Jabil's large-scale diversification serves as a solid foundation from which we run our business.
The team has built this foundation over the past five to six years, as we target new end markets and optimize our legacy business.
The output of this effort is twofold: one, a higher level of resiliency across the company; and two, a substantial presence in secular end markets, markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.
If we dissect the pie chart a bit differently with an emphasis on financial contribution and economic relevance, we see a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows, again, a real tribute to the diversified nature of our business today.
Lastly, if we look at a third dimension of our portfolio, we find a library of essential capabilities, capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands.
And when done correctly, our unique set of capabilities offer Jabil a real competitive advantage, as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.
Moving on to Slide 8.
You'll see management's outlook for the year.
We've increased core earnings per share to $7.25, an increase of nearly 30% year on year.
As for revenue, FY '22 now looks to be in the range of $32.6 billion, up more than 10% year on year.
In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year, while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year on year.
For me, this is a positive testament on how the team is managing the business as our strategy has been consistent, and what needs to be done is well understood throughout our company.
With that, let's move to my final slide, where I'd like to start with the importance of our purpose.
At Jabil, with purpose comes expectations, expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe; servant leadership; protecting t...
...reverse in Q3.
In spite of these two factors impacting inventory, our second quarter cash flows from operations were very robust, coming in at $246 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $201 million.
From a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter at approximately 1.3 times and with cash balances of $1.1 billion.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $145 million.
And for the year, we've repurchased 4.4 million shares for $272 million, as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.
Turning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide.
DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 17% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.2 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4 billion.
We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $300 million to $360 million, representing a core margin range of 3.8% to 4.2%.
At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 20 basis points over the prior year and down sequentially, reflecting planned investments in our Q3 quarter.
It's also worth noting, sequentially in Q4, we expect robust core margins driven by our scaling automotive business, along with typical seasonality in our mobility and EMS businesses.
In Q3, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $276 million to $336 million.
Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.64.
The core tax rate in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 21%.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market.
Today, the outlook for our business is strong, with end markets across both segments continuing to benefit from multiyear secular trends.
We believe these markets will continue to drive our growth, as we concentrate our efforts on long-term secular growth markets with strong margin and cash flow dynamics, markets such as electric vehicles, personalized medicine, and healthcare, semi-cap, clean and smart energy infrastructure, cloud, 5G infrastructure, and the associated connected devices.
Our electric vehicle business, in particular, continues to outperform, in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates.
We've seen this rapid acceleration manifest in top-line revenue growth in excess of 50% this year alone in our automotive end market.
We're also expecting double-digit growth from the healthcare, automotive retail, industrial and semi-cap, and 5G wireless and cloud end markets.
And importantly, the broad-based growth associated with these secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin and free cash flow expansion.
All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year.
We're now anticipating core earnings per share will be in the neighborhood of $7.25 per share on revenue of approximately $32.6 billion.
Notably, this incremental revenue will improve mix and drive operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.6% for FY '22, as we continue to drive the organization to 5% and beyond.
Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating in excess of $700 million in free cash flow, in spite of the higher revenue and associated working capital.
We've been working extremely hard as a team to expand margins and drive strong cash flows.
I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.
Before we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind our participants that we cannot address customer-specific or product-specific questions.
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Participating on the call today are Aaron Ravenscroft, our president and chief executive officer; and David Antoniuk, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
However, actual results could differ materially from any implied or actual projections due to one or more of the factors, among others, described in the company's latest SEC filings.
During our last call, I outlined Manitowoc's three key priorities for managing through the COVID-19 pandemic, which are: one, manage the health and safety of our employees; two, strengthen our balance sheet; and three, position the company for long-term growth.
Orders for the quarter were $390 million and frankly, much stronger than we had anticipated.
This laid the groundwork for us to increase our factory production in certain facilities where we had an aggressive shutdown plan and allowed us to deliver on a strong quarter.
We generated $21 million of free cash flow during the quarter and ended the quarter with $101 million of cash on hand.
Our total liquidity of $397 million at the end of September positions us well for the cyclical nature of the Crane business and to execute on our strategic growth initiatives.
With that, I'll ask Dave to take us through the details of the financial results, and I'll close with some more color on the market outlook and our strategy.
Let's move to Slide 3.
Our third-quarter orders totaled $390 million, an increase of 10% compared to $353 million of orders last year.
The year-over-year increase was driven by improved crawler crane demand in the Americas segment, partly offset by declines in other product lines due to the continued effect of COVID-19 on our end markets.
In addition, we secured a couple of large mobile crane project orders in the MEAP segment, which contributed to the year-over-year increase.
Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our year-over-year orders by approximately $6 million.
The book-to-bill in the quarter was $1.1 million.
Our third-quarter ending backlog of $465 million was essentially flat over the prior year and up $35 million or 8% on a sequential basis.
Improved backlog in the MEAP and EURAF segments were fully offset by a decline in the Americas.
On a currency-neutral basis, backlog decreased 4% year over year.
Net sales in the third quarter of $356 million decreased $92 million or 21% from a year ago.
market for most mobile crane products during the first half of the year due to the impact from COVID-19, resulting in a lower shippable backlog entering the quarter.
Net sales were favorably impacted by approximately 2% from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our aftermarket revenue in the quarter declined slightly over the prior year.
Gross profit decreased $23 million year over year, mainly driven by the lower volume in the Americas.
Gross profit percentage decreased to 140 basis points to 18% from the same period in 2019, primarily due to the impact of lower production levels.
Third-quarter engineering, selling, and administrative expenses of $50 million decreased by approximately $5 million year over year.
The decrease was primarily due to lower employee-related costs, including short-term incentive compensation costs and reduced discretionary spending.
As a result, third-quarter adjusted EBITDA amounted to $25 million or 7% of net sales.
Our flow-through on the year-over-year sales decline was approximately 19%, reflecting excellent performance in managing our costs in this uncertain environment.
Restructuring costs in the quarter totaled $4 million and were mainly due to headcount reductions in the Americas.
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter was a loss of $0.01 per share versus income of $0.51 per share in the prior year.
On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was income of $0.10 compared to $0.54 in the comparable period.
The primary driver of the lower adjusted diluted earnings per share was the impact of reduced year-over-year sales vol...
...Please move to Slide 4.
The third quarter was a refreshing recovery from the steep decline that was experienced in the first half of the year, but we are not out of the woods yet.
The COVID pandemic continues to create uncertainty and industry confidence remains weak.
In the Americas, we still face headwinds, including COVID, presidential election dynamics, challenging oil prices, and elevated dealer inventory.
Demand for crawler cranes has been better.
However, when speaking to our customers and dealers, the consensus is that we won't see a broad recovery until mid-2021 at the earliest.
In Europe, we saw good orders during the third quarter, reflecting a bounce back after business grounded to a halt in the second quarter, although looking forward we are most concerned with this region.
The recent spike in COVID cases is weighing heavily on the general sentiment, even more so than in the United States as certain countries have implemented severe lockdowns.
And if you recall, the tower crane business in this region was already cycling down before COVID hit.
In MEAP, I would describe customer sentiment as mixed.
China and South Korea have been relatively strong for us in 2020, and we've landed a couple of nice sized projects in the Middle East.
That said, we have to see structural improvements in the Middle East economies that would give us confidence that a sustainable recovery is imminent.
Southeast Asia and India remain very slow.
Lastly, while Australia has been strong throughout the summer, we have seen some signs of a slowdown as the geopolitical situation with China evolves.
There is no question that we are operating in unprecedented times.
While we continue to manage the business closely during these challenging market conditions, we are also proactively taking actions to accelerate our growth when the market recovers.
Our investment in new product development remains on track, and we are developing new strategies to get closer to our customers to grow the business.
This slide breaks down the different revenue streams that are derived from a tower crane.
Historically, we've primarily focused on the sale of new cranes, which serves us well in markets where we have strong distributors and partners.
However, there are certain geographic territories such as Germany, where some of our partners don't have the balance sheet to take advantage of rental fleet of large top-slewing tower cranes.
In addition, large international construction companies rely on crane rentals to help manage their fleet, and they are beginning to shift their preferences to rent from OEMs as part of bundled deals.
Beyond the obvious benefits of having a rental fleet to run cranes, this business model helps facilitate greater service revenue and use equipment sales.
Moreover, many customers prefer to rent a crane for two years to work down the acquisition price prior to the actual purchase.
We see this approach as an opportunity to diversify our revenue streams and generate attractive returns in markets where we have opportunity to grow our share.
We quietly trialed this initiative during 2020 with good success and intend to expand this initiative in 2021.
We will continue to share more on this initiative as it matures.
But we want to give you some insight on how we are changing our mindset around growth.
In closing, improvement in our financial performance in the current down market is proof that we have created a sustainable stand-alone crane company.
We have significantly transformed our cost structure with the implementation of the Manitowoc Way.
Over the next five years, we will need to approach growth with the same rigor that we attacked safety, quality, and cost over the last five years.
We will continue to utilize the Manitowoc Way as our platform for driving our company culture.
We believe there are plenty of opportunities for organic and inorganic growth in segments of the crane business that are less volatile and offer a better margin profile.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call today is Jeff Powell, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Before we begin, let me read our safe harbor statement.
These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Following Jeff's remarks, I'll give an overview of our financial results for the quarter, and we will then have a Q&A session.
We had another quarter of record revenue and bookings, along with strong EBITDA margin performance and free cash flow, positioning us well for a strong finish to the year.
I'd like to begin by reviewing our operational highlights for the third quarter.
The robust demand for aftermarket parts and a high level of capital project activity in the third quarter led to an all-time high for revenue and bookings.
Our aftermarket parts and consumable business was exceptionally strong in most regions of the world, and new order activity was driven by solid demand across all of our operating segments.
In the third quarter, we announced the closing of two acquisitions, one in our Flow Control segment and another in our Material Handling segment.
The integration of these businesses is going well and their financial results contributed to our third quarter performance.
Just after the third quarter closed, we completed an acquisition of a small manufacturing business in India.
It is a well-established manufacturer of engineered stock preparation and equipment used to process recycle and virgin fiber for paper packaging and tissue production.
Our acquisition of this business will create a new manufacturing base for us in India, where we have leading market position and have been active for more than 20 years.
It also provides a strategic platform to accelerate new business opportunities in the fast-growing and in packaging petition markets.
Before moving on to our Q3 financial performance, I want to comment on the global supply chain and how we are managing in this complex environment.
The headwinds found within the global supply chain continued to be a challenge, pushing out expected deliveries and materials and creating a significant amount of work, to keep our delivery promises to our customers.
I'm pleased to say it is a challenge that our operations teams around the globe are managing successfully.
Our employees are doing a great job in navigating through a highly dynamic and uncertain environment that looks to be with us for some time.
While there is little expectation for a sudden return to normalcy, I am confident we will work through these immediate supply chain challenges and continue to meet our customers' needs.
Turning now to slide six and our Q3 financial performance.
You can see we had significant increases across all of these financial metrics compared to Q3 of last year.
Q3 revenue was up 29% compared to the third quarter of 2020 to a record $200 million.
Excluding acquisitions and the favorable impact of FX, revenue was up 18% compared to the same period last year.
Our aftermarket parts consumables revenue was up 28% to a record $131 million in Q3.
The consistently high operating rates of our customers and strong end-market demand contributed to our record aftermarket performance.
Solid execution contributed to boosting our adjusted EBITDA margin to 20.5%, which led to our excellent operating cash flow of $38 million in Q3.
All of our operating segments delivered excellent adjusted EBITDA margin performance despite the continuing inflationary pressures for materials and the ongoing supply chain constraints.
Bookings were exceptional in the quarter, up 71% to a record $245 million.
Excluding acquisitions and FX, bookings were up 57%, with contributions from all three of our operating segments.
I'll review the performance of these segments next, beginning with our Flow Control Group.
Flow Control segment achieved its fifth consecutive increase in quarterly revenue, reaching a record $76 million in the third quarter, up 34% compared to Q3 of last year.
Aftermarket ...
...2020 consists of the following: $0.90 due to higher revenue; $0.09 from acquisitions, net of interest expense and acquisition borrowings; and $0.05 due to lower interest expense.
These increases were partially offset by $0.21 due to higher operating expenses, $0.15 due to a decrease in the amounts received from government assistance programs.
$0.01 from higher noncontrolling interest expense and $0.01 due to higher weighted average shares outstanding.
Collectively, included in all the categories I just mentioned, was a favorable foreign currency translation effect of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of last year due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.
Looking at our liquidity metrics on slide 15.
Our cash conversion days, which we calculate by taking days in receivables plus days in inventory and subtracting days in accounts payable, decreased to 113 at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to 140 at the end of the third quarter of 2020.
This decrease was primarily driven by a lower number of days in inventory.
Working capital, as a percentage of revenue, was 13.5% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 15.6% in the third quarter 2020.
Our net debt, that is debt less cash, increased $115 million sequentially to $231 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021.
We borrowed $63 million in the quarter to fund our acquisitions, and we were able to pay down $26 million of debt in the quarter.
Our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our credit agreement, was 1.69 at the end of the third quarter 2021 compared to 1.71 at the end of the second quarter of 2021.
Our net interest expense decreased $0.3 million to $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2020.
At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had $105 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, which matures in December of 2023.
I would like to update our revenue range for the fourth quarter and full year 2021.
Although we had record bookings of $245 million in the third quarter, which is the fourth record quarter in a row.
We ended the third quarter with a record backlog of $299 million, the current headwinds from supply chain and logistical constraints have caused us to reduce our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter.
We now anticipate revenue of $210 million to $215 million, down from $220 million to $225 million that we noted in the July call.
For the full year 2021, we now anticipate revenue of $778 million to $783 million revised from $783 million to $793 million.
This change in the revenue range includes $13 million of revenue that has been moved into 2022 and as a result of supply chain issues or customer requested changes to the shipping dates.
In addition, the timing of capital orders also had an impact.
As Jeff mentioned, the China power supply issue, which came to light during September, has also had an impact on our production schedule.
The Chinese government has imposed varying power restrictions from time to time, which are outside of our control.
Our current revenue expectation is based on the current power use guidelines we have been given holding throughout the quarter.
Our guideline and gross margins essentially remains the same.
We anticipate fourth quarter gross margins will be 42%, which includes the impact of amortizing the acquired profit and inventory.
Our current estimate for the amortization of acquired profit and inventory in the fourth quarter is $2.1 million or $0.13.
We anticipate SG&A expenses will be approximately $55 million to $56 million, and R&D will be a little over $3 million in the fourth quarter.
The SG&A expense includes backlog amortization of approximately $600,000 or $0.04.
We anticipate our net interest expense will be approximately $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we anticipate the tax rate for the quarter will be 27% to 28%.
We hope these directional comments are helpful.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC, including in our 10-Q, which we file later today.
I will now turn the meeting over to Dave.
AMETEK delivered a strong third quarter, despite ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
While sales continue to be impacted by the pandemic, the demand environment shows solid improvements from the second quarter, as customers return to work and travel restrictions began to slowly ease.
In addition, our businesses delivered outstanding operating performance, allowing us to expand margins, generate excellent cash flow and drive earnings ahead of our expectations.
I continue to be impressed by the strength of our workforce and the dedication to our mission of solving our customer's most complex challenges.
We remain vigilant and focused on our employees' safety.
Our site and country level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the shifting guidelines provided by the CDC, and local health and safety agencies.
The flexibility our teams have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been excellent.
Now let me turn to our results for the quarter.
Third quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Organic sales were down 14%.
With the recent acquisitions contributing five points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a three point headwind and foreign currency adding one point.
As expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company, experienced the largest impact from COVID, with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year.
Our businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness.
These efforts lead to excellent operating results in the quarter.
Third quarter operating income was $270 million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter.
EBITDA in the third quarter was $332 million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year's comparable period.
This led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Furthermore, our businesses generated a strong level of cash flow.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of that income.
Next, let me provide additional details at the operating group level.
Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the quarter, despite end-market weakness, delivering outstanding operating performance resulting in strong margin expansion.
Sales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2019.
As expected, we saw solid and wide-spread sequential sales improvements from the second quarter.
Organic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing six points and foreign currency contributing one point.
Commercial aerospace remains a largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG.
EIG's third quarter operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.
Our Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand environment with solid operating performance.
EMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year's third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture.
Organic sales were down 13%, with a divestiture of 8-point headwind, the acquisition of PDT added two points and foreign currency adding one point.
EMG's operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the quarter.
Let me comment briefly on end-market dynamics for some of our businesses...
...gs per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.04, down 4% to 7% versus the prior year.
Fourth quarter decremental margins are expected to remain solid in the low 20%s.
To summarize, our businesses delivered a solid quarter in a difficult environment.
AMETEK continues to manage this global crisis well to the proven strength of the AMETEK growth model and with a talented workforce.
Our cost mitigation efforts have allowed the company to weather this ongoing storm and we are confident that we will overcome these challenges with a bright future.
I'd like to echo Dave's comments on the quarter, as we saw outstanding operating performance driven by the tremendous efforts of our team in a very challenging economic environment.
Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Third quarter general and administrative expenses were down $4.5 million, compared to the same period of 2019, primarily due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts.
As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.7% last year.
The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, down from 19.5% in the same period last year.
The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to returned provision adjustments and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.
For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%, and as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.
Operating capital and working capital was an impressive 17% in the third quarter, down sequentially from the second quarter's 19.6% on outstanding working capital management.
Capital expenditures in the quarter were $10 million.
We now expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, which is $5 million higher than our full year expectations last quarter, as we are investing in incremental growth opportunities.
Our full year capital expenditures estimate remains below our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $63 million.
For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million, free cash flow was $300 million and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 146% of net income.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, up slightly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $68 million from the end of the second quarter.
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion.
Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.1 times, as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances.
This was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times at quarter end, which improved by two -- 0.2 turns in the quarter.
We remain well-positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.3 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives.
This includes approximately $1 billion in available revolver capacity.
As we have highlighted on previous calls, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.
In summary, our businesses continue to manage through the pandemic exceptionally well, delivering strong operating results and high levels of cash flow.
The dedication of our world-class workforce to serving our essential customers has truly been impressive.
We remain well-positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges, while investing in our long-term growth initiatives.
Andrew, we are ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC.
I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
AMETEK had another outstanding quarter, with better than expected sales growth, strong operating performance, and earnings above our expectations.
We established records for sales, EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share in the quarter.
Demand remained strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth, and a record backlog.
While the global supply chain and logistics networks remain challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results which exceeded our expectations.
Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year.
This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues, as well as the strength, flexibility, and sustainability of the AMETEK growth model.
AMETEK's proven business model is central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders.
We are very proud of the important steps we're taking to further sustainability across AMETEK.
And last week, we published our latest Corporate Sustainability Report to highlight our efforts in this area.
This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made, and the commitments we are making to create a better future.
Now let me turn to our third-quarter results.
Third-quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% over the same period in 2020, and above our expectations.
Organic sales growth was 17%, acquisitions added 11 points, and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter.
Overall orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior-year period.
While organic orders were up an impressive 30% in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year.
Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020, and operating margins were 23.4%.
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020.
EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 28.8%.
This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share.
Up 25% over the third quarter of 2020, and above our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18.
We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, with third-quarter operating cash flow of $307 million, and free cash flow conversion of 109% of net income.
Overall tremendous results in a challenging operating environment.
Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level.
First, the Electronic Instruments Group.
Sales for AIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter.
Organic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency was a modest headwind.
While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies, and our Power and Industrial businesses.
AIG's third-quarter operating income was a record $245 million, up 20% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 25%.
Excluding acquisitions, AIG's core margins were excellent at 27.2% in line with prior year margins.
The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance.
Third-quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million.
Organic sales were up 20%, and currency added one point to growth.
Growth remained strong across all of the MG, with our automation businesses again delivering notably strong growth in the quarter.
EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a...
...imately 10%.
Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020 is comparable basis, and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.86 per diluted share.
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter.
Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30 of 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter.
In summary, AMETEK's third-quarter results were excellent.
Our teams continue to execute, and our businesses are performing well.
Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model.
The asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success.
The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.
As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, with continued strong sales growth, and orders growth, and outstanding operating performance.
Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Third-quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million dollars, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expenses.
As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year.
For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million, driven by higher compensation costs were approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year.
Third-quarter other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter.
This gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year.
For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate.
Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, down 210 basis points from the 17%, reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses, and managing working capital.
Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million, for all of 2021 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts.
In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million, and free cash flow was $281 million.
With free cash flow conversion, 109% of net income.
Total debt at quarter-end was $2.65 billion, up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions, thus far in 2021.
Offsetting this debt with cash and cash equivalents of $359 million?
In the quarter-end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times.
We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.
To summarize our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter, and throughout the first 9 months of 2021.
Our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow generation, have positioned the company for significant growth in the coming quarters, and years.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC.
I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter.
Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations.
We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter.
This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams.
We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile.
The five acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth.
Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year.
Now let me turn to our second quarter results.
Our businesses saw robust, broad-based sales growth in the quarter.
Overall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020.
Organic sales growth was 25%.
Acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added two points.

We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year.
Our business has also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter.
While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges as is reflected in our results.
Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020.
And operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%.
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%.
EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%.
This operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10.
Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions.
In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% of net income.
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level.
Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter.

The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK Growth Model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.
As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings.
Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense.
As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter versus 1.7% in the same period last year.
For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6% compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year.
The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. rate change and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities.
For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.
And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well.
For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020.
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million.
For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management.
In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income.
Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion.
Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million.
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front.
During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI.
This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software and Magnetrol, which were completed in the first quarter of the year.
Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on five strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021.
At quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio were 1.9 times and 1.6 times, respectively.
We remain well positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility.
At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.
To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations.
The performance of our businesses through the first half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation and the dedication of our world-class workforce, has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.
Michelle, we're ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Dave Martin of Harsco.
As previously noted, we are very fortunate to have recruited Anshooman to Harsco and he has held significant financial and operational roles at Siemens, AECOM and Cubic, and he is already adding tremendous value to our company.
Turning to our results, the third quarter was characterized by healthy underlying demand in our two core businesses, Harsco Environmental and Clean Earth.
It also reflected cost inflation and supply chain disruptions across all three business units.
Overall, Harsco consolidated revenue was up 7% versus Q3 of 2020 while adjusted EBITDA was up 22% on the same basis.
Demand in our Rail segment was dampened by continued weakness, in-transit ridership, a slowdown in domestic freight traffic and uncertainty as customers wait for the passage of the US infrastructure bill.
As we have indicated in the past Harsco Rail is not aligned with our long-term strategy to focus on and drive growth in businesses that provide environmental solutions to a broad mix than markets.
However, Harsco Rail is a unique business with innovative solutions and a global reach with meaningful growth opportunities ahead.
We have received solicited expressions of interest from many parties over the past several months and expect a very competitive sale process.
I'll comment on each of our segments beginning with Harsco Environmental.
Harsco Environmental continued to perform in line with our expectations and we are pleased with its momentum.
Capacity utilization of the steel mills we support remains lower than the levels of the first half of 2019 and analysts expect low-to-mid single digit LST growth through next year.
Commodity prices along with the contributions from our so called echo products, previously referred to as applied products, remains strong.
Looking ahead to 2022, against a continued positive outlook for the global steel industry and a decline to normalized levels of capital spending in our business we expect the Environmental business to deliver the highest EBITDA and free cash flow in many years.
Clean Earth experienced a moderate impact in the third quarter from cost inflation and an excess of backlog of material requiring incineration, which negatively affected volume.
The recovery and contaminated soil continues to be a bit slower than anticipated due to delays in certain infrastructure projects.
Nonetheless, Clean Earths EBITDA in Q3 was close to our expectations, and these pressures should abate throughout Q4 and become de minimis by Q1 of 2022.
Similar to Harsco Environmental we believe the Clean Earth has set up to deliver another strong year of growth in 2022.
Underlying market demand, new business, and you had higher benefits from the ESOL turnaround and integration will be the primary drivers.
As noted, our Rail business had a challenging quarter due to cost inflation and the timing of equipment orders and shipments.
Many of our customers have been affected by their own supply chain issues, and as a result, maintenance programs are being put on hold.
While we expect to see some continued impact from these inflationary and supply chain issues in Q4, we expect the situation to improve as we move through the first half of next year.
The passage of the US infrastructure bill and the introduction of new products aimed at improving the efficiency of rail maintenance activities should also support growth.
The other components of our business those being aftermarket technology and contracted services are performing in line with expectations and the outlook is encouraging.
Therefore, we believe the timing of the divestiture of the rail business should coincide with improving market fundamentals and deliver the value we expect for our shareholders.
Let me start by saying I am very excited to be here and a part of the Harsco team.
I joined Harsco because I thought the promise of the Company's ongoing transformation to a single investment thesis environmental solutions company, and the value creat...
...ails later.
Lastly on Clean Earth, I'd highlight that our year-to-date free cash flow now totals $39 million.
This total represents more than 70% of segment EBITDA.
Rail revenues totaled $74 million and its EBITDA totaled $3 million in the second quarter.
These figures are below those realized in Q3 of 2020.
The change in EBITDA can be attributed to lower equipment sales volume and higher costs.
I have mentioned earlier most of the deferred sales are expected to be realized in the next few quarters.
Also higher material costs impacted results.
We incurred a negative LIFO adjustment in the quarter of approximately $2 million, which has not been anticipated.
These impacts were partially offset by higher contributions from aftermarket parts and contracted services both in US and Asia.
Turning to slide 8, which is our consolidated 2021 outlook.
Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is now $248 million to $256 million for the year while adjusted earnings per share is anticipated to be within a range of $0.51 to $0.54.
These figures consider $4 million of stranded corporate costs that were previously allocated to Rail.
This outlook also includes 100% of Harsco's interest costs and a pro forma estimated tax rate.
A detailed segment outlook is included in the appendix of the slide deck.
And, from a business segment point of view our adjusted EBITDA outlook for environmental is essentially unchanged.
Meanwhile, our outlook for Clean Earth's adjusted EBITDA is lowered by $5 million at the midpoint.
This change reflects the impact of higher container and transportation costs as well as a volume impact from end disposal constraints.
Last quarter we noted certain risk related to Clean Earth including the impacts related to incineration and inflation.
These impacts, however, are larger than what we previously anticipated for the second half of the year.
Looking forward, we do expect these pressures to abate.
There are a number of disposal assets that have restarted or are increasing output.
Also we have been pushing through price increases to offset the inflation.
Price initiatives take time as you have aware driven by timing of contractual annual price increases in many cases, and we expect to fully offset the cost increases we've seen year-to-date during the first quarter of 2022.
Also, we remain very diligent on our cost structure, including corporate costs and the need for continuous improvement.
In this regard, we recently launched a cost improvement program which includes targeted reductions at both Clean Earth and Rail.
These efforts are anticipated to provide annual run rate benefits of $10 to $15 million when fully realized in the second half of 2022.
Any non-recurring costs related to this program as well as our recently announced decision to move our corporate office to Philadelphia are excluded from this outlook.
Let me conclude on slide 9 with our fourth quarter guidance.
Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $55 million to $62 million.
Again, this range excludes Rail.
Clean Earth is expected to see a nice improvement year-on-year as a result of integration benefits and higher volumes, including in the soil dredged materials business line.
These impacts are expected to be partially offset by inflation and investments.
Environmental EBITDA is anticipated to be similar or slightly below the prior year quarter.
This guidance contemplates a negative FX impact, some contract exit costs and the less favorable services mix compared to Q4 of 2020.
Sequentially, we anticipate that some seasonality will reemerge across our businesses.
And before opening the call to questions let me again reiterate our focus on reducing leverage and strengthening free cash flow.
We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 4.48 times.
Importantly, we are targeting a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times at the end of 2022.
This outcome would be consistent with our long-term targets and reflects our optimism about our businesses and ability to sell Rail.

 There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially.
You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in our Form 10-Q filed earlier today.
Before we get started on operational results, one of the strategic priorities outlined during our Strategy Day was to foster a high-performance culture with purpose.
And I'm pleased to announce that we have appointed Tolani Azis, a six-year Fluor employee with 20 years of EPC experience, to lead our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Fluor is a vast and diverse company, and with Tolani's leadership, she will help us retain, attract and cultivate a workforce that represents the world in which we live and operate.
On a separate subject, please note that earlier this week, a favorable motion was granted as it relates to an outstanding securities class action lawsuit.
This motion dismissed with prejudice all allegations, except those relating to a single statement in 2015 about one gas-fired power project.
While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this remaining allegation, we do not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred.
It's been great to see the vaccine rollout around the globe, and I'm particularly encouraged at the speed of distribution here in the United States.
Although there are still many regional challenges to deal with, the end of the pandemic seems to be in sight, which will be a relief to all of us.
Currently, well over 90% of our project sites and about 80% of our offices are operating at limited operations or better.
One exception is our office in New Delhi, where a surge in COVID cases has caused local officials to issue a lockdown and curfew order effective until May 10.
The safety and well-being of all employees is our top priority.
To help support our Delhi colleagues and families that are in medical need, we airlifted several oxygen concentrators from Houston.
Our 1,500 New Delhi employees are all now working safely and productively from home.
In the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.25, with new awards led by the Dos Bocas in our Energy Solutions Group.
While we continue to see softness in the markets when it comes to capital spending, we anticipate that awards will start to pick up as we get into the back half of 2021.
And our teams are busy on front-end work and project pursuits that will help to build a healthy backlog over the next few years.
Note again that we are now reporting in line with our three new business segments: Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions and Mission Solutions.
Additionally, Stork is now a part of discontinued operations.
Joe will give an update on our divestitures of Stork and AMECO in just a few minutes.
Moving to Slide 5, with regard to NuScale's.
On April 5, we announced a $40 million equity contribution from JGC.
We know JGC well, having executed projects with them for more than 10 years.
They are an ideal partner that could support NuScale's industry-leading carbon-free energy solution.
This is consistent with the strategy announced in January to reduce Fluor's equity ownership of NuScale.
Regarding our cost savings initiative, efforts are now well under way to streamline the organization.
We will be updating you on our progress as the year proceeds.
Key to this program will be ensuring the deployment of world-class execution teams onto new prospects over the coming quarters, coupled with the proper level of fit-for-purpose back-office support.
I'd like to take the next few minutes to inform you on what is happening across our end markets and what we expect to see over the next few quarters.
In Energy Solutions, this quarter, our ICA Fluor joint venture was awarded three contracts totaling $2.8 billion for the PEMEX Dos Bocas refinery in Mexico.
We have a long and successful history of PEMEX contracts, and we are pleased to be adding our $1.4 billion share of this refinery program to backlog.
During the quarte...
...exclude an embedded foreign currency derivative for an Energy Solutions project in Mexico.
This derivative is based on exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso and will fluctuate over the life of the contract or at least until the job has been fully procured.
Our overall segment profit for the quarter was $60 million or 2% and includes the $29 million embedded derivative in Energy Solutions and quarterly NuScale expenses of $15 million.
This compares favorably to $55 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Removing NuScale expenses and the effect of the embedded derivative would improve our total segment profit margin to 3.6%.
Margins in Energy Solutions and Urban Solutions reflect reduced execution activity on certain projects and the lack of new awards to replace projects we are completing.
We anticipate project activities will accelerate as we move through 2021.
In Mission Solutions, margins were strong due to the increased execution activity on DOE projects as well as an increase in performance scores on several projects.
As David mentioned, we received a $40 million investment in NuScale from JGC this quarter and are anticipating other significant investments in the near future.
Note here that even though partners are meeting NuScale's cash needs, we will continue to expense 100% of this investment on our income statement on a consolidated basis.
Our G&A expense in the quarter was $66 million.
This is higher than our expected run rate due to the increase in our stock price driven -- driving up the value of our executive compensation expense.
As David said, our cost savings initiative is well under way.
We have identified cost savings above the $100 million target previously discussed.
I look forward to providing an update on the progress as we get into the execution phase later this year and transition into a fit-for-purpose organization.
On Slide 12, our ending cash for the quarter was $2 billion, 25% of this domestically available.
As a reminder, the rest of our cash is tied up in either VIEs in projects or in foreign accounts and is not easily accessible.
Our operating cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $231 million and was negatively impacted by increased funding of COVID costs on our projects, higher cash payments of corporate G&A, including the timing and extent of employee bonuses, and increased tax payments.
While it is typical to have a lower operating cash flow in the first quarter, we expect full year operating cash flow to be positive.
We used approximately $50 million in cash for challenged legacy projects in the first quarter.
As I stated in February, we expect to spend an additional $65 million over the balance of 2021 to fund these projects.
As we announced earlier this week, we have divested our AMECO North America business for $73 million.
This follows our successful transaction of our AMECO Jamaica business last year.
We are now focusing on our South American assets, and we'll update you on that plan later in 2021.
The store divestiture process is well under way, and we have received interest from a number of promising buyers.
We are working through our diligence and are targeting a sale near the end of this year or early in 2022.
Please move to Slide 13.
We are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $0.50 and $0.80 for the full year.
Hitting this target is dependent on projects being awarded in a timely fashion and revenue picking up over the next two quarters.
We are also maintaining our previous segment level guidance and expect 2021 full year segment margins to be approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in Energy Solutions, which excludes any fluctuation from the embedded foreign currency derivative; 2% to 3% in Urban Solutions; and 2.5% to 3% in Mission Solutions.
We have posted unaudited financials for 2019 and 2020 that aligns with our new reporting structure on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Operator, we are now ready for our first question.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 During the call, we will discuss our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 as well as our outlook for fiscal 2022.
In addition, a slide deck providing detailed financial results for the quarter is also posted on our website.
Despite operating in what remains an incredibly volatile environment, we delivered on our previously provided 2021 outlook for net sales, synergies, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA.
2021 was our sixth consecutive year of organic revenue growth behind elevated demand and distribution gains.
This top line growth, combined with synergies we achieved from the Spectrum acquisition and interest expense savings translated into strong adjusted earnings per share and EBITDA growth.
In a few moments John will provide details on the fourth quarter and full year.
However, before he does some key headlines from our fiscal 2021 performance.
For the first time our Company exceeded $3 billion in net sales.
We also maintained top line momentum with organic sales growth of 7.3% including growth of nearly 17% in our auto care business.
Our battery and auto care businesses benefited from elevated demand and distribution gains in North America.
Auto care further benefited from the expansion in our international markets, reaching $100 million in sales in those markets for the full year.
We also delivered synergies of $62 million for the year, resulting in total synergies from the Spectrum acquisition in excess of $130 million, 30% higher than our initial estimate.
And we continue to invest in our brands, resulting in strong brand preference globally.
With more consumers selecting our battery brand, we gained 2.2 share point in the last 12 months.
This performance is a tribute to our team and their resiliency.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have consistently adapted in real-time to ensure business continuity and repositioned Energizer for the future.
The hard work of our global colleagues to produce and deliver products to our customers and consumers in a time of heightened demand and significant disruption has been impressive to witness on a daily basis.
In a moment, I will provide headlines for our 2022 outlook.
However, before I do I want to provide an update on a few key topics that will set the stage for the future.
First, our categories remain healthy and are showing solid growth when compared to pre-pandemic levels and we expect the consumer behaviors supporting that demand will continue for the foreseeable future.
Specifically in batteries, there are two drivers.
Devices owned per household are up mid single digits in the US and an increase in the amount of time those devices are being used.
Consequently, consumers are using more batteries, which has resulted in new buying patterns versus a year ago, including increased purchase frequency and spending per trip.
As a result, on a two-year stack basis without e-commerce, the global battery category has grown by 2.9% in value and 3.7% in volume.
In the near term, we will see the category decline as it did in the three months ending August 2021 where it was down 6.9% in value and 5.3% in volume due to comping elevated demand from a year ago.
However, as we look to the long term, we anticipate the category to experience flat to low single-digit growth, albeit on a higher base as the category has increased in size due to consumers' behavior during the pandemic.
Within the category, our iconic brands remain well positioned.
Our brands outpaced the category, resulting in a 2.2 share point gain versus last year as we increased distribution in the US and internationally with share gains in those markets representing 70% of our total battery revenues.
Turning to the auto care category.
Over the last five years the auto care category has shown consistent growth, a trend that continued in the latest 13 weeks with category value up 3.5% versus year ago and 16.3% versus 2019.
The growth is being driven by consumers continuing the do-it-yourself behavio...
...ear quarter as we are benefiting from significant refinancing activity over the past 18 months.
During the fourth quarter, we entered into a $75 million accelerated share repurchase program.
Approximately 1.5 million shares were delivered in fiscal 2021 and we expect another 400,000 shares to be delivered in the first quarter of fiscal '22, bringing the total number of shares repurchased under the ASR program to approximately 1.9 million.
Now turning to the highlights for fiscal 2021.
As Mark mentioned, we delivered our full-year 2021 outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.
Net sales grew 10.1%, including organic sales up 7.3% as we experienced robust growth in both the Americas and International and across all three product categories, batteries, auto care and lighting products.
Adjusted gross margin was down 100 basis points, as higher input costs were partially offset by synergies and the reduction of COVID-related costs incurred in 2020.
Interest expense, benefiting from significant refinancing activity, decreased $33 million.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 51% to $3.48 as higher sales, synergies and lower interest expense more than offset the higher input costs.
And adjusted EBITDA increased 10%.
At the end of 2021, our net debt was approximately $3.2 billion or 5.1 times net debt to credit defined EBITDA with nearly 85% at fixed interest rates, no near-term maturities and an all-in cost of debt below 4%.
Our adjusted free cash flow for 2021 was $203.5 million.
The decline versus the prior year primarily reflects working capital investments as we proactively invested in incremental inventory given the continued volatility in the global supply network and uncertainty around product sourcing, transportation and labor availability.
Now turning to our fiscal 2022 outlook.
As Mark discussed, our categories remain healthy and are showing solid growth when compared to pre-pandemic levels.
As we enter fiscal 2022, we are benefiting from significant pricing actions.
However, input costs continue to rise.
The outlook we are providing for next year reflects pricing actions that we have executed or planned as well as the assumption that our input costs remain at current levels for the full year.
Organic revenue is expected to be roughly flat with auto care growth and pricing actions across 85% of our businesses, offset by declines in battery as we comp prior year elevated demand in the first two fiscal quarters.
We also expect reported revenue will be negatively impacted by foreign currency headwinds of $20 million to $25 million at current rates.
As we have talked about for the last couple of quarters, input costs including raw materials, labor and transportation costs, are rising rapidly and supply chain networks continue to be stressed.
Last quarter I highlighted the potential for an additional 100 basis points of gross margin headwinds in 2022 if input costs did not improve.
And as of today, the trends have worsened.
While we expect the absolute dollar amount of these rising costs to be offset by the pricing actions and cost reduction efforts that our team has undertaken, we now project gross margin headwinds of approximately 150 basis points, based on current rates and assumptions.
These inflationary cost pressures, combined with the anticipated volume declines in battery in the first half of the year, are expected to result in adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3 to $3.30 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $560 million to $590 million.
As we look at our capital allocation priorities during this volatile macro environment, we will continue to invest in our businesses and brands for the long term while returning cash to shareholders and paying down debt.
While 2021 was a solid year for Energizer and one that we are proud of, our focus today is on moving forward and working to further mitigate the cost headwinds we are facing while ensuring our products are available to consumers around the world.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Let's begin with the highlights on the Slide 4.
Our sales for the quarter were $296 million.
We had a significant headwind in our automotive segment, due to the ongoing supply chain disruptions, particularly the semiconductor shortage.
That shortage led to Auto OEM production slowdowns and some cases production shutdowns.
This in turn led directly to lower sales in our Automotive segment, especially in North America.
Helping to offset that auto headwind were near record sales in our Industrial segment.
There was strength in sales across all our industrial product categories, but in particular, we saw growth in electric vehicle busbars, commercial vehicle lighting and radio remote controls.
Respectively, these products are benefiting from the macro growth trends of electrification, e-commerce and automation.
The industrial sales in our portfolio relative our Automotive sales continue to grow.
As I mentioned, our team continuing to face supply chain challenges.
These include the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage, pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and port congestion, all of which are increasing costs and consequently negatively impacting margins.
Our team has worked diligently to mitigate these challenges, which in many cases require remedial actions such as expedited shipping and premium component pricing.
In addition, we are working relentlessly with our customers to share in the absorption of these costs.
The timing of these cost recoveries is not certain.
At this point, our expectation is that these conditions will last until the end of our fiscal year.
This extended period of demand recovery and margin pressure is a driver of our revised guidance for the full fiscal year.
The situation is fluid and our mitigation efforts are ongoing, but we are confident that we will continue to execute and meet our customers' requirements.
Ron will provide more detail on our guidance later in the call.
On the new order front, we were encouraged by the diversity of awards across key applications.
In addition to our traditional automotive market, we secured awards of cloud computing, commercial vehicle and EV applications.
Focusing on EV, last quarter, we reported that sales into EV applications were 16% of the consolidated sales.
This quarter, EV sales were again 16% of consolidated sales.
However, on a dollar basis, they were higher and in fact, we were a record for Methode.
Our expectation for that percentage for the full year continues to be in the mid-teens.
In the quarter, we further reduced debt, generated positive operating cash flow and continued to return capital to shareholders.
Our free cash flow was positive even though we invested in inventory to support our deliveries to customers and to help mitigate supply chain disruptions.
While our debt was down, we did have an increase in net debt as we utilized a portion of our available cash to execute a $35 million share buyback in the quarter.
We have now executed half of $100 million stock buyback authorization since it was announced last March.
Before I provide detail on our business awards, I want to provide some information on an existing program.
I can now share with you a little more detail on our largest truck center console program.
We expect a small portion of that sales from this program to start to roll off late this fiscal year, which was included in our original full-year guidance.
Then in fiscal 2023, we expect the bulk of the remaining truck program sales to roll off in the range of $90 million to $100 million.
The fiscal 2024 impact is negligible.
As I've mentioned in recent quarters, our business awards over the last couple of years have put us on track in aggregate to replace the sales from the roll off of this truck program.
Moving to Slide 5.
Methode had another solid quarter of business awards.
These awards continue to capitalize in key market trends like cloud computing and vehicle electrification.
The awards identified here represent some of the key b...
... increased by nearly $26 million due to the supply chain-related challenges.
Regarding capital allocation on March 31, we announced a $100 million share repurchase program, which we executed nearly $35 million of purchases during the second quarter of fiscal year '22.
Since the authorization's approval, we purchased nearly 50 million worth of shares at an average price of $44.04.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined as net cash provided from operating activities, minus capex.
For the fiscal year '22 second quarter, free cash flow was $21.6 million compared to $36.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year '21.
The decrease was mainly due to negative working capital changes, especially from the inventory items we discussed prior.
We experienced sequentially improved free cash flow in the second quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22.
We anticipate our proven history of generating reliable cash flows, which allows for ample funding of future organic growth, inorganic growth and continued return of capital to the shareholders.
In the second quarter of fiscal year '22, we invested approximately $5.4 million in capex as compared to $3.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal year '21.
The higher capex is in line with our expectation that capex in fiscal year '22 would be higher than the investment in the prior fiscal year.
We now estimate fiscal year '22 capex to be in the $45 million to $50 million range, which is lower than the prior estimates for the current fiscal year of $50 million to $55 million we provide earlier.
The decrease is simply the result of the timing of the cash outflows of approved projects as opposed to a concerted effort to slow or reduce the guidance of capital investment.
Investing for future organic growth and vertical integration remains a key priority from a capital allocation strategy perspective.
We do have a strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to utilize it by continuing investment in our businesses to grow them organically.
In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for inorganic growth in a measured return of capital to the shareholders.
Regarding guidance, it is managed -- it is based on management's best estimates.
External events and the related potential impact on our financial results remain an ongoing challenge.
As Don mentioned in his remarks, we lowered our previously issued revenue and earnings per share guidance, largely due to the persistent headwinds from the ongoing negative impact of the chip shortage and logistics challenges.
As you recall in our September conference call, we noted that the persistent headwinds could call our performance to be below the midpoint of the ranges of our original guidance as a situation was fluid and would likely remain challenging.
These headwinds continue to adversely impact our second quarter results and will likely be with us for the remaining six months of our fiscal year.
The revenue range for full fiscal year '22 is between $1.14 billion and $1.16 billion, down from a range of $1.175 billion to $1.235 billion.
Diluted earnings per share range is now between $3 per share and $3.20 per share, down from $3.35 to $3.75 per share.
The range is due from the uncertainty from the supply chain disruption for semiconductors and other materials on both Methode and as customers.
From a sales perspective, lower sales could result from a supply disruptions to us or our customers, which could result in lesser demand for our products or our ability to meet customer demand.
Continued supply chain disruption would also negatively impact gross margins, due to additional costs incurred from premium freight, factory inefficiencies and a lesser extent, other logistic factors such as port congestion.
Higher costs for materials, freight and labor are a constant and a dynamic battle, and we remain uncertain as to when things will stabilize.
Don, that concludes my comments.
Matt, we are ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With that, I will now turn things over to Mike.
I want to discuss a few highlights of our third quarter results before turning it back to Shantanu, who will review them in detail.
Turning to our financial performance in the quarter, we are pleased with how our teams delivered across both the coke and logistics segments.
cokemaking operations continued to operate at full capacity, while our Logistics segment delivered another solid quarter, despite the disruption caused by Hurricane Ida.
For the third quarter of 2021, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $73.9 million, representing record third quarter performance.
As I mentioned, CMT operations were disrupted due to Hurricane Ida, but the terminal recovered quickly with only minor damage and minimum business disruption.
The resilient nature of our operations and commitment to our employees was clearly visible through the speed at which CMT returned to normal operations.
Operationally, our export and foundry coke initiatives continued to perform well as evident from our financial results.
In addition, positive market dynamics are proving that our entry into these markets was timely.
Our products are well received by customers and we have established ourselves as a reliable supplier of quality products in both markets.
Our gross leverage stands at approximately 2.5 times on a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA basis.
We are committed to continue paying down our revolver for the remainder of the year.
Based on our year-to-date performance and the expectation of continued strength in steel and coal markets for the remainder of the year, we are well positioned to modestly exceed our full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $255 million to $265 million.
Turning to Slide four, our third quarter net income attributable to SXC was $0.27 per share, up $0.30 versus the prior year period.
The increase is primarily driven by the absence of supply relief provided to certain customers as part of the turned down agreements during the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA came in at $73.9 million for the quarter, up $26.1 million from the prior year quarter.
Our coke operations continue to deliver strong performance and operate efficiently.
Overall, coke operations were up $17.7 million over prior year period.
Turning to the Domestic Coke business summary on Slide five.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA per ton was $62 on 1,056,000 sales tons.
The volumes were higher across the fleet as the prior-year period was impacted by pandemic-related turn downs.
Our successful entry into export and foundry market is proving to be timely and when combined with full capacity utilization, we can see the positive impact on our profitability.
We expect full-year Domestic Coke adjusted EBITDA to come in modestly higher than the guidance range of $234 million to $238 million.
There are planned outages at some of our Domestic Coke facilities, which will impact the volume and profitability of fourth quarter, but is included in the full-year guidance.
Moving to Slide six to discuss our Logistics business.
The Logistics business generated $11.6 million of adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter of 2021, as compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period.
The increase is driven by higher coal volumes, addition of iron ore as a product and higher price on coal handling all at CMT. The coal handling contract includes a quarterly price adjustment or a price kicker, which is based on the API2 price index, which benefited Q3 results.
We expect the benefit to continue in Q4, as well.
As mentioned by Mike earlier, the impact of Hurricane Ida on CMT was limited and the facility came back to normal operating levels fairly quickly.
The segment as a whole handled 4.9 million tons of throughput volumes during the quarter, as compared to 3.3 million tons during the prior year period.
Our full-year guidance for Logistics volumes and adjusted EBITDA remains the same as provided in second quarter.
Turning to Slide seven to discuss our liquidity position in Q3.
As you can see from the chart, we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $54.6 million.
In the third quarter, cash flow from the operating activities generated close to $79 million.
We spent $18.4 million on capex during the quarter and paid dividends of $5 million at the rate of $0.06 per share.
We lowered our debt by $51.7 million with the majority of the reduction coming in the form of paydown of our revolving credit facility.
Our total debt balance stood at approximately $615 million at the end of third quarter and we expect to continue to pay down the revolver over the balance of the year.
In total, we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of $291 million.
Wrapping up on Slide eight.
As always, safety and operational performance is top of mind for our organization.
We look to continue to perform safely, while successfully executing against our operating and capital plan for the remainder of the year.
We are very pleased with the progress we have made so far in the new markets we entered this year and we will continue to focus on further developing our customer base and participation in future years.
Our aim, when we started 2021, was to run at full capacity, while introducing new products.
As we end the third quarter, we are fully booked for the balance of the year and we are actively working on filling the order book for next year.
On the Logistics side, we have made good progress on revitalizing CMT with the backdrop of positive market dynamics.
We will continue to build on this foundation for CMT's long-term success.
On the capital allocation front, we will continue to work toward reducing our revolver for the balance of the year.
In the longer term, we will continually evaluate the capital needs of our business, profitable growth opportunities and the need to reward our shareholders, and we'll make capital allocation decisions accordingly.
Finally, based on reliable performance of our operating segments and success of export and foundry products, we are well positioned to modestly exceed our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $255 million to $265 million for 2021.
With that, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Sales in the second quarter were $129.6 million, up 54% compared to the same period in 2020.
Customer demand remains robust, while supply challenges persist especially for automotive products.
Second quarter gross margin was 36.8%, up 525 basis points from 31.6% in the second quarter of 2020.
Though improved, gross margin performance continues to be impacted by semiconductor and commodity price increases, as well as increased logistics costs.
EBITDA margin of 21.5% was up 480 basis points from 16.7% in the same period last year.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 were up 225% from $0.16 in the second quarter of 2020.
Later, Ashish will add color to the GAAP performance including a non-cash charge related to the U.S. pension plan termination.
Operating cash flow of $19 million was up from $12 million in the second quarter of 2020.
New business awards of $174 million were solid and up from $105 million in the same period last year.
Ashish Agrawal, our CFO, is with me for today's call and will take us through the Safe Harbor statement.
And more information can be found in the company's SEC Filings.
To the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investor section of the CTS website.
I will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO, Kieran O'Sullivan.
In the second quarter, our sales were $129.6 million, up 54% from the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding sales from the acquisition of Sensor Scientific, sales were up 52% organically.
The SSI acquisition continues to deliver solid growth.
As I referenced in our last earnings call, we expected the transportation sales run rate to be slightly lower than our first quarter 2021 performance due to ongoing supply challenges.
Our teams worked creatively and diligently to secure parts, approved substitutions and adapt with speed to support our customers.
Transportation sales while up 88% from the same period last year would have been stronger by a few million dollars if we did not have these supply challenges.
We expect the supply challenges and some customer shutdowns to persist in the second half.
New business awards were $174 million for the quarter, up from $105 million in the same period last year.
We added three new customers in the quarter; two in transportation and one in telecom.
In Asia, we added a new transportation customer in China for a large platform that would ship in the 2023 timeframe.
Across the accelerator modules, we had wins with two existing customers in China, secured awards with two Japanese OEMs for the North American market and added a new electric vehicle customer in Europe.
With passive safety sensors, we had wins with existing Tier 1 customers across all three regions with one of the wins for an EV application.
In Europe and North America, we had wins for throttle position and transmission position sensing.
Bookings and sales for two-wheeler applications were strong in Asia.
We continue to advance our diversification strategy by growing in non-transportation end markets.
In Defense, we had several undersea sonar wins and we also maintain good momentum with our RF filter products for GPS anti-jamming applications.
Temperature sensor wins were solid in defense, and we had an important win for an aviation application in Europe.
In Industrial, we continue to see strong demand for temperature products across pool and spa as well as HVAC applications.
We also had a large win in industrial printing, securing a two-year contract where the market has expanded into new applications such as garment printing.
Momentum in medical markets was positive but with inconsistencies regionally due to countries emerging from lockdowns and some customers being impacted by material shortages.
We had various temperature application wins and additional wins in CPAP, medical ultrasound and intravenous drug delivery.
For medical ultrasound, our design wins are inc...
...ver the last 12 months, as well as improvements in other parts of our business.
We also benefited from a larger portion of our revenue coming from the Industrial, Medical and Aerospace and Defense end markets.
Raw material price increases, as well as freight costs continue to impact us unfavorably.
And we are working closely with our customer base to offset or share these cost increases.
In the last quarter, we generated $0.03 of earnings per share in savings from our restructuring program announced in the third quarter of 2020, bringing the total savings to $0.12 of earnings per share so far.
As we mentioned back in April, the timing of some of our projects is being impacted due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on travel, as well as an increase in demand.
We are still on track to achieve the targeted annualized savings of $0.22 to $0.26 by the end of 2022.
SG&A and R&D expenses were $27 million or 21% for the second quarter.
Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of reinstating cost cuts made during the pandemic to offset the impact of revenue decline and higher incentive compensation expenses.
In the second quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of $20.1 million related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan.
We are expecting the remaining non-cash charge of approximately $101 million to be booked in the third quarter when we complete the settlement process.
As a reminder, these are non-cash charges and the U.S. pension plan is expected to be overfunded at settlement.
Second quarter tax rate was 246% as a result of the impact of the pension settlement charge on our income statement.
We anticipate our 2021 tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21% excluding the impact of the pension settlement and other discrete items.
We are carefully watching the new tax proposals and initiatives of the Biden Administration, and we'll discuss the impact on our business in the coming months as we get more clarity.
Second quarter 2021 earnings were $0.03 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.52 compared to $0.16 for the same period last year and $0.46 last quarter.
Now I'll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow.
Our controllable working capital is essentially flat from the end of 2020.
While we remain focused on working capital efficiency, we anticipate carrying some excess inventory where possible to manage supply chain concerns over the next few quarters.
Our operating cash flow was $19 million for the second quarter which is an improvement from $12 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We generated $16 million in free cash flow.
Capex was low in the first half primarily due to the timing of various projects.
In 2021, we expect capex to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% of sales.
Our cash balance on June 30, 2021 was $117 million, up from $92 million on December 31, 2020.
Our long-term debt balance was $50 million, down from $55 million on December 31, 2020.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was at 9.9% at the end of the second quarter compared to 11.4% at the end of 2020.
The combination of a strong balance sheet with a net cash position and access to approximately $250 million through our credit facility gives us the liquidity to make progress on the right M&A transactions.
In early July, we successfully went live on SAP at Boise, Idaho, and Tecate, Mexico.
These are locations from our first temperature acquisition.
As we had previously mentioned, more than 90% of our revenue now comes from sites that are running on SAP.
We expect to complete the rollout to our remaining sites in early 2022.
Before we wrap up, as Kieran mentioned earlier, we see a sustained demand environment in the second half of 2021.
However, supply chain challenges are expected to persist for us and our customers on both material availability and cost through the rest of the year.
Our current expectation is that Q3 could be the most challenging with some improvements in the fourth quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Sorry for that break.
Before we begin our call today, I need to remind you that in order to talk about our company, we're going to mention a few things that are not historical facts.
These non-GAAP measures are adjusted net loss, adjusted loss per share, adjusted operating loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
We're using these non-GAAP measures today because they allow us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to nonrecurring items.
In addition, RPC is required to use EBITDA to report compliance with financial covenants under our revolving credit facility.
Please review these disclosures if you're interested in seeing how they're calculated.
2020 was a very challenging year on many levels.
Fortunately, the world is coming to terms with the COVID-19 pandemic and hydrocarbon demand is slowly but surely recovering.
This has led to a reduction in oil inventory to near its five year average, aided by supportive OPEC+ actions to date.
As a result, the outlook for the oil and gas prices is encouraging, which should support modest growth in industry activities.
The first quarter played out largely as we expected, except for the unusually severe cold weather during February.
Our estimate is that this event negatively impacted our EBITDA by approximately $5 million.
Notwithstanding that event, we see encouraging trends in most of our service lines, which gives us confidence in our 2021 outlook.
Our CFO, Ben Palmer, will discuss this and other financial results in more detail, after which I will provide some closing comments.
For the first quarter of 2021, revenues decreased to $182.6 million compared to $243.8 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
Revenues decreased due primarily to significantly lower activity levels, including the February adverse weather conditions, and lower pricing compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
Operating loss for the first quarter was $10.5 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $13.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
EBITDA for the first quarter was $7.8 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $25.8 million in the same period of the prior year.
Loss per share was $0.05 in the first quarter of this year compared to adjusted loss per share of $0.04 in the first quarter of 2020.
Cost of revenues during the first quarter of 2021 was $146.2 million or 80.1% of revenues compared to $181.9 million or 74.6% of revenues during the first quarter of 2020.
Cost of revenues declined primarily due to decreases in expenses consistent with lower activity levels and RPC's cost reduction initiatives.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to lower pricing for our services, increased maintenance and repair and fuel costs as well as labor and other cost inefficiencies resulting from several challenges during the quarter.
These challenges included lower activity levels, COVID compliance costs and adverse weather events in the first quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $30.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $36.5 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
These expenses decreased due to lower employment costs, primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives during previous quarters.
Depreciation and amortization decreased to $17.8 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $39.3 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
Depreciation and amortization decreased significantly primarily due to asset impairment charges recorded in previous quarters, which decreased RPC's depreciable property, plant and equipment as well as lower capital expenditures.
Our Technical Services segment revenues for the quarter decreased 24.2% compared to the same quarter in the prior year.
This was due to significantly lower activity and pricing.
Significant operating -- segment operating loss in the first quarter of 2021 was $5.8 million...
...ion operating loss in the first quarter of the prior year.
Our Support Services segment revenues for the quarter decreased 38% compared to the same quarter in the prior year.
Segment operating loss in the first quarter of 2021 was $2.9 million compared to an operating profit of $1.5 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
On a sequential basis, RPC's first quarter revenues increased 22.9% to $182.6 million from $148.6 million in the prior quarter.
And this was due to activity increases in most of our service lines.
Cost of revenues during the first quarter of '21 -- 2021 increased by $28.3 million or 24% to $146.2 million due to expenses, which increased with higher activity levels, such as materials and supplies and employment expenses.
As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased slightly from 79.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 80.1% in the first quarter of 2021.
This was due to increases in M&R expenses and fuel costs, coupled with labor and other cost inefficiencies due to the adverse weather event.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of 2021 increased 17.6% to $30.6 million and $26 million in the prior quarter.
This was primarily due to a beneficial forfeiture rate adjustment to stock compensation that we recorded in the prior quarter.
RPC incurred an operating loss of $10.5 million during the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted operating loss of $11.3 million in the prior quarter.
RPC's EBITDA was $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2021, which was the same as adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Our Technical Services segment revenues increased by $33.7 million or 24.2% to $172.6 million in the first quarter due to increased activity levels in most of the segment service lines.
The Technical Services segment incurred a $5.8 million operating loss in the current quarter compared to an operating loss of $11.3 million in the prior quarter.
Our Support Services segment revenues increased by $310,000 or 3.2% to $10 million in the first quarter.
Operating loss was $2.9 million in the current quarter compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million in the prior quarter.
During the first quarter of 2021, RPC operated five horizontal pressure pumping fleets, the same as in the fourth quarter, but with improved utilization.
Due to high utilization of these existing fleets, we recently added one additional horizontal fleet to meet expected incremental demand.
First quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $11.8 million, and we currently estimate full year 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $55 million, comprised primarily of capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment and selected growth opportunities.
We are encouraged by how 2021 has started.
Activity levels and pricing have largely tracked our expectations coming into the year, and all signs point to a continued modest recovery as the year progresses.
We remain committed to capital discipline and do not plan to add incremental capacity until we have greater confidence that economic returns will justify the investment.
ESG has continued to grow as a topic of interest among many of our customers.
RPC aspires to be an environmentally friendly company.
We are adapting our operations to reduce emissions wherever possible.
We are in the final stages of upgrading another of our fleets to dual-fuel capability, after which 2/3 of our deployed frac capacity will be ESG-friendly.
However, for RPC and most of our competitors, the easy conversions are largely done.
Further ESP adaptation requires economics to improve before additional capital investments make financial sense.
While economics are not currently supportive of adding net capacity, the continued transition to ESG-friendly equipment is more likely to come from the replacement of older equipment than growth of capital expenditures.
At the end of the first quarter, RPC's cash balance was $85.4 million, and we remain debt-free.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined by John Garrison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Duffy Sheehan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance.
Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures can be found in the conference call materials.
Most importantly, I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy.
Throughout these challenging times, we are proud of all Terex team members who are keeping themselves and others safe, meeting the needs of customers and helping our communities.
Safety remains a top priority in the company, driven by Think Safe, Work Safe, Home Safe.
All Terex team members have contributed to our effort to continue to produce for our customers, while following the protocols and maintaining a safe working environment.
Before I discuss our Q1 results, I would like to review our commitment to ESG.
Environment, social and governance is not a new concept at Terex.
It has been front and center for many years through our Zero Harm safety program and our commitment to maintaining a vibrant and supportive working environment.
ESG is foundational to the Terex culture.
Our company purpose is to help improve people's lives.
Through our Terex Way Values, we are focused on strong governance, a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion at every level and supporting the communities where we live and work, including being responsible, environmental stewards.
First, strong governance and leadership.
Our independent and engaged board with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and experience adds value for all stakeholders.
Second, we've enhanced our DE&I governance and we are energized by the engagement of our team members.
And third, electrification, by interview using sustainable products, such as our new Genie electric drive scissors.
We've made good progress in our sustainability program, including publishing our first annual ESG report, which enhances our ESG communications.
We're working on standard reporting frameworks, which a group of company senior leaders are charged with implementing.
We will keep stakeholders apprised through our investor conferences and quarterly earnings calls.
We believe companies that recognize the importance of ESG are better able to identify strategic opportunities and meet competitive challenges.
Turning to slide five.
We're off to a very strong start to 2021.
Customer demand continued to increase during the quarter, resulting in revenues exceeding our expectations.
We increased operating margins and backlog in AWP and MP year-over-year.
We significantly improved our first quarter earnings per share compared to last year, and we are increasing our full year sales, operating profit, cash flow and earnings per share outlook.
Despite having to address supply chain challenges, AWP delivered improved margins in Q1.
Materials process continued its strong execution by overcoming supply disruptions and delivering increased sales and profitability.
As a result of the improved execution in both segments, year-over-year operating margins of the company improved by 800 basis points.
Our intense focus on net working capital management and improved profitability drove $40 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter, which is an excellent start to the year.
During the first quarter, our team continued to meet increased customer demand, tightly managed all costs and delivered outstanding positive free cash flow.
Overall, our Q1 financial performance demonstrated strong execution by our global team in the face of increasing supply chain challenges.
We continue to improve Terex's global cost competitiveness.
Our SG&A cost reduction initiative, with a target of full year 2021 of approximately 12.5% or better SG&A to sales remains on track.
We are maintaining strict cost discipline.
In addition, during the quarter, we announced the plan move of our Oklahoma City Teleh...
...for incremental margins, which meet or exceed our 25% target for the full year 2021.
Corporate and other costs will occur relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year.
On April 1st, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and unsecured bond.
These transactions will result in Q2 charges of $25 million, which were not previously included in our 2021 financial outlook.
Including $0.30 per share of costs for refinancing of our capital structure, our earnings per share outlook is increased to $2.35 to $2.55 per share, based on sales of approximately $3.7 billion.
Quarterly earnings per share are expected to be generally consistent with the development of operating profits during the year.
For the full year 2021, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $150 million, reflecting another year of positive cash generation.
We continue to plan for capital expenditures, net of asset dispositions of approximately $90 million.
The largest project included in capital expenditures is for the Genie Mexico manufacturing facility John referenced earlier.
Turning to slide 12, and I'll summarize our updated 2021 earnings per share outlook.
We expect the strong customer sentiment demonstrated in Q1 by our AWP and MP customers to continue throughout 2021.
Our 2021 full year earnings per share outlook comprehends, first, our Q1 outperformance.
Second, the operating profit contribution on additional revenue for Q2 through Q4.
Third, price and manufacturing efficiency, which is only partially offsetting increasing supply chain headwinds.
And finally, reduced interest expense and one-time capital structure charges of approximately $27 million, representing $0.30 per share.
Overall, our 2021 outlook represents a significant improvement in operating performance when compared to 2020.
We will continue to aggressively manage costs, while positioning the business for growth.
Turning to page 13, and I'll review our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
Our team members remain vigilant and will continue to aggressively manage production, especially within our AWP segment and scrutinize every expenditure.
The strong positive free cash flow of $40 million in the quarter demonstrates the hard work of our team members to tightly manage net working capital.
Terex has ample liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion available to us, with no near term debt maturities.
So, we can manage and grow the business.
As discussed during the Q1 earnings call, the proceeds from the sale of the TFS on book portfolio and our strong liquidity position allowed us to prepay $196 million of term loans in early February.
This prepayment resulted in reducing outstanding debt, lowering, leverage, and saving annual cash interest expense of approximately $7 million.
This deleveraging action resulted in a rating agency upgrading Terex's outlook and providing positive momentum for refinancing our capital structure.
Our refinancing included successfully renewing our $600 million revolving credit facility and placing 600 million of new bonds with a 5% coupon.
These new bonds replaced our 5.625% bonds due to mature in 2025 and reduce annual cash interest expense by approximately $4 million.
Importantly, Terex obtained lower costs, unsecured funding for the remainder of this decade.
This strong action demonstrates our commitment to improving Terex balance sheet, while maintaining flexibility to execute on our organic and inorganic growth plans.
Turning to slide 14, to wrap up our remarks.
Terex team members around the world are focused on the right things, safety, health, customers, and improve productivity.
End markets are strong, and the team is managing the increasing supply chain headwinds.
We're driving positive free cash flow.
We're continuing to invest in innovative products to meet increased customer demand.
We are focused on both organic and inorganic growth.
As a result of these actions, Terex is well-positioned to deliver strong 2021 results.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I guess I'd first say that it's pretty clear the diversity and the relevancy of our offerings as well as the outstanding effort from our colleagues has resulted in another great quarter.
Our strategy and efforts are clearly yielding results as we delivered a 70% increase in fee revenue with really strong profitability, earnings per share of $1.37 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.7%, and these results are the continuation of our momentum over recent quarters and our performance speaks to our agility and importantly to the purpose for decisions and deliberate actions we've taken not only over the last few quarters but over the last several years, and now they've come together in a critical mass of opportunity.
As a result, today's Korn Ferry is poised to seek the opportunities of tomorrow.
And those opportunities begin with a world of work that's in a massive state of transition and maybe always will be.
Companies reimagining their businesses, from strategy, to people, to culture, career Nomads, aging demographics, a real war for talent, work from anywhere, anytime, and last but not least, the digitization of everything.
These are the features of our new landscape of work.
And we don't see that changing anytime soon.
In response, companies are rethinking their org structures, their roles, responsibilities, how they compensate, engage, motivate and upscale their workforce, as well as the type of agile talent they hire and how they hire that talent, and they're all going to need to lead differently.
And as I said, this new world is creating opportunities for Korn Ferry.
The mega changes that I described align very nicely with our businesses.
Today, wherever and whenever leadership meets talent, Korn Ferry is at that cross section, enabling agility in a world in transition and driving performance for our clients.
To position our Company for long-term success, we remain relentlessly focused on this dynamic world of work.
Our scaled capabilities include org strategy, leadership and professional development, assessment, succession and rewards and talent acquisition, and of course, the judgment and expertise built from decades of experience and insight into the questions companies are grappling with across industries.
We're going to continue to drive an integrated go-to-market strategy through our marquee and regional accounts, which represent about 35% of our portfolio.
And this facilitates not only growth and enduring partnerships, but also is key to more scalable and durable revenues.
In the quarter, about 30% of our revenue was driven by cross referrals, an all-time high, which I think demonstrates the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.
Today, the fight for talent is absolutely more profound than we've ever seen.
This new world is driving a robust market for our talent acquisition expertise, from Executive Search to Pro Search to RPO, we're helping companies find the right talent, fitting the right needs.
And looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we've been actively marrying our capability with today's mega trends.
The result is larger projects with greater sustainability and more durable revenue, in areas such as D&I and organizational transformation, as well as core solutions such as assessment, pay and governance, and leadership and professional development.
Looking ahead, I truly feel we have the right strategy with the right people at the right time to help our clients drive performance in this new world, and our results are clearly affirming this belief.
With that, I am joined by Gregg Kvochak and Bob Rozek.
Our financial results in the first quarter were outstanding and they continue to push to new highs.
Our unique mix of organizational consulting solutions continue to grow in relevance and it gives us a greater share of strengthening global markets.
Clients are embracing our solutions to help them navigate today's unprecedented and rapidly changing work and social environment, and that's driving our...
...quarter.
Globally, fee revenue was $139.3 million, which was up 103% year-over-year and approximately $19 million or 16% sequentially.
Both RPO and Professional Search continued to take advantage of the surge in demand for skilled professional labor.
RPO fee revenue grew approximately 98% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, while Professional Search fee revenue was up approximately 112% year-over-year and up 24% sequentially.
New business wins for both RPO and Professional Search were also extremely strong in the first quarter.
Professional Search new business was up 14% sequentially and RPO was awarded $113 million of new contracts consisting of $45 million of renewals and extensions and $68 million of new logo work.
Adjusted EBITDA for RPO and Professional Search continue to scale in the first quarter, improving to $34 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.4%.
Finally in the first quarter, global fee revenue for Executive Search reached a new all-time high of $217 million, which was up 81% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.
Growth was also broad based and led by North America, which grew 100% year-over-year and over 6% sequentially.
Our international regions continue to accelerate sequentially.
Fee revenue in EMEA and APAC were up approximately 4% and 22%, respectively.
We continue to aggressively invest in expanding our network of consultants in the first quarter.
The total number of dedicated Executive Search consultants worldwide at the end of the first quarter was 565, up 55 year-over-year and up 41 sequentially, including 22 colleagues who were recently promoted.
Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the first quarter improved to a record $1.59 million and the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the first quarter was up 57% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to 1,745.
In the first quarter, global Executive Search adjusted EBITDA grew to approximately $61.6 million, which was up $53.5 million year-over-year and up $11.7 million or 23.5% sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 28.4%.
As I mentioned, new business in the first quarter grew to a new all-time high.
So we're really starting the second quarter with a strong backlog of work.
Now August is historically a seasonal month influenced by summer vacations, but new business for August was up approximately 41% year-over-year and was in line with our expectations.
Now if monthly trends in each of our lines of business are consistent with historical patterns and market conditions remained strong, we expect demand to continue to accelerate with new business up sequentially in September, peaking at a quarter high in October.
Additionally, as previously discussed, we're going to continue to make near term investments in consultants and execution staff to fuel future growth and we do expect employee productivity to remain strong and G&A spend to remain at or near current levels in the second quarter, keeping both earnings and profitability strong.
Now assuming no major Delta variant related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets or foreign exchange rates, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '22 to range from $585 million to $615 million and our consolidated diluted earnings per share to range from $1.30 to $1.44.
Now as we've begun our new fiscal year, we continue on a path of strong financial performance, leaving no doubt about our strategy or the durability of our business model.
Today, we stand alone in industry of one, going to market with unique end-to-end organizational consulting solutions that continue to grow in relevance.
Our robust new business generation over the past six months is a true barometer of marketplace recognition.
Korn Ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies, colleagues, clients, candidates and shareholders for years to come.
With that, we would be glad to answer any questions you may have.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate you joining us for our third-quarter earnings call.
Moving to Slide 3.
I'll share a few updates on regulatory and ESG-related matters.
And Joe will then provide a more detailed overview of the third-quarter financial results.
Turning to Slide 4.
Today, we announced third-quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share.
based on the 2020 Finance Act and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges.
Third-quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.61 per share a year ago.
At a high level, results for the quarter were in line with our expectations.
I'll note that the lower earnings, compared to last year include $0.02 of lower volumes in the U.K., which will recover in future periods.
And $0.01 due to the timing of our estimated federal income tax computation, which will reverse in Q4.
Joe will cover the financial results in more detail in his section.
Regarding a COVID update, throughout the quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, providing outstanding customer service and reliability.
At the same time, we've remained focused on innovation and building for the future.
In September, we launched the new digitalization strategy in the U.K. The strategy focuses on transforming the way we develop and operate the network to empower customers drive greater efficiency and deliver faster decarbonization.
And in Pennsylvania, during Q3, we reached the $1 million mark for customer outages avoided as a result of our investments in automated power restoration technology.
Regarding customer sales during the quarter, residential load continued to be strong than our weather-normalized forecast, driven by sustained work-from-home measures in all of our service territories.
Conversely, C&I demand remained lower in all three business units albeit less pronounced in Q3 than it had been earlier in the pandemic.
From a financial perspective, we are well-positioned to weather the continued economic downturn.
We've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion.
Our cash receipts remain steady and our capital plans remain largely intact.
And as the moratoria are starting to lift across our U.S. service territories, we will comply with all state utility commission requirements and continue to work with our customers to maintain uninterrupted electricity and gas service.
This means offering flexible payment plans, connecting our customers with agencies and programs that can provide assistance and working with them to address overdue balances before they become unmanageable.
Service terminations are always a last resort.
Overall, we continue to believe the full-year impact of COVID-19 will be manageable as we close out the year.
As a result, we've narrowed our forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from the prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
We continue to expect to track toward the lower end of this guidance range due to the impacts of COVID-19 and warmer than normal weather during the first quarter.
sale process remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of 2021.
Moving to Slide 5, and starting with key regulatory developments.
On October 1, WPD responded to Ofgem's RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology consultation, advocating for the continuation of a strong incentive-based regulatory regime that supports the best outcomes for our customers in terms of low prices and high-quality service.
We believe RIIO-ED1 largely achieved this balance and that the basic structure of the RIIO-ED1 regime should broadly remain intact under ED2.
WPD's response to the consultation focused on several areas, where we believe Ofgem should reconsider its position and the robustness of its supporting evidence before making its methodology decision.
In the end, we continue to believe that Ofgem has made it clear that DNOs will be critical to supporting decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy.
Based on our d...
...of COVID-19 offset by factors that were individually not significant.
Results at corporate and other were $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher income taxes due to timing, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 7.
We again outlined the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class as we did last quarter.
And like Q2, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories.
Demand in the C&I sector, while still lower than last year, has been steadily recovering as certain COVID restrictions have been lifted.
In Pennsylvania, demand improved from about an 11% decline in C&I load in the second quarter to a 4% decline during Q3 compared to a year ago.
C&I declines in Pennsylvania continue to be primarily in retail trade and services industry and manufacturing, respectively.
Our large industrial customers have generally returned to pre-COVID operations and are not expecting future reductions at this time.
Our Kentucky segment reported about a 7% C&I load decline during Q3, compared to the greater than 14% decline we saw last quarter versus the prior year.
And like Pennsylvania, the services industry, such as restaurants, retail and hotels continue to be negatively impacted in our commercial sector in Kentucky.
Much of the improvement we experienced during Q3 was on the industrial side as many manufacturing companies were able to reopen after temporarily being forced to shut down in Q2.
Specifically, industrial volumes were driven in part by auto manufacturing volumes returning to pre-COVID levels.
Coal mining and non-auto manufacturing continue to be more negatively affected.
Finally, in the U.K., C&I load improved to about a 14% decline in the third quarter, compared to a 20% decline that we experienced last quarter versus a year ago as government restrictions put in place in late March were further eased throughout the month of July.
The primary driver of the increase was seen in the large industrial and manufacturing sectors that have largely closed during the full lockdown phase and have since opened, albeit not quite the pre-COVID levels.
It's clear on this slide that the U.K. demand has not recovered as sharply as our U.S. service territories which underscores the value of the effective decoupling mechanism there.
We remain encouraged by the recovery we have observed in each of our service territories during the third quarter, but we'll continue to monitor load impacts as we move into the winter months, including the impact of additional temporary lockdowns should they arise, such as the lockdowns we are currently experiencing in England and Wales.
At this time, the current lockdown is not as stringent as what we experienced early in the year as workers that are not able to work from home can still go to work and many retail establishments can still provide takeout options.
In addition, strong residential demand is expected to continue to act as a hedge to lower C&I demand.
Now I know I just stated a lot of percentages.
So let me take a moment to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing results in 2020.
We experienced a $0.10 per share impact to the end of the third quarter.
The remaining $0.03 is primarily from lower demand in Kentucky, and we have been able to offset the majority of that through effective cost management.
Overall, we believe our strong regulatory constructs, balanced rate structures and customer mix, positions PPL well to continue to operate at a high level in this challenging environment.
In closing, I remain very proud of how our teams across PPL have risen to the challenge of COVID-19.
We continue to deliver electricity and gas safely and reliably to our customers.
At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on innovation and continuous improvement as we position the company for future success.
With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today's call will also include non-GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Third quarter net income of $34.1 million produced core earnings per share of $0.36, accompanied by core return on assets of 1.43% and core pre-tax pre-provision ROA of 1.79%.
This was a very good quarter for First Commonwealth with solid profitability, growth in credit metrics.
Other headlines for the quarter include first, excluding PPP loan payoffs, we're pleased with loan growth of 8.2% or $132.3 million in the third quarter with ongoing strength in indirect lending, home equity lending, commercial lending and mortgage lending.
Our growth is broad-based between commercial and retail lending disciplines and has become increasingly granular over the years.
As an aside, our loan growth over the first -- over the last two quarters has not yet benefited from higher line of credit utilization.
Second, the loan growth and improved margin enabled a $2.4 million quarter-over-quarter increase in net interest income to $70.9 million.
Jim will have more color on the net interest margin.
Third, non-interest income or fees grew $1.2 million quarter-over-quarter to $27.2 million on the strength of improvement in SBA and mortgage gain on sale income as well as higher wealth management income.
Importantly, our card-related interchange business generated $7.1 million in fee income.
Our regional business model has been a strong contributor to fee income growth with better teamwork and collaboration enabling us to deliver a broader set of solutions for our clients.
Fourth, our efficiency ratio increased to 55.27% as core non-interest expense rose some $3.7 million, primarily due to higher personnel expense, including higher incentive accruals based upon increased production, higher wages, particularly in entry level positions driven by inflationary pressure, higher hospitalization expense and then the hiring of the management team of the equipment finance division.
It is increasingly clear that we are not immune to expense headwinds in the current environment.
Fifth and importantly on the credit side, we guided last quarter to stronger credit metrics in the second half of the year in 2021.
That's exactly what is happening.
The third quarter represented our lowest loan charge-offs in nine quarters, a decrease in specific reserves for troubled credits coupled with general improvement in economic conditions led to a provision of just $330,000 down from $5.4 million in the second quarter.
Our reserves now represent 1.3% of total loans, excluding PPP and a 247% of non-performing loans.
The level of non-performing loans improved significantly from $52.8 million in the second quarter to just $38.1 million in the third quarter or 56 basis points of total loans.
Similarly, non-performing assets of $39 million at quarter end now stand at 41 basis points of total assets.
Subsequent to quarter end in early October a $6.9 million troubled credit was resolved and will be reflected in Q4 results.
Other notable third quarter items follow.
First Commonwealth earned the number one SBA lender ranking in Pittsburgh for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021.
This is a significant accomplishment and reflective of both the talent in the SBA lending team coupled with the partnership enabled by the regional business model alluded to earlier.
In the third quarter, we continued to transform our technology to include the selection of a new loan origination system, as well as introducing several new cash management solutions or TM Solutions for our business clients.
We continue to be pleased with our adoption of our new mobile banking app, which is growing at an annualized rate of 18%.
As we work through our three year strategic plan, I would share three of our six areas of focus that might be most relevant to investors.
First, this accelerates the growth trajectory...
...oint to 3.19%.
We think that the core NIM has bottomed out and should drift upwards from here as we redeploy excess cash into loans.
Our cost of deposits in the third quarter was down to only 6 basis points.
I'm pleased to report that our last remaining tranche of high cost deposits totaling $52 million at a cost of 1.65% repriced on October 13 subsequent to quarter end.
That alone will save us nearly $1 million a year in interest expense at about a point of NIM.
We will reap the benefit of that starting in the fourth quarter.
With that behind us, we're down to about $400 million in time deposits remaining at a cost of 36 basis points, three quarters of which will mature by the end of 2022.
So while some deposit repricing opportunity remains we are very far along in repricing our entire deposit book leaving us very well-positioned if rates rise.
With that in mind, we've taken a hard look at the deposit beta assumptions in our interest rate and risk sensitivity calculations.
In light of unprecedented levels of liquidity, we are revising our interest rate risk assumptions to reflect the ability to lag deposit rate increases for the first two 25 basis point rate hikes.
The result will be what we believe to be a more accurate picture of our asset sensitivity in the current environment.
You'll see this in our IRR tables once we published our 10-Q but to give you a preview a 100 basis point parallel shock will show an increase in the first year net interest income of over 5%.
That's roughly double the previous level of sensitivity so we wanted to explain the reason for the change.
Even without a rate hike however the NIM story in 2022 will be driven by the redeployment of excess cash and loans especially since we believe that deposit balances will remain relatively stable throughout 2022 and any loan growth above cash levels can be funded by cash flow from the securities portfolio.
This effectively rotates lower earning assets into higher earning ones.
This asset rotation should benefit NIM in 2022 even if rates don't rise and then if rates do rise our asset sensitivity will kick in and expand the margin even further.
Turning now to fee income; fee income of $27.2 million in the quarter remains a bright spot and seems to be one aspect of our company that is consistently underappreciated.
There's been talk of slowdown in mortgage all year but our mortgage gain on sale income actually increased by $400,000 over the last quarter.
SBA is another fee income engine that continues to gain momentum now that PPP is mostly behind us with SBA gear and sale income up by $700,000 from last quarter to $2.4 million.
Card related interchange income continues at new record levels for us of approximately $7 million a quarter, and deposit service charges after the off pace for much of the pandemic due to heightened cash levels and customer accounts have returned to more normalized levels.
Turning to non-interest expense, last quarter, our guidance was $53 million to $54 million, and we came in at $55 million for the reasons Mike described.
Like many of our peers, we are experiencing expense pressures mostly related to people costs like salaries and benefits.
While there are some normal variability and costs quarter-to-quarter, it's difficult to see NIE falling from current levels.
Fortunately, the pace of our loan growth gives us confidence that our revenue can outpace expense growth.
Finally, we repurchased 997,517 shares of stock during the third quarter at an average price of $13.35.
While we ended the quarter with approximately $10.3 million remaining of our $25 million share repurchase authorization we are also pleased to announce that our board authorized an additional $25 million share repurchase authorization yesterday.
We increased the authorization so that we could have repurchase authority available to redeploy expected excess capital generation in the fourth quarter and into next year.
And with that, we'll take any questions you may have.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We're obviously quite content to being able to provide black numbers, maybe to the surprise of many of you.
Q1 '21 was a fairly quiet quarter corporate-wise as we are in a good position financially and no major transactions were concluded during the quarter.
We continue from Frontline a high focus on the well-being of our seafarers as they are out there being exposed to the global ebb and flow of COVID-19 infections.
Our technical and operations team are doing a fantastic job in mitigating the challenges that arise and I'm very happy to report that they are well under way in vaccinating our sailors.
Let's move to Slide 3 and have a look at the highlights.
The Q1 '21 performance is very much a testament to keeping true to our strategy.
Being mostly spot exposed and not expecting an imminent recovery in the market, our charter investment remains true to trading the ships in a month where we allow our vessels to commit to long voyages securing income but potentially giving away upside.
Our modern fuel-efficient fleet is built for this purpose and it also gives us this flexibility.
This proved to be the right call.
In the first quarter of 2021, we made $19,000 per day our VLCC fleet, $15,000 per day on our Suezmax fleet, and $12,000 per day on our LR2/Aframax fleet.
So far in Q1, we have booked 70% of our VLCC days at $18,100 per day, 63% of our Suezmax days have $13,600 per day, and 59% of LR2/Aframax days have $14,200 per day.
All these numbers in the table are on the load to this chart basis.
Before Inger takes you through the financial highlights, let me quickly comment on the fleet development as well.
We took delivery of two of our four LR2s coming this year.
Front Fusion and Front Future in March and April respectively, bringing our number of LR2s on the water to 20.
Further, subsequently, we confirmed acquisition through the resale of six high-spec ECO-scrubbers fleet of VLCCs to be delivered from Hyundai Heavy Industries in Korea.
Five in 2022 and one early in 2023.
I'll now let Inger take you through the financial highlights.
Let's turn the slide to Slide 4 and look at the income statement.
As I said, we are happy to report numbers in black, and Frontline achieved total operating revenues and work expenses of $107 million in the first quarter.
We also have an adjusted EBITDA of $59 million and net income of $28.9 nine million, or $0.15 per share.
Further, we have an adjusted net income of $8.8 million or $0.04 cents per share.
The adjustments consist of a $15.7 million gain on derivatives, a $3.1 million unrealized gain on marketable securities, a $1.2 million on amortization on acquired time charters, and $0.1 million results of associated companies.
The adjusted net income in the first quarter has increased by $21 million compared with the previous quarter.
The increase was driven by a decrease in ship operating expenses of $11 million, mainly as a result of $6.4 million lower dry-docking fund.
We also had an increase of cash and cash equivalents of $6.4 million and that was due to the prior TCE rates, as well as we had a $11.2 million decrease in other costs.
Let us then take a look at the balance sheet on Slide 5.
The total balance sheet numbers have increased by $10 million in the first quarter.
The balance sheet movements in the quarter were related to taking delivery of the energy sector from Fusion in addition to ordinary debt payments and depreciation.
As of March 31, 2021, Frontline had $318 million in cash and cash equivalents including undrawn amounts under our senior unsecured loan facility, marketable securities, and minimal cash requirements.
Let's then take a closer look on Slide 6 on the cash breakeven rates and the opex.
We estimate that risk cash costs break-even rate will remain for 2021 of approximately $21,500 per day for VLCC, $17,700 for days for the Suezmax tankers, and $15,900 per day for LR2 tankers.
This gave a fleet average of about $18,100 per day.
These rates, they are all-in day rates.
Tha...
...
So let's move on to Slide 8 and look at the tanker order books.
On all asset classes, we are observing delayed recycling.
We see very little support for keeping older tonnage in this market.
But they remain in the fleets.
Recycling prices are up 30% year to date and are now count being negotiated around %550 per long ton or $23 million for a VLCC.
This is, to some extent, being outcompeted by the fact that we continue to see demand for vintage tonnage from undisclosed price -- buyers with relatively firm prices.
The overall tanker order book has shrunk year to date by approximately 4%.
This as vessels deliver and new ordering has been fairly muted.
We've seen on the VLCC's 20 new -- 28 new orders placed, but as 25 vessels are delivered at the same time, the order book remains to be fairly flat.
The VLCC order book stands at around 9% of the existing fleet, and the overall order book for tankers is up to around 7% of the existing fleet.
Let's move to Slide 9 and recap what's going on the asset prices.
So the asset prices are on the move.
We have, over the last six months, see more -- seen more than 170 new orders for containerships.
We've also seen quite some ordering on LPG.
And also seeing confirmation of LNG orders, which has further contributed to the activity.
And in line with the entire commodity space, steel prices have appreciated sharply.
The fundamentals of the tanker market suggest a tightening of capacity over the coming years.
And the regulatory tightening in respect of greenhouse gas emissions further supports the case of investing in modern fuel-efficient ships.
Propulsion is yet not the driver.
Right now, it's the yard capacity or rather the lack of it which is driving prices together with the steel.
So let's move to Slide 10 and look at the short-term outlook.
So we're currently right in the middle of OPEC plus productions increasing.
They are increasing somewhat slowly, but they are adding to transportation demand.
Currently, Asia, and in particular, China, are coming out of refinery maintenance.
And oil demand continues to recover.
and Europe in focus as we're coming out of lockdowns.
Inventories, both on land and floating, are now normalized and at pre-COVID-19 levels.
From where we are now, according to EIA, oil supply is expected to grow by 6 million barrels by year-end.
If you look at the graph on the left-hand side below, we see that most of these increases are expected to happen basically from where we stand now and over the summer.
The key to the demand bounces in 2021, you can find on the right-hand side.
We know that gasoline demand fell by 3.3 million barrels per day in 2020.
And it's now expected to grow by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2021.
For jet, it's affected the crude oil balances by 3.2 million barrels per day and negative in 2020 and about 1.3 million barrels per day is expected to return this year.
For diesel, we're actually adding more than we lost, 1.2 million barrels per day.
For fuel oil, we're keeping at level.
Other kind of uses of oil is also linked to this at 0.7 million barrels per day.
Let's move over to Slide 11 and my summary.
So basically, to wrap this up, all key macro indicators points toward a firm recovery.
And global GDP is expected up 6% this year.
Asset prices are on the move as yard capacity is tightening and steel prices are increasing.
I've just mentioned, global oil supply is expected to grow by 6 million barrels by the end of 2021.
The COVID-19 vaccination pace in the developed countries is very encouraging and countries are opening up.
We can see on the graph below, which indicates activity within the various key segments of the shipping sector.
That the cyclical recovery run has started.
All key shipping sectors are firm.
The tankers are lagging.
Frontline is ideally positioned to capitalize on the anticipated recovery in tanker markets with our modern, spot-exposed, fuel-efficient fleet.
And with that, I would like to open up for question-and-answer session.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is Allison Lausas, vice president and chief accounting officer for IDEX Corporation.
The format for today's call is as follows.
We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business and an overview of our end-market performance.
Bill will then discuss our third-quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021.
Finally, Eric will conclude with an update on the IDEX Difference.
Before we begin, a brief reminder.
It's a pleasure to have you on the team.
Mike helped lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization and his work has had a long-lasting impact on the business.
On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors.
Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on Slide 6.
We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter.
Our localized sourcing, production, and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor, and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business.
Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion.
They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers.
At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds.
Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022.
We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth, and our critical business priorities.
I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products.
Overall, the price actions that we took over the past six months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price/cost spread increase sequentially.
We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments.
Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong.
we set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales, and backlog.
Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year.
Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas.
Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well.
Over the past five or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term.
Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market.
We brought three optics facilities together, and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers.
We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies.
These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well-positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward.
On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well.
ABEL Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations.
The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy.
Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business.
Our M&A funnel is healthy.
Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term.
In the end, we are focused on delivering and gr...
...icant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter.
We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year.
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.
I'm on Slide 11.
For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.55 to $1.58.
We expect organic revenue growth of nine to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%.
Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments, seasonality, and the potential for year-end logistics challenges.
The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%.
We expect about 0.5% of top-line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around 19 million.
Turning to the full year.
We are narrowing our full-year earnings per share guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33.
We are also maintaining our full-year organic growth of 11 to 12%.
We expect operating margins of approximately 24%.
We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top-line results.
The full-year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around 65 million, in line with our previous guidance.
Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments.
And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year.
Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges.
Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide earnings per share guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization.
We believe reporting adjusted earnings per share on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey.
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.
I'm on the final slide, Slide 12.
Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams.
First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our non-executive chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors.
Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years.
His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor.
Turning to the IDEX Foundation.
Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.
Various U.S.-based business units have supported their local boys and girls clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement.
Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one boys and girls club location.
This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community.
Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture.
Our annual September engagement survey just came back.
And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions in unexpected turns, we held study and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies.
Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Jim Hatfield, Chief Administrative Officer; Daniel Froetscher, APS's President and COO; and Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy, are also here with us.
First, I need to cover a few details with you.
Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.
It will also be available by telephone through May 15.
Before I get started, let me say, I hope everyone is doing well.
This is certainly an unexpected way to start our year, but the last several weeks have only reaffirmed to me that our company and our people are resilient, agile and prepared to handle whatever comes our way.
We recognize the realities of COVID-19 and the challenges that people are facing, and we remain committed, first and foremost, to safely delivering reliable power to Arizona, building shareholder value by ensuring customer value.
In March, we made the decision to deploy as much of our workforce as possible to work from home and to change our work practices for those essential workers needed to keep the lights on for our customers and to prepare for the Arizona summer.
The transition from normal course of business to social distancing and revised safety procedures was seamless from our reliability standpoint and for our customers.
While our processes have changed, our priorities have not.
From a financial perspective, our strengths lie on a strong balance sheet, good credit rating and sufficient liquidity.
We can and will weather the storm.
We recognize that in order to serve both our customers and our shareholders, it is important to maintain our financial health.
Financial stability is a key driver in our decision-making, and it's essential to support our long-term goals.
Operationally, the rigor of our preparation and the strength of our team position us well to navigate the challenges presented by COVID-19.
Our pandemic plan was established, tested, refined and rehearsed before any of the COVID-19 impact began to hit us.
As I mentioned earlier, we've transitioned as many employees as possible to working from home.
I'll note, that includes over 140 call center associates who we moved very quickly to seamlessly continue to provide customer service from their homes, and that includes the oversight folks as well, an incredible job by the IT group there, as well as our field employees who continue to prepare for our peak summer season.
All necessary summer preparedness work, including vegetation management and planned outages at our power plants, have continued.
In an effort to minimize the duration of those outages and the number of people required to be physically present, we prioritized essential work and deferred some discretionary maintenance until later in the year.
I'm pleased to share that we completed the Palo Verde Unit two refueling outage earlier this week, ensuring that this key resource will be available to serve customers this summer.
The refueling outage had a reduced scope to allow the completion of the essential work, with 40% less contractors than normal.
In addition, we've deferred nonessential transmission and distribution work that would require more than a two hour planned outage to our residential customers during this time.
We are grateful for the support we've received from so many who've helped our employees stay safe, including Armored Outdoor Gear, one of our commercial customers in Flagstaff.
We were able to quickly secure 3,000 masks for APS, including an expedited quantity of 300 for Palo Verde employees at a time when masks were harder to come by.
It was really a win-win situation.
We were able to keep our employees safe and, at the same time, support our local economy.
Based on what we've seen so far in energy usage and customer load growth, and Ted will talk more about this, but we know that circumstances will continue to evolve.
Our resource plans for additional generation remain in place.
We expect to announce the results of outstanding wind and solar request for propos...
...er year.
Just five of the automations planned for the first part of this year are expected to produce an NPV benefit of $1.8 million over the next five years.
These examples and our focus on reducing costs will serve us well, not just through the interim challenges, but also in achieving our long-term goals of providing customers with affordable and reliable service.
While total sales will likely continue to lag during the duration of the stay-at-home period, we remain confident in the long-term growth of our service territory.
According to the Arizona Technology Council's quarterly impact report, Arizona tech sector is growing at a rate 40% faster than the U.S. overall.
Metro Phoenix area showed strong job growth through February of 2020, which has consistently been above the national average.
Through February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.2% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 5.4%, and manufacturing employment increased by 2.1%.
This data reflects pre COVID-19 conditions, and we expect to see the 2.2% customer growth rate we experienced in the first quarter to slow in the near term.
However, the qualities and fundamentals that I mentioned that have consistently attracted residents to Arizona, including a low cost of living, attractive weather and robust employment opportunities, remain intact and likely to continue supporting long-term growth after the economy normalizes.
In regard to our future capital investments, we remain committed to the $4.7 billion capex forecast for the 2020 through 2022 time frame, largely driven by clean energy investments.
Information regarding COVID-19 and the potential impact is fluid and changing rapidly.
We will continue to assess our capex plans, load forecast, sales expectations, O&M and other financial data points as more information becomes available.
We recognize there are potential scenarios where COVID-19 impacts could necessitate changes in the timing or scope of our investment plans.
However, as of today, we do not believe the limited load reductions experienced thus far require any alterations to our long-term plans.
Similarly, we continue to believe 2020 Pinnacle West consolidated earnings of $4.75 to $4.95 per share remain achievable, assuming the impacts for COVID-19 dissipate by the end of the second quarter, and customer and sales growth resumes once the economy normalizes.
Additional O&M savings are also being assessed by our management team to mitigate the impact from lost revenue.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance can be found on slides three and four.
Another advantage for Pinnacle West is our financial health.
We have a strong balance sheet, A- credit rating, well-funded pensions, sufficient liquidity and no equity needs in 2020.
We currently have $1.2 billion in revolver capacity with an option to increase by another $500 million.
As of May 1, we have drawn down $310 million on our revolvers.
In addition, all remaining Pinnacle West long-term debt maturing in 2020 will occur in November and December, and APS's $200 million term loan matures in August.
With all the long-term maturities falling late in the year, we have ample flexibility to assess the market conditions and evaluate our options.
Further, at year-end 2019, our pension was 97% funded.
With our liability driven investment strategy, our pension was 96.4% funded as of March 31, 2020, highlighting our resilience to the market volatility.
Last week, we proudly celebrated 136 years of service to Arizona customers and communities, and we've been through plenty of challenges before.
As Jeff mentioned, we were well prepared for this current challenge.
We started from a position of financial strength.
The seasonality of our jurisdiction and the exceptional skills and sophistication of our team give us confidence that we will effectively navigate the near term and continue to work toward our long-term commitments.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated, depending on a variety of risk factors.
As I have said the last couple of quarters, I want to start by saying that first and foremost, our thoughts are for the safety and well-being of all those dealing with the impact of this virus.
Overall, we're pleased with the results of our first quarter, which came in mostly as expected from a top line perspective.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $446.9 million, down 4% from our fiscal 2020 first quarter.
These results were impacted by a strong quarter from both the nuclear and cleanroom operations of our Specialty Garments segment.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.20, which exceeded our expectations as many variable expenses trended lower than our projections.
As we have discussed, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and services.
We believe the need and demand for hygienically clean garments and work environments positions our company well to support the evolving economic landscape.
Like many businesses, we expect the quarters ahead to be uneven and bumpy, but we continue to be confident in the Company's position to weather the storm.
We also continue to position our sales resources to take advantages of opportunities that exist in the market today and as the economy recovers.
Some positive trends of note for the quarter include new business installs at roughly the same level as the first quarter a year ago, as well as improved customer retention.
In addition, although reductions in wearers continue at higher than normal levels, the significant reductions experienced in our energy-dependent markets during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 have started to moderate.
Overall, the outlook continues to be difficult to forecast.
Vaccine optimism is being balanced by uncertainty as to when and how quickly the vaccine will create positive movement in the economy.
In addition, the recent surge in positive COVID cases has started to cause increased business restrictions in certain states, provinces and municipalities.
The impact of these or further potential restrictions could have an impact on our results moving forward.
As a result of the ongoing uncertainty, we will not be providing any guidance at this time.
As we've talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, infrastructure and technologies.
All of our investments designed to deliver solid long-term returns to all UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components to our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry.
Our solid balance sheet positions us well to meet the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to invest in growth and strengthen our business.
Certain investments scheduled for this year will continue as planned including the deployment of our new CRM system.
As we've talked about before, some of these investments will pressure on margins in the near term.
However, we feel strongly that keeping these improvements to our company on schedule, will be critical to our long-term success.
As Steve mentioned, in our first quarter of 2021, consolidated revenues were $446.9 million, down 4% from $465.4 million a year ago and consolidated operating income decreased to $56 million from $60.1 million or 6.7%.
Net income for the quarter decreased to $41.9 million or $2.20 per diluted share from $48.2 million or $2.52 per diluted share.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 25% compared to 22.1% in the prior year which unfavorably impacted the earnings per share comparison.
Our Core Laundry operations revenues for the quarter were $393.2 million, down 5.6% from the first quarter of 2020.
Core Laundry organic growth, which adjusts for the estimated effect of acquisitions as...
...r year or 14.2%.
This increase was primarily due to higher direct sales and project-related work in the U.S. and Canadian nuclear operations as well as continued growth in the clean room operations.
Segment's operating margin increased to 18.8% from 14.6%.
This increase was primarily due to lower production and delivery costs as a percentage of revenues as well as lower travel-related, healthcare and energy costs.
These items were partially offset by higher merchandise expense as a percentage of revenues.
The Specialty Garments' quarterly top line and profit performance significantly exceeded our expectations as certain direct sales and project related work that had been deferred in the second half of fiscal 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic were finally realized as well as some additional direct sale activity that was anticipated later in fiscal 2021 came through early.
As we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services.
Our First Aid segment's revenues were $15.5 million compared to $15.7 million in prior year.
However, the segment's operating profit was nominal compared to $1.4 million in the comparable period of 2020.
This decrease is primarily due to reduced sales from the segment's higher margin wholesale business combined with continued investment in the Company's initiative to expand its first aid van business into new geographies.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $473 million at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2021.
For the first three months of fiscal 2021, capital expenditures totaled $41.8 million as we continue to invest in our future with new facility additions, expansions, updates and automation systems that will help us meet our long-term strategic objectives.
Our quarterly capex spend was elevated primarily due to the purchase of a building in New York City for $14.1 million, which will provide us a strategic location for a future service center.
During the quarter, we capitalized $2.9 million related to our ongoing CRM project which consisted of license fees, third-party consulting costs and capitalized internal labor costs.
As of the end of our quarter, we had capitalized a total of $25.5 million related to the CRM project.
As discussed on our last call, we are piloting a number of locations and expect that we will start a broader deployment in the second half of this fiscal year, at which time we will begin depreciating the system.
Eventually, the depreciation of the system combined with additional hardware we will install to support our new capabilities, like mobile handheld devices for our route drivers, will ramp to an estimated $6 million to $7 million of additional depreciation expense per year.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we repurchased 41,000 common shares for a total of $7.2 million under our previously announced stock repurchase program.
As of November 28, 2021 [Phonetic], the Company had repurchased a total of 355,917 common shares for $59.5 million under the program.
As Steve discussed, due to continued uncertainty regarding how states, provinces, municipalities and our customers will respond to the recent surge in positive COVID cases, as well as how quickly the vaccine will provide pandemic relief to the economy, we will not be providing guidance at this time.
However, I will remind you that our second fiscal quarter tends to be a lower margin quarter due to the seasonality of certain expenses that we incur.
As we have done in our recent quarters, we also wanted to provide you an update on our current revenue trends.
Throughout December, the weekly rental billings in our Core Laundry operations have been trending down compared to the comparable weeks in prior year by approximately 3.5% to 4%.

[/INST] # UniFirst's Q1 financial performance met expectations, with revenues of $446.9 million and EPS of $2.20. The Core Laundry segment faced a 5.6% decline in revenue, while Specialty Garments exceeded expectations due to deferred revenue realization. First Aid's results were impacted by wholesale sales reduction. Despite margin pressure from investments, UniFirst remains financially strong with no long-term debt and investments totaling $473 million. The company faces ongoing uncertainty due to COVID-19, but has observed moderate reductions in wearers and strong new business installs.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our disclosures about comparable sales include sales from our full-price stores and e-commerce sites, and excludes sales associated with outlet stores and e-commerce flash clearance sales.
Just two weeks ago, I would have wanted to spend a good amount of time on our fiscal 2019 results and share with you the details of our exciting plans for 2020.
With the recent events associated with the COVID-19 outbreak that no longer seems as relevant.
First and foremost, our thoughts are with the people who have been affected by the COVID-19 virus as well as everyone who is working to protect and serve impacted communities.
During these unprecedented times, our priority is and will continue to be the health and well-being of our employees, our customers and the communities in which we live and work.
To the extent it provides a framework for our current environment, I'm going to spend just a moment on our fiscal 2019 results and then spend the rest of our time on how we are responding to the current environment.
Our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 were fairly consistent with fiscal 2018.
However, looking at our performance in more detail shows that big strides were made in the right place.
Our direct businesses which are 70% of our sales were strong with positive comps in all quarters of the year by brand and on a consolidated basis.
Importantly, our e-commerce business led the charge with 10% year-over-year growth and 11% comp and now represents 23% of sales.
At the same time, our wholesale sales declined in 2019 as many of those retailers continued to face strategic challenges with sales to department stores representing only 11% of our consolidated revenue.
We would love to continue to partner with these retailers, but in some cases their business model is becoming more challenging and our strategy reflects that.
Our adjusted earnings of $4.32 per share, which were flat with fiscal 2018 included the negative impact of increased tariffs as well as an increase and our effective tax rate, importantly as we ended the fiscal year with very strong liquidity, including $53 million of cash and no borrowings under our $325 million asset-based credit facility which leads us to the topic of the day.
In our 78-year history, Oxford has weathered many crises and we are highly confident in our ability to weather the impact that COVID-19 outbreak is having on our business and the retail marketplace.
We are approaching our businesses with three top priorities; our people, our brands and our liquidity.
First, we have been and will continue to make the health and well-being of our employees, guests and communities in which we live and work our priority.
All of our North American stores and restaurants have been temporarily closed since March 17th and our Australian stores closed earlier this week.
All of our distribution centers are operational and we've implemented a comprehensive program of prudent measures in all of our distribution centers to keep our people safe.
Most of our associates in our corporate and brand offices are working remotely.
As we come out of this crisis, it is critical that any actions we take preserve our ability to have the team we need in place for the future.
Second, our lifeblood is the strength of our compelling brands and we will zealously protect them.
We have a tremendous portfolio led by Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide as well as our collection of smaller brands like the Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head.
We will not take actions to try to prop up our top line in the short run that could harm our brands over the long term.
Each of our brands engages their customers with exciting websites and memorable digital marketing programs.
Our technological capabilities will serve us well as we stay connected with our customers during this period of self-isolation.
Our third priority is liquidity.
Importantly, we entered fiscal 2020 with the inventory levels in very good shape.
We had a strong start through the middle of March.
However, as concerns about COVID-19 virus began to impact our business, sales have substantially deteriorated.
We are taking steps to mitigate the risk of the inventory increases by working with our suppliers to cancel delay or reduce our forward purchases.
We are also taking advantage of our strength in digital to remerchandise and remarket our seasonal offerings for this channel.
Finally, preserving our liquidity will be paramount over the near term and we are extremely well positioned on this front.
As I mentioned earlier, we entered 2020 with over $50 million in cash and an undrawn $325 million credit facility.
To further bolster our cash concession and maintain our high level of liquidity, we have drawn down $200 million from the facility.
On the expense side, we are pulling levers across most spending categories.
One of the largest is employment costs which were approximately $260 million in fiscal 2019.
As store and restaurant closures persist, we are using furloughs and layoffs as needed and warranted.
Where possible our plans will include preserving employee benefits at least for a period of time.
At all times, our priorities will be protecting the health of our employees and ensuring Oxford remains well-positioned for the future.
Today Tommy Bahama announced a furlough of most of its retail and restaurant team to begin on March 31st.
Through March 30th these employees will have received full pay and benefits.
During the month of April, Tommy Bahama will continue to cover the cost and benefits for furlough employees.
We are also focusing efforts, including partnering with our landlords as appropriate on mitigating our occupancy costs which were over $100 million last year.
Marketing expense, which was over $50 million last year is being addressed in phases.
Our reliance on digital marketing affords us opportunities to quickly modify our messaging and our spend as needed while continuing to stay engaged with our customers and generate traffic for our e-commerce websites.
Meanwhile reductions are being taken in other areas such as catalogs and photo shoots.
Also other variable costs such as credit card transaction fees, royalties on licensed brands, sales commissions, packaging in the supplies were approximately $50 million in fiscal 2019.
All capital expenditures are being reevaluated with many, including new store openings and remodels, as well as certain IT projects being deferred in this uncertain environment and our Board of Directors reduced our quarterly dividend from $0.37 a share to $0.25 per share.
We believe these measures, among others, position us well to successfully navigate through these unprecedented times.
Ultimately, it's the character and the quality of our people that will help us navigate these troubled times.
By focusing on our people, our brands and our liquidity, we are confident in our ability to continue our history of delivering long-term shareholder value.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we discuss our results, I encourage you to review the cautionary statement on slides 2 and 3 for our customary disclosures.
Further information can be found in our regular SEC filings.
Bill and Pete will provide a company update as well as an overview of the company's second quarter 2021 results.
Please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up.
You may get back into the queue if you have additional questions.
It is good to speak with everyone today and I'm excited to report our second quarter results.
I will start by providing some highlights from the quarter.
Our strong performance is a reflection of our market leadership, where we serve more clients than ever before and those clients are engaging with us in more ways given the breadth and essential relevance of our offerings.
I will also review our strategy and progress toward creating the most impactful and comprehensive financial wellness, ecosystem of data, technology and solutions that powers our industry.
Envestnet achieved strong adjusted revenue growth of 23% in the quarter and 70% year-to-date.
Our new guidance reflects the stronger than expected first half of the year as well as an improved outlook for the second half of 2021.
This growth was enabled by our market leading position and the scale we have achieved and this is a market position we continue to expand.
I believe this is important to note our position and ability to create scale, creates unique leverage for Envestnet as we drive our strategic plan forward.
The number of advisors on the Envestnet platform is now almost 108,000 with 14 million accounts that make up $5.2 trillion in assets.
Our data aggregation business serves over 500 million aggregated accounts each day.
Our MoneyGuide financial planning business continues to be the market leader in the industry while Envestnet tamp services also stands atop the podium as the market leader.
We have the largest network of services, solutions and third-party providers and we continue to grow these options for our clients.
New accounts are being opened at a faster pace and we are averaging well more than 10,000 new accounts every week.
We added several new customers during the second quarter including notable firms such as security.
As we also continue to add services to the firms, we serve today.
Our exchanges are activating more and more advisors, financial planning continues to add exciting new features, we've rolled out to our existing clients and in our RIA business, we are seeing momentum adding manage accounts to a growing number of firms.
While our footprint continues to grow, total meaningful metrics such as asset per advisor, accounts per advisor and adjusted revenue per advisor.
We are operating at significant scale as well.
During the second quarter, we serviced almost 15 million trades and completed 1.8 million service requests.
We're also generating more than 8 million data driven recommendations a day for our clients to better connect and better serve all of their clients.
As we mentioned on Investor Day, we are on our way to 10 million recommendations a day by year-end and over a billion, a day by 2025.
These proof points are unique to Envestnet market position and enable us to advance our vision and pursue the growth strategy we have discussed on earlier calls.
I believe these are very clear leading indicators and as we continue to execute the future for Envestnet is brighter than it's ever been.
Over the past several months, we have laid out a straightforward and executable strategy and we are driving progress toward enabling ecosystem that powers our industry.
No one has the strength of platform user base and leadership position that we have and it is a significant differentiator position in Envestnet to continue its leading position and drive the company toward achieving our mission and our stated financial goals.
This scale combined with our cloud-based infrastructure and unparalleled data and solution set opens up the grow...
...d to the second quarter of last year.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.67.
Turning to the balance sheet; we ended June with approximately $370 million in cash and debt of $860 million.
The debt consists of our outstanding convertible notes maturing in 2023 and 2025.
Our $500 million revolving credit facility was undrawn as of June 30, making our net leverage ratio at the end of June 1.8 times EBITDA.
Turning to our investment initiatives; I want to reiterate our expectations.
We continue to expect the investments to account for roughly $30 million of operating expense during the year.
We are making good progress on the hiring front, the impact of which is reflected in our updated guidance.
We expect the investments to ramp up throughout 2021 with most of the impact in the second half of the year and annualizing to a run rate of approximately $40 to $45 million in 2022, growing at the same rate of operating expenses thereafter.
Additionally, we continue to expect to begin to generate faster revenue growth in 2022 as we create a better more streamlined ecosystem, which elevates our value proposition to existing clients and expands our total addressable market.
Adjusted EBITDA to be between $61 million and $63 million as we further ramp up the investments and earnings per share to be $0.58 per share.
For the full year, we are again raising our outlook to reflect the strength of the first half of the year.
For the full year, we expect adjusted revenues to be between $1.169 million and $1.174 million, up 17% to 17.5% compared to 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA to be between $253 and $257 million, representing growth of 4% to 6% for the full year, and earnings per share to be between $2.30 and $2.35, which is $0.31 higher than the original guidance we gave back in February.
Adding some detail about our revenue outlook for the second half of the year to highlight some of the drivers of our revenue growth trends.
First, our wealth business has performed increasingly well year-to-date.
During the second quarter, we completed the merger of two-like clients moving significant assets from an asset based relationship to a subscription-based pricing model.
While this doesn't hit the way, we have reported reclassifications in the past, it is an effect of reclassification.
If we adjusted for this, the second quarter was ahead of even the first quarter in terms of net new flows from existing business.
Further, our significant asset base benefited from favorable capital markets adding to our forecast of revenue growth.
Second, our data and analytics segment has grown subscription revenue around 4% in the first-half of the year compared to the first-half of last year.
We expect this business to see improving revenue growth in the second-half of the year.
As we continue to execute on our strategy in the coming years and begin to benefit from the investments were making now, we will capture more of the opportunity we've identified positioning us to attain our longer-term targets of mid-teens growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% by 2025.
We are pleased with the progress we're making and are focused on the execution of our strategy.
The opportunity to be the leader of the ecosystem that powers the industry.
The ecosystem that connects data, technology and solutions to enable the intelligent financial life and is differentiated from every other provider as a fully connected, open architecture, hyper-personalized, wealth management platform.
As the industry leader, we will continue to enable the digital transformation that our clients need from us.
Our roadmap is very clear.
We are capturing more of the addressable market opportunity with our data in our solutions.
We are modernizing the digital engagement marketplace to reduce friction and land more clients and we're opening up our platform to accelerate growth.
We will continue to execute on that roadmap and it will continue to create greater value for each and every one of our stakeholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Leading today's discussion will be Joe Saffire, Chief Executive Officer of Life Storage; and Andy Gregoire, Chief Financial Officer.
Our actual results may differ from those projected due to risks and uncertainties with the company's business.
Additional information regarding these factors can be found in the company's SEC filings.
I am very pleased to report another solid quarter and a great start to this year.
With record occupancy of 94% at quarter end, we have managed to grow occupancy by 460 basis points year-over-year, an incredible accomplishment, and I'm very proud of the entire Life Storage team.
With this level of occupancy, we have been aggressively pushing asking rates while also decreasing free rent, resulting in higher net effective rates, which were up roughly 20% for the quarter.
Further, we have been very active on the acquisition front, with 33 stores acquired or under contract since the beginning of the year.
These stores are a blend of lease-up and stabilized and as a group, will be immediately accretive and growing thereafter.
We also continue to see strong growth in our third-party platform with 18 new additions during the quarter and a very robust pipeline as more and more owners consider Life Storage as a leading candidate to manage their stores.
And we continue to see further traction in Warehouse Anywhere with a significant contract for our Enterprise product.
This product is unmatched in the self-storage industry, and we continue to drive more corporate business to our unique solution.
These enterprise customers would unlikely be using self-storage for their inventory needs, if it were not for Warehouse Anywhere brings to the table.
Our newer Lightspeed product also continues to expand with now three fully operational micro fulfillment centers and three more in the works to open over the coming months.
Revenue for this business will continue to grow as we add more and more clients to our last mile fulfillment solution.
This solution is also unmatched in the self-storage industry.
With all of this success and growth, we exceeded our expectations for the quarter, and as such, are increasing our guidance for the remainder of the year.
We are raising the midpoint of our estimated adjusted funds from operations per share by more than 3% to $4.37 this year, which would be 10.1% growth over 2020.
And with that, I will hand it over to Andy to provide further details on the quarter and revisions to our guidance.
Last night, we reported adjusted quarterly funds from operations of $1.08 per share for the first quarter, an increase of 16.1% year-over-year.
First quarter same-store revenue accelerated significantly again to 7.3% year-over-year, up 240 basis points from the 4.9% growth produced in the fourth quarter.
Revenue performance was driven by a 410 basis point increase in average quarterly occupancy.
That occupancy is augmented by positive rent roll up.
In the quarter, our move-ins were paying almost 6% more than our move-outs, which is a significant improvement from the rent roll down that we experienced in the same quarter last year.
Our move-ins have been paying more than our move-outs for six straight months, with March move-ins paying almost 8% more than move-outs.
Same-store operating expenses increased 4.7% year-over-year for the quarter.
The largest negative variance during the quarter occurred in repairs and maintenance, which increased primarily due to higher snow falling expense and miscellaneous repairs following record cold weather earlier this year.
Payroll and benefits, again, remained well controlled, up only 1.8% year-over-year, while advertising and Internet marketing costs were down 2.6%.
The net effect of the same-store revenue and expense performance was an increase in net operating income of 8.6% for the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
We supported our acquisition activity and liquidity position by issuing approximately $180 million of common stock via our ATM program in the first quarter.
Our net debt to recurring EBITDA ratio decreased to 5.5 times, and our debt service coverage increased to a healthy 4.9 times at March 31.
At quarter end, we have $457 million available on our line of credit, and we have no significant debt maturities until April of 2024 when $175 million becomes due.
Our average debt maturity is 6.7 years.
Regarding 2021 guidance, we've increased our same-store forecast, driven by higher expected revenues and unchanged expense expectations.
Specifically, we expect same-store revenue to grow between 5.5% and 6.5%.
Excluding property taxes, we continue to expect other expenses to increase between 2.25% and 3.25%, while property taxes are expected to increase 6.75% to 7.75%.
The cumulative effect of these assumptions should result in 6.5% to 7.5% growth in same-store NOI relative to our original guidance of between 3.75% and 4.75%.
We have also increased our anticipated acquisitions by $175 million to between $550 million and $600 million.
Based on these assumptions changes, we anticipate adjusted FFO per share for the 2021 year to be between $4.33 and $4.41.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call is our Chief Executive Officer, Brian Deck; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Meister.
JBT's periodic SEC filings also contain information regarding risk factors that may have an impact on our results.
These documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Also, our discussion today includes references to certain non-GAAP measures.
A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Finally, I encourage you to review the second quarter slide deck, which is also posted in the Investor Relations section of the JBT website.
In it, we show historical trends, our key performance metrics and business opportunities and speak to our growth strategy.
It's great to be here to talk about JBT's strong financial performance and the strategic progress we made in the second quarter.
As we highlighted last quarter, JBT continues to enjoy robust demand at FoodTech and encouraging signs of recovery at AeroTech.
At the same time, we continue to face a challenging macro environment driving increase in cost of doing the business including material cost inflation, supply chain constraints and tight logistics.
Those pressures have intensified and now also include rising labor costs and labor shortages.
Notwithstanding this challenging backdrop, we outperformed expectations on the top and bottom lines in the second quarter.
I'd like to express my appreciation to everyone at JBT who did an excellent job of getting orders out the door to satisfy customer needs in this tough operating environment.
In the second quarter, we also booked record orders and generated excellent cash flow.
Moreover, we advanced our growth strategy with the exciting acquisition of Prevenio which expands our recurring revenue stream and further strengthens JBT's wall in food safety.
I'll hand it over to Matt who will provide a more detailed analysis of the second quarter results, speak to the benefits of the convertible note offering we completed in the quarter and walk you through our updated guidance.
JBT's second quarter performance continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver on growth in a challenging operating environment.
FoodTech revenue was $361 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 16% sequentially.
As Brian mentioned, we outperformed in the quarter driven primarily by better than expected shipments as our businesses executed well despite the challenges they faced.
The impact of foreign exchange translation was also a positive factor in the quarter, accounting for approximately 5 percentage points of the year-over-year growth which was 3 percentage points higher than expected.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19%, operating margins of 14.3% at the low end of our guidance range and negatively impacted by the cost pressures we experienced with the supply chain and labor market.
AeroTech revenue of $115 million which was ahead 6% year-over-year and 8% sequentially was at the high end of our expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.1% and operating margins of 10.5% exceeded guidance due to a favorable mix of higher recurring revenue.
Interest expense came in nearly $1 million less than forecast due to better than expected cash flow.
As a result, JBT reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.95 in the second quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 includes an adjustment for a $4.4 million or $0.14 per share non-cash deferred tax remeasurement associated with the tax law change in the UK.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $70.1 million up 2.58% year-over-year and 20% sequentially.
Operating profit of $47.3 million declined 1% year-over-year and higher M&A costs also had [Phonetic] 25% sequentially.
Free cash flow for the quarter remained strong at $35 million, representing a conversion rate of 115% with continued goods collections and accounts receivable, customer deposits and a s...
...ect to uncertainty surrounding COVID.
As it relates to Asia and South America, we are experiencing some fresh pandemic-related delays in customer investment decision making.
AeroTech also enjoyed record orders in the second quarter.
This primarily reflected some major orders on the infrastructure side of the business, which will mostly ship in 2022.
AeroTech's second quarter orders also reflected typical seasonal strength including demand for cargo loaders and deicers.
Given the lumpiness of orders, we expect AeroTech order activity in the second half of the year to be normal -- to be more normalized relative to the outstanding second quarter.
At the same time, we are encouraged by the pickup in US passenger traffic and have a few -- have secured a few additional orders from commercial airlines.
However, as we've said, we expect full recovery to take another two years to play out and we're cautiously watching the developments surrounding the Delta variant, which also could impact the pace of recovery in air travel.
Nonetheless, we feel we are clearly beyond the bottom of the investment cycle.
Now to the acquisition of Prevenio which closed in early July.
Prevenio further strengthens JBT's role in food safety, which is a critical and growing concern for our food processing customers.
They offer a unique delivery system for consumption-driven anti-microbial solutions which provide optimal food safety performance on our customers' operations, a safer environment for their employees as well as enhances food integrity.
Financially, Prevenio has demonstrated an impressive growth record with EBITDA margins in the mid-20s.
Moreover, the revenue model is predominantly consumable and contractual adding to the strength of our recurring revenue profile.
And as part of JBT, we foresee significant opportunities to expand Prevenio's applications beyond its core poultry market and its other proteins and fresh food and vegetables where JBT has a strong presence.
Furthermore, over time, we see opportunities to extend its geographic reach.
Switching gears toward internal investments, JBT plans to accelerate investment in our digital strategy in iOPS platform that builds intelligence in our products and services.
Through a focus on digitally enabled customer-centric solutions, we believe we can further entrench JBT as a holistic uptime solutions provider with our customers.
Additionally, I want to speak to the rebranding of what was previously our liquid food business within the FoodTech segment.
Its new name Diversified Food & Health reflects a business that has expanded far beyond its historical focus on juice and canned goods as a result of continued investment, both organically and through acquisition.
Diversified Food & Health now provides a wide portfolio of solutions for customers across the FoodTech segment including processing, preservation and packaging solutions to serve end markets for fresh cut and processed foods and vegetables, convenience foods, prepared and ready to eat meals, pet foods, protein and plant-based beverages, dairy, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.
Together with our protein business, FoodTech has an enviable diverse offering for our food and beverage customers.
Overall, we are very pleased with the robust commercial activity at FoodTech, which has enjoyed broad-based strength on the retail side growing demand for automation solutions and a pickup in the hard hit foodservice side.
At AeroTech, continued strength on the infrastructure side has been accompanied by initial improvement in our business with commercial airlines.
However, we remain concerned by the recent resurgence in COVID and the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions.
We are otherwise mindful of the high cost environment under which we are working.
Lastly, as part of JBT's core values, we continue to prioritize a diverse and inclusive work culture that promotes continued education, enhance development opportunities, mutual respect and teamwork.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the partnerships future operations and financial performance, including expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Actual results could differ materially, and the partnership undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events.
During todays call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as adjusted.
In the second quarter, Sunoco continued to showcase the strength of its business model with strong financial results in a period of increasing commodity prices.
For the second quarter of 2021, the partnership recorded net income of $166 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was $201 million compared to $182 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Volumes were 1.93 billion gallons, a sequential increase of approximately 10% from the first quarter as the reopening trend in the U.S. took off Q2.
Year-over-year volumes increased approximately 28%.
Fuel margin was $0.113 per gallon versus $0.135 per gallon in the second quarter of 2020, which Karl will hit on further in his remarks.
Total operating expenses in the second quarter were up slightly compared to the first quarter at $102 million versus $100 million and were up from $97 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Second quarter distributable cash flow as adjusted was $145 million, yielding a current quarter coverage ratio of 1.67 times and a trailing 12-month coverage ratio of 1.41 times consistent with our long-term target of 1.4 times.
On July 22, we declared an $0.8255 per unit distribution, the same as last quarter.
We continue to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders, which remains the 1 pillar behind our capital allocation strategy.
Leverage at the end of the quarter was 4.27 times, which we expect to continue to decline toward our 4.0 target as the year progresses.
Our 2021 full year EBITDA guidance remains unchanged from the original guidance, which we provided in December 2020.
For the full year 21, we expect adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $765 million.
Operating expense guidance is unchanged at $440 million to $450 million.
And while we expect higher second half operating expenses, we are trending toward the low end of the full year range.
We continue to expect maintenance capital of approximately $45 million and target growth capital expenditures of $150 million in 2021.
Next, Id like to spend a few minutes on the meaningful expansion to our midstream business that we announced yesterday.
To recap, we announced two terminal transactions that will not only help diversify and strengthen our core fuel distribution business, but will also provide a platform for growth in the markets served by these assets.
The new store assets consist of eight largely refined product terminals, seven of which are on the East Coast and one is just south of Chicago.
These assets have approximately 14.8 million barrels of storage and are accessed via pipeline, truck, rail and marine vessels.
We expect the $250 million purchase price to result in a sub seven times multiple on expected EBITDA, including synergies in the second year of ownership.
The Cato terminal is a gasoline and distillate terminal with 140,000 barrels of storage located in Salisbury, Maryland, and is accessed via truck and marine vessels.
We expect the $5.5 million purchase price to result in a sub-6 times multiple on expected EBITDA, including synergies in the second year of ownership.
Both of these transactions are expected to be immediately accretive to unitholder value.
The second quarters strong results and the announced acquisitions demonstrate our commitment to maintaining Sunocos solid financial footing and increasing value to our stakeholders through our strategy of disciplined capital investment.
I want to start today by giving you some more insight into our important expansion of the midstream busines...
...and midstream strategy, we have proven that we can add value.
Next, I will share some thoughts on our second quarter results.
At a high level, our strong results were underlined by better volume performance, margin returning to our guidance range even with a generally unfavorable and rising market and continued discipline on expenses.
Starting with volumes, we were up about 28% from last year, but the more relevant comparison continues to be performance relative to 2019.
Looking at it through that lens, we were down about 6% from 2019 volumes, meaningfully better than last quarter.
Weve seen similar volume performance at the beginning of the third quarter.
As we look at volumes through the back half of the year, it feels as though the pace of closing the gap to 2019 has slowed a bit, but we remain optimistic as overall economic strength in the U.S. continues.
The second quarter showed improvement versus the challenging first quarter.
Even though prices rose another $0.25 per gallon or so in the second quarter, the increased volatility, coupled with our continual margin optimization strategies, resulted in our margins rebounding and returning to our full year 2021 guidance range.
As we look forward, I still feel confident that $0.11 to $0.12 per gallon fuel margin is appropriate for the full year 2021 as we expect similar volatility to persist in the commodity markets through the back half of the year.
The final piece of our strong financial performance was continued expense control and discipline.
As Dylan mentioned earlier, we expect second half expenses to be higher than the first half with full year expenses trending toward the lower end of our guidance range.
Some of the higher spending in the second half of the year is due to timing, and some of it is related to our decisions to defer bringing costs back into the business with a challenging start to the year.
As the margin environment has improved, we are more comfortable returning some of our expenses to a more sustainable level going forward.
We delivered a very strong second quarter.
Fuel volume grew roughly 10% versus the first quarter of this year, while our fuel margins remain very healthy.
The combination of higher industry breakevens with our ability to control costs and optimize gross profit allows us to minimize the downside while still capturing the upside when the commodity market supports it.
Quarter after quarter, we have proven the durability of our business.
Looking forward, the third quarter is off to a good start.
For the month of July, RBOB prices have been volatile.
Within these volatile commodity environments, we have a proven history of delivering attractive margins.
As for volume, the start of the third quarter has seen a moderation of volume growth as compared to the growth we experienced from the first to second quarter.
We still believe that there is upside.
But as of today, we foresee similar volume in the third quarter to what we realized in the second quarter.
With the first half of the year in the books and early readings for the third quarter, we expect to deliver on our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance.
Moving on to growth.
Were very excited about the expansion of our midstream business through the two announced acquisitions.
Strategically, these acquisitions help diversify and vertically integrate our business while providing a more enhanced platform for fuel distribution growth.
Financially, we executed these transactions at very attractive valuations, especially after adding synergies.
In addition, the Brownsville terminal project is on budget and on time.
We expect the terminal to be up and running in early 2022.
On the field distribution side, we continue to grow organically.
However, well also look for acquisitions.
For both organic growth and acquisitions, well continue to build on our history of maintaining financial discipline, which means protecting the security of our distributions while also protecting our balance sheet.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Avner will review our financial performance and provide an outlook for the balance of 2021 with closing remarks from Steve.
This will be followed by Q&A.
A replay of today's call will be available for the next seven days.
It will also be read in full at the end of today's call.
Today, I would like to begin by sharing some opening comments and then provide a brief overview of the quarter.
Before I do that, I want to take a moment to recognize the contributions of Walter Scott, Jr., who served on our Board for more than 40 years and passed away late last month.
Walter was an incredible individual whose wisdom and leadership were critical to Valmont's success over the years.
His loss is felt deeply by those who knew him and the entire Omaha community.
Walter's counsel, kindness and mentorship will truly be missed by all of us at Valmont.
Moving on to the business.
Our strong performance this quarter, once again, demonstrated the solid demand across our businesses and the consistent execution of our growth strategies, even amid a challenging global environment.
Like most others, we have safety impacts of broad-based inflation, the COVID-19 Delta variant, and labor and supply chain disruptions.
Government mandated lockdowns in Australia and workforce quarantines in North America, including Mexico and the Southeast United States, impacted certain utility and coatings facilities.
Supply chain disruptions affect the timing of some shipments in our Irrigation and Solar businesses.
Despite this, we delivered a strong quarter of growth and profitability.
Our commercial and operations teams are managing exceptionally well through these unique dynamics of focus and perseverance, while continuing to prioritize employee safety and serve our customers.
I'm extremely proud of our team's execution throughout this year.
Record third quarter sales of $868.8 million increased more than 18% compared to last year.
Sales growth was realized in all segments led by higher pricing and strong broad-based market demand with particularly substantial sales growth in Irrigation.
Moving to the segments and starting with Utility.
Sales of $276.5 million grew slightly compared to last year.
A significantly higher pricing and higher volumes were mostly offset by renewable energy projects that did not repeat or that were pushed into future quarters due to customers' supply chain disruptions.
North American utilities have been increasing their planned investments in transmission and distribution projects, even exceeding recent years of higher capital spending.
Further, proposed capacity additions in the renewable energy sector are favorable demand drivers across our Utility business.
We see strong demand continuing, as both utilities and developers have been increasing their forecast of additional projects over the next several years to comply with mandates to increase renewable energy generation.
Moving to Engineered Support Structures.
Sales of $281.1 million increased 10% year-over-year, led by favorable pricing in all markets and sales growth of more than 25% in wireless communication products and components.
Pricing improvements across all product lines continued this quarter, and international markets are benefiting from higher stimulus and infrastructure investments, especially in Australia.
5G build-outs and significant investments by the major carriers are driving demand in our wireless communications business, providing a good line of sight into 2022.
Sales of $96.7 million grew 10% year-over-year, driven by higher pricing, improved general end market demand and sales from our greenfield facility in Pittsburgh.
Global sales of $240.3 million grew more than 72% year-over-year, with sales growth in all regions and higher sales of technology solutions.
In North America, sales grew nearly 55%, as strong market fundamentals and improved net farm income projections continue to positively impact farmer sentiment, generating very strong order flow.
International...
...erm impact on cash flow.
For the balance of the year, we expect inventory levels to remain elevated to help mitigate supply chain disruption and strategically secures raw material availability to support strong sales growth.
Accounts receivable will also increase in line with sales growth.
As our historical results have shown, we will see improvements in working capital as inflation subsides.
Turning to slide 13 for a summary of capital deployment.
Year-to-date capital spending of $81 million includes $33 million for strategic growth investments and $55 million of capital was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with approximately $170 million of cash.
Moving on to slide 14.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
Based on our recently amended revolving credit facility, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 1.85 times remains within our desired range of 1.5 to 2.5 times.
We're increasing our earnings expectations for fiscal 2021 by narrowing the earnings per share guidance range to $10.60 to $11.10.
This reflects strong market demand and our solid execution this year and our confidence in our ability to continue this performance.
Turning to our segment outlook on slide 16.
In Utility Support Structures, we expect operating margins to improve sequentially as pricing becomes more aligned with steel cost inflation.
Moving to Engineered Support Structures.
We expect continued stable market condition in North American transportation market and order rates are beginning to improve.
Demand for wireless communication products and components remains very strong, and we are on track to grow sales 15% to 20%, in line with expected market growth.
We remained focused on pricing actions and providing value to our customers.
We now expect sales to grow 50% to 53% this year based on strength in global underlying ag fundamentals and a strong global backlog.
Looking ahead to 2022, strong market demand across our businesses, the strength and flexibility of our global teams and our continued pricing strategies give us confidence in achieving sales growth of 7% to 12%, and earnings-per-share growth of 13% to 15% in line with the three- to five-year growth targets that we have communicated at our Investor Day in May.
Turning to slide 17.
The long-term drivers of our businesses remain solid as evidenced by our record global backlog of more than $1.5 billion, up 35% from year-end 2020.
These demand drivers are in place to sustain this momentum into 2022, and our business portfolio is well positioned for growth.
We also continue to take pricing actions across our businesses where needed.
Like others, we are closely monitoring inflation, supply chain disruptions and COVID.
We are ready to take additional appropriate actions to address these issues across all our businesses, as needed.
Meanwhile, our focus on following state and local regulations to keep our employees and customers safe is not wavered.
Turning to slide 18.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results and our team's ability to navigate through challenging market dynamics.
We've demonstrated our ability to grow sales through innovation and execution, while being flexible and responding quickly to meet customer needs.
We've improved operating margins by executing on our pricing strategies and advancing operational excellence across our footprint.
And we have invested in our employees and technology to drive new products and services and build upon the strength of our operations.
Throughout 2021, we have been disciplined in allocating capital to high-growth strategic investments, while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Looking ahead to 2022, we are confident in our plan to deliver the outlook that we have communicated and remain focused on execution and our ESG principles to build upon our success, while creating additional stakeholder value and improving a return on investor capital.

[/INST] # During Q3 2021, Valmont Industries reported a strong performance with record sales of $868.8 million, an 18% increase year-over-year, driven by higher pricing and broad-based market demand. Notably, Irrigation sales grew substantially. Despite challenges from inflation, the Delta variant, and supply chain disruptions, the company's commercial and operations teams managed well, prioritizing employee safety and customer service. All segments reported sales growth, with Utility supported by increased planned utility investments in transmission and distribution projects, Engineered Support Structures driven by higher pricing and wireless products demand, and Irrigation benefiting from strong market fundamentals and increased farmer sentiment. Looking ahead to 2022, Valmont expects sales growth of 7% to 12% and earnings per share growth of 13% to 15%, supported by continued market demand, pricing strategies, and a strong global backlog. Despite ongoing monitoring of inflation, supply chain disruptions, and COVID, the company remains confident in its ability to execute its plan and deliver stakeholder value.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, Chief Executive Officer; and Csaba Sverha, Chief Financial Officer.
We had a very strong quarter, representing our third quarter in a row of record revenue and earnings per share, both of which also exceeded our guidance.
With sequential growth in all of the end markets that we track, total revenue was $479.3 million.
Non-GAAP operating margins of 9.5% were at the highest level in two years and helped produce record non-GAAP earnings of $1.21 per share.
We generated these results while positioning ourselves for continued growth, and we are optimistic that we can deliver another record quarter in Q4.
Looking at some of the highlights of the quarter.
Optical communications revenue reached a new record, driven primarily by record telecom revenue.
Our Cisco optical transport system transfer program, which we have been discussing on recent calls, contributed to this strong performance.
This program transfer was completed in the third quarter, reaching its full run rate about one quarter earlier than originally anticipated.
Based on the success of this transfer, we believe that our unique value proposition in manufacturing complete network systems puts us in a strong position to win additional new business from our existing customers, as well as other systems manufacturers who are looking to leverage their supply chain by outsourcing more efficiently.
Notably, these newer systems programs are having a positive impact on operating margins as we were able to generate this revenue with close to zero incremental operating expenses.
We also achieved record non-optical communications revenue in Q3.
Revenue grew sequentially from all non-optical markets, with automotive reaching a new record revenue level and representing the largest non-optical category for the third quarter in a row.
Newer automotive technologies were the biggest factors driving our strong automotive growth in the quarter.
In summary, we are pleased to have delivered record third quarter results that exceeded our guidance.
We are optimistic about all the end markets that we serve and believe that with continued efficient execution, we'll be able to deliver an even stronger fourth quarter, resulting in our best year ever.
We are excited about our performance in the third quarter, which produced record revenue and non-GAAP earnings.
Revenue of $479.3 million was above our guidance range, and non-GAAP earnings of $1.21 also exceeded our guidance.
Looking at revenue in more detail.
Optical communications was $361.7 million or 75% of total revenue, up 4% from Q2.
Non-optical communications revenue was $117.6 million or 25% of total revenue and increased 11% from Q2.
Within optical communications, telecom revenue was $283.5 million, up 4% from last quarter.
Datacom revenue was $78.3 million, up 5% sequentially.
Silicon photonics remains an important revenue driver at 22% of total revenue or $105.4 million, up 4% from Q2.
Revenue from 100G products increased 8% sequentially to $138.6 million but remains below peak levels as growth from faster data rate products continues to accelerate.
Revenue from 400G and faster was $105.1 million, up 1% from last quarter and more than tripled from a year ago.
In Q4, we expect optical communications growth trend to continue.
Looking at our non-optical communications business.
Automotive has grown to become the largest category for the third quarter in a row with record revenue of $52.5 million in the third quarter, up 12% sequentially, driven primarily by growth from new automotive programs.
We remain optimistic about these new automotive programs as we look ahead.
Industrial laser revenue was $36.1 million, up 7% from Q2.
Sensor revenue was $4.1 million and other non-optical communications revenue was up 10% to $24.8 million.
We believe the combination of laser and automotive strength will generate sequential growth for non-optical communications again in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to the details of our P&L.
Gross margin was 12.2%, up from 12.1% in Q2 and in line with our target range of 12% to 12.5%.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $12.7 million or 2.6% of revenue, reflecting our ability to grow revenue without meaningful increases in operating expenses.
This produced record operating income of $45.6 million or 9.5% of revenue, the highest level in two years.
Taxes in the third quarter were $1.6 million and our normalized effective tax rate was 4%.
We continue to anticipate an effective tax rate of about 4% for the year.
Non-GAAP net income was a record at $45.4 million or $1.21 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, net income was also a record at $27.5 million or $1 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
At the end of the third quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $508.9 million.
Operating cash flow was a strong $23.8 million.
With capex of $6.4 million, free cash flow was $27.5 million in the third quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 15,000 shares at an average price of $80.64 for a total cash outlay of $1.2 million.
I would now like to turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.
We continue to be very optimistic about our business and anticipate another record quarter for revenue and profitability in Q4.
We expect total revenue in the fourth quarter to be between $475 million and $495 million and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.25 per diluted share.
In summary, we had our best performance ever in Q3 and are well positioned to continue our track record of success as we look ahead.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Please ensure that your [Technical Issue] Leading our call today will be Mike Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Lower, our Chief Financial Officer.
I will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.
Today, we reported all-time record quarterly results with earnings per share of $5.12, an increase of 115% compared to adjusted earnings per share of $2.38 last year.
This marks AutoNation's sixth consecutive all-time record quarter, driven by strong performance across both variable and fixed operations.
Our third quarter same-store revenue of $6.4 billion was up 18% compared to the prior year as well as the third quarter of 2019.
Consumer demand continues to outpace supply, driven by consumer desire for personal transportation and ongoing manufacturer supply chain disruption.
We expect this to continue well into 2022.
New vehicle sales are currently constrained by reduced production volume, low inventory levels leading to even more pent-up demand and should support sales for the foreseeable future.
In our used vehicle business, our strong self-sourcing capability, digital tools and customer-focused sales processes are competitive advantage that has allowed us to outperform our peers and the broader used vehicle market.
In the third quarter, we self-sourced 90% of our pre-owned vehicle retail sales and our same-store used vehicle revenue increased 63% year-over-year.
We see additional opportunity to capture used vehicle market share to our AutoNation USA expansion.
This week, we opened our eighth AutoNation USA store and our second store in the Denver market and we expect to open two additional stores in Phoenix and Charlotte before year end.
Our rollout schedule remains on track with 12 additional stores planned for 2022 and over 130 stores by the end of 2026.
Today, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Priority 1 Automotive Group, adding $420 million in annual revenue.
Together with our previously announced acquisition from Peacock Automotive Group, AutoNation has announced $800 million in annual revenue from acquisitions this year.
We also continue to buy back our shares during the third quarter.
Over the last 12 months, through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 27% of our shares outstanding from September 30 last year.
Our strong execution and cash flows have positioned us well to continue our disciplined, opportunistic capital allocation strategy.
I'm going to start the same place as Mike opened.
Today, we reported net income of $362 million or $5.12 per share versus adjusted net income of $212 million or $2.38 per share during the third quarter of 2020.
This represents our sixth consecutive all-time high quarterly earnings per share and 115% increase year-over-year.
As Mike mentioned, consumer demand for personal transportation remained strong, while new vehicle inventory is at historically low levels.
In this environment, we continue to focus on optimizing new vehicle margins and procuring used vehicle inventory to support sales.
We expect these trends with demand exceeding supply to continue well into 2022.
For the quarter, same-store variable gross profit increased 42% year-over-year, driven by an increase in total combined units of 4% and an increase in total variable PVR of $1,709 or 39%.
A decline in new units of 11% was more than offset by growth in used units of 20%.
Our customer care business has recovered with same-store customer care gross profit increasing 8% on a year-over-year basis and 6% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Taken together, our same-store total gross profit increased 29% compared to the prior year and 45% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
We also continued to deliver significant SG&A leverage due to strong cost discipline and robust vehicle margins.
Third quarter SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 56.9%, a 750 basis point improvement compared to the year ago period on an adjusted basis.
As measured against gross profit on an adjusted basis, our metrics improved across all key categories, with overhead decreasing 390 basis points, compensation decreasing 290 basis points and advertising decreasing 70 basis points.
We expect SG&A as a percentage of gross profit to remain below 60% for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021.
Floorplan interest expense decreased to $5 million in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower average floorplan balances.
This, combined with a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding generated a record EPS.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity.
Our cash balance at quarter end was $72 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion.
We continue to leverage our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows to invest in our business.
As Mike mentioned, this week we opened our eighth AutoNation USA store in Denver, Colorado.
We remain on track to open two additional stores in the fourth quarter and 12 more in 2022.
Again, as Mike mentioned, longer term we continue to target over 130 stores by the end of 2026.
In addition to organic growth initiatives, today we announced the acquisition of Priority 1 Automotive Group.
We will continue to look for additional acquisitions that complement our portfolio and meet our return thresholds.
We have also continue to repurchase our own shares.
During the third quarter, we purchased 7.9 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $879 million.
This represents an 11% reduction in shares outstanding for the fourth quarter alone.
Today, we announced that our board has authorized an additional $1 million for share repurchase.
With this increased authorization, the company has approximately $1.3 billion available for additional share repurchase.
As of October 19, there were approximately 66 million shares outstanding.
Despite our significant capital deployment, we maintained ample capacity on our balance sheet.
At the end of the third quarter, our covenant leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA was 1.4 times, up slightly from 1.2 at the end of the second quarter, but still well below our historical range of 2.0 to 3.0 debt to EBITDA.
We continue to demonstrate strong operational execution and disciplined capital allocation.
Going forward, we will remain focused on leveraging our balance sheet and strong cash flows to drive long-term shareholder value.
It's been my honor to serve in a leadership position of AutoNation for the past 22 years.
We've built an exceptional brand.
We are America's most admired and respected automotive retailer.
We provide a peerless customer experience from coast to coast.
And we have made a difference in people's lives with DRIVE PINK and our efforts to beat cancer.
He is one of the world's most respected, admired automotive executives, and we are thrilled to have him as our new CEO.
And AutoNation has an even brighter future.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company.
We hope you and your families are and will continue to be safe and healthy.
2020 represented another year of strong earnings growth for Vulcan, despite the many challenges associated with the pandemic.
Our results demonstrated the strength, flexibility and resilient nature of our aggregates business, but most of all 2020 demonstrated the commitment of Vulcan employees as they faced uncertainty and had to make adjustments, both in the professional and their personal lives.
Our team stayed focus on operating safely, servicing our customers and making progress on our four strategic disciplines.
Congratulations on a job well done.
In a few minutes, Suzanne will share some fourth quarter highlights with you.
But first, I'd like to summarize our full-year 2020 accomplishments, and discuss broad themes and where we are headed.
Our full-year financial results were strong.
Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $1.324 billion and EBITDA margin expanded by 150 basis points.
Cash generation continued to be strong with operating cash flows increasing by 9% to $1.1 billion.
And finally, one of our principal measures, return on invested capital improved by 40 basis points to 14.3%.
These results were particularly noteworthy considering our annual aggregates volume declined by 3% as compared to 2019.
Higher average selling prices and effective cost control were key drivers of this performance.
Aggregates pricing improved by just over 3% on both a reported and mix-adjusted basis.
Importantly, these pricing gains were widespread across our footprint.
Our total cost of sales per ton increased by 2%, while our unit cash cost of sales, which is more controllable, only grew by 1%.
This led to a 5.5% gain in our aggregates cash gross profit per ton.
At $7.11, we are making good progress toward our longer term goal of $9 per ton.
This improvement in unit profitability was supported by our four strategic disciplines, commercial excellence, operations excellence, logistics innovation and strategic sourcing.
We also experienced improvements in each of our non-aggregates business segments.
Collectively, gross profit improved 12% across these three segments.
Unit profitability increased in both asphalt and country.
Asphalt gross profit increased $12 million or 19% over the prior year, even though volumes declined 7%.
This improvement in profitability resulted from stable sales prices and lower liquid asphalt cost.
Our ready-mix concrete unit profitability increased 8%.
Average selling prices increased by 2% and volume declined by 5%, primarily as a result of the cement shortages in California.
The higher profitability in each of our business segments and our improving overall EBITDA margin set us up well for 2021.
We are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities in our geographic footprint.
The demand environment is also improving, particularly in residential construction and highway construction.
Let's take each market segment in turn.
Residential continues to show strength, especially in single family.
The market fundamentals of low interest rates, and reduced supply suggests that the growth will continue.
This represents a clear opportunity for us as both permits and starts are growing faster in Vulcan-served markets.
Highway lettings and awards returned to growth in the fourth quarter.
State DOT budgets have stabilized, with most of our states showing budgets flat to up from 2020.
The caution in this market segment is that it will require time to turn awards into shipments given the mid-year 2020 loan awards due to the pandemic.
While timing of shipments is a variable, we will see improvement in highway shipments throughout 2021.
As we said in the third quarter, the near-term outlook for the nonresidential construction sector provides the lease forward visibility.
Dodge construction starts are still down year-over-year, but certainly, indicators are beginning to improve, ...
...m it up, 2021 will turn out to be a year of solid earnings growth.
Before I discuss fourth quarter 2020 highlights, I'll fill in some additional details on our 2021 guidance.
We made significant reductions in our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020.
We expect to further leverage our overhead costs in 2021 and anticipate our SG&A expenses to be between $365 million and $375 million.
We anticipate interest expense to approximate $130 million for the full year.
Barring any changes to federal tax law, our effective tax rate will be about 21%.
The category of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expenses will be around $400 million.
Now with respect to capital expenditures, we invested $361 million in 2020.
We expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million 2021.
This includes fully restarting and advancing growth projects that were delayed last spring, such as the opening of a new quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries, and improvements to our logistics and distribution network.
It also reflects a catch-up of operating capex that was postponed at the start of the pandemic.
As always, we'll carefully monitor the economic environment and adjust our capital spending as necessary.
As you model, you'll note that the combination of our assumptions for 2021 leads to another healthy year of cash generation.
I'll now give a little color on the fourth quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $311 million, up 4% from last year's fourth quarter.
Aggregates volume declined by 1%, while reported pricing increased by 3% and mix adjusted pricing by 2%.
Costs were slightly higher in the quarter due to additional stripping costs in advance of future shipping growth and the timing of repairs.
There were two items that affected the comparability of our fully diluted earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 as compared to those same periods in 2019.
First, we recorded a one-time non-cash pension settlement charge of $23 million or $0.13 per diluted share in connection with the voluntary lump sum distribution of benefits to certain fully vested plan participants.
This liability management action will benefit future pension expense and funding requirements.
And second, the tax rate for fourth quarter and full-year 2020 was higher than in the comparable periods in 2019.
Last year, the tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and R&D credits were greater than the same benefits in 2020.
The resulting earnings per share effect was $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.18 per diluted share for the full year.
Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position remains very strong with a weighted average debt maturity of 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%.
Our net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6 times as of December 31, reflecting $1.2 billion of cash on hand.
Approximately $500 million of this cash will be used to repay a debt maturity coming due next month.
As Tom mentioned, our cash flow was robust in 2020 and contributed to year-over-year leverage reduction.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the resulting slowdown in economic activity, M&A was lighter than usual in 2020.
We returned $206 million to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases.
Our capital allocation priorities, which have helped to drive an improvement of 220 basis points and our return on invested capital over the last three years, remain unchanged.
We will continue to operate Vulcan for the long term, and our focus on building an even stronger and more profitable business.
We know that our leading market positions and our aggregates-focused business are strengths, along with our strong balance sheet.
When combined with the execution capabilities that we demonstrated in 2020, as well as solid long-term fundamentals, we are excited about our future.
While there may be challenges in 2021, we have confidence in its potential.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors.
We direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations or FFO, core FFO, same-center net operating income, adjusted EBITDA and net debt.
As such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, November 2, 2021.
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.
We request that everyone ask only one question and one follow-up to allow as many of you as possible to ask questions.
If time permits, we are happy for you to requeue for additional questions.
On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We had a great quarter as a result of improvements in occupancy, rent spreads and sales.
These all contributed to earnings, which exceeded our expectations, and an increase in our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Our proactive capital market success has also positioned us well with low leverage, ample liquidity and exciting potential growth opportunities.
I'm proud of the tireless efforts of the entire Tanger team who are successfully delivering our strategic objectives.
We delivered strong performance in the third quarter and the continued momentum we are demonstrating across our portfolio supports our decision to increase our guidance for the year.
The successful execution of our strategic plan is evident across all of our key metrics, including occupancy, rent spreads, tenant sales and our focus on driving non-rental revenues, all of which continue to contribute to core FFO growth.
Our portfolio occupancy has returned to pre-pandemic levels, despite having recaptured over 1 million square feet due to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings since the beginning of 2020.
This includes 55,000 square feet recaptured in the third quarter as anticipated.
As of September 30, occupancy was 94.3%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 130 basis points since the end of the second quarter.
With regard to rent spreads, we continue to see positive momentum for leases that commenced in the 12 months ended September 30.
Blended average rates improved by 240 basis points on a cash basis compared to the 12 months ended June 30.
Spreads have improved each quarter this year and we believe that the continued improvement we are seeing in traffic and sales will help sustain this trend.
We also benefited from significant percentage rental growth this quarter, which was more than 2.5 times the comparable 2019 period.
During the height of the pandemic, we renegotiated select leases with an aim to trade value for value, in some cases, trading base rent for a larger variable rent component.
In many cases, reducing break points and increasing variable rent pay rates are now producing total rents that exceed the prior contractual fixed rents.
Our rent spreads don't capture percentage rent contributions as spreads measure the change in base rent and common area charges only, but the strong variable rent component has contributed to our core FFO growth.
Additionally, as we continue to negotiate renewals on these leases, we are focused on converting some of the variable upside into base rents, which provide longer term certainty.
In light of the improving trends, we are being strategic in our renewal and permanent leasing activity.
Renewals executed or in process represented 68% of the space scheduled to expire during the year compared to 72% at this time last year.
Traffic for the quarter was approximately 99% of the same period in 2019.
We saw a slight downturn in August, in part, due to concerns over the Delta variant and the timing of Labor Day, but Septe...
...ulfilling holiday experience to our customers and guests.
In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic plan, focus on our core business, and create value by unlocking new revenue opportunities across our portfolio.
We are enthusiastic with our positive leasing momentum and are encouraged by the new brands and categories we are adding to our centers.
We are innovating and reaching our shoppers where they want to be, offering additional ways to engage and interact with new products and to shop.
We continue to see traffic, sales, leasing and business development results improve.
We're on a clear path to sustained same-center NOI growth and, along with our new long-term growth initiatives and operational efficiencies, we believe we have a compelling opportunity to create value over time.
We delivered strong third quarter results showing continued positive momentum.
Third quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.47 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
Core FFO for the third quarter of 2021 excludes a charge of $34 million or $0.31 per share for the early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of our 2023 and 2024 bonds.
Same-center NOI for the consolidated portfolio increased 11.5% for the quarter to $73.8 million, driven by better than expected rebound in variable rents and other revenues.
We remain on track with rent collections and, through October 29, had collected approximately 98% of 2020 deferred rents due by the end of the third quarter.
The strategy we employed during the pandemic of deferring rent has proven to be effective.
With regard to our ATM program, we did not sell any additional equity during the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we have sold 10 million shares generating proceeds of approximately $187 million and $60 million remains available under our current authorization.
As previously announced, in July, we amended our unsecured lines of credit and extended the maturity date to July 2026, including extension options.
The lines have a borrowing capacity of $520 million with an accordion feature to increase borrowing capacity to $1.2 billion.
Additionally, in August, we completed a public offering of $400 million of senior notes at a rate of 2.75%, the lowest coupon in Tanger history.
We used the proceeds from the sale to redeem the $100 million that was outstanding on our 3.875% notes due in 2023 and the $250 million that was outstanding on our 3.75% notes due in 2024.
We also incurred a $31.9 million make-whole premium in September related to these redemptions.
As of quarter end, we had no significant debt maturities until April 2024.
Our leverage position has continued to improve in conjunction with our capital markets activity and earnings growth.
As of September 30, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.3 times for the trailing 12 months compared to 7.2 times for the comparable 12-month period of the prior year.
We have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position and a disciplined and prudent approach to capital allocation.
Our Board will continue to evaluate dividend distributions alongside earnings growth and taxable income distribution requirements.
Our priority uses of capital are investing in our portfolio to grow in a way and evaluating selective external growth opportunities.
Turning to guidance for the remainder of the year.
We are increasing our core FFO to a range of $1.67 to $1.71 per share from the prior range of $1.52 and $1.59, an increase of 9% at the midpoint.
This guidance reflects continued sequential improvement in our business, particularly higher variable rents achieved in the third quarter.
Our guidance also includes up to 50,000 [Phonetic] square feet related to the potential additional bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings that could occur for the remainder of the year.
For additional details on our key assumptions, please see our release issued last night.
Operator, can we take our first question?

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We'll begin today with a brief strategic overview from Randy, Mike will review the title business, Chris will review F&G, and Tony will finish with a review of the financial highlights.
There is a significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of this pandemic.
Such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.
It will also be available through phone replay beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until March 4.
Our primary focus has been and continues to be the health and well-being of our employees while maintaining our business continuity and ensuring the needs of our customers are consistently met.
For the fourth quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $624 million compared with $355 million in the year ago quarter and a record 22.7% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
While we are very pleased with our strong financial results, we also made significant headway on our technology investments in our title business, having recently announced both the inHere platform and subsequently Close inHere.
Mike will go into more detail on this, but as we continue to drive the innovation of the title industry, we believe our significant national footprint will prove to be a real plus as further adoption of our client-facing and title automation technology expands our competitive advantage.
Turning to our acquisition of FGL Holdings.
F&G continues to execute on its growth strategy, generating retail sales growth of over 40% in the fourth quarter.
The credit rating upgrade that F&G has enjoyed as a result of the acquisition by FNF has opened additional large market opportunities.
F&G is gaining momentum in the newly entered bank and broker-dealer channel, generating $500 million of channel sales since our launch on July 1.
Additional distribution channels, including institutional products, will continue to be a strategic area of focus for F&G in 2021, including the pension risk transfer marketing.
Chris will go into more detail on F&G's fourth quarter results shortly.
Looking forward, our priority continues to be focused on long-term value creation for our shareholders through our diligent capital allocation program, while also remaining focused on investing in our business to sustain growth.
Last week, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, reflecting the fourth quarter dividend increase of 9%.
Additionally, in October, we announced a 12-month $500 million share repurchase target.
And since that announcement, we have repurchased 3.8 million shares for approximately $140 million.
And for 2020 in total, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for approximately $244 million.
As Randy mentioned, the fourth quarter was a record for adjusted pre-tax title earnings and adjusted pre-tax title margin, as we continue to benefit from low interest rates driving sustained momentum in refinance volumes, strong purchase demand and the continued rebound in commercial real estate activity.
For the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $624 million, a 76% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our adjusted pre-tax title margin was 22.7%, a 640 basis point increase over the prior year quarter.
We had a 40% increase in direct orders closed -- 48% increase in direct orders closed, driven by an 86% increase in daily refinance orders closed, an 18% increase in daily purchase orders closed and a 1% increase in total commercial orders closed.
Total commercial revenue was $322 million compared with the year ago quarter of $321 million due to the 1% increase in closed orders.
Total commercial fee per file was flat compared to the year ago quarter.
For the fourth quarter, total orders opened averaged 11,600 per day, with October at 11,800 and November at 11,900 in December at 11,000.
For January, total orders...
... pandemic environment.
Most importantly, our investment portfolio continues to perform well, and credit impairments for the year were less than our product pricing assumptions.
In addition, as of year-end, the portfolio's net unrealized gain position grew to $2 billion, a sharp reversal from the net unrealized loss position experienced early in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Moreover, we came into 2020 with a strong balance sheet, which allowed us to effectively weather the volatility and economic impacts of the pandemic, while still growing the business.
As expected, we ended the year with an estimated RBC ratio of over 400% for our primary insurance operating subsidiary.
We also completed the sale of our offshore third-party reinsurance business, F&G Re, to Aspida Holdings in December.
Proceeds from the sale will be used to fund future growth opportunities for F&G.
And we also entered into a mutually beneficial flow reinsurance agreement with Aspida on our MYGA products beginning in the first quarter of 2021.
So in summary, our sales are growing nicely as we diversify into multiple channels following the FNF acquisition.
We continue to consistently generate stable net investment spread and earnings, and we remain confident in our investment portfolio.
We generated approximately $3.8 billion in total revenue in the fourth quarter, with the title segment producing approximately $3 billion, F&G producing $667 million and the corporate segment generating $60 million.
Fourth quarter net earnings were $801 million, which includes net recognized gains of $573 million versus net recognized gains of $131 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The net recognized gains in each period are primarily due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of equity and preferred stock securities, whether the securities were disposed of in the quarter or continued to be held in our investment portfolio.
Excluding net recognized gains, our total revenue was $3.2 billion as compared with $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $588 million or $2.01 per diluted share.
The title segment contributed $498 million.
F&G contributed $128 million, and the corporate and other segment had an adjusted net loss of $38 million.
Excluding net recognized gains of $290 million, our title segment generated $2.8 billion in total revenue for the fourth quarter compared with $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Direct premiums increased by 29% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
Agency revenue grew by 33%, and escrow title-related and other fees increased by 21% versus the prior year.
Personnel costs increased by 15%, and other operating expenses decreased by 7%.
All in, the title business generated a 22.7% adjusted pre-tax title margin, representing a 640 basis point increase versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
Interest income in the title and corporate segments of $32 million declined $23 million as compared with the prior year quarter due to the reduction of short-term interest rates on our corporate cash balances and our 1031 exchange business.
FNF debt outstanding was $2.7 billion on December 31 for a debt-to-total capital ratio of 24.2%.
Our title claims paid of $54 million were $33 million lower than our provision rate of $87 million for the fourth quarter.
The carried title reserve for claim losses is currently $62 million or 4.1% above the actuary central estimate.
We continued to provide for title claims at 4.5% of total title premiums.
Finally, our title and corporate investment portfolio totaled $5.7 billion at December 31.
Included in the $5.7 billion are fixed maturity and preferred securities of $2.5 billion with an average duration of three years and an average rating of A2, equity securities of $900 million, short-term and other investments of $500 million and cash of $1.8 billion.
We ended the quarter with just under $1 billion in cash and short-term liquid investments at the holding company level.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm pleased that you're able to join us today.
The slides are available on our website at investors.
We caution you that such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
Leading our discussion today are Maria Pope, President and CEO; and Jim Ajello, Senior Vice President of Finance, CFO and Treasurer.
Our financial results this quarter were strong.
We reported net income of $96 million or $1.07 per share compared to net income of $81 million or $0.91 per share in the first quarter of last year.
In light of the strong quarter and positive outlook, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.70 per share, as well as our long-term earnings and dividend growth rates.
Jim will cover first-quarter results in more detail, provide regulatory and capital updates, as well as discuss the outlook for the rest of the year.
This quarter, again, presented significant weather-driven operational challenges.
And I'm proud of how our teams came together, responding to the most severe, ice, wind and snowstorms in our history, improving our operations and achieving important customer-focused results.
In February, we restored over 750,000 customer outages, as nearly half of our customers were without power, many of whom experienced multiple outages over a more -- more than 2.5-week period.
I want to recognize the hard work of our coworkers, mutual aid crews and assistance from as far away as Southern California, Utah, Montana to Alberta, British Columbia, all of whom in the midst of a pandemic went above and beyond to restore power quickly and most importantly, safely.
Even as we speak, crews continue to repair equipment and clear down trees, as damage is still extensive.
As of March 31, the cost of the February storm were $87 million, which Jim will discuss in detail.
The recent storms and wildfires last fall on top of the pandemic with so many people living, working and learning remotely underscore the importance of our ongoing system hardening and reinvestment programs, combined with the deployment of digital capabilities, AI and smart grid technologies.
Today versus a year ago, customers are experiencing about 16% less planned outages.
Average outage restoration times are about 7% faster and outage text notifications and digital payment options are making a difference in customer satisfaction.
And equally important to note is what did not happen during the February weather events, our generation plants, as well as wind and hydro facilities operated seamlessly.
And power was generated across the region throughout the harsh conditions.
Turning to load growth and the economy.
For the last couple of years, we've discussed the strength of our service territory.
Overall, year-over-year, customer count increased more than 1%, and load growth was up 1.2% on a weather-adjusted basis and 2.3% after accounting for the harsh winter conditions.
Residential usage was up 3% weather-adjusted, offsetting commercial declines of 5%.
Industrial usage grew an impressive 8%, powered by the strength of the tech and digital sectors.
Expansion within our region of several digital companies and the global semiconductor shortage are expected to continue and solidify our positive outlook.
Overall, Oregon's economy is recovering, with nearly two-thirds of the state's pandemic-driven job loss recovered.
Unemployment currently stands at 5.7% across our service territory.
ESG, Portland General has long been an ESG leader.
And this quarter, we join the Amazon Climate Pledge in keeping with our commitment to reduce carbon by 80% by 2030 over 2010 levels and our aspirational goal of net zero by 2040.
We also know that to make real progress on climate, we need to partner in addressing the admissions from transportation and other sectors.
Last week in partnership with Daimler Trucks North America, we celebrated the opening of the first of its kind heavy-duty electric truck charging site.
This ...
... were capital expenditures and $54 million were operating expenditures associated with our transmission and distribution system.
We have a storm deferral mechanism that collects $4 million annually from retail customers to cover incremental expenses related to storm damages, and we defer any amount not utilized in the current year.
In response to the February storms, we exhausted our storm collection balance for 2021 of $9 million to offset operating expenses.
This brings the cumulative incurred cost from the February storm to be estimated at $45 million net as of March 31, 2021.
We have filed an application for authorization to defer emergency restoration costs for the February storms.
We expect a decision from the PUC on this in 2022.
We are confident these costs were incurred prudently in response to this unique and unprecedented storm, although there are comparable storms of similar size and duration in other regions at a similar expense, the OPUC has significant discretion in making the final determination of recovery and their conclusion of the overall prudence.
Turning to Slide 7, which shows our updated capital forecast through 2025, we've increased our 2021 capital expenditures by $45 million this year, the majority of which relates to the capital expenditures from the recent storm restoration.
Our capital plan remains on track, and we continue to invest primarily in projects that enhance the resiliency and reliability of our system for the benefit of customers, while maintaining affordability.
Given our guidance today, we raised our O&M guidance by $20 million.
This is in response to several factors.
$12 million of this increase is associated with the February storm response expense, which is ultimately offsetting revenue and the remaining $8 million is associated with additional initiatives to address wildfire risk, improve our outage restoration estimation and outage response processes.
On to Slide 8, we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet, including strong liquidity and investment-grade ratings, accompanied by a stable outlook.
Based on our strong financial condition, we do not expect to issue additional equity in 2021.
We expect to fund 2021 capital expenditures and long-term debt maturities with cash from operations during 2021, which is expected to range from $600 million to $650 million.
We've also increased a long-term debt issuance later this year up to $350 million, which will refinance the short-term notes closed earlier this year and satisfy our 2022 requirements.
Total liquidity of $780 million, all of which is available.
Earlier this week, our Board approved a dividend increase of $0.09 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 5.5% increase.
This increase is consistent with our long-term dividend growth guidance of 5% to 7%, while observing a dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.
Turning to our 2021 outlook, our first-quarter performance was strong.
We are on track to achieve our guided range and finished within the long-term growth guidance of 46% from the 2019 base year.
We expect continued impacts from the pandemic on the economy and regional power picture through the second quarter.
We anticipate a similar load composition to the trends that we've experienced over the last two quarters.
Our commercial customers face risks associated with economic impact of the pandemic in Oregon, but the strength of our residential and industrial energy deliveries has mitigated this decline.
Right now, we are still under the cap of our decoupling mechanism.
Residential customer usage on a weather-adjusted basis is above the established threshold and is expected to be refunded to customers.
As I settle in, I can see excellent fundamentals of the business, load growth is strong, and we continue to see opportunities to drive efficiency in our operations, mostly through investment in technology and developing a smarter more resilient grid, all of which will result in better outcomes for our customers.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Steven Sintros, UniFirst's president and chief executive officer.
Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors.
Overall, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Our team continues to focus on providing industry-leading services to our customers as well as selling prospective customers on the value that UniFirst can bring to their businesses.
The results for our first quarter were largely as we anticipated, with consolidated revenues growing 8.8% and an overall adjusted operating margin for our core laundry operations of approximately 10%.
The team continues to execute well, producing solid performances in both new account sales as well as customer retention during the quarter.
In addition, wearer additions versus reductions during the quarter were positive, indicating the continued growth and recovery of our customer base.
This is a favorable comparison to a year ago when many customer wearer levels remained depressed due to the impact of the pandemic.
The strong year-over-year growth in the quarter was also impacted by adjustments to customer pricing as we continue to work with our customers through this inflationary environment.
As a reminder, from a profitability perspective, we discussed during our year-end earnings call that going forward over the next few years, we are going to be reporting adjusted results, which exclude the impact of costs that we are expending on three discrete strategic initiatives that are critical in our efforts to transform the company in terms of our overall capabilities and competitive positioning.
As a reminder, these three initiatives are the rollout of our new CRM system, investments in the UniFirst brand, and a corporatewide ERP system with a strong focus on supply chain and procurement automation and technology.
As we have talked about over the last year or two, we continue to be focused on making good investments in our people, our infrastructure, and our technologies.
All of the investments designed to deliver solid long-term returns for UniFirst stakeholders and are integral components of our primary long-term objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry.
After excluding our costs in our quarter related to these investments, our adjusted operating margin is showing an anticipated decline compared to a year ago.
The comparison of adjusted margin is being impacted by increases in costs we've been highlighting for a couple of quarters now.
Some are simply bouncing back from depressed levels during the pandemic and others are being impacted by the inflationary environment and some are being impacted by both.
As a reminder, these costs include merchandise amortization, costs related to raw materials and the overall supply chain disruption, the cost to hire and retain labor, energy, and travel.
Our solid balance sheet positions us well to meet these ongoing challenges while continuing to make investments in growth and strengthen our business.
Along those lines, during December, we closed on two small acquisitions, which will improve our footprint in key markets.
As we have highlighted before, acquisitions continue to be part of our overall growth strategy.
Despite the challenges in the overall operating environment, we continue to be confident in our ability to manage and execute through these obstacles.
We maintain a sharp focus on taking care of our employees, our customers, and bringing new customers into the UniFirst family.
As we have discussed previously, the pandemic has clearly highlighted the essential nature of our products and services and we feel the company is positioned well to support the evolving economic landscape.
In our first quarter of 2022, consolidated revenues were $486.2 million, up 8.8% from $446.9 million a year ago, and consolidated operating income decreased to $44.8 million from $56 million in -- or 20.1%.
Net income for the quarter ...
..., responding to the very challenging employment environment.
Energy costs increased to 4.3% of revenues in the first quarter of 2022, up from 3.6% in prior year.
Revenues from our specialty garments segment, which delivers specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services, increased to $39.5 million from $38.1 million in prior year or 3.5%.
This increase was primarily due to growth in our cleanroom and European nuclear operations.
The segment's operating margin increased to 21.9% from 18.8%, primarily due to lower merchandise costs as a percentage of revenues.
As we've mentioned in the past, this segment's results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services.
Our first aid segment's revenues increased to $17.8 million from $15.5 million in prior year or 14.8%.
This increase was due to improved top line performance in both our wholesale distribution as well as our first aid van business.
However, the segment had an operating loss of $0.3 million during the quarter primarily due to continued investment in the company's initiative to expand its first aid van business into new geographies.
We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $478.1 million at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2022.
During the quarter, our net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by our reduced profitability as well as heavier than normal working capital needs of the business.
Contributing to these higher working capital needs were elevated supply inventory balances related to the ongoing supply chain disruption as well as increases to rental merchandise and service as our balance sheet position continues to normalize coming out of the pandemic-impacted period.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $31.1 million as we continued to invest in our future with new facility additions, expansions, updates, and automation systems that will help us meet our long-term strategic objectives.
Now that our CRM project has transitioned from a development phase to deployment, the majority of the costs are now being expensed.
As a result, the capitalization of costs related to our CRM project in the quarter totaled only $1.7 million.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we repurchased 22,750 common shares for a total of $4.8 million under our previously announced stock repurchase program.
I'd like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our outlook.
At this time, we now expect our full-year revenues for fiscal 2022 will be between $1.94 billion and $1.955 billion.
This revised top-line guidance includes the anticipated impact of the two small acquisitions we closed in December that Steve discussed.
These acquisitions are expected to add approximately $10 million to our fiscal 2022 revenues.
We further expect that our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 will now be between $5.50 and $5.80.
This earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 24% and continues to include an estimate of $38 million worth of costs directly attributable to our key initiatives that will be expensed during the year.
Please also note the following assumptions regarding our guidance.
Core laundry operations adjusted operating margin at the midpoint of the range is now 9.2%, which reflects continued pressure from costs that trended lower during the pandemic and the current inflationary environment.
Our assumed adjusted tax -- our assumed adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2022 is 24.25%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $7 and $7.30.
Guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks or potential tax reform, and guidance assumes a stable economic environment with no pandemic-related headwinds, including potential expenses related to government COVID-19 mandates.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We sincerely hope everyone is continuing to stay healthy and safe.
Finally, we'll be referring to adjusted results and outlook.
That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.
Let me start with the headlines for the full year results.
We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook.
We significantly increased our brand and capability investments and improved our market shares.
We generated excellent cost savings and cash flow, and we returned significant cash to shareholders.
Now let's cover the details of our results, starting with sales.
Full year net sales were $19.1 billion.
That's up 4% year-on-year and included a 2 point drag from currency rates.
Organic sales grew 6%, with healthy underlying performance and increased demand related to COVID-19.
Volumes were up 4%, and net selling prices and product mix each increased 1%.
Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line and market share performance in just a few minutes.
Moving on to profitability.
Full year adjusted gross margin was 37.1%, up 210 basis points year-on-year.
Adjusted gross profit increased 10%.
We generated $575 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs.
That was well above our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October.
For 2021, we're targeting $400 million to $460 million in total cost savings.
Commodities were favorable by $175 million in 2020 although they turned inflationary in the fourth quarter.
We're planning for commodity inflation of $450 million to $600 million in 2021.
Costs are projected to increase broadly in most areas, including pulp and recycled fiber, resins, superabsorbent and distribution expenses.
Other manufacturing costs were higher in 2020, including costs related to COVID-19.
Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high-single digit rate.
Moving further down the P&L, between the line spending was up 110 basis points as a percent of sales.
That was driven by advertising, which was up 90 basis points.
SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability building investments.
Adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, up 90 basis points, and adjusted operating profit grew 9%.
In terms of Company profitability for 2021, the midpoint of our planning assumptions implies a 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin.
And while there are a number of moving pieces, it's likely that adjusted gross margin will be down somewhat more than that.
Turning back to 2020 results.
Full year adjusted earnings per share were $7.74, up 12%.
Our October guidance was for earnings of $7.50 to $7.65.
In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating profit, the bottom line benefited from higher equity income, a lower share count and a slight decline in adjusted effective tax rate.
Now let's turn to cash flow [Technical Issues] Cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3.7 billion, up $1 billion year-on-year, reflecting outstanding working capital performance and strong earnings.
Cash flow is expected to be down year-on-year in 2021, driven by higher cash taxes and working capital.
Nonetheless, cash flow should remain strong and well above 2019's level.
Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, in line with plan and the prior year.
We plan to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, including activity for our restructuring program and a pickup in growth projects.
Based on an initial outlook at longer-term opportunities, we believe spending will be elevated again in 2022.
On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.15 billion.
That's the 10th consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders.
Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program.
We continue to make significant progress as we head into the last year of this program.
We're about 85% to 90...
...up high single digits in Eastern Europe; and up low-single digits in Latin America.
We also improved our share positions in many D&E markets.
Looking at our other segments.
Organic sales were up 13% in Consumer Tissue and down 7% in K-C Professional.
As expected, both businesses experienced the effect of COVID-19 and the shift to more consumers working from home.
We're pleased with how our K-C team managed through that volatility.
To meet elevated demand in Consumer Tissue, we significantly reduced our SKU count and leveraged our global supply network to increase production, including support from KCP.
We continue to focus on category expanding and brand building programs while improving our market execution.
Those actions helped us gain market share for Kleenex facial tissue in North America and Europe.
In KCP, where the washroom category continues to be a significant part of our business, we made good progress pivoting to growth opportunities in other parts of the business, including in wipers and safety products.
Sales of those products were up double digits in North America.
Importantly, we grew or maintained market share in approximately 60% of the 80 key cohorts that we track.
I'm pleased to see our brands winning in the marketplace.
Overall, our results were strong, and I'm encouraged by the way we executed in 2020.
Next, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021.
We expect a more challenging environment, especially compared to last year.
More specifically, we expect some of the net benefit from COVID dynamics, including higher consumer demand, to reverse.
In addition, commodity costs are rising globally, and we're also reflecting our latest view on economic conditions and birth rate trends.
Despite these factors, we're confident in our ability to deliver top line growth and expect to strengthen our market positions and improve our Company for long-term value creation.
Our plans call for total sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2021, and that includes 2 points from the Softex acquisition and a 1 to 2 point benefit from currencies.
We expect to grow organic sales 1% to 2%.
We plan to leverage and scale our brand-building capabilities and investments that we've made over the past two years.
We have a healthy innovation pipeline, including near-term launches for Huggies in North America, China, Eastern Europe and Latin America, and we've also upgraded products for our global Kotex brand in several markets.
We expect to benefit from selective pricing actions and other revenue management programs, but we're not currently planning for broad-based list price increases.
And we'll continue to make capability and technology investments to drive long-term success.
On advertising, spending should be similar to 2020 levels, and this reflects the increases we made over the last two years and confidence in the strong ROIs from digital.
We believe this level of investment is sufficient to support our growth plans in the current environment.
On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8.
That's even to up 3% year-on-year.
We're focused on delivering our annual plan, while managing the quarter-to-quarter volatility that could be higher than normal in this environment.
Finally, because of the different COVID dynamics in 2020 and 2021, we think it is relevant to consider our performance over both years.
So on that basis, using the midpoint of our 2021 outlook, we're projecting to grow organic sales approximately 4% and to increase adjusted earnings per share 7% on average over that two-year period.
Those growth rates are slightly above our medium-term objectives.
In conclusion, we're on track with KC Strategy 2022, and we're managing effectively through a very challenging environment.
We're improving our top line and strengthening our brands, our market positions and our Company for the long term.
We continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'll start today with a review of guest cruise operations, along with a summary of our first quarter cash flows.
Then I'll provide an update on booking trends and finish up with adjusted EBITDA and net income expectations.
Turning to guest cruise operations.
During the first quarter 2022, we restarted 10 additional ships, resulting in 60% of our fleet capacity in guest cruise operations for the whole of the first quarter.
This was a substantial increase from 47% during the fourth quarter 2021.
As of today, 75% of our fleet capacity has resumed guest cruise operations.
Agility to continuously adapt to the ever changing landscape has been one of our greatest strengths during the pandemic.
In the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate this scale as we adjusted restart dates to optimize our guest cruise operations.
And we now expect each brand's full fleet to be back in guest cruise operations for its respective summer season where we historically generate the largest share of our operating income.
I am happy to report that just last week, we announced plans for our Australia restart, commencing at the end of May after the government advised that cruising would be permitted beginning in April.
For the first quarter, occupancy was 54% across the ships in service.
We never expected to achieve our historical 100-plus percent occupancies for the first quarter since many of these sailings were confirmed just a number of months before departure, which resulted in less than the normal booking lead time.
However, we had anticipated first quarter occupancy would exceed the 58% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We started the quarter with over 55% cabin occupancy booked for the first quarter and expected to improve upon that during the quarter.
However, during the first quarter 2022, as a result of the omicron variant, we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, including higher cancellations resulting from an increase in pretravel positive test results, challenges in the availability of timely pretravel tests and disruption than omicron caused on society during this time.
All of this inhibited our ability to build on our cabin occupancy book position for the first quarter 2022 during the first quarter, resulting in occupancy for the first quarter 2022 at 54% being lower than the 58% occupancy we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Despite all that, during the first quarter, we carried over one million guests, which was nearly a 20% increase from the fourth quarter 2021.
Once again, our brands executed extremely well with Net Promoter Scores continuing at elevated levels compared to pre-COVID scores.
Revenue per passenger day for the first quarter 2022 increased approximately 7.5% compared to a strong 2019 despite our lucrative world cruises and exotic voyages being shelved this year.
Our revenue management teams held on price when we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, optimizing our longer-term prospects for future revenue and pricing.
Once again, our onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the first quarter 2022 versus the first quarter 2019, in part due to the bundled packages as well as onboard credits utilized by guests from cruises canceled during the pause.
We had great growth in onboard and other per diems on both sides of the Atlantic.
Increases in bar, casino, shops, spa and Internet led the way onboard.
Over the past 2.5 years, we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package options.
In the end, we will see the benefit of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue.
As a result of these bundled packages, the line between passenger ticket and onboard revenue is blurred.
For accounting purposes, we allocate the total price paid by the guests between the two categories.
Therefore, the best way to judge our performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics.
On the cost side, our adjusted cruise cost without fuel p...
...e full year 2022 compared to 2019.
Next, I'll provide a summary of our first quarter cash flows.
We ended the first quarter 2022 with $7.2 billion in liquidity versus $9.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Looking forward, we believe we remain well positioned given our liquidity.
The change in liquidity during the quarter was driven essentially by four things: first, an improved negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion due to our ongoing resumption of guest cruise operations despite the impact of the omicron variant.
We had thought adjusted EBITDA was going to improve more.
But as I said before, the omicron variant inhibited our ability to grow occupancy during the quarter, which limited the improvement in adjusted EBITDA.
Second, our investment of $400 million in capital expenditures net of export credits.
Third, $500 million of debt principal payments.
And fourth, $400 million of interest expense during the quarter.
Now let's look at booking trends.
Since the middle of January, we have seen an improving trend in booking volumes for future sailings.
Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations.
During the first quarter, we increased our booked occupancy position for the second half of 2022, albeit not at the same pace as a typical wave season due to the omicron variant.
As a result, the cumulative advanced book position for the second half of 2022 is at the lower end of the historical range.
However, we believe we are well situated with our current second half 2022 book position given the recent improvement in booking volumes, coupled with closer in booking patterns and our expectation for an extended wave season.
We continue to expect that occupancy will build throughout 2022 and return to historical levels in 2023.
And importantly, I am happy to report that prices on these bookings for the second half of 2022 continue to be higher with or without future cruise credits, or more commonly called FCCs, normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings.
Our cumulative advanced book position for the first half of 2023 continues to be at the higher end of the historical range, also at higher prices with or without FCCs normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings.
This is a great achievement given pricing on bookings for 2019 sailings is a tough comparison as that was a high watermark for historical yields.
I will finish up with our adjusted EBITDA and net income expectations.
We all know that booking trends are a leading indicator of the health of our business.
With improved recent booking trends leading the way, driving customer deposits higher, positive adjusted EBITDA is clearly within our sights.
Over the next few months, we expect ship level cash contribution to grow as more ships return to service and as we build on our occupancy percentages.
However, as I've already said, adjusted EBITDA over the first half of 2022 has been or will be impacted by the restart-related spending and dry dock expenses as 39 ships, over 40% of our fleet, will have been in dry dock during the first half of fiscal 2022.
Given all these factors combined, we expect monthly adjusted EBITDA to continue to improve and turn consistently positive at the beginning of our summer season.
We continue to expect a net loss for the second quarter of 2022 on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis.
However, we expect the profit for the third quarter of 2022.
For the full year, we do expect a net loss.
Looking to brighter days ahead in 2023, with the full fleet back in service all year, 8% more capacity than 2019 and improved fleet profile with nearly a quarter of our capacity consisting of newly delivered ships, continuing momentum on our outstanding Net Promoter Scores and occupancy returning to historical levels, we are looking forward to providing memorable vacation experiences to nearly 14 million guests and generating potentially greater adjusted EBITDA than 2019.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made.
I hope you and your families are all well.
Despite the challenges facing our industry, we experienced an excellent quarter of leasing activity and rent collections, in addition to making strong progress on several of our ESG initiatives and accomplishments.
Also, we continue to keep two eyes on the current business and a third eye on the future as we start to see opportunistic shifts in the retail real estate landscape.
While we will be disciplined with our capital, we are well positioned to be on the offensive.
We are pleased with the level of leasing demand that we are seeing so quickly after the economy reopened.
This quarter, we executed 106,000 square feet of total new leasing volume, the highest level since the first quarter of 2019.
As a result, our signed not open ABR of $3 million nearly doubled since last quarter.
As we look ahead, our leasing pipeline is very healthy.
Today, we have an additional $1.5 million of ABR that is currently in lease negotiations with significantly more in advanced LOI stages.
Much of this demand is coming from grocery, off-price, QSR and medical-use tenants.
We have also seen an acceleration of traditional mall tenants looking for space in open-air centers.
While this demand creates friction in the market and helps drive pricing, we are being highly selective in this area as we are not interested in turning our centers into outdoor malls with a heavy concentration of full price apparel.
Overall, visibility into our leasing pipeline and pending signed not open balance gives us comfort that incremental cash flows will provide some cushion from COVID-19 store closures.
Along with our solid leasing activity, we achieved double-digit growth in our releasing spreads, including a 43% increase on new leases, the highest level since the second quarter of 2018.
In fact, since mid-2018, after the new management team started, our new releasing spreads have averaged 30%, with an incremental return on capital of 12%, reflecting the mark-to-market opportunity embedded throughout the portfolio.
We look forward, we expect to continue to drive rent as we believe our Midwest and Southeast geographies have in-place rents that are more accessible to tenants.
Leasing highlights for the quarter were new deals with Nike, Sephora, Burlington and Bank of America, to name a few.
These credit tenants not only improve the quality of our cash flows, but are also providing a good return on capital in the mid-teens range.
During the quarter, we opened lululemon at our Woodbury Lake (sic) Woodbury Lakes property in Minneapolis, with initial sales significantly exceeding lulu's forecast.
Touching on our grocery initiative.
We continue to see tremendous opportunity for strongergrow and gain share, including Kroger, Sprouts and Publix.
Each reported impressive quarterly earnings and sales, while Aldi recently announced plans to open 70 new U.S. stores in 2020.
The demand is real, and we continue to see a unique opportunity to improve property values and strengthening the resiliency of our cash flows.
Our pipeline of deals includes the addition of grocers to nongrocery-anchored centers and then opportunities to enhance the existing grocer tenancy.
Negotiations are progressing well on several locations, and we hope to provide further updates in the coming weeks.
Our collection rates in the third quarter showed noticeable improvement, with 87% of base rent and recovery income collected as of October 30.
We have seen further improvements in October, with 90% collected thus far, which is ahead of the pace we experienced for September at the same point in time.
Our collection levels are rising quickly as deferral periods end and tenants resume payment in accordance with their deferred plans.
As a result, our second quarter collections have increased to 76%, up from 65% as reported last quarter.
We also con...
...d not a run rate moving forward, it is a stark contrast to the decrease implied in our share price.
As we look forward, there are puts and takes to the trajectory of NOI.
The puts are items such as signed not open ABR backlog of $3 million, the $1.5 million of signed not open ABR associated with leases in negotiation and embedded annual contractual rent growth.
The takes are any reductions in rent or tenant fallout which is tough to speculate on, given the state of the pandemic.
Regarding third quarter uncollected rent, it's totaled about $6.4 million for the quarter, of which $3.6 million was reserved, as I noted earlier, and $2.6 million was deferred net of reserves, leaving about $200,000 unaddressed.
For reference, this is detailed in our supplemental on page 33.
Touching on our operating fundamentals.
During the third quarter, we signed 44 leases covering 279,000 square feet.
Blended rent spreads were 10.7% driven by our 43% new lease spread, our highest since mid-2018.
We ended the quarter with a leased rate of 93.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially as the effects of COVID-19 begin to impact our occupancy statistics.
Given our solid leasing activity during the quarter, our anchor leased rate was actually up 10 basis points from last quarter, fueled by our Nike and Burlington deals at Front Range Village in Fort Collins, Colorado, where we are seeing excellent leasing demand.
As Brian noted, our small shop leased rate was impacted this quarter as we recaptured eight ascena spaces, which unfavorably impacted our leased rate by 30 basis points.
Bolstered by our rising rent collections of nearly 90% and as a result of liquidity measures we took earlier in the year, we ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $220 million, including $125 million of revolver borrowings and $95 million of cash.
Our cash balance before debt repayments increased by about $20 million.
With our strong third quarter cash flow generation and incremental confidence in our business, we paid off another $50 million of our revolver during the quarter.
We expect to repay additional outstanding amounts on our revolver as stability in cash flow continues to improve and the economy overall returns to more steady state.
We will also continue to keep tight control over liquidity, capex and expenses.
This approach gives us the flexibility to strategically invest at the right time for the long term.
Regarding the dividend, we understand this is a very important piece of our total return to shareholders.
However, as I noted last quarter, we would not need to pay a common dividend for the balance of 2020 to meet our REIT taxable income payout requirement based on our current projections.
The timing of reinstatement remains a quarterly Board decision.
As previously noted, when we reinstate the common dividend, we will do so at a sustainable level that we can grow in conjunction with earnings.
We entered the third quarter with trailing 12-month net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 7.2 times, up slightly from 7.0 times last quarter as another COVID-impacted quarter entered the calculation.
We remain committed to bringing leverage into our long-term target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times as the impacts of the pandemic move behind us.
As I alluded to earlier, and as part of our continuing effort to improve transparency into our business, we have provided a granular breakdown of our first and third quarter recurring revenue and a bridge between reported base rent and recoveries to build an unaddressed rent on page 33 of our supplemental.
We hope you find this helpful as you evaluate the trajectory of NOI from COVID-19.
With respect to guidance, we will not be providing an update at this time, given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of several macro factors, including the pandemic economic stimulus and the results of the election, to name a few.
We will continue to reassess the practicality of resuming guidance in future quarters.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our unique strategy of concentrating assets around U.S. defense installations executing priority missions continues to produce highly resilient, growing cash flows, as demonstrated by our strong first quarter results, representing a great start toward shaping up to be another strong year.
Driven by solid operations and interest savings from our recent bond financing, first quarter FFO per share, as adjusted for comparability, of $0.56 met the high end of guidance and is 10% higher than the first quarter results in 2020.
Additionally, NOI from real estate operations in the quarter was up 6% from a year ago.
And AFFO increased an impressive 26%.
As these year-over-year comparisons demonstrate, we are clearly on a path of sustainable and highly visible growth.
First quarter leasing results were solid, totaling 258,000 square feet, and second quarter leasing is off to a blistering start.
In April, we've completed 662,000 square feet of renewals and vacancy leasing, eclipsing first quarter volume by 2.5 times.
Better-than-planned outcomes on vacancy and renewal leasing are driving our increased guidance for same-property results for the year.
Development leasing in the quarter totaled 11,000 square feet.
However, we're in advanced negotiations on nearly 900,000 square feet that should close in the coming months.
Bridging to financing activities, we completed a second landmark bond offering last month.
The $600 million 10-year issuance has a 2.75% coupon and was the strongest debt financing in the company's history.
The bonds priced a full notch higher than our current ratings, reflecting the market's growing recognition of the durability of our portfolio, our strategy and our cash flows.
So for the second time in six months, the fixed income investor community unequivocally recognized and rewarded our company with robust demand for and exceptional pricing of our bond offerings.
The improved outlook for same-property cash NOI and interest savings from the bond refinancing are driving the $0.03 increase in the midpoint of 2021 guidance for FFO per share as adjusted for comparability, which at the midpoint implies 4.7% growth over the elevated 2020 results.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Todd.
First quarter total leasing of 258,000 square feet included 154,000 square feet of renewals.
Renewal economics were in line with expectations, with cash rents rolling down 2.2%, annual escalations averaging 2.6% and leasing capital being only $1.93 per square foot per year of term.
This month, we renewed 596,000 square feet of expiring leases, achieving an 88% renewal rate.
Cash rents on April renewals rolled up 0.5% and carried an average lease term of 4.8 years.
To date, we have completed 750,000 square feet of renewal leasing with a 77% retention rate and average lease term -- or an average term of 4.5 years and cash rents rolling flat.
Based on our renewal achievement to date, we are increasing our full year retention guidance to a new range of 70% to 75%.
We completed 93,000 square feet of vacancy leasing in the quarter and 66,000 square feet in April, bringing our total to 159,000 square feet, and our leasing activity ratio remains strong.
One lease to highlight from the quarter was a 2-floor 55,000 square foot lease at 6721 Columbia Gateway with Rekor Systems, a provider of real-time technology to enable AI-driven decisions.
Recall that the nonrenewal of that building's anchor tenant a year ago left it 20% leased.
We took the opportunity to reposition the asset, creating amenity areas which appeal to a growing list of high tech and cyber companies in the market.
This property is now 80% leased with strong demand for the remaining availability.
In April, we completed a 7,000 square foot expansion with IntelliGenesis, a cybersecurity defense contractor at 6950 Columbia Gateway, bringing that 2020 redevelopment to 100% leased.
We believe our leasing success at both properties demonstrates the value we add by repositioning building...
... refinance some higher coupon debt.
On March 3, we launched a new 10-year offering at initial price talk on credit spreads of 175 basis points.
The offering was 8 times oversubscribed with an order book that totaled close to $3.5 billion.
Strong demand from many high-quality investors allowed us to upsize the offering to $600 million and significantly drive down the credit spread.
The deal priced at 140 basis points over the 10-year treasury, resulting in a 2.75% coupon and a 1% discount.
We used the proceeds to retire two higher-cost issuances, blocking in annual interest savings of $7 million.
The fixed income investors were highly focused on our ability to deliver large volumes of highly leased, low-risk development to continue to grow EBITDA and FFO.
They also appreciated our strategy of concentrating assets around mission-critical defense locations, which greatly insulates our cash flows from the impact of any work-from-home trends.
The March bond issuance represented the fifth most oversubscribed book of all time in the office sector, and the seventh lowest coupon of any length note ever issued by an office REIT.
This offering reset our credit spreads, which now are well within the band of spreads of peers who are rated one notch higher.
Fixed income investors have expressed their views with their wallets, and clearly value the performance of our portfolio, the resiliency of our cash flows and our growth from low-risk developments.
Regarding operations, same property cash NOI was roughly in line with the low end of our first quarter range.
As forecasted, weather-related expenses were at normal levels compared to extremely light levels in the first quarter of 2020, and parking income continued to be lower than last year, as employees start to return to our urban locations.
Based on current negotiations, we expect several positive leasing outcomes that increase our forecast of same-property cash NOI from our original midpoint of negative 1% to a new range that is flat at the midpoint.
As a reminder, our full year guidance continues to assume same-property occupancy declines modestly during the year, due to the diminished vacancy leasing volume last year and the projected impact of joint venturing additional wholly owned data center shells this year to raise equity.
Our central strategy of value creation through low-risk development, deeply concentrated adjacent to Department of Defense priority missions that support the U.S. government and its contractors, has and continues to provide an average of one million or more square feet of new development opportunities, and by extension, high-value defense IT assets each year.
Our strategy also has created a portfolio of high-credit tenants, whose business cycles are not correlated to the general economy, who have durable and growing business demand, and who are supported by healthy defense spending on priority national defense programs.
These attributes allowed both our company and our tenants' businesses to outperform during the pandemic shutdowns, and continue prospering now during the emerging recovery.
Our 2021 business plan had a great start in the first quarter and adds accelerating achievement and demand levels thus far into the second quarter.
Our recent experience in the debt markets, achieving landmark results for our company, combined with our stock's relative outperformance last year, demonstrate that the investment community recognizes the strength of our strategy, our assets and tenants that result in the strength of our franchise.
Our increased midpoint of full year FFO guidance of $2.22 implies 4.7% growth over the elevated 2020 results and 4.8% compound growth from 2019.
We're firmly on a path of sustainable growth, driven by a durable operating portfolio, a strong balance sheet and a reliable low-risk development program that is producing incremental NOI annually.
We look forward to capitalizing on the growing set of impressive opportunities we have before us.

 Both are available on the Investors section of our website, hudsonpacificproperties.com.
Moreover, this quarter, we've once again included certain disclosure prompted by COVID-19 business changes which we won't maintain once business operations normalize.
They will be joined by other senior management during the Q&A portion of the call.
We had a very strong second quarter in terms of our financial results.
We've also had a very busy start to our third quarter, executing on our growth strategy for Sunset Studios.
And I'll talk a little bit about that more in a moment.
The big picture, the tech and media industries continue to flourish in our markets.
Venture investment and fundraising are at record levels.
The IPO market is strong, tech employment and hiring have recovered to essentially pre-pandemic levels, and media companies are spending billions to produce a backlog of content.
Over the last few months, we've seen a real momentum toward the return of office, and we're optimistic that's going to continue.
Growing vaccination rates, combined with statewide reopenings in California in mid-June in Washington at the end of June and forthcoming in Vancouver after Labor Day, led companies to begin implementing and formalizing plans.
We are still in a wait-and-see mode regarding any major adjustment space configurations or needs.
But even with variance, we're expecting heading into fall, most companies will move forward toward at least a partial reoccupancy of existing space, potentially coupled with vaccine mandates.
We're already seeing this from a few of our larger office tenants.
Essentially, all of our major studio tenants, Netflix, HBO, CBS, Disney, ABC, Amazon, have resumed and are scheduled to imminently resume active production or on our lots with safety protocols in place.
Production is now an overdrive given content demand and pandemic-related shutdowns, particularly here in Los Angeles, where we are building a state-of-the-art global studio portfolio to meet that demand.
To that end, I'm sure many of you saw, we made two very exciting major announcements over the last week around our expansion of our Sunset Studio platform.
The first, Sunset Glenoaks, will be the largest purpose-built studio in the Los Angeles area in over 20 years.
The project is in Sun Valley, minutes from Burbank where Disney, NBC Universal and Warner Media are headquartered and many other production companies like Netflix are located.
We're going to build approximately 240,000 square feet, adding another seven stages to our portfolio for a total investment of approximately $170 million to $190 million.
We're finalizing plans and budgets that could start construction as early as fourth quarter of this year and complete the project in the third quarter of 2023.
This is a 50-50 joint venture with Blackstone and we're on point for development, leasing and property management.
The second transaction, which we announced on Monday, mark Sunset Studio's first expansion out of the U.S. into the U.K. Something I've often noted was on our agenda.
The U.K. has a long history of global production in a media center.
It is a deep pool of talent, crews and services to support productions, regional infrastructure and generous and long-standing tax credits.
Further, investment in the U.K. film and TV investment has grown dramatically over the last five to seven years, while supply and purpose-built studios remains limited.
We're in the entitlement and planning stages to build what will ultimately be one of the three largest purpose-built studios in the U.K. and one of the highest quality production facilities globally for TV and film.
The site comprises 91 acres on undeveloped land, about 17 miles north of London and Box Borne Harpeture, minutes from public transit and close to the Heathrow Airport as well as Central London.
This facility will provide great access to other major studios, production houses, crew and talent.
We purchased the site for GBP120 million thr...
...
For expirations, we addressed in the first half of the year, we renewed or backfilled close to 70%.
Touching on our office developments, we're on track to deliver One Westside to Google in the first quarter of next year potentially sooner.
We're also set to close on the podium for Washington 1000 late in the fourth quarter at which point, we'll have a year to further evaluate tenant interest and broader market conditions and to finalize our time line to start construction.
In the second quarter, we generated FFO, excluding specified items, of $0.49 per diluted share compared to $0.50 per diluted share a year ago.
Second quarter specified items consisted of $1.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share of transaction-related expenses and $0.3 million or $0 per diluted share of onetime prior period supplemental tax expense related to Sunset Gower compared to $0.2 million or $0 per diluted share of transaction-related expenses a year ago.
FFO beat our own expectations at the midpoint of our guidance by $0.02 per diluted share.
This was primarily due to the reversal of reserves against uncollected cash rents and straight-line rent receivables and savings on operating expenses, some of which we expect to incur in the second half of the year.
Second quarter NOI at our 44 consolidated same-store office properties decreased 2.1% on a GAAP basis, but increased 4.9% on a cash basis.
For our three same-store studio properties, NOI increased 17% on a GAAP basis and 29.3% on a cash basis.
Adjusting for the onetime supplemental property tax expense at Sunset Gower, NOI for our same-store studio properties would have increased by 22.8% on a GAAP basis and 35.8% on a cash basis.
At the end of the second quarter, we had $0.9 billion in liquidity with no material maturities until 2023, but for the loan secured by our Hollywood Media portfolio.
This loan matures on Q3 2022 and has three 1-year extensions, our average loan term is 5.2 years.
In late July, in preparation of funding our U.K. Blackstone JV, we drew down $50 million on our revolver, resulting in $550 million of undrawn capacity, we funded our remaining pro rata acquisition costs with cash on hand.
Our AFFO continued to grow in the second quarter, increasing by $11.4 million or nearly 24% compared to Q2 2020.
This occurred even while FFO declined by $3.6 million for the same period.
Again, this positive AFFO trend reflects the significant impact of normalizing leasing costs and cash rent commencements on major leases following the burn off of free rent.
Now I'll turn to guidance.
As always, our guidance excludes the impact of unannounced or speculative acquisitions, dispositions, financings and capital market activity.
In addition, I'll remind everyone of the potential COVID-related impacts to our guidance, including variants like Delta and evolving government mandates.
Clearly, the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic makes projecting the remainder of the year difficult, and we assume our guidance will be treated with a high degree of caution.
As noted, many companies are still determining return to work requirements and the impact on space needs.
Because of this, for example, our guidance does not assume a material increase in parking and other related variable income.
Overall, we assume full physical occupancy and related revenues will not return to pre-COVID levels in 2021.
That said, we're providing both full year and third quarter 2021 guidance in the range of $1.90 to $1.96 per diluted share excluding specified items and $0.47 to $0.49 per diluted share excluding specified items, respectively.
Specific items for the full year 2021 are the $1.1 million of transaction-related expenses and the $1.4 million of prior period supplemental property tax expense referenced in our second quarter SEC filings.
There are no specified items in conjunction with our third quarter guidance.
We appreciate your continued support.
Stay healthy and safe, and we look forward to updating you next quarter.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially.
You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in our Form 10-K filed earlier today.
My first two official months back at Fluor have been extremely busy.
The immediate priority was to reset and communicate our longer-term strategy and the corresponding organizational structure.
As you know, we announced the new Fluor management team in January.
Our collective focus is on the end markets where we have the right technical expertise to add value for our clients, while earning a suitable return for our shareholders.
The recent changes that have been implemented align our business around the strategic priorities identified for Fluor in the near term.
As a reminder, our four strategic priorities are to: number one, drive growth across the portfolio; two, pursue contracts with fair and balanced terms; three, foster a high-performance culture with purpose; and four, reinforce financial discipline.
For a longer-term view of Fluor's opportunities and key focus areas, please tune in to our Strategy Day from last month if you haven't had a chance to view it yet.
Strategy Day kicked off one of the more exciting eras of change and growth in Fluor's long history.
And we are confident that the strategic plan as outlined will deliver a directional earnings range between $3 and $3.50 per share by 2024.
We ended the year with a backlog of $25.6 billion and full year new awards of $9 billion.
New awards clearly reflected the impact of the pandemic and its pressure on our clients.
They also reflect our stringent pursuit criteria and strategy to reduce risk.
Across our end markets, we saw clients delay capital spending plans while they waited for uncertainty from the pandemic to subside.
Based on conversations with our clients, we are starting to see positive momentum and expect to see new awards pick up in the second half of 2021.
We continue to see good prospects across our portfolio and are completing front-end work scopes to populate our future backlog.
However, lower awards in 2020 will create a headwind for 2021 earnings.
Before talking about what we are seeing for 2021, I want to reinforce that the people of Fluor have tackled the challenges of 2020 with a resilience and energy that was unmatched.
These challenges have made us all more adaptive, and I believe that the organization is truly motivated to successfully take the company forward into its next chapter.
Now let's turn to our business lines and how we are aligning our priorities with the opportunities ahead.
Turning to Slide 4.
As we move into 2021, our urban solutions end markets are gaining momentum, specifically, in mining.
We are seeing high demand for metals such as copper and iron ore.
Last year, we booked a significant North American steel project as well as several front-end studies that we expect will convert to follow-on EPCM awards in late 2021 and beyond.
Late last year, we achieved patent completion for the BHP Spence copper project in Chile.
We've had a long-term relationship supporting BHP's capital efforts, and we are proud to be completing another successful project for them.
We are also encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in our advanced technologies and life sciences end markets.
Here, we are pursuing data centers and semiconductor opportunities in North America and major life sciences prospects in Europe.
In addition, Fluor has just been selected for a large biotech project in Europe, and we are finalizing contract details now.
This confirms our strategy to leverage front-end technical solutions into full EPC awards.
Contract signature is expected by the end of Q1 2021, and we look forward to sharing more specifics at that time.
Advanced technologies and life sciences is well positioned to support our clients for advanced manufacturing projects.
This includes opportunities arising from the U.S. government's executi...
...ditional $100 million of annual savings over the next three years as we rationalize overhead to the new shape of our business.
During the fourth quarter, we exited two of our European infrastructure P3 investments and received cash of approximately $20 million.
We also have two North American joint ventures that we expect to exit later in 2021.
Moving to Slide 11.
Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion, up from 2019.
Domestic available cash represented 32% of this total.
We expect to see our cash holding steady around $2 billion through the year, with debt retirement being offset by divestitures and the liquidity improvement measures we have discussed in the past.
Operating cash flow for the full year was $186 million, which included approximately $375 million of cash to fund our legacy projects.
Additionally, our debt-to-capitalization requirement on this amendment facility was expanded to 0.65 times, which gives us more flexibility in current borrowing capacity as we assess our capital needs moving forward.
We believe this is the appropriate size facility we need to support our business given the shift in our strategy as well as another good example of our efforts we are making around the organization to make Fluor fit for purpose.
In 2020, we continued the process of monetizing our investment in AMECO, an equipment rental business; earlier in the year, we sold our operations in Jamaica, closed our operations in Mexico and sold the equipment rental business owned by Stork.
We announced on our Strategy Day call that we have received a letter of intent for our AMECO North America business and are now reviewing options for the remaining South America business.
Our two main financial priorities in 2021 are further stabilizing our capital structure, which we plan to primarily do with debt retirement and divestitures, and booking a pipeline of work that fits our revised pursuit criteria and our strategies.
We are introducing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.50 to $0.80 per diluted share for continuing operations.
This excludes NuScale-related expenses and any impact from foreign currency gains or losses, restructuring or impairments.
This also reflects Stork being a discontinued operation.
As David said, we expect to see new awards begin to pick up in the back half of 2021 with significant earnings per share growth in 2022 as we begin to work these projects.
Though we do not give quarterly guidance, Q1 results have historically reflected higher G&A expenses.
While we are seeing green shoots around the business, the lingering effects of the pandemic will continue to keep awards depressed for the next few months.
Furthermore, our existing backlog is still being impacted by the pandemic.
Though our projects are back online for the most part, government restrictions have slowed down our progress and the rate at which we are able to grow our clients.
Turning to Slide 13.
Our assumptions for 2021 include: a slight decline in revenue as compared to 2020, adjusted G&A expense of approximately $40 million to $50 million per quarter and a tax rate of approximately 28%.
We anticipate average full year margins of 2% to 3% in Urban Solutions, 2.5% to 3% in Mission Solutions and margins of 2.5% to 3.5% in Energy Solutions and improving as the year progresses.
These margins include the remaining impact of zero-margin work flowing through the business.
We also anticipate 2021 capital expenditures to be below $100 million as we divest our AMECO business this year.
As David reaffirmed, we maintain our long-term guidance of $3 to $3.50 of earnings per share by 2024.
We are taking the necessary first steps by strengthening our balance sheet and focusing our growth on end markets where we see the best opportunities for revenue and margin expansion.
With the COVID headwinds starting to subside, we will see a resumption of project awards to drive our profits over the next several years.
Operator, we're ready for our first question.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 He expects to rejoin us shortly.
When I handed over the CFO reins to Darren five years ago, one of the things that I was happy that went with it was the call.
But although Darren is doing well and we expect his return to action shortly, I boldly volunteered to handle the call today.
And just so you know, my agenda is that I do a good job but not such a good job that you won't be clamoring to have Darren back as soon as possible.
Outside of our usual seasonal first-quarter surge in salaries and benefits, expenses remained well-controlled, and credit trends are indicative of the state of the loan portfolio and the forecasted improvements in the economy.
Diluted GAAP earnings per common share was $3.33 for the first quarter of 2021, compared with $3.52 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $1.93 in last year's first quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $447 million, compared with $471 million in the linked quarter and $269 million in the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's first-quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.22% and an annualized return on average common equity of 11.57%.
This compares with rates of 1.30% and 12.07%, respectively, in the previous quarter.
Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $2 million or $0.02 per common share, little change from the prior quarter.
Also included in the quarter's results were merger-related charges of $10 million related to M&T's proposed acquisition of People's United Financial.
This amounted to $8 million after tax or $0.06 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
Net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $457 million, compared with $473 million in the linked quarter and $272 million in last year's first quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per share were $3.41 for the recent quarter, compared with $3.54 in 2020's fourth quarter and $1.95 in the first quarter of last year -- of last year.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible asset and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.29% and 17.05% for the recent quarter.
The comparable returns were 1.35% and 17.53% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
So let's take a look at some of the underlying details.
Taxable equivalent net interest income was $985 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $993 million in the linked quarter.
This reflects a higher level of average interest-earning assets, primarily cash equivalents, and a shorter calendar quarter.
The margin for the past quarter was 2.97%, down 3 basis points from 3% in the linked quarter.
The primary driver of the margin decline was the higher level of cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve, which we estimated reduced the margin by 5 basis points.
And that was partially offset by a 2-basis-point benefit from the shorter quarter.
Similarly, the $8 million linked-quarter decline in net interest income reflects the loss of income from two fewer accrual days.
Changes in interest rates had a minimal effect for the quarter.
Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, average interest-earning assets increased by some 2%, reflecting a 9% increase in money market placements, including cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve, and an 8% decline in investment securities.
Average loans outstanding grew by – grew nearly 1% compared with the previous quarter.
Excluding PPP loans, average loans grew $1.1 billion or over 1%.
Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were essentially flat with incr...
...ences between the former incurred loss accounting method and the CECL standard adopted at the beginning of last year.
Previously, reported delinquencies and transition of loans from accruing to nonaccruing status evidenced by financial stress delinquency or default by borrowers preceded or accompanied the establishment of loss reserves.
Under CECL, we increased our loss reserves last year based on worsening projected economic scenarios.
Significant downgrades of specifically identifiable credits to nonaccrual emerged in the fourth quarter and criticized in the recent quarter -- and to criticize in the recent quarter, consistent with last year's additions to the allowance for credit losses.
The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.6 billion at the end of the first quarter.
The $100 million decline from the end of 2020 reflects a $25 million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses, combined with $75 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter.
The provision recapture and the resulting reduction in the allowance for the recent quarter continued to reflect the ongoing uncertainty as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity, employment levels, and the ultimate collectibility of loans.
That said, the improving economic outlook leaves us cautiously optimistic as to the ongoing effects of the pandemic compared with the greater levels of uncertainty in prior quarters.
Our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and GDP.
Our forecast assumes that the national unemployment rate continues to be at elevated levels, on average, 5.7% through 2021, followed by a gradual improvement, reaching 2.4% by the end of 2022.
I'm sorry, 4.2% by the end of 2022.
The forecast assumes that GDP grows at 6.2% annual -- at annual rate during 2021, resulting in GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels during 2021.
Our forecast considers improved government stimulus, but not any further fiscal or monetary actions.
Nonaccrual loans amounted to $1.9 billion or 1.97% of loans at the end of March.
This was up slightly from 1.92% at the end of last December.
As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $75 million.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 31 basis points for the first quarter compared with 39 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to improve interest, were $1.1 billion at the end of the recent quarter, 96% of those loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.
M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.4% compared with 10% at the end of the fourth quarter, and which reflects a slight reduction in risk-weighted assets and earnings net of -- and earnings net of dividends.
As previously noted, the People's United merger is pending.
We don't plan to engage in any stock repurchase activity while that is pending.
Now turning to the outlook.
While the economy continues to improve and funds from stimulus programs reach our commercial, and consumer clients, we haven't seen enough change in our outlook for 2021 in any significant way from what we shared on the January call.
Aside from the improved credit outlook as evidenced by the reserve release this quarter, I don't intend to provide any updates.
Darren's remarks as to net interest income, loan growth, fees, and expenses still hold.
And those, of course, are predate our merger announcement and don't contemplate any impact from the merger.
We supply the merger-related comments at the time of announcement.
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
So now let's open up the call to questions before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is Jim Koch, Founder and Chairman and I'm pleased to kick off the 2020 third quarter earnings call for the Boston Beer Company.
Joining the call from Boston Beer are Dave Burwick, our CEO; and Frank Smalla, our CFO.
We achieved depletions growth of 36% in the third quarter.
We believe that our depletions growth is attributable to our key innovations, quality and strong brands as well as sales execution and support from our distributors.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our primary focus continues to be on operating our breweries and our business safely and working hard to meet customer demand.
I'm very proud of the patient, creativity and commitment to community that our company has demonstrated during this pandemic.
We remain positive about our future growth of our brands and are happy that our diversified brand portfolio continues to fuel double-digit growth for the 10th consecutive quarter.
We planned some major innovations to be introduced in 2021 for our brands.
These include Twisted Iced Tea Hard Seltzer, Samuel Adams, Just the Haze, our first non-alcoholic beer, Dogfish Head Scratch-Made Canned Cocktails and Angry Orchard Fruit Cider.
We're confident in our ability to continue to innovate and build strong brands to help support our mission of long-term profitable growth.
I will now pass over to Dave for a more detailed overview of our business.
Before I review our business results, I'll start with the usual disclaimer.
Now, let me share a deeper look at our business performance.
Our depletions growth in the third quarter was a result of increases in our Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands, partly offset by decreases in our Sam Adams, Angry Orchard and Dogfish Head brands.
The growth of the Truly brand, led by Truly Lemonade Hard Seltzer, continues to be very strong and we expect the Truly brand to continue to lead the growth of the business into 2021.
In early 2021, we will launch Truly Iced Tea Hard Seltzer, Truly Extra, a higher ABV version of Truly, and other new Truly flavors and package sizes, as we continue to lead innovation in the hard seltzer category.
We believe that Truly Iced Tea Hard Seltzer, which combines the refreshment of hard seltzer with real brewed tea and fruit flavor at only 100 calories and 1 gram of sugar, will further strengthen our position in the category.
Since early in 2020, Truly has grown its velocity and its market share sequentially despite other national, regional and local hard seltzer brands entering the category.
Truly is the only national hard seltzer, not introduced earlier this year, to grow its share during 2020.
We will continue to invest heavily in the Truly brand and work to improve our position in the hard seltzer category as competition continues to increase.
We will also continue to invest heavily in our Live Truly advertising campaign that showcases, variety, colors and joy to hard seltzer drinkers.
Twisted Tea has benefited greatly from increased at-home consumption and continues to generate consistent double-digit volume growth, even as new entrants have been introduced and competition has increased.
Our Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard and Dogfish Head brands have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the related On-Premise closures, but we are pleased that they all finished the month of September with strong growth in the measured Off-Premise channels compared to last September.
For the remainder of 2020 and into 2021, we plan to build upon our success and work to drive our brands to their full potential, with a particular focus on our Truly brand.
We've adjusted our expectations for 2020 full-year depletions growth and our earnings guidance to reflect our trends for the first nine months and our current view of the remainder of the year, which is primarily driven by the year-to-date performance of Truly.
We are expecting all of our brands to grow in 2021 and are targeting overall volume growth rates to be between 35% and 45%.
We have closely managed o...
...ately 2 weeks on hand and was lower than prior year levels due to depletions outpacing supply constrained shipments.
We expect wholesaler inventory levels in terms of weeks on hand to remain between one and four weeks for the remainder of the year.
Our third quarter 2020 gross margin of 48.8% decreased from the 49.6% margin realized in the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of higher processing costs due to increased production at third-party breweries, partially offset by cost saving initiatives at company-owned breweries and price increases.
Third quarter advertising, promotional and selling expenses increased by $11.5 million from the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased investments in media and production, increased salaries and benefits costs and increased freight to distributors because of higher volumes.
General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.1 million from the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to non-recurring Dogfish Head transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million incurred in the comparable 13-week period in 2019, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits costs.
Based on information of which we are currently aware, we are now targeting full-year 2020 earnings per diluted share of between $14 and $15, an increase of the previously communicated estimate of between $11.70 and $12.70.
However, actual results could vary significantly from this target.
This projection excludes the impact of ASU 2016-09.
Full year 2020 depletions growth is now estimated to be between 37% and 42%, an increase and narrowing from the previously communicated estimate of between 27% and 35%.
We project increases in revenue per barrel of between 1% and 2%.
Full year 2020 gross margins are expected to be between 46% and 47% and narrowing down of the previously communicated estimate of between 46% and 48%.
We plan to increase investments in advertising, promotional and selling expenses of between $55 million and $65 million for the full year 2020, a change from the previously communicated estimate of between $70 million and $80 million primarily due to lower selling expenses.
This does not include any increases in freight costs for the shipment of products to our distributors.
We estimate our full-year 2020 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, which excludes the impact of ASU 2016-09.
We are continuing to evaluate 2020 capital expenditures and currently estimate investments of between $160 million and $190 million, a change from the previously communicated estimate of between $180 million and $200 million.
Most of which relates to continued investments in the company's breweries.
Looking forward to 2021 we are in process of completing our 2021 plan and will provide further detailed guidance when we present our full-year 2020 results.
Based on information of which we are currently aware, we are targeting depletions and shipments percentage increases of between 35% and 45%.
We project increases in revenue per barrel of between 1% and 2%.
Full year 2021 gross margins are expected to be between 46% and 48%.
We plan increased investments in advertising, promotional and selling expenses of between $130 million and $150 million for the full year 2021, not including any changes in freight costs for the shipment of products to our distributors.
We estimate our full-year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09 line.
We are currently evaluating 2021 capital expenditures and our initial estimates of between $300 million and $400 million, which could be significantly higher if deemed necessary to meet future growth.
We expect that our cash balance of $157.1 million as of September 26, 2020 along with our future operating cash flow and unused line of credit of $150 million will be sufficient to fund future cash requirements.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made.
We had another very strong quarter, resulting in another raise in our 2021 operating FFO guidance.
We experienced balanced success across all our disciplines as we continue to refresh our portfolio, tenant mix, liquidity and balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on future earnings growth.
We closed on several high-quality acquisitions across all three of our strategic investment platforms, bringing our gross acquisition volume to $500 million in 2021.
We continue to see strong demand for space in our centers and signed a number of key leases with well-capitalized tenants, driving our accelerated signed not opened balance to almost $4 million.
And lastly, we raised or received commitments on $670 million of capital from our equity, debt and joint venture partners, strengthening our liquidity profile and balance sheet.
Starting off with our capital-raising efforts.
I am very pleased with GIC's recent commitment of an additional $500 million to our core grocery-anchored R2G platform, positioning that platform to scale up to $1.7 billion.
We believe this is an endorsement of RPT and our ability to create value.
We are grateful to be in the company of top-tier REITs, like Ventas, Boston Properties, Equinix and others, that have partnered with GIC.
The new commitment provides us with the firepower to further accelerate our portfolio transformation while enhancing our management fee income stream.
We also recently obtained commitments for $130 million in the debt private placement market and received another $40 million through our ATM, demonstrating our ability to access multiple sources of capital to accretively fund our growth plans.
The size of our portfolio is an advantage as it allows us to rapidly reshape our geographic exposures toward higher-growth and more durable markets like Boston, which is now our third-largest market.
We also increased our exposure to Atlanta and Tampa while reducing our concentrations in Detroit, Cincy and Chicago.
This real-time shift in our mix not only improves our geographic diversification but also increases our visibility with retailers, brokers and other stakeholders, which is leading to increased deal flow on both the leasing and acquisition fronts.
To support our data-driven investment decisions, we have an in-house data scientist who developed a proprietary asset scoring model that combines advanced data analytics with a collective knowledge and experience of our investments, leasing, property management and portfolio management teams.
With this dynamic tool, we can continually assess our existing and potential future properties in real time to inform our capital allocation decisions.
Our scoring model was a key advantage for us as we underwrote our recent acquisitions and will continue to be used as we assess our future acquisitions and dispositions through the lens of quality, balance sheet and earnings accretion.
Regarding the acquisition environment, we are currently experiencing a very competitive landscape to acquire high-quality shopping centers, where cap rates for grocery-anchored centers in top U.S. metros are down approximately 50 basis points over the past few months.
As a result, we believe the $500 million of acquisitions that we closed on so far could be up as much as 10% relative to our transacted prices.
Despite the recent cap rate compression, our three investment platforms provide us a competitive advantage to acquire at higher returns, allowing us to remain active on the acquisition front in our target markets.
We continue to work tirelessly, sourcing additional acquisitions, focusing primarily on off-market, relationship-driven opportunities and expect 2022 to be another active year.
We continue to see a healthy pipeline of deals for grocery-anchored centers, smaller strips and wealthy infill suburbs in our core communities and large...
... range.
We are in active negotiations on a number of other pipeline deals totaling about $30 million with strong box demand in Boston, Florida and Detroit.
Turning to the balance sheet.
We ended the third quarter with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6.8 times, down from seven times last quarter.
This is a bit better than expected as a result of the $40 million raised through our ATM and due to better NOI performance.
We continue to expect our leverage to fall toward our target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times as bad debt and occupancy normalize to pre-COVID levels.
Despite the heavy level of acquisition activity in the quarter, our liquidity remains strong.
We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of approximately $10 million and have $295 million available on our unsecured line of credit.
We expect to repay the vast majority of the outstanding balance on the line of credit by the end of the year or shortly thereafter.
One of the core tenets of our balance sheet strategy, in addition to managing overall leverage, is to proactively address our pending debt maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to refinance $177 million of debt.
Included in this amount are all of our private placement notes that mature in 2023 and 2024 and our Bridgewater mortgage that matures in 2022.
We expect to use proceeds from our recent private placement of unsecured notes totaling $130 million, our share of expected proceeds from mortgages placed on R2G assets that we locked rate on totaling $15 million and proceeds from the sale of Market Plaza totaling $30 million to fund these debt repayments.
Following all this activity, we will have reduced debt maturities through 2024 to just 16% of our debt stack.
Over the next two quarters, we also expect to generate $96 million in disposition proceeds from parcel sales to RGMZ, including sales from our recently acquired Northborough and Newnan Pavilion assets and the remaining seed portfolio sales.
These proceeds will effectively be used to fund our share of the debt of acquisition of $68 million and to repay amounts outstanding on our revolving line of credit.
Moving to our increased guidance for 2021.
We initiated a new range for operating FFO of $0.90 to $0.94 per share, which is up $0.02 or 2% over prior guidance.
The primary drivers of the upside were $0.01 from a prior period bad debt reversal and about another $0.01 of lease termination fees recognized in the third quarter.
The key factors that would drive results to the high or low end of the range are the timing of closing of the net lease parcel sales and bad debt reserves.
In addition, our incentive compensation is not finalized until the fourth quarter, which could result in an uptick in G-and-A expense, similar to what we experienced in late 2019.
But I wanted to provide insight into a couple of items as you start to establish your quarterly run rate for 2022.
Our third quarter operating FFO per share of $0.27 benefited from $0.02 related to nonrecurring items, including a prior period favorable bad debt adjustment and a one-time lease termination fee.
In addition, relative to our third quarter results, 2022 G-and-A is expected to increase by approximately $0.01 per quarter related to an uptick in travel-related expenses, similar to 2019 levels, and continued investments in talent to support our growth platforms.
Our framework can be summarized with three questions.
Does the property improve our overall portfolio quality?
How much future value-creation potential is there?
And can we fund the acquisition in a way that's both accretive to earnings and pushes us closer to our target leverage range of 5.5 to 6.5 times?
No deal is as simple as this.
And each has its own unique set of circumstances.
But we think it is important to understand our framework as you build out your own forecast.
Also, as a reminder, it is our normal practice not to include speculative acquisitions unless we have a strong line of sight on a potential close.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.
We plan to release fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings on March 25 before the market opens followed by a conference call.
Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the third quarter.
And then Gene will share some closing comments.
As -- we continue to operate in a very fluid environment, and I was pleased with our ability to once again deliver strong profitability in an unpredictable sales environment.
Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.
The last two weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter.
During the quarter, we remain focused on four key priorities.
The health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in the complex operating environment, deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model.
The health and safety of our team members and guest has always been our top priority.
We continue to follow latest guidance from the CDC as well as our own enhanced safety protocols to create a safe environment for everyone.
This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring mask for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols.
I'm proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe.
Second, our restaurant teams remain focused on our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that results in great guest experiences whether our guests are dining with us or ordering curbside to-go.
Our teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it's still not easy.
That's why we remain committed to our simplified operations, including streamline menus, processes and procedures which continue to strengthen our execution and our guest satisfaction metrics confirm that our restaurant teams are doing a great job delivering exceptional guest experience in this challenging environment.
Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience.
Our brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database.
During the quarter, Olive Garden LongHorn Steakhouse launched refresh websites and all our brands continue to use their digital storefronts effectively.
More than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online.
And at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital.
During the quarter, we also rolled out Curbside I'm Here, which allows our guests to easily notify the restaurant that they've arrived to pick up their curbside to-go order by simply tapping on a link embedded in a text message.
As a result, our operators are spending less time on the phone and more time focused on ensuring orders are accurate and on-time, which is leading to improved guest satisfaction scores.
We also introduced Wait List Visibility, allowing guest to see their place on the waiting list using their phone regardless of whether they've checked in online or in person.
And we're working on several other initiatives, including streamlining our online checkout process and adding additional mobile payment options to provide even more convenience for our guest.
We continue to accelerate our digital journey, and I'm encouraged by the progress we are making.
Finally, we continue to vie...
...ends reversed.
As of today, we have approximately 77% of our restaurants operating with at least partial dining room capacity versus a peak of 97% in the middle of the second quarter.
Moving forward, we may experience further dining room closures and increasing capacity restrictions in the third quarter.
As you may recall, in our last earnings call, we mentioned that the third quarter is historically our peak seasonal sales quarter, driven by the Christmas, New Year's and Valentine's Day holidays as well as travel time during this time of year.
At that time, we also stated that it will be more difficult to increase on-premise average unit volumes if capacity restrictions do not ease.
Current dining room closures, capacity restrictions and reductions in travel will exacerbate our same-restaurant sales comparison to last year due to the higher sales -- seasonal sales from last year.
Additionally, there are still uncertainties surrounding further capacity limitations and dining room closures and the duration of these impacts.
Given all these factors, we are providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter.
We expect total sales to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, resulting in total sales of between $1.53 billion and $1.65 billion, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.50 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares.
With dining rooms closures increasing, we are focusing on our playbook of expense management and off-premise sales.
While there is encouraging news on the broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in the spring, we currently don't anticipate meaningful sales trend improvements until some time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Despite the short-term headwinds we faced with sales trends, operational complexity and impacts to our team members, I'm confident we are making the right decisions for the long-term to create a better guest experience and strengthen our business.
And consistent with our messaging last quarter, we continue to believe we can achieve 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID EBITDA -- pre-COVID sales, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business.
Rick's career represents what our industry is all about.
He joined Darden as a Buster at Red Lobster 1984 and has worked extremely hard mastering many functions.
On January 4, he will become the President of the world's largest full service restaurant company.
He's been a great partner to me over the last five years, and I look forward to working side-by-side with him in his new role.
Additionally, we announced that Raj Vennam will become our Chief Financial Officer.
Raj began his career at Darden in 2003, and has done an exceptional job in every role he has held.
His promotion recognizes the significant contributions he has made to our individual brands as well as the greater organization.
With a brilliant mind and a keen understanding of our industry, Raj is the perfect person to take over for Rick.
I'm excited to see him expand his role in the company as CFO.
Rick and Raj are here with me in the room today, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate both of them.
I want to close by recognizing our team members in the restaurants and at the support center.
I can't say enough about the dedication they've demonstrated throughout the year.
Their focus, commitment and determination is exceptional.
With multiple jurisdictions implementing dining room closures, we know many team members will not get the hours they needed during this holiday season.
That is why we have reintroduced our emergency pay program that will provide three weeks of emergency pay to team members who are furloughed from their restaurant when dining rooms are closed.
Our [Technical Issue] our greatest competitive advantage, and we are committed to taking care of them.
I wish you all a safe and a happy holiday season.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.
We plan to release fiscal 2021 fourth quarter earnings on June 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.
It's hard to believe it's been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business.
When I reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty.
Our portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our Back to Basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results oriented culture.
And while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger.
Our significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment.
The depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions.
We have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators.
Our scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively.
The robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest.
Finally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of COVID-19.
As soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models.
As our Founder Bill Darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our Company has is the quality of our employees, evidenced by the excellent job they do every day.
Throughout this past year, Darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences.
That is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year.
Since March of 2020, we have invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave, COVID-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed.
These investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
In addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today, totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members.
Beginning Monday, every hourly team member, tipped and non-tipped, will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income.
Additionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in January 2022 and to $12 per hour in January 2023.
These investments further strengthen our industry-leading employment proposition.
Lastly, I continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year.
You are the heart and soul of our Company and on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you.
As Gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year.
In addition to executing our Back to Basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage through this situation by remaining focused on the four key prioritie...
...ent charge of $3 million.
This location was in Portland, Oregon, and had been temporarily closed since April.
We finalized the legal recovery during the quarter, resulting in favorability of $16 million.
This favorability was partially offset by $8.8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation.
Excluding these two items, G&A would have been $86 million this quarter.
As a reminder, the mark-to-market expense is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity market this quarter, and due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset on an after-tax basis.
Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.2 million, resulting in a net reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.6 million.
Our effective tax rate of 2.3% this quarter was unusually low due to two factors.
First, the tax benefit from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduced the tax rate by 5 percentage points.
Second, the stock option exercises this quarter drove approximately $7 million of excess tax benefit, reducing the tax rate by 4.8 percentage points.
After adjusting for these factors, our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter would have been 12.1%.
Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden saw segment profit margin increase versus last year despite sales declines.
Our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor, combined with lower marketing expenses, drove this margin improvement.
Segment profit margin declined for LongHorn as higher than average beef inflation and other investments drove higher food and beverage expense.
In addition, both labor and restaurant expenses were higher as a percent of sales due to sales deleverage.
Segment profit margin declined for Fine Dining and Other segments due to deleverage across the P&L from the significant sales decline year-over-year.
We generated over $240 million of free cash flow this quarter, ending the third quarter with over $990 million in cash.
Our recent performance has given us better visibility into the durability of our cash flows.
Therefore, we will return to our 50% to 60% dividend payout target applied to future earnings to determine our dividend.
To that end, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share, matching our pre-COVID dividend level.
The ability to resume pre-COVID dividend levels just 12 months after suspending it is a testament to the strength of our business model and the durability of our cash flows.
And finally, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $500 million which replaces all previous authorizations.
Turning to the fourth quarter.
As of today we have 99% of our dining rooms open with some capacity.
Taking that all into consideration, we currently expect, for the fourth quarter, total sales of approximately $2.1 billion, EBITDA between $345 million and $360 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $1.60 and $1.70 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares.
We've also updated our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be between $285 million and $295 million, and we anticipate opening 33 net new restaurants for the year.
We continue to believe we can achieve pre-COVID EBITDA dollars on 90% of pre-COVID sales, resulting in 150 basis points of EBITDA margin growth, and our Q4 outlook falls within this framework.
As we move beyond the fourth quarter, there are additional costs such as training, travel, growth cost, incremental marketing and other investments that we expect will need to come back into the P&L.
And while it's too early to provide insights into fiscal '22 sales and earnings, we did want to provide some preliminary guidance for a few items.
We expect total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million and open approximately 35 new restaurants in fiscal '22.
We also anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13% for fiscal '22.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who's the President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan.
Before we start, our usual cautionary statement.
Now on to our financial report.
Watsco achieved record first quarter results.
Earnings per share grew 93% to a record $1.39 per share.
Records were set for sales, gross profits, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share.
Now these results were driven by strong sales growth made at higher selling margins, along with improved operating efficiencies.
When we look at our product offering, we achieved double-digit sales growth in equipment, non-equipment, and commercial refrigeration.
And in terms of geography, growth rates during the quarter were similar for U.S. markets and international markets as a whole.
For HVAC equipment, residential sales increased 18%, and commercial equipment sales stabilize and are now trending more positively.
But more important, this is not just about one quarter.
Over the last 12 months, residential equipment sales in our U.S. markets have increased 15%, and we believe meaningful market share gains have been achieved.
Looking forward, we expect business to be strong and that 2021 will be another record year of performance for our company.
Adding more color, Watsco's industry-leading technology continues to gain adoption.
That leads to new customer acquisition and we believe development of greater market share.
Now a few important trends are also continuing.
Active technology users continue to outpace growth rates of nonusers.
Customer attrition among active technology users is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers, and our platforms used by contractors to make sales to homeowners gain more users.
We are happy with our progress, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments.
We, once again, invite you to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its impact.
Moving along financially, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt.
We're excited to have closed two weeks ago on the acquisition of Temperature Equipment Corporation, also known as TEC.
This is a long-established, generationally owned company headquartered in Chicago.
TEC adds 32 locations and approximately $300 million in revenue and establishes Watsco's first major presence in the Midwest United States.
I must say that TEC is a great company with a long and proud history.
They are led by a wonderful team of entrepreneurs, and we are honored to be part of their family.
They are also off to a strong start this year, and we expect their results to be accretive to 2021 results.
We continue to look for other transactions with great businesses like TEC.
While doing our search, we offer our well-known culture -- that is to say, again, when we search, we offer our well-known culture that respects and continues a company's distinct legacy, and we support their plans for growth.
We think that Watsco is a great next step for family owned companies in our industry.
Lastly, a reminder that we raised our dividends by 10% in April 2021 to $7.80, a follow-up to the record cash flow achieved in 2020.
We believe our dividend is a good reason to watch Watsco over the long term.
2021 marks our 47th consecutive year of paying dividends, and yet, we have increased our dividends 19 over the last 20 years, from $0.10 per share in '20 -- in the year 2000 -- let me say that again.

 The theme for our on-hold music today was Strange Days.
It's one of the most common ways I've heard people describe life during this pandemic, strange days indeed.
It's common for some to refer to the current state of affairs as unprecedented.
I've concluded that while almost all agree that these are strange days, whether or not people believe these strange days are unprecedented is definitely age related.
Younger people are more likely to view our current situation as unprecedented.
People my age or older are far less likely to see these current strange days as unprecedented.
In 1967, when I was 13 years old and a rock band name The Doors released the song titled Strange days.
Clearly, I have a background from that.
This is the first versus of the song, ""Strange days have found us.
Strange days have tracked us down.
They're going to destroy our casual joy.
We shall go on playing or find a new town"".
The Doors were way ahead of their time, both musically and culturally.
And indeed, the next few years after 1967 would bring an extended period of strange days and civil unrest that were orders of magnitude stranger than we've seen thus far during the COVID storm.
I'm naturally optimistic, and I promise you this too shall pass.
Since we're all in this together, we will continue to encourage our Camden team to stay true to Camden's why, our purpose for being, that is to improve lives of our team members, residents and shareholders, one experience at a time.
Apartment demand is stronger in the market than we expected given the nearly 40 million Americans that have filed for unemployment benefits with an official employment unemployment rate of 11.1%.
Camden's geographic and product diversification has continued to lower the volatility of our rents and occupancy.
Camden's Sunbelt markets have fewer job losses than coastal markets in the U.S. overall.
Our product mix that offers varying price points in urban and suburban locations continues to work for us.
Camden was prepared for the pandemic.
We have a great culture and a flexible workplace and amazing employees that have adapted very, very well to the current work environment.
Our investments in technology, moving to the cloud-based operating systems and our Chirp Access systems have allowed us to not miss a beat when it comes to leasing or operating our portfolio or making payroll and basic things like that.
We have the best balance sheet in the sector and one of the best in REIT land overall.
We were prepared and continue to be prepared to do as well as we can in this environment, and I think we'll do well long term.
I want to give a shout out to our amazing Camden teammates for all that they do for our residents and taking care of each other every single day.
We want to make sure that we're providing you with the information that you find most useful to your ability to understand the current state of affairs in Camden's markets.
At the outset of the COVID storm, we held an all-Camden conference call during which we told our Camden team that our highest priorities were: number one, taking care of our Camden family; and two, taking care of our residents.
During the second quarter, we made good on that promise.
We undertook various initiatives, including a frontline bonus paid to our 1,400 on-site team members, and we provided grants to almost 400 Camden associates from our long-established Camden employee emergency relief fund.
We also established a Camden resident relief fund from which we were able to provide grants to 8,200 residents at a time of maximum financial uncertainty in their lives.
We were pleased to be able to provide this level of assistance to the people who were financially impacted during the early stages of the COVID crisis.
On our first quarter conference call, we were asked when we thought we could reintroduce guidance.
And we said that when we felt like we had reasonable visibility into the next quarter, we would do so.
At that time, based on the confidence le...
...nts uncollected and not deferred, which totaled approximately $800,000.
Last night, based upon our recent trends, we issued FFO and same-store guidance for the third quarter.
However, given the continued uncertainty surrounding the social and economic impacts from COVID-19, at this time, we will not provide an update to our financial outlook for the full year.
For the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2019, at the midpoint, we expect same-store revenues to decline by 1.6%, driven primarily by lower occupancy, higher bad debt and lower miscellaneous fee income.
We expect expenses to increase by 4.5%, driven primarily by higher property insurance, higher property tax assessments and large property tax refunds received in Atlanta and Houston in the third quarter of 2019.
As a result, we expect NOI at the midpoint to decline by 5%.
We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.14 to $1.20.
The midpoint of $1.17 is $0.08 per share better than the $1.09 we reported in the second quarter.
However, after adjusting our second quarter results for the previously discussed $0.14 of COVID-related charges, our $1.17 midpoint for the third quarter is a $0.06 per share sequential decrease, resulting primarily from: a $0.045 per share sequential decline in same-store NOI as a result of a $0.005 per share decrease in revenue, resulting primarily from lower net market rents; and a $0.04 per share increase in sequential expenses, resulting primarily from the typical seasonality of our operating expenses, the timing of certain R&M costs and the timing of certain property tax refunds and assessments; an approximate $0.005 per share decline in non same-store NOI, resulting primarily from the same reasons; and an approximate $0.005 per share increase in sequential interest expense, resulting from our April 20 bond issuance.
As of today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity comprised of just over $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding on our $900 million unsecured credit facility.
At quarter end, we had $185 million left to spend over the next two and half years under our existing development pipeline, and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022.
Our current excess cash is invested with various banks, earning approximately 30 basis points.
And finally, a quick update on technology.
As I discussed, our on-site teams are having great success with virtual leasing, and we just completed our second virtual quarterly close, a task that would have been so much harder, if not nearly impossible, without our investment in a cloud-based financial system.
As mentioned yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, we are continuing our pilot of Chirp, our smart access solution, with great success.
And we are finding even more ways to utilize the Chirp technology.
At our pilot communities for self-guided tours, our leasing teams can use the Chirp Access application to grant a prospect limited access to tour both the community and specific available apartment homes in a completely touchless exchange.
There is no need for the prospect to pick up physical keys or FOBs or ever even enter the leasing office.
Our leasing teams create the prospect a Chirp account, grant them access to the best apartments chosen per their unique wants and needs and then determine when the prospects access will expire.
Additionally, we can utilize Chirp to quickly and automatically control the number of residents to have access to an amenity space, such as a fitness center, at any given time.
Amenity spaces deemed as reservation only will require residents to use the chirp access application to reserve a specific time slot.
Only those residents with confirmed reservations will have access to open the door of the amenity space for the allotted time.
When the reservation expires, so does access to the amenity.
Clearly, in this COVID-19 environment, our Chirp initiative takes on even more importance.

KRG_q4_2021.txt,"<s>[INST] You are a financial advisor tasked with creating a short summary of an earnings call transcript. You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Actual results may differ materially from these statements.
For more information about the factors that can adversely affect the company's results, please see our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K.
Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
We closed on the transaction in late October, and since then have been working tirelessly to complete the integration and implement KRG's culture and operating philosophy across the combined organization.
The timing of the merger was impeccable and KRG was positioned perfectly to take advantage of the opportunity.
It's now become clear that the merger is even better than we anticipated.
Today, I'm going to speak about three horizons of opportunity for KRG.
Those opportunities that are immediately in front of us, those that will cultivate over the next 18 to 24 months, and those that will materialize over the long term.
The most immediate benefit of the merger, of course, is the significant earnings accretion.
Heath will give additional color as to the underlying assumptions.
While we've only owned the legacy RPA assets since October 22, we quickly jumped headfirst into attacking operational efficiencies with an intense focus, as always, on our leasing efforts.
Against the backdrop of strong demand from a deep and diverse set of retailers, KRG is experiencing significant leasing momentum across all of our open-air product types.
In fact, we're noticing that national retailers are now looking more intently for space across the open-air spectrum, which dovetails nicely with our high-quality and well-located properties.
These positive trends are readily evidenced in our fourth quarter and full year leasing results.
During the fourth quarter, KRG leased over 900,000 square feet at a very strong 12.9% blended cash spread on comparable new and renewal leases.
The blended spread on our fourth quarter comparable non-option renewals was 10.2%.
This is a strong indicator of where market rents are headed for the KRG portfolio.
For the full year, KRG leased over 2.6 million square feet at blended cash spreads on a comparable deals of 10.7%.
As a reminder, those leasing statistics including the leasing activity from the legacy RPAI portfolio are since October 22nd.
If we include the active -- the activity from the legacy RPAI assets for all of 2021, we leased over 5.1 million square feet for the combined portfolio.
Based on this progress, our retail lease percentage stands at 93.4%, up 220 basis points over last year, and yet, we still have significant upside.
The portfolio has signed not-open NOI of approximately $33 million, which will primarily come online during the back half of 2022 and the first half of 2023.
This bodes extremely well for our growth trajectory going into 2023, as the rents from all these leases will be fully annualized.
The good news is that the $33 million of signed not-open NOI represents about half of the near-term leasing-related NOI opportunity.
Our increased scale and improved balance sheet represent a host of immediate opportunities, including the potential for lower debt costs, increased liquidity in our stock, and enhanced relevance with our tenants and vendors.
We are marching toward completing the active development projects detailed in our supplemental.
Based on KRG's underwritten incremental NOI related to the active developments, we are anticipating very solid returns.
We're meticulously reviewing the land bank, also disclosed in our investor deck, in addition to a multitude of other opportunities embedded within the KRG portfolio.
We have learned over the years that each project is unique and requires a customized approach in order to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns.
Sometimes that means bringing in an experienced JV partner or monetizing the land.
For example, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Republic Airways to develop a new $200 million corporate campus on an outdated retail location owned by KRG in Carm...
... front of us is absolutely energizing.
On the integration front, our substantial efforts to date have enabled the combined organization to operate at a high level, and truly embrace our internal model of one team, one focus.
Before I discuss KRG's fourth quarter results, please keep in mind that they're a bit clunky by virtue of the fact that we closed the merger on October 22.
While the results are from the combined portfolios, we only have two months and nine days of contribution from the legacy RPAI assets.
For the fourth quarter, KRG generated $0.43 of FFO per share.
As compared to NAREIT, our as adjusted FFO results add back in the $76 million of merger-related costs and deduct the $400,000 of net prior period activity.
For the full year, KRG generated $1.50 of FFO per share, as compared to NAREIT, or as adjusted FFO adds back in the $87 million of merger-related costs and deducts the $3.7 million of prior period activities.
Our same-property growth for the fourth quarter and full year is 7.2% and 6.1%, respectively.
These results were primarily driven by a reduction in bad debt as compared to the prior-year periods.
Absent the net contribution from prior-period activities, the fourth quarter and the full year same-property NOI growth is 6.8% and 4.3%, respectively.
These metrics and a host of others are set forth on the news summary page in a revised supplemental.
We hope you like the changes.
Our balance sheet and liquidity profile not only remains solid but continue to improve.
Our net debt to EBITDA was 6x, down from 6.1 times last quarter.
Adding in $33 million of signed, but not-open, NOI from the combined portfolio, our net debt to EBITDA would be 5.6 times.
We are in a great position to not only weather any storm but to also take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves.
As John alluded to earlier, we are providing FFO as adjusted guidance of $1.69 to $1.75 per share.
The variance from NAREIT FFO is approximately $0.02, which represents our estimate of $4 million of nonrecurring merger-related costs.
Furthermore, the accounting adjustments related to the legacy RPAI below-market leases and above-market debt, contribute an incremental $0.06 of FFO per share to our 2022 guidance.
This is a good indicator of our future ability to drive rents and reduce borrowing costs.
Additional assumptions at the midpoint include neutral impact from any transactional activity and bad debt of 1.5% of total revenues.
As you all know, providing same-property NOI growth is a SKU proposition for the sector, given all the noise over the past few years.
It is especially tricky right after a merger of two companies that approach the potential pandemic credit loss from different perspectives.
In order to avoid any confusion, we are assuming same-property NOI growth of 2% at the midpoint, excluding the net impact of prior period adjustments.
This estimated 2% same-property growth is primarily driven by occupancy gains and contractual rent bumps.
Last week, KRG declared a dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter.
This represents a 5% sequential increase and an 18% year-over-year increase.
The dividend will be paid on or about April 15th to shareholders of record as of April 8.
One last thought before turning the call over for Q&A.
I think another compelling comparison is to look at our original 2020 FFO guidance of $1.50 per share at the midpoint.
Like our peers, we gave this guidance before the pandemic set in and reflected KRG's run rate after selling over $0.5 billion of assets in connection with Project Focus.
Our 2022 per share guidance represents a 15% increase over our original 2020 per share guidance at the midpoint.
During the course of 2021, many of you asked, when will your earnings return to pre-pandemic levels.
On a per-share basis, not only we return to pre-pandemic levels, but we tacked on another 15%.
Just another testament to the compelling accretion and synergies associated with our well-timed merger.

[/INST] # Kite Realty Group's earnings surged in Q4 following its merger with RPAI, resulting in an immediate earnings accretion and exceeding expectations. Despite only having two months of contribution from RPAI assets, KRG generated $0.43 FFO per share, attributing primarily to operational efficiency improvements and strong demand for open-air retail space.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Last night,we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica will review the business segment and corporate financial details.
At this time last year.
I talked about being prepared to win as the recovery takes hold and I think 2021 is evidence that we were prepared.
Fiscal 2021 was a remarkable year for Cabot as the business recovered from the 2020 COVID lows to deliver record results.
We accomplished this through a combination of extraordinary execution and our commitment to driving growth through differentiated investments.
I would like to spend a little time now recapping the accomplishments of the year.
The Cabot operating model is built on the foundations of commercial and operational excellence and our strength in these disciplines drove our outstanding results in fiscal year 2021.
We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and total segment EBIT of $550 million.
And our focus on cash, resulted in a record discretionary free cash flow of $353 million.
The macro environment in 2021 required resilience and agility and I'm very proud of the Cabot team in how they work tirelessly to support our customers' evolving needs.
Serving our customers and innovating to grow with them is what motivates our team.
This was made more challenging in 2021 given the myriad global supply chain disruptions that companies face and the fact that necessary COVID safety protocols continue to evolve and adjust our normal ways of working.
Additionally, companies experienced sharply rising input costs, which required dynamic commercial management.
Our teams worked closely with our customers to manage through this environment and we were successful in our pricing efforts to ensure our margins remained robust and we could invest to support our customers long-term supply needs.
Fiscal year 2021 mark the sixth year of our advancing the core strategy and I'm very pleased with our record of execution and the growth prospects for our company.
Adjusted earnings per share has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% since the inception of our strategy, ahead of our 7% to 10% target.
A growth focus built around our core segments and disciplined execution have been the hallmarks of our approach.
As pleased as we are with the results since 2015, I'm even more excited about the growth opportunities that lie in front of us and the progress we made in 2021.
Our growth strategy is built on a philosophy of investing from positions of strength and where we have what we call a right to win.
A few highlights from 2021 are particularly noteworthy.
Our unmatched portfolio of conductive carbon additives in our strong customer focus model resulted in a doubling of revenue in our battery materials business year-over-year.
We are progressing with the specialty carbons conversion of our plants in Xuzhou, China and this investment will provide growth across our broad range of specialty carbon applications and will free up additional capacity to support battery materials.
Our inkjet business is well positioned to capitalize on the shift in the commercial and packaging segments from analog to digital printing and we achieved multiple OEM qualifications in 2021 that set us up well for growth as inkjet presses penetrate these markets.
And finally, we continue to the execution of a project to build a specialty compounds production line in Cilegon, Indonesia, which will allow us to meet customer demand for black masterbatch in this high growth region.
While growth and execution are highlights from 2021, these accomplishments have been achieved with sustainability at the core.
We...
... compliance projects.
We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $225 million and $250 million.
This estimate includes continued U.S. EPA related capital compliance spend and increased spending on growth projects related to high confidence, high return areas of the portfolio.
The growth related capital includes completing the conversion of upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty carbons, which is planned to come online in the second half of 2022.
In addition, we are executing on a new specialty compounds unit in Indonesia and have planned growth capital related to capacity expansions in battery materials and inkjet.
Additional uses of cash during the fiscal year included $80 million for dividends.
The operating tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 27% and we anticipate our operating tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of 27% to 29%.
As we look ahead to 2022, I'm excited about the growth opportunities in front of us.
Let me take a couple of minutes to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.
First, we will finalize our 2022 tire customer agreements and we remain positive about the outcome as security of supply remains the top priority for customers.
Demand continues to be strong and is projected to be robust in all regions.
Inventories levels are low across the value chain and global transportation flows remain challenging, all of which are placing a greater premium on local supply.
Second, we'll continue to advance a broad portfolio of strategic growth investments across the company.
In battery materials, we plan to expand capacity at our carbon nanotube facility in Zhuhai, China.
Additionally, the aforementioned specialty carbons conversion of our Suzhou plant will provide 50,000 metric tons of growth capacity across specialty carbons and will free up our network to support growth of battery materials.
We also expect to complete our new specialty compounds production unit in Indonesia later in the calendar year 2022, which will enable us to build on our strong position in the high growth ASEAN region.
And finally, we intend to build on our track record of execution by delivering earnings growth and strong cash flow, while maintaining our investment grade rating and industry-leading dividend.
I hope this gives you some color on our priorities for 2022.
I'll close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook for the year.
Clearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of fiscal 2021 and we feel very good about how the new year is shaping up.
We expect a step-up in Reinforcement Materials starting in the second quarter based on an expected positive outcome from our 2022 customer agreements.
We anticipate improved results across all product lines in the Performance Chemicals segment with above-market growth in our battery materials and inkjet product lines.
Based on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60.
The first quarter results are expected to be generally in line with the fourth quarter with results accelerating as we move through the year.
On the cash side, we anticipate strong free cash flow from year-over-year earnings growth, partially offset by an increase in working capital to support growth.
Cash flow will be used to fund advantage growth investments, dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
Overall, I'm very excited about where we are as a company and where we're going.
The growth opportunities we have in front of us are better than they have been at any point during my time as CEO.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are strong.
Our end markets remain robust and we continue to execute at a high level.
Looking ahead, we believe we have a winning formula, a talented team, an excellent portfolio of businesses that for growth and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on our strategic objectives and continue to grow and lead in our industry.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Mr. Brett McGill President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Mike McLamb, Chief Financial Officer of the company.
These risks include, but are not limited to, the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, and the level of consumer spending, the company's ability to capitalize on opportunities or grow its market share, and numerous other factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I'm very proud of the extraordinary achievements of our team in fiscal 2021; record revenue of more than $2 billion record gross margin of over 30%, record earnings per share, all while achieving record net promoter customer satisfaction scores.
Given the extremely lean inventory and well documented supply chain issues, this is a great achievement in 2021.
Today, I'd like to share highlights from our fourth quarter and full year, followed by a discussion of the results of our strategic growth plan, which will continue to create shareholder value in 2022 and beyond.
Then, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide color on our 2022 financial outlook.
Let me start by touching on our fourth quarter and full year performance.
For the quarter, we generated 16% revenue growth, record gross margin of almost 38%, and record earnings per share of $1.45.
I'm extremely pleased that our strategic acquisitions are exceeding expectations and diversifying our model resulting in robust margins and earnings growth.
Our same-store sales for the quarter were down 7% versus 33% growth a year ago.
As supply chain challenges and lean inventory environment worsened and impacted us as we move through the later part of the quarter.
However, demand remained strong and we see no softening as consumers are still actively seeking the boating lifestyle.
This strong demand environment is highlighted by our customer deposits, which jumped more than 3 times last year's level to over 100 million.
Last year was elevated with increased demand, so this increase, this year, is a significant sign of strong and growing demand.
For the full-year, same-store sales growth was over 13%, on top of 25% a year ago.
Our significant geographic and product diversification along with the effective utilization of our digital platform are driving profitability and growth.
The marine industry is continuing to experience an influx of new boaters.
Given our scale, and global presence, we are benefiting from our growing share of the market.
And based on available industry data, we believe we continue to gain market share.
From a cadence perspective, the supply chain headwinds deteriorated as we moved through the quarter.
I want to emphasize that we are not seeing a demand issue, rather the timing of shipments is impacting our ability to fulfill some customer orders and therefore recognize revenue.
Simply put, if we had the boats, they would be delivered and we'd have even higher revenue.
We are working closely with our manufacturing partners to satisfy the strong demand.
But as many experts in the industry are forecasting it, we'll likely not improve materially until later in fiscal 2022.
It's a unique environment and one that is challenging to predict, but our team will continue to perform.
I also want to underscore our strategic growth plan, and how it is not only driving market share and revenue growth, but expanding company wide margins.
This quarter, we increased our operating margin by 130 basis points over last year's record to 9.5%.
We also finished the fiscal year with an operating margin increase of more than 300 basis points to over 10%.
This performance is directly attributable to our ability to execute our strategy, focusing on higher gross margin businesses, including charter, finance, insurance, marina, storage, parts, service and brokerage.
The gross margin strength we produced in the first nine months of the year accelerated in the September quarter.
Additionally, as we integrate our acqu...
...s.
The acquisitions we completed were all successfully integrated, resulting in record setting results for each.
Additionally, the acquisitions we completed over the last few years are all contributing greatly to our results.
The management teams of each acquired company also are contributing to our overall success.
Our ability to acquire and integrate companies is greater today than at any point in our history.
During the year, we added significantly to the strength of our balance sheet while continuing to make significant long-term investments in our real estate portfolio, our digital capabilities, and our team.
Lastly, for the full year, our earnings per share was close to double the midpoint of our initial guidance.
And I would add that $6.78 is a pretty strong year.
Moving on to our industry-leading balance sheet.
We continue to build cash with over $220 million.
Our inventory at quarter end was $231 million, down 22%, excluding SkipperBuds and Cruiser Yachts, inventory declined about double that percentage.
Looking at our liabilities, short-term borrowings decreased sharply due to lower inventory and related financing, as well as an increase in cash generation.
Due to the demand we are seeing, customer deposits, as Brett said, more than tripled to over $100 million, setting another new record.
Our current ratio is over 2, and our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is at 1; both of these are very impressive balance sheet metrics.
Our tangible net worth is about 400 million.
Our balance sheet has always been a formidable strategic advantage, and now more than ever, it provides the capital for growth and expansion as opportunities arise in good or bad times.
Turning to our guidance for fiscal year 2022.
Fiscal 2021 and the September quarter generated significant operating leverage and demand remains strong.
The challenge with projecting 2022, are the assumptions around the supply chain.
Today, given what we're being told from our various manufacturing partners, we do expect retail unit growth in 2022.
However, until we see more stabilization in the supply chain, our guidance assumes basically flat units.
This, combined with increases in our average unit selling price, should provide annual same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits.
Including the remainder of the Cruisers and Nisswa acquisitions, we expect total annual revenue growth in the high single digits to 10%.
Given the inflationary pressures in the marketplace, we do expect modest margin pressure.
We have levers to mitigate these pressures but believe it's prudent to include it in our expectations for now.
Our guidance is also, before any other acquisitions that we may complete, including Intrepid, using the low end of our historical leverage range, plus a modest share increase and a tax rate of 20%, results in our earnings per share guidance range of $7.20 to $7.50.
Obviously, we expect to update you throughout the year as our visibility increases on the supply chain.
Turning to current trends, October is forecasted to end with positive same-store sales growth and our backlog is at record levels.
As we have said, industry demand remains strong and we are generally outperforming these elevated levels.
2021 generated landmark metrics for MarineMax and I am very proud of our team's ability to execute on our strategy and to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions, driving superior operating leverage.
We are pleased to see our business continue to build strength and are confident in our strategy for 2022 and beyond.
Our operating margin ended the fiscal year at over 10%, almost double 2019.
This is the result of our team's commitment to capitalize on the strong industry demand.
While we know we will face a few challenges related to the supply chain and inventory as we start fiscal 2022, beyond our organic growth, we will pursue additional brand expansions and higher margin businesses to support our strategy to create long-term shareholder value.

[/INST] # MarineMax reported a record-breaking fiscal 2021, with revenue exceeding $2 billion, gross margin over 30%, and earnings per share of $6.78. Despite a challenging supply chain environment impacting same-store sales growth in Q4 (down 7%), customer demand remained strong, with deposits tripling to $100 million. The company's strategic acquisitions exceeded expectations, driving robust margins and earnings growth. For fiscal 2022, MarineMax expects flat unit growth due to supply chain challenges, but anticipates high single-digit to 10% total revenue growth. Earnings per share guidance is projected at $7.20 to $7.50, incorporating modest margin pressure from inflationary pressures. The company's strong balance sheet and industry-leading demand position it well for continued growth and strategic acquisitions.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These types of statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those described in MFA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other reports that it may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Little did I know that I would have to compete for airtime with Chairman Powell who is testifying in the Senate at 10:00 AM.
I apologize for those of you who drew the short straw and get stuck on our call.
Before we begin, I want to give a shout out to our entire MFA team.
The last three months have obviously been extremely challenging and made exponentially more so by the fact that all of our efforts have been remote.
The Company fully implemented our business continuity plan during the third week of March and successfully completely transitioned to our remote work environment to address the operating risks associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The effort and commitment displayed by our entire team over the last three months has been extraordinary and I've been humbled by their dedication.
Before we discuss the first quarter of 2020 financial results, which frankly at this point seems like ancient history, I'd like to spend some time discussing what other important work streams have been taking place at MFA since March 23 and I think it will be obvious why we've been silent on so many of these activities.
These critical efforts have been comprised primarily of three things.
One, forbearance; two, balance sheet and liquidity management; and three, sourcing third-party capital.
As arduous that these forbearance agreements have been to negotiate and operate through, they have provided us with the time to manage our balance sheet and liquidity while also working to source third-party capital and we are grateful to our lending counterparties that stuck with us through three versions of forbearance plans.
During April and May, we significantly reduced our balance sheet in an effort to raise liquidity and delever.
Importantly, because we entered into these forbearance plans, we were able to manage our balance sheet in a more judicious fashion, given the time allowed through forbearance.
Many of our asset sales, particularly on mortgage-backed securities, were at prices significantly higher than the price levels that existed in late-March.
Our sales during the month of April alone of legacy non-agencies, CRTs, and MSR-related assets generated over $150 million of realized gains versus March 31 marks.
Now, while still down significantly from values at the end of February, the patience permitted through forbearance enabled us to work hard to lessen book value erosion.
We were also able to manage the sale of a large non-QM whole loan portfolio that traded in late-April and closed in mid-May.
While we realized a significant loss on the sale, we are confident that we achieved a much better execution by controlling and managing the trade than we would have realized had the lender just liquidated the pool.
In the end, all of our lenders will have been fully repaid with no deficiencies, which is another of the design goals of the forbearance plan.
It was clear to us in late March that our situation was not due to bad assets, but the fragile funding and the path forward would require more durable forms of financing.
We also recognize that term financing, margin holiday and/or non-mark-to-market financing would necessarily require higher haircuts and therefore more capital.
Our method for seeking third-party capital began somewhat passively during the last week of March with fielding incoming indications of interest.
As this process intensified with more and more parties together with negotiating NDAs and then responding to voluminous data requests, all the while with our hair on fire negotiating a forbearance agreement while managing our balance sheet and liquidity and we engaged Houlihan Lokey at the end of March to manage...
...nt in securities pricing through April and May whereas loan pricing changes were less defined and slower to occur, both on the way down and on the way back up.
More importantly, it is more difficult to get non-market -- non-mark-to-market financing on mortgage-backed securities than it is on loans due to certain regulatory issues.
So, the decision was relatively easy.
We view loans as generally more attractive assets and -- than securities and loans are more conducive to more durable financing arrangements.
In rough numbers, our whole loan portfolio today is comprised of non-QM loans, $2.4 billion, loans at fair value, $1.2 billion, fix and flip loans, $850 million, purchase credit impaired or reperforming loans, $660 million, single family rental, $500 million, season performing loans, $150 million, and REO or real estate owned of $375 million.
Looking forward, we will finance a significant portion of this portfolio through term non-mark-to-market financing, including securitization.
With the committed $1.65 billion in our existing securitizations of approximately $500 million, we will have over $2 billion of such financing.
And as mentioned previously, we are working on a similar committed line with Athene and another dealer for our fix and flip portfolio.
We will continue to pursue securitization, particularly for non-QM loans.
Spreads for AAA securities widened out from the 100 area, that's 100 over swaps in early March to as wide as plus 400 at the depth of the crisis, but they've been slowly grinding tighter and are now back to mid-100 levels.
We expect that following the closing and funding of these transactions, we will be able to declare and pay the accumulated dividends on our Series B and Series C preferred stock issues.
As we have disclosed previously, the terms of the forbearance agreement prohibited payments of dividends on any equity interests, including preferred stock.
Once the preferred stock dividends are current, we will no longer be prohibited from paying a common dividend.
As far as the dividend on MFA's common stock, the Board of Directors will determine our dividend policy going forward.
While we do not provide guidance as to expected future dividends, I will share several pertinent facts that will clearly be given consideration in framing dividend discussions with the Board.
One, at present we have undistributed REIT taxable income from 2019 of $0.05 per share.
In order to avoid paying corporate income tax, we are required to declare a dividend for this income prior to filing of our 2019 REIT tax return, which we do in October of this year and pay such dividend before the end of the year.
Two, estimated REIT taxable income or ordinary income for the first quarter of 2020, is approximately $0.10 per share.
In order to avoid paying a 4% excise tax on this amount, we are required to declare dividends in 2020 for at least 85% of our estimated 2020 REIT taxable income.
And three, capital losses, again for tax purposes, generated from sales of residential mortgage assets to date in 2020 are carried forward and offset future capital gains.
However, these capital losses do not offset ordinary REIT taxable income.
While we cannot forecast ordinary REIT taxable income for the balance of 2020, any such income generated will be added to the $0.10 in the first quarter in determining the threshold necessary to avoid the 4% excise tax.
Our other brief update.
At June 12, our unrestricted cash was $242 million.
Book value as of May 31 -- GAAP book value is estimated to have increased by approximately 2% to 3% versus March 31.
Economic book value is estimated to be flat versus March 31.
This is primarily because carrying value loan marks were lower in April than in March and while we have seen some appreciation from April to May, the May loan marks for carrying value loans, which is what determines economic book value for the difference between GAAP and economic book value, those marks are still below the March marks.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable -- attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. is included in today's release.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter.
The results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins.
Revenues grew over $1.1 billion, or 8.7% as compared to the prior year.
This growth was generated by highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in March.
Generally speaking, March trends are continuing into April.
Inpatient revenues increased by 12%.
The acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both the case mix index, which increased 7% and length of stay which grew by 6%.
Additionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits, compared to 26.5% last year.
The commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past four quarters.
These two factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admissions.
The total -- the total admits were down 4.2% year over year.
In comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%, which was -- which was in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total admissions.
Throughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined.
January with 17%, February was 8%, and March was down to almost 5%.
Outpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to the prior year.
This result is better performance than the previous two quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%.
Outpatient revenues declined in January and February, consistent with that trend.
But March, which had one additional weekday this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly.
Same facility outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year.
As compared to 2019, they declined 3%.
E.R. visits declined 18%.
This decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the previous two quarters.
visits were down 19% compared to 2019.
Our teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda.
The adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales as well as losses on debt retirement, increase 78% to $4.14.
During the quarter, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home health and hospitals business of Brookdale Senior Living.
This business provides us with a large platform that complements our local provider systems.
It will expand the services we offer across our networks and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their experiences.
Additionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for healthcare in the future with continuing growth and demand.
We anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter and we look forward to our new partnership with Brookdale.
Also during the quarter, we opened two new hospitals.
One in Denver and one in Orlando.
Each of these hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities.
In the second quarter, we expect to close on the acquisitions of two small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and Savannah.
And lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access, and value for patients by developing more outpatient facilities.
The pipeline for development and acquisition in this category remains strong.
As we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors.
Mainly, governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets including uninsured assumptions.
Bill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments.
The first corps is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by our teams were on display.
We could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our patients and the communities we serve.
As we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda, we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all our stakeholders.
Sam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results so I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter and then review our updated 2021 guidance.
As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
Capital spending for the quarter was $654 million and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter.
We have approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization and consistent with our year-end discussion.
We are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021 subject to market conditions.
Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85 times and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.
We expect revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion.
We expect full-year EBITDA to range between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion.
We expect full-year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30 and $14.30.
And our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion.
Our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first quarter, and also considers the extension of the public health emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year.
In summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the balance of the year, but we are confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles and we are well-positioned to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if they become available.
Please remind everyone to limit their questions to one so that we may keep trying and get in the queue as possible.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website.
We'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call.
This cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We also have other company representatives available to help answer any questions you may have after Steve, Lisa and Darrel provide updates.
On Slide 4, we present our quarterly and annual financial results.
IDACORP's 2019 fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of $0.41 per share over last year's fourth quarter.
IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the full-year 2019 were $4.61, an increase of $0.12 per share over 2018.
These full-year results represent the 12th straight year of earnings growth for IDACORP and are the highest achieved in its history.
IDACORP's cumulative average growth rate in diluted earnings per share is 7.9% since 2007.
Today, we also initiated our full-year 2020 IDACORP earnings guidance estimate to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize any of the tax credits in 2020 that are available to support earnings in Idaho under its settlement stipulation with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.
Last week, we announced that after 24 years with the company that I would retire effective June 1 of this year.
In connection with this decision, our board of directors selected Lisa Grow to succeed me as president and CEO of IDACORP and Idaho Power effective June 1 and also appointed her to the boards of directors of both companies effective last week.
She's an electrical engineer by training and she's got over 32 years of experience at Idaho Power.
Not only does she have a long tenure at the company, she also has a long history with Idaho Power as her grandfather was a lineman with the company for 30 years prior to Lisa joining the company.
She has contributed significantly to the operational and financial success of Idaho Power since becoming an officer in 2005.
She has earned the opportunity to take over the reins as we move forward into 2020 and beyond.
I look forward to continuing to serve as a member of the board of directors once I step away from my executive roles.
With that short introduction, I will now turn the time over to Lisa for some updates on the company, as well as ongoing economic activities.
I am honored by the opportunity to succeed you, and I look forward to the exciting times ahead.
In addition to the financial success noted by Justin, Idaho Power set records across several of our important metrics: safety, customer satisfaction and reliability.
On Slide 5, we see details of the company's record employee safety results in 2019.
We are very excited and proud to see injuries at an all-time low as we continue to spend significant time on our safety culture and to emphasize the importance of safety at work and at home.
Our record-setting results in residential and business customer satisfaction are shown on Slide 6.
As the population within our service area continues to grow, Idaho Power is working hard to meet our customers' evolving needs.
Most Idaho Power customers experienced -- most Idaho customers experienced an overall price decrease for the second consecutive year in 2019 with business customers' rates going down by at least 5%.
Idaho Power's efforts to keep prices affordable, provide personal service and improve the customer experience are paying off as overall customer satisfaction metrics continue to rank near the top of the list among our peer utilities.
Reliability is a key piece of the customer satisfaction puzzle and is also included on Slide 6, which shows another outstanding year.
Idaho Power kept customers' lights on 99.975% of the time in 2019, and overall system reliability was among the best in company history, finishing very close to 2018's record results.
As noted on Slide 7, Idaho Power service area continues to ex...
...e nature, timing and amount of the underlying property sales at IFS are difficult to predict and are controlled by third parties, we do not expect them to be as significant in 2020.
Overall, Idaho Power's and IDACORP's net income were $2.1 million and $6.1 million higher than last year, respectively.
IDACORP and Idaho Power continue to maintain strong balance sheets, including investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, which enable us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and dividend payments.
Regarding dividends, you'll note that in addition to the latest dividend increase of 6.3% announced by the board of directors last September, the board also increased IDACORP's target dividend payout ratio to 60% to 70% of sustainable earnings.
This reflects several years of our steady upward trajectory of dividend increases.
We expect to recommend an annual dividend increase of 5% or more to the board of directors in the coming year.
On Slide 10, we show IDACORP's operating cash flows along with our liquidity positions as of the end of 2019.
Cash flows from operations were $125 million lower than 2018.
These were mostly related to changes in regulatory assets and liabilities like those resulting from the power cost adjustment mechanism and the timing of working capital receipts and payments.
The liquidity available under IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities is shown on the bottom of Slide 10.
At this time, we do not anticipate issuing additional equity in 2020 other than relatively nominal amounts under the compensation plans.
Slide 11 shows our first look at full-year 2020 earnings guidance and our key financial and operating metrics estimates.
We are initiating IDACORP's 2020 earnings guidance in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share, which is up roughly 4% over prior-year guidance range and assumes no use of additional tax credits under normal weather conditions.
Our record 12 years of earnings growth is something that sets us apart from our peers.
We expect O&M expenses to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million, which would keep O&M relatively flat for the ninth straight year.
We expect capital expenditures will lift somewhat to the range of $300 million to $310 million.
You'll note that our updated five-year forecast of capital expenditures is also higher than our previous plan, now forecasted to range from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion over that time.
This forecast still does not include the majority of costs to build the major infrastructure projects, such as Boardman to Hemingway or increased compliance costs associated with the new Hells Canyon license due to the uncertainty and the exact timing of that spend.
Finally, our current reservoir storage and stream flow forecast suggests that hydropower generation should be in the range of 6.5 million to 8.5 million megawatt hours.
With that, I'll turn the time back to Darrel.
There is much to be proud of as we look back on the outstanding results of 2019.
While the energy industry is rapidly evolving, IDACORP continues to meet challenges and opportunities while delivering unparalleled results for customers and investors alike.
From meeting financial targets to striving for a cleaner energy future, we believe that our employees and our ongoing business strategy will help sustain our success into the future.
I will close with a look at weather on Slide 12.
The latest projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggests an equal chance of above or below normal precipitation levels and a 40% to 50% chance of above normal temperatures from March to May.
We have seen a lot of snow and rain in recent weeks.
As a reminder, our power cost adjustment mechanisms in Idaho and Oregon significantly reduced earnings volatility related to changes in our resource mix and associated power supply costs that can fluctuate greatly due to weather.
With that, Steve, Lisa and I and others here today will be happy to answer questions you may have.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate you joining us.
Let me begin by outlining our plan for this evening's call.
First, I'm going to discuss the details behind our second quarter 2021 financial results.
Paul will then comment on the key drivers behind our Q2 results and our plan for the remainder of the year.
I will return to provide our financial guidance for the third quarter and an update to the full year guidance.
We will then end the call with a question-and-answer session.
In addition, some of our discussion may include non-GAAP financial measures.
Now let's discuss our second quarter results.
We achieved $0.91 and adjusted earnings per share and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA with our growth rebounding ahead of plan from the pandemic lows a year ago.
As for our growth metric, the average number of paid worksite employees increased by 7% over Q2 of 2020 above the high end of our forecasted range of 5% to 6%, and this was a sequential increase of 4.3% over Q1 of 2021.
Both worksite employees paid from new client sales and net gains from hiring in our client base exceeded our targets and second quarter client retention came in at our historical high levels of 99%.
Now along with worksite employee growth, our revenue per worksite employee, which included a 6% increase in pricing and the non-recurrence of the 2020 FICA deferral and customer service fee credits exceeded our expectations.
Our workers' compensation program also continued to produce favorable results.
In spite of these three factors, we experienced a decline in gross profit of 9% from Q2 of 2020 related to the dynamics associated with the pandemic.
First, during Q2 of 2020, with the onset of the pandemic, we experienced unusually low utilization in our health plan, and therefore lower benefit costs.
Over the first half of this year, we have seen an increase in healthcare utilization, including elective care that was previously deferred and COVID-19 related vaccination, testing and treatment costs along with changes in claim payment patterns by our carrier associated with these claims.
Second area of gross profit unemployment taxes has been favorable relative to our expectations coming into 2021.
We prudently budgeted for an increase in state unemployment tax rates coming off of the high 2020 unemployment levels.
Ultimately, many states elected not to raise their rates at anticipated levels including Texas, whose rate we received during Q2.
Also, we experienced a change in client mix that had a favorable impact on our SUTA cost.
So, the gross profit contribution from our payroll tax area has exceeded our budget through the first half of 2021.
Moving forward into the second half of this year, we have appropriately lowered our pricing to allow our clients and prospects to benefit from our lower SUTA costs while still targeting our initial budgeted spread between price and cost.
We will closely monitor SUTA rates as we enter 2022 to determine the need for any further pricing adjustments.
Now, another positive outcome in the payroll tax area during Q2 was the receipt of $11 million of federal payroll tax refunds related to prior years.
As for our Q2 operating expenses, we continue to balance managing costs relative to the ongoing pandemic while also investing in our current and long-term growth plans.
We have increased our marketing spend related to lead generation activity and have incurred costs related to our sales force implementation.
Other corporate employee head count has remained relatively flat in the first half of 2021.
We have reinstituted travel for certain employees in events, however, these costs along with other G&A costs continue to be managed at historically low levels as the economy in our growth recovers from the pandemic.
Our financial position and liquidity remains strong as we continue investment in our growth and provide returns to our shareholders.
During the quarter, we repurchased 98,000 shares of stock at a cost of $9 million, raised our dividend rate by 12.5% pa...
...ynamic than I've seen in the 35 years building our company and industry.
At the core of this optimism is the recognition of the importance of the HR function and the need for consultative HR support to achieve business objectives.
I've mentioned throughout the pandemic the increase in the number and average length of time of interactions with our client owners and C-level management.
Another element and maybe the most significant change to note is the topics being discussed at this level, including corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, employee communication and emotional support and talent acquisition and retention.
It is apparent that developing and implementing an ongoing people strategy is front and center in the minds of business owners and the C-suite.
This reality highlights the value of the PEO option for small and mid-sized firms in general and even more so the distinct competitive advantage of Insperity's premium service offering.
So, we believe it's time to pull gas on the fire and prepare for the growth potential in the years ahead.
We are in a great position to ride the wave of the recognized value of a sophisticated HR function on top of a second wave of the growing awareness of the PEO solution on top of a third wave of the value Insperity can deliver with our superior service model.
We intend to continue to capitalize on this expanding market opportunity by investing in innovative ways designed to drive awareness and adoption of Insperity's best of class offerings.
We believe this will allow us to continue to deliver on our mission of helping businesses succeed, so communities prosper and provide exceptional returns to our shareholders.
At this point, I'd like to pass the call back to Doug.
Now let me provide our guidance for the third quarter and an update for the full year 2021.
We are now forecasting 5.5% to 6.5% worksite employee growth for the full year, an improvement over our previous guidance of 4% to 6% growth.
This increase is based upon our outperformance during the first half of the year leading to a higher starting point going into Q3, continuing momentum in sales and client retention and some continued hiring by our clients.
We are forecasting Q3 paid worksite employee growth of 9.5% to 10.5% over Q3 of 2020, so it's coming off the 7% year-over-year growth in the prior quarter.
As we approach our annual fall sales campaign, we have taken a portion of the upside in earnings created during the first half of this year and invested it in initiatives designed to build upon our strong sales momentum.
These initiatives include the continued hiring of Business Performance Advisors, increased investment in advertising and reinstituting our corporate sales and client retention fall campaign event.
Also, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, as a result of the 2021 SUTA rates coming in lower than anticipated.
We have taken the opportunity to pay savings to our renewing clients and prospects through lower SUTA pricing allocations over the latter half of 2021 to further support our sales and retention goals.
Now, there does seem to be continued uncertainties around the pandemic and its impact on our direct cost programs, particularly in our benefits area where COVID-related costs, potential deferred care, higher acuity and the Delta variant are potential factors.
Therefore, we continue to take the approach of adopting a wider than usual range around our earnings expectations.
When considering this factor and the investment of a portion of the earnings upside for the first half of the year, we are now forecasting adjusted EBITDA in a range of $258 million to $288 million.
This is up from our previous guidance of $250 million to $280 million.
As for full year 2021, adjusted EPS, we are now forecasting a range of $4 to $4.59 up from our previous guidance of $3.83 to $4.40.
As for Q3, we are forecasting adjusted EBITDA in a range of $52 million to $62 million and adjusted earnings per share from $0.74 to $0.93.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm here today with Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn and CFO, Joe Reitmeier.
Todd will review key points for the quarter.
Joe will take you through the company's financial performance for the quarter and year as well as the outlook for 2021.
To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and requeue for any additional questions.
All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period.
For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong momentum in our Residential business, and year-over-year improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration.

Within this, replacement revenue was down low-single digits at constant currency, but with planned replacement down high single-digits and emergency replacement up low double digits.
New construction revenue was down a mid 20s percentage.
Breaking our revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down low-double digits.
National accounts equipment revenue was down mid-teens.
On the service side, Lennox National Accounts Service revenue was down high single-digits.
Some highlights to mention for commercial.
Our team added six new National Account equipment customers in the quarter to bring the total to 32 for the year.
While small today, we are seeing fast indoor air quality revenue growth led by our new Building Better Air initiative.
And in the first quarter, we are on track with the launch of our new Model L rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field in energy efficiency.
The Model L features variable speed technology and an all-new advanced control system.
We are seeing higher -- we are seeing high customer interest in this industry leading product for 2021.
Overall commercial backlog is up double ...
... due to the COVID-19 pandemic, $4.2 million for asbestos related litigation, a net loss of $2.3 million related to damage of the company's manufacturing facility in Iowa, a net charge of $600,000 in total for various other items, and a benefit of $4.2 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
Corporate expenses were $30 million in the fourth quarter, and $92 million for the full year.
Overall, SG&A was $143 million for the fourth quarter or 15.7% of revenue, down from 16.3% in the prior year quarter.
For 2020 overall, SG&A was $556 million or 15.3% of revenue, down from 15.4% on an adjusted basis in the prior year.
For 2020, the company had cash from operations of $612 million compared to $396 million in the prior year.

And proceeds for damage to property and disposal of property were $1 million compared to $81 million in the prior year.
Free cash flow was $535 million for the year compared to $371 million in the prior year.
In 2020, the company paid $118 million in stock -- in dividends and repurchased $100 million of company stock.
Total debt was $981 million at the end of the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7, and cash and cash equivalents were $124 million at the end of the year.
Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same.
We expect industry to see mid-single digit shipments growth in residential, commercial unitary and refrigeration markets in North America.
The company's guidance for 2021 remains the same as we presented at the December Investment Community Meeting.
Our guidance for 2021 revenue growth is 48% with neutral foreign exchange impact.
We still expect GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $10.55 to $11.15, with about half of the earnings in the first half of the year and half in the second half of the year.
Let me now run through other key points on our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021, all of which are unchanged.
We expect a benefit of $50 million in price for the year.
We expect a benefit of $25 million from sourcing and engineering led cost reductions, and a $20 million benefit from factory productivity.
We are guiding for residential mix to be neutral.
[Technical Issues] foreign exchange will be neutral as well.
For the headwinds in 2021, we expect a $30 million headwind from commodities.
Freight is expected to be a $5 million headwind.
We will be at more -- at a more normal run rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned.
Tariffs are expected to be a $5 million headwind.
We are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or headwind of about $45 million.
Within SG&A, we will be making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, control, e-commerce, factory automation, and productivity.
A few other guidance points.
Corporate expenses are targeted at $90 million.
Net interest in pension expense is expected to be approximately $35 million.
We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year.
We are planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which are for the third plant and our campus in Mexico.
We expect construction to be completed by the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid 2022.
We expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant.
Free cash flow is targeted at $325 million as we reinflate working capital to support strong growth.
And over the long term we expect free cash flow to approximate net income on average.
And finally, we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 to 38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.
And with that, John, let's now go to Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'll now discuss the financial results.
We reported revenue of $267 million during the first quarter of 2022, which represents an increase of 16%, compared to $230.1 million during the first quarter of 2021.
The increase was largely attributable to volume increases in our Fenestration segment, combined with higher prices related to the pass-through of raw material cost inflation.
More specifically, we realized net sales growth of 14.5% in our North American fenestration segment, 15.5% in our North American cabinet components segment, and 18.6% in our European fenestration segment, excluding the foreign exchange impact.
We reported net income of $11.2 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the three months ended January 31st, 2022, compared to $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share during the three months ended January 31st, 2021.
On an adjusted basis, net income increased by 25.9% to $11.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021.
The adjustments being made to earnings per share are for restructuring charges, loss on the sale of a plant, foreign currency transaction impacts, and transaction and advisory fees.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter was essentially flat year over year at $24.4 million, compared to $24.3 million during the same period of last year.
The increase in earnings for the three months ended January 31st, 2022, was attributable to continued strong demand, operational efficiency gains, and increased pricing.
However, the decrease in margin percentage was driven by inflationary pressures and time lags on material index pricing mechanisms.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Cash used for operating activities was $21.7 million for the quarter, compared to $3.4 million for the same period of last year.
Due to the typical seasonality in our business, free cash flow was negative in the first quarter of this year.
In addition, the value of our inventory increased further due to inflationary pressures, which had a negative impact on working capital.
As a reminder, we usually generate most of our cash in the second half of each year.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong.
Our liquidity position is solid, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was at 0.4 times as of January 31st, 2022.
We will remain focused on generating cash, paying down debt, and opportunistically repurchasing stock as the year progresses.
However, based on improvements in labor performance, the expected continuation of our pass-through pricing strategy, conversations with our customers, and the latest macro data, we're now comfortable providing the following guidance for fiscal 2022.
Net sales of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $135 million to $140 million; depreciation of approximately $31 million, amortization of approximately $15 million; SG&A of $115 million to $120 million, interest expense of $2 million to $2.5 million, tax rate of 28%, capex of $30 million to $35 million; and free cash flow of $55 million to $60 million.
While we do expect some level of volume growth in our Fenestration segments for the remainder of the year, note that our current expectation is that revenue growth for the remainder of the year should be driven more by price, as opposed to volume, and we expect margin expansion to be second-half weighted.
From a cadence perspective for Q2, we expect net sales to be up mid to high single digits year-over-year in each segment.
However, due to inflation and the time lag associated with passing on price increases for most of our raw materials, we believe it will be a challenge to realize margin expansion in any segment in Q2.
Looking ahead into the second half of the year, on a consolidated basis, we currently expect mid-single-digit net sales growth year over year in Q3 and Q4.
In addition, due to easier comps and the expected benefit from our pri...
...y inefficiencies caused by the COVID-related absenteeism early in the quarter.
As such, adjusted EBITDA came in at $10.4 million for the quarter, which was $300,000 less than prior year and yielded margin compression of approximately 420 basis points.
Similar to our expectations for other segments, we do anticipate that margins will improve, as the year progresses, again, assuming that the rate of inflation subsides.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $62.4 million in Q1, which was $8.4 million or 15.5% higher than prior year.
Volumes decreased in this segment year over year, mainly as a result of customers' decisions to reduce overtime hours worked in their plants.
Increases in hardwood index pricing as well as discretionary pricing actions offset the volume and resulted in revenue growth year over year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2 million for the quarter, which was $1.2 million less than prior year and resulted in margin compression of approximately 280 basis points.
Improvements in lumber yield and labor efficiency were more than offset by a significant increase in hardwood lumber costs during the quarter.
Weather-related challenges in the Appalachian wood region, as well as increases in maple demand, were the main drivers of the increases in lumber costs.
As a reminder, we have material index pricing mechanisms in place, but they typically have a 90-day lag, and we will require a period of flat or declining wood pricing before we're able to catch up on our margin performance in this segment.
As we look forward through the remainder of the year, we feel good about the demand environment across all of our product lines.
In North America, the housing market remains strong, and our customers continue to have high levels of backlog, which we anticipate will slowly dwindle throughout the year.
The rate of inflation and the potential for further interest rate hikes could impact demand at some point in the future, but we do not expect this to occur in the near term due to the high backlog levels.
In Continental Europe and the U.K., the demand environment remains healthy, although consumer confidence could ultimately be impacted if inflation continues to ramp and energy costs continue to increase.
From a Quanex perspective, we have seen enough improvements in our supply chain and stabilization in our labor force to say that the main challenge we now face is the rate of inflation and the ability to pass through price in an expedited manner.
As Scott mentioned earlier, we have enough data points and adequate visibility into our customers' backlog to give us confidence in providing full year guidance.
Again, we expect to generate revenue of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $135 million to $140 million.
If we execute to plan and are able to post results within these ranges, it will mark the third straight year of record performance for the Quanex team.
Moving on to a more recent tragic subject, which is the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
It is difficult to see these events unfold in real time and watch what you believe to be unfathomable turn into reality.
We have employees and business partners with personal ties to Ukraine and our hearts are with them, their families, and all the Ukrainian people being affected by this pointless and horrific war.
At this point, it is too early for anyone to accurately predict or estimate the impact that this war will have on the European or global economies or what supply chain disruptions or other impacts this may have on our industry.
We anticipate there will be challenges, especially if the situation worsens substantially.
However, at this point, it is much too early to predict or forecast those impacts.
Nonetheless, our team has managed through COVID and numerous global supply chain challenges over the past two years, and we are very confident in our ability to navigate this event as well.
And with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I am joined today by Summit Hotel Properties President and Chief Executive Officer, Jon Stanner; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Trey Conkling.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with the continued acceleration of our improving operating trends in the third quarter, which exceeded our initial expectations and resulted in more than a 25% increase in RevPAR from the second quarter.
Occupancy average daily rate and overall profitability all reached new highs since the onset of the pandemic, and we more than tripled our positive corporate cash flow compared to last quarter.
Demand growth accelerated broadly during the quarter as we sold nearly 7% more room nights in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter, peaking during a historically strong summer travel season in July when occupancy in the portfolio was above 72%.
Although August demand pulled back modestly as expected, we saw a reacceleration in the back half of September when occupancy averaged nearly 70% during the last two weeks of the quarter.
While leisure demand continues to be the primary driver of our operating results, we remain encouraged by improving corporate transient demand trends.
Negotiated room revenue increased approximately 28% in the third quarter over the second quarter.
And while that is admittedly off of a very small base, we're also encouraged by some of the anecdotal signs suggesting a more robust return of corporate travel is forthcoming.
We reported third quarter pro forma RevPAR of $98, which was more than double our RevPAR in the third quarter of last year and was 24% lower than what was achieved in the third quarter of 2019, a significant improvement from the first half of the year when RevPAR was nearly 43% lower in the second quarter and 59% lower in the first quarter than the comparable 2019 periods.
Importantly, the recovery of average rates accelerated meaningfully during the quarter.
As ADR across our portfolio increased 19% compared to the second quarter, and weekday ADR growth outpaced weekend growth by nearly 200 basis points.
Average rates in our urban portfolio increased 24% from the second quarter, and weekday urban ADR grew 27% from the second quarter, which encouragingly reflects some level of rate accretive remixing of our business with corporate travel.
Weekend occupancy was an impressive 80% during the third quarter and averaged 82% in July and September as the recovery continues to clearly be led by exceptionally strong leisure demand.
However, mid-week occupancy also continues to steadily improve, climbing to 64% during the first quarter, a full five percentage points higher than the second quarter and the gap between weekday and weekend occupancy continues to narrow.
Trey will provide some additional color on our operating results later in the call.
During the third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the newly built 110 guestroom residence in Steamboat Springs for $33 million.
The extended-stay hotel is the newest hotel in Steamboat, one of only six other hotels that have opened in the market since the year 2000, and the first Marriott-branded extended stay product in the market.
Since acquisition, the hotel has performed exceptionally well, generating occupancy and RevPAR of nearly 87% and $161, respectively, and hotel EBITDA margin of 49% for the third quarter.
On an annualized basis, this equates to a 9% net operating income yield and less than three months of ownership, despite the hotel having been open for less than one year.
During the third quarter, we invested approximately $4.2 million in our portfolio on items primarily related to planned maintenance capital.
As we previously mentioned, given our conviction around the long-term improvement in demand trends, we plan to commence several renovations in the fourth quarter of this year and early next year to minimize disruption from these projects.
We expect to spend between $15 million and $20 million in cap...
...five and seven, eight Series A perpetual preferred paper.
Proceeds from this opportunistic offering were used to accretively refinance our $75 million, 6.45% Series B preferred stock and to reduce the outstanding balance on our November 2022 term loan to its current balance of $62 million.
This sub term loan remains the company's only 2022 maturity, and we continue to maintain ample liquidity to repay all maturing debt through 2024 when considering available extension options.
We're thrilled to announce the acquisition of a 27 hotel portfolio from NewcrestImage, which is comprised of approximately 3,700 guest rooms located across 10 high-growth Sunbelt markets in Texas, Oklahoma City and New Orleans.
These hotels are highly complementary to our existing portfolio with premium brand affiliations, excellent locations in strong markets and comprise a relatively new portfolio with approximately 70% of the guest rooms opening since 2015 and more than 1/3 of the guestrooms built in the last three years.
The hotel portfolio's allocated value of $776.5 million equates to approximately $209,000 per key, which reflects a significant discount to replacement costs and results in a stabilized NOI yield of 8% to 8.5%, including underwritten capital expenditures.
Our increased exposure to Sunbelt markets, which will be approximately 60% of our pro forma room count, positions the combined hotel portfolio to benefit from the favorable migration patterns, labor dynamics, corporate relocation activity, return to office trends and general pro business climates in these markets.
In addition to the hotel portfolio, we will be acquiring two parking structures, totaling approximately 1,000 parking spaces that serve two triplex hotel clusters, one in Downtown Dallas and the other in the emerging mixed-use development of Frisco Station, a thriving North Dallas suburb.
The transaction also includes an allocation to several financial incentives that will be assumed upon closing of the transaction.
Our joint venture with GIC will acquire the assets for a total consideration of $822 million, and we will finance the investment with a new $410 million credit facility.
We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to our earnings and leverage-neutral to our balance sheet.
GIC's 49% equity interest will be a cash contribution totaling approximately $208 million, and our 51% controlling interest will come from a combination of common and preferred op units.
We will issue 15.9 million shares of common op units valued at $160 million.
Based on our common stock's 10-day [Indecipherable] as of Tuesday's closing price equal to $10.09 per share.
NewcrestImage ownership will be approximately 13% of our total shares outstanding.
The preferred op units totaling $50 million will be issued at a standard $25 par value and pay an annual coupon equal to 5.25%.
As part of the transaction, NewcrestImage will have the right to appoint one representative to the company's Board of Directors.
The transaction would increase our combined room count by over 30% and our total enterprise value by approximately 20%.
Acting as a general partner, on behalf of the joint venture, we will continue to earn fees for our asset management services and expect our stabilized fee stream earned through the joint venture will cover approximately 17% of our in-place cash corporate G&A.
The utilization of common and preferred op units for our 51% equity interest will preserve nearly all of our liquidity of $450 million, leaving us ample runway to pursue additional growth opportunities.
While closing remains subject to customary closing conditions and a formal due diligence period, we anticipate closing to occur later this quarter or early in the first quarter of 2022.
We are incredibly excited about the future of our business and believe this transaction, combined with the continued recovery of lodging fundamentals, positions us particularly well to create long-term value for our shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I ll begin with consolidated revenues on slide nine.
Record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion, grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Record asset management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with a sequential increase of fee-based assets in the preceding quarter.
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 9% during the fiscal third quarter, providing a tailwind for this line item for the fourth quarter.
Consolidated brokerage revenue is $552 million, grew 14% over the prior year, but declined 7% from the record set and the preceding quarter.
Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the record set in the preceding quarter.
Brokerage revenues and PCG were up 22% on a year-over-year basis, but down 6% sequentially due to lower trading volumes, as well as the large placement fee in the preceding quarter.
Account and service fees of $161 million increased 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund balances.
Record consolidated investment banking revenues of $276 million, grew 99% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by record M&A revenues, and strong debt and equity underwriting results.
Our investment banking pipelines remain strong.
So we would be pleased if fourth quarter revenues came in around the average of the quarterly revenues generated over the first three quarters of the fiscal year, that would have been about $260 million on average.
But of course, this line item is inherently difficult to predict.
Other revenues of $55 million were up 25% sequentially, primarily due to $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to non-controlling interest, which are reflected in the other expenses.
Moving to slide 10.
Clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $62.9 billion, essentially flat compared to the preceding quarter and representing 6.1% of domestic PCG client assets.
As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $8.6 billion of the client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer.
Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On slide 11, the top chart displays our firmwide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis, as these two items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates.
The combined net interest income and BDPs from third-party banks of $183 million were up slightly compared to the preceding quarter, as modest NIM compression was offset by growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances in Raymond James Bank.
However, it s still down significantly from the peak of $329 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, really highlighting the remarkable results we have been able to generate despite near zero short-term interest rates.
In the lower left portion of the slide, we show net interest margin or NIM for both RJ Bank and the firm overall.
We continue to expect the bank s NIM to decline to just around or just below 1.9% over the next quarter or two.
The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks declined 1 basis point to 29 basis points in the quarter.
We believe this average yield will remain around this level for the rest of the fiscal year, but there will likely be downward pressure in this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year if banks demand for deposits, don t improve from current levels.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 12.
First, our largest expense compensation; the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 69.5% to 67.2% largely due to record revenues in the capital markets segment, which had a 57% comp ratio during the quarter.
And the benefit ...
...ird quarter, we repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million.
As of July 28, $632 million remains available under the current share repurchase authorization.
But as Paul Reilly will discuss our priority continues to be deploying capital to grow our businesses.
Lastly, on slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank.
The credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve.
Non-performing assets remained low at just 12 basis points of total assets and criticized loans declined sequentially.
The bank loan loss benefit of $19 million reflects an improved outlook for economic conditions and higher credit ratings on average within the corporate loan portfolio.
Due to reserve releases and loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans declined from 1.5% to 1.34% of the quarter end.
For the corporate portfolio, these allowances are higher at around 2.4%.
We believe, we re adequately reserved, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate.
So overall I m very pleased with our strong results for this quarter, which top many records, and did so in spite of the persistent challenges of the global health pandemic and near zero short-term rates.
As for the outlook, we remain well positioned entering the fourth fiscal quarter with records of many of our key business metrics, strong pipelines for financial advisor recruiting and investment banking.
In the Private Client Group results will benefit by starting the fourth quarter with 9% increase of assets and fee-based accounts.
With the strong recruiting pipeline, we are on track for record fiscal year recruiting as prospective advisors across all of the affiliation options have continued to be attracted to our platform, including the leading technology solution, our advisor and client centric culture.
These recruiting results are primarily strong given the very competitive market for experienced advisors.
In Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains strong and we expect solid fixed income brokerage results, driven by demand from depository client segment.
However, keep in mind, these there is still an economic uncertainty due to the ongoing pandemic that could impact these results.
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results to be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management.
Active asset managers continue to face structural headwinds.
However, we are pleased to see positive net flows on a fiscal year to date basis for Carillon Tower Associates.
We hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of our high quality asset active managers.
And Raymond James bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet.
We ll continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through securities-based loans and mortgages.
And we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency backed securities portfolio.
As we look further ahead, we remain focused on the long-term growth.
And as we ve outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives, include driving organic growth across all of our core businesses, continue to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A.
Today s announcement of our firm s intention to make an offer for Charles Stanley Group demonstrates our focus on these initiatives in our commitment to deploy excess capital over time.
We believe this acquisition stays true to our long-standing criteria for acquisitions.
So first, being a good cultural fit, a good strategic fit, it makes financial sense for shareholders and something we can integrate.
They ve been amazing at being able to provide excellent service to their clients, to these difficult times.
I m very proud to be a part of this special Raymond James family.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate your continued interest in our company.
We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance.
Our 2021 financial outlook and recent development on our effort to transform kidney care.
First, let me start the conversation with the clinical highlights.
Kidney transplant is the best treatment option for eligible patients with kidney failure.
DaVita has worked hard over the years to help our patients gain access to transplant through education and direct support for patients to get on and stay on the transplantation waitlist.
The cumulative impact is meaningful.
Last December, we announced a milestone of 100,000 DaVita patients who have received transplant since the year 2000.
Further advance the cause of transplantation are collaborating on a yearlong pilot aim at improving health equity in kidney transplantation with a focus on living donors.
Increasing living donor transplant expands access to transplantation by increasing the availability of organ, which has been the limiting factor in the number of transplants performed annually.
This pilot provides high touch and customized information to patients and families seeking a kidney transplantation from a living donor.
We look forward to learning more from this pilot, improving the health equity of kidney transplant and continuing to be the leader in supporting our patients to receive kidney transplant.
Shifting to the latest update on COVID, we have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID 19 pandemic over the past several months.
New COVID infections among our patients continue to drop significantly through the last week of June down more than 90% from the peak in early January.
However, similar to the rest of the country, we have started to see an uptick over the last few weeks.
As of last week on a rolling seven day average basis new infection, they're still down more than 90% from the peak.
Thus far, mortality continues to remain low on an absolute basis as we believe that are vaccinated patient are more protected from severe cases of COVID.
We continue to educate our patients about the benefits of vaccine to reduce vaccine hesitancy and we remain confident in our policies and procedures designed to keep our patients and our teammates safe while they're in our care.
Now let me turn to our financial performance in the second quarter, we delivered strong results in both operating income and earnings per share, our margin expanded as we continue to manage cost while delivering quality care.
As a result, we delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income and 35% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share.
Our free cash flow was particularly strong this quarter, we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our stock buyback.
With the first half of the year behind us.
We are now increasing the midpoint of guidance for the full year.
Let me transition to update our progress in our integrated Kidney Care efforts, otherwise known as by IKC.
Value-based care for our patients with kidney disease is gaining momentum and appears to have reached an inflection point.
We have always believed the core name dialysis care with the broader healthcare needs of KB and SKG patients with simultaneously improve outcomes and reduce total healthcare costs.
For years, we've been participating in a variety of small programs and pilots to build our integrated care capability and better understand the economics we believe we are at that point now where we are ready to shift to the next stage of the evolution of integrated care.
You might be wondering why now, the trend toward value-based care is not new either in kidney care or other segments of healthcare so what's changed to make the development of scale business viable today.
There's a couple of reasons.
First with the growth of Medicare Advantage payers are looking for innovative ways to manage the increasing number of ESKs patients choosing MA plans these patients ...
... that the worst is behind us.
But we're closely monitoring the potential impact of the delta Varian especially within pockets of the country that have lower vaccination rates.
Longer term, we continue to believe that we will return to pre-pandemic treatment growth levels with an additional tailwind from lower than normal mortality rate.
Our US dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $6 this quarter, primarily due to normal seasonal improvements from patients meeting their co-insurance and deductible obligations.
We also saw favorable changes in government rate and mix including the continued growth in the percentage of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage.
Patient care costs and G&A expense per treatment in total were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.
Our patient care costs decreased sequentially primarily due to reductions in labor costs.
Our G&A increased slightly, primarily due to charitable contributions and increases in personnel costs.
As expected, our US dialysis and lab DSO decreased by approximately six days in Q2 versus Q1.
Primarily due to collections on the temporary billing holds related to the winter storms in the first quarter.
The majority of the impact of the storms on DSO and cash flow, we reversed in Q2.
But we may see an ongoing smaller benefit through the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we generated a gain of approximately $9 million on one of our DaVita Venture Group investments which hit the other income line on our P&L.
We have a small investment in medical that recently went public.
The value of this investment at quarter end was $23 million going forward market-to-market every quarter.
Now turning to some updates on the rest of this year and some initial thoughts on 2022.
As Javier mentioned, we are raising our guidance ranges for 2021 as follows.
Adjusted earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.40.
Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.875 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Also we now expect our 2021 effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita to be between 24% and 26% lower than the 26% to 28% range that we had communicated at the beginning of the year.
These new guidance ranges exclude the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge later this year.
I'll call out two notable potential headwind during the second half of the year.
First is COVID we continue to expect the impact of excess mortality will be higher in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year due to the compounding impact of mortality through 2021.
We're also expecting an uptick on costs related to testing, vaccinations and teammate support as a result of the delta variant.
As a result, we are increasing the middle of the range of COVID impact for the full year to $170 million from $150 million.
That implies a $30 million headwind from COVID in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.
As a reminder, this is the middle of what is a wide range of possible impacts depending on the impact of the delta or other variance and any additional COVID mandate.
Second, we expect to experience losses in our US ancillary segment of approximately $70 million in the second half of the year compared to $50 million in the first half of the year.
This incremental loss is due primarily to new value based care arrangements and start-up costs associated with the CKCC program that launches in 2022.
Looking forward to 2022 we do not expect anything unusual among the primary drivers of the business, including RPT, cost per treatment or capital expenditures.
However we expect pressure on OI growth from the increased spend on growing our IKC business, the possibility of union activity in 2022 that we did not face in 2021 and the first year of depreciation expense associated with our new clinical IT platform that we have been developing for the past several years.
We will provide more specific 2022 guidance on a future earnings call.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These are important to review and contemplate.
As everyone on the call today is well aware, business environment uncertainty remains heightened due to COVID-19 and continues to have numerous potential impacts.
This means the results could change at any time, and the forecasted impact of risk considerations is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date.
Additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available in our most recent SEC filings and most recent company 10-K.
I'll now hand it over to our CEO, Ron Lombardi.
Let's begin on slide five.
We are very pleased with our record start to the year.
Our proven business strategy emphasizing brand building paid off meaningfully in Q1, and the strong results we'll discuss in detail are a key factor enabling us to raise our fiscal year guidance.
The fast start to our fiscal '22 was driven by two primary factors.
First, and most importantly, our base business continues to perform well with strong 5% growth across the base portfolio.
This result was driven by solid consumption and share gains across the portfolio, a continuation of the trends we have seen for a while now.
Second, we experienced a dramatic increase in sales for brands benefiting from travel-related activity as consumers shifted habits with increased vaccination rates.
We estimate this accounted for approximately $25 million of the Q1 sales increase over the prior year.
I'll discuss the change in consumer habits in greater detail on the next slide.
Our time-tested brand-building strategy and the reacceleration of certain categories and channels resulted in our highest level of sales ever when excluding our divested Household Cleaning business.
Meanwhile, our financial profile has remained solid throughout the change in consumer purchasing patterns, and we generated record earnings per share of $1.14 and free cash flow of approximately $68 million in Q1.
Our stable and strong cash flow profile continues to enable a disciplined capital allocation strategy.
Throughout fiscal '21, this meant focusing on debt reduction combined with share repurchases.
In Q1, we announced the acquisition of Akorn Consumer Health and its TheraTears brand, which closed on July 1.
We believe this acquisition is a great strategic use of capital, which we'll share more detail on shortly.
So in summary, we delivered excellent Q1 results underpinned by our long-term strategy and further fueled by a rebound in certain COVID-impacted categories and channels.
Let's turn to page six and review some of the changing consumer habits resulting from the pandemic.
Throughout all of fiscal '21, we noted dramatic ways in which consumer habits changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting effects on our portfolio.
We observed less consumer travel and more focus on hygiene as consumers stayed home and wear masks.
This meant a significant headwind for many of our brands, including Dramamine in motion sickness, Chloraseptic and Luden's in cough/cold, Hydralyte in rehydration and Nix in head lice.
Combined, these brands represent about 20% of our revenues.
Back in May, when we provided fiscal '22 guidance, we anticipated this portion of our portfolio would be largely flat as we expected consumers would take time to move away from the habits formed over the previous year.
While this is still the case in certain categories, this assumption proved conservative in others.
To start, we saw a dramatic rebound in travel-related activity.
This drove a meaningful recovery in Dramamine along with a recovery in our Australian Hydralyte business.
The recovery in travel activity also drove increases in convenience store consumption and the distributor inventory in this channel to support the increased takeaway at shelf.
This benefited brands like Dramamine as well as Clear Eyes with it's Pocket Pal on-the-go offering.
In addition, drug retailer traffic also increased owing to vaccination visits, leading to...
...iscal '22 revenues increased 17% versus the prior year.
Our strong and diverse portfolio experienced approximately 5% baseline growth driven by the favorable year ago comparison and our long-term brand-building efforts.
In addition, we experienced a sharp rebound in certain COVID-impacted categories, adding an estimated $25 million to our Q1 revenue performance.
Of this, we believe roughly half of this relates to timing while the other half resulted from increased consumption in the current quarter.
We also continued to experience year-over-year double-digit consumption growth in the e-commerce channel, further building off the sharply higher online purchasing shift of the prior year.
Total company gross margin of 59.1% in the first quarter increased 70 basis points versus last year's gross margin of 58.4%.
This strength was driven by higher-than-expected sales performance as well as product mix.
We continue to anticipate a gross margin of about 58% for fiscal '22.
Advertising and marketing came in at 14.7% for the first fiscal quarter.
Following the abnormally low rate of spend in Q1 of last year due to COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions, A&M returned to normalized levels of spend of approximately 14% to 16%.
For fiscal '22, we still anticipate an approximate 15% A&M rate as a percentage of sales.
And for Q2, we anticipate A&M of closer to 14%.
G&A expenses were just over 8% of sales in Q1.
For the full year fiscal '22, we still anticipate G&A expenses to approximate just over 9% of sales.
G&A dollars are likely to be the highest for the year in Q2, owing to the timing of certain expenses.
Lastly, record diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 32.5% over the prior year.
Higher sales and lower interest expense drove this growth.
Looking forward, we now anticipate interest for the full year to approximate $63 million, reflecting the recent financing completed in conjunction with the TheraTears acquisition.
In Q1, we generated $67.8 million in free cash flow, down versus the prior year due entirely to the timing of working capital.
We continue to maintain industry-leading free cash flow and are raising our outlook for the year.
At June 30, our net debt was approximately $1.4 billion, inclusive of the cash we built ahead of the anticipated acquisition closing on July 1.
Following the acquisition of Akorn, our net debt at July one was approximately $1.6 billion.
The acquisition was funded from cash on hand, our ABL revolver and our term loan, which we simultaneously amended and now matures in calendar 2028.
Our covenant-defined leverage ratio was 4.3 times at the closing of the transaction, and we anticipate leverage of approximately four times by year-end fiscal '22.
Over the last year, we faced an unprecedented and dynamic environment.
The many positive attributes of our business and our execution leave us well positioned moving forward.
This is evidenced by our strong Q1 results, where our long-term brand-building efforts paid off in a big way.
For the full year fiscal '22, we now anticipate revenues of $1.045 billion or more, which includes an organic revenue growth expectation of about 6% and the revenue from the acquisition of the Akorn Consumer Health.
For the second quarter, we anticipate revenues of $260 million or more.
This revenue outlook assumes a few key factors: one, that the travel-impacted portion of our business will continue at the recovered levels for the remainder of the year; two, we still anticipate flat sales to prior year in the cough and cold and head lice areas of our business; and three, the acquisition of the Akorn portfolio discussed today should contribute approximately $40 million to the fiscal year net sales.
We anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $3.90 or more for fiscal '22.
For Q2, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.95 or more.
These attributes translate into strong free cash flow as well, where we anticipate adjusted free cash flow of $245 million or more for the year.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 During our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.
And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.
With the rollout of vaccines in full swing and restrictions lifting across the country, our guests' pent-up demand for a dine-in experience is being released as well.
People are finally starting to feel safer to venture out and spend more -- spend some of the money they've been saving over the past year.
We're excited about the positive momentum in our economy and the resurgence in our dining rooms.
When we last talked at the end of January, we were already seeing progress in the business, even as we were navigating a COVID spike that drove another wave of capacity restrictions in our dining rooms.
Just as we started to see numbers of cases come back down, we were hit with the winter storm of the century that impacted our restaurants across Texas and the southeast at levels we haven't experienced before.
But despite the challenges at the start of the third quarter, we ended strong, delivering an adjusted earnings per share of $0.78 with Chili's sales returning to positive territory from an absolute perspective.
And we've seen those sales trends continue into April.
When we look at our more normalized performance of fiscal '19, Chili's sales are up 10%, and nearly three-quarters of our restaurants are generating meaningful positive results, even though we're still social distancing and wearing masks in all of our restaurants and we're still operating under capacity restraints across the country.
We believe, all along, the consumers' increased demand for convenience would continue post-pandemic, and it's playing out that way.
As our dining room traffic increases, our off-premise business continues to hold strong.
We expect that when things normalize, we'll see stronger dining rooms and a takeout and delivery business stronger than it was pre-pandemic.
As you think about Maggiano's in the context of this recovery, upscale casual is playing itself out a little differently.
We're pleased with the significant improvements in the Maggiano's business, especially in their dining rooms.
Now, it's just a matter of how quickly banquets come back.
We know there's significant pent-up demand and we're well-positioned to meet it.
We're already seeing signs of social occasions returning, and we feel good about building our corporate business back in time for the important holiday season.
Staying focused on our strategy throughout the extraordinary events of the past year has served us well as we consistently outperformed the industry.
We have good line of sight to hit the targets we were expecting post-pandemic at both Chili's and Maggiano's.
Navigating the past year taught us we can run this business even more efficiently than in the past, and we're committed to keeping our cost structure in line.
We think our category leadership -- driven by the multiyear investments in our infrastructure and digital capabilities will help us continue to outpace the industry.
We still have a lot of heart for our restructured marketing approach, and we'll continue to leverage our digital expertise to connect with consumers and drive traffic.
The subject of labor is clearly top of mind across our industry.
Today's labor market is one of the toughest ones we've experienced, but we have the tools to navigate through it successfully.
While our performance throughout the pandemic enabled us to keep higher levels of staffing in our restaurants, we are hiring more team members than usual to support our increased volumes.
We're also benefiting from our decision to keep our managers on board throughout the pandemic as they provide the operational leadership to staff our teams and take care of our guests.
We're fortunate to be able to leverage our scale, the digital ...
...s we featured steak on three for $10 in the prior year.
Pricing was slightly favorable, and commodities were flat.
Labor expense, again as a percent of company sales, was favorable 70 basis points as compared to the prior year.
During the quarter, lower dining room capacity year over year resulted in a reduced hourly labor cost.
We do anticipate hourly labor to increase, importantly along with sales volumes as capacity restrictions lift in certain states.
During the quarter, we meaningfully increased our manager bonus payout, impacting margins by approximately 60 basis points as we move to reward this critical leadership level for outstanding performance.
By leveraging our scale, our well-established people, practices, and benefits and utilizing our digital connectivity know-how, we are confident in our ability to effectively manage through the current labor market environment.
Restaurant expense was unfavorable year over year by 30 basis points, a reflection of increased off-premise costs such as packaging and fees, driven by our successful off-premise sales channels.
Advertising expense continues in a favorable year-over-year position as we lean into our digital and loyalty-driven marketing strategy.
Brinker continues to deliver strong operating cash flow.
Year to date, we have generated $268 million in operating cash flow.
During the third quarter, we used a portion of that cash flow to repay $115 million in revolver borrowings, bringing the outstanding balance to under $300 million.
We anticipate further borrowing reduction in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, we are investing significantly into the growth of our brands.
Capital expenditures year-to-date totaled approximately $62 million.
We opened two new Chili's during the third quarter and two additional locations in April, bringing our total for this fiscal year to 10.
We are moving aggressively to further build our development resources and increase the NRO pipeline.
We continue to target expanding new restaurant development to a range of 18 to 22 restaurants a year.
We also are investing in reimages of our existing fleet, with a particular focus on the Midwest restaurants acquired in early fiscal '20.
Brinker has continually proven to be a leader in utilizing technology to enhance the guest experience and improve operational performance.
In fiscal 2021, we will invest approximately $20 million of capital and technology that enhances our digital guest connectivity, supports our virtual brand growth, and improves our in-restaurant dining experience.
Now, turning to our expectations for the final quarter of this fiscal year.
We expect both Chili's and Maggiano's to maintain their current favorable sales trends throughout the quarter, assuming COVID cases continue to decline and state and local restrictions continue to ease.
Let me provide some additional specifics for the fourth quarter.
Total revenue is estimated to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share are estimated in the $1.55 to $1.70 range.
Weighted average diluted shares are estimated to be in the 47 million to 48 million share range.
Also, as we have previously noted, fiscal 2021 includes a 53rd week at the end of this fourth quarter.
As we settle into the last quarter of the fiscal year, we are excited about the momentum we have built from the uncertainty that surrounded the restaurant industry a year ago.
During the past year, the members of our support teams here in Dallas stepped up and provided innovative solutions to any number of issues since the pandemic changed how we all approach our work.
And our frontline team members in the restaurants have continually delivered for our guests in ways none of us would have contemplated not too long ago.
We are grateful to both these groups of team members who combined to lead the casual dining sector throughout this past year.
They are all committed to finishing strong this fiscal year and then carrying the success forward.

 Before we begin, I'll cover two items.
Actual events or results could differ materially.
Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results news release.
Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial result -- financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results news release, which can be found on our website.
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full-year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19.
I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020.
And here are some of the highlights.
Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity.
We shifted our financial forecast for prioritizing cash and liquidity given the uncertainties and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities.
Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end-markets, which gives us this ability.
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy, we've accelerated progress and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020.
In addition, in our 2020 Sustainability Report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by one-third by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January.
That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19.
This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control.
In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash.
As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took.
If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about a $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share.
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced costs by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary.
We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs.
As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020.
On top-line growth, we expect growth from three levers.
First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020, as we have seen in Q4 and in January.
Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products.
There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020 and we expect it to continue in '21.
Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products.
Significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix.
As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth.
We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21.
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties.
In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising, and have competitive pressures in a few products.
When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted earnings per share will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020.
This means our expected '21 earnings per share will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio.
We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted earnings per share similar to the first quarter of '20.
You recall in the first quarter of 2020, our earnings per share was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time.
Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
A moment ago I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy, and as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing along with Tennessee Governor, Bill Lee, our plan to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport.
Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products.
Over the next two years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders.
Using the company's polyester renewal technology, this new facility will use 110 kmt [Phonetic] of plastic waste to produce premium high-quality specialty plastics made with recycled content.
This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%.
This is incredibly exciting news and we're only just beginning.
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman to make all this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future.
I share their optimism.
This is an exciting time for Eastman.
Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, I'd like to review the safe harbor statement.
During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
Additionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call.
We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information.
I will now turn the conference over to our president and chief executive officer, Matthew Lambiase.
I'll make some brief comments, then Mohit will discuss the changes in the portfolio and Rob will then review our financial results.
I believe the first six months of 2020 will go down in the financial history books as one of the most volatile periods in modern times.
The U.S. economy went from excellent to dismal in the span of just a few months and the financial markets, especially fixed income, experienced record volatility and record intervention from the government.
In our space, many levered investors were caught off guard by the swiftly falling asset price, and they were forced to sell at the low point of the market.
Fortunately, Chimera was able to navigate through this difficult period by executing transactions which enabled us to retain our high-yielding and unique mortgage credit portfolio.
It's important to understand that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to recreate our portfolio in the current low interest rate environment and its retention affords Chimera the ability to pay a meaningful dividend, which we would not have if the assets had been sold.
In the quarter, we took several actions that helped us augment our liquidity.
We issued a $374 million three-year convertible bond, we entered into a $400 million three-year revolving loan facility arranged by Ares Capital and we executed three new mortgage securitizations, totaling over $1 billion, which significantly reduced our loan warehouse exposure and helped reopen the mortgage securitization market, which is a primary source for Chimera's long-term financing.
Additionally, during the period, we negotiated longer-term and non-mark-to -- longer-term and non-mark-to-market repo finance facilities for our mortgage loans and credit-related assets.
We now have approximately 75% of our credit borrowings on longer-term facilities and over 50% of them have no mark-to-market or limited mark-to-market arrangements.
While these actions have had the short-term effect of increasing financing costs, we believe the benefits over the long-term are significant.
We've strengthened our balance sheet, enabling us to further withstand additional market volatility, continue to produce attractive spread income and to make new investments when we see attractive asset opportunities.
This position is enviable, given the uncertain economic conditions and the low return environment that we're currently operating within.
The Federal Reserve has stated that they expect to keep the Fed funds rate zero bound for the next two years and that they will continue to buy large quantities of assets to support the financial markets and the U.S. economy.
We are present -- presently witnessing the effects of these actions.
The 10-year treasury yield is now roughly 55 basis points and a rate on a new 30-year mortgage dipped below 3% for the first time in history.
Current market expectations are that we'll be in this low rate environment for several years to come, and that the returns on all financial assets will be also low into the future.
While the Federal Reserve's asset purchases have not been directly focused on residential mortgage credit, their purchases have started solidifying the markets and senior mortgage bonds have witnessed significant price appreciation.
We would expect that over time, deeper credit subordinate residential bonds could see similar moves.
Chimera's portfolio of higher-yielding legacy assets should become ever more valuable as the Fed continues to buy assets and returns in the market becom...
...oving loans from warehouse to securitization is an important aspect of our portfolio strategy as it reduces the mark-to-market risk and improves risk metrics for the company.
After the completion of this quarter's securitization, our residential mortgage loan warehouse stands at $263 million and is financed for one year without mark-to-market risk.
CIM 2020-R3 issued in May had $438 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 5.28% and a weighted average loan age of 150 months.
The average loan size in the R3 securitization was $127,000 and the average FICO was 651 with an average LTV of 80%.
We sold $329 million senior securities with a 4.2% cost of debt.
Chimera retained a May 2022 calendar call option for the R3 securitization.
CIM 2020-R4 had $276 million underlying loans, with a weighted average coupon of 4.78% with a weighted average loan age of 168 months.
The average loan size in the R4 was $127,000.
The average FICO was 598 with an average LTV of 75%.
We sold $207 million senior securities with a 3.2% cost of debt.
Chimera retained a June 2022 calendar call option on the R4 securitization.
In early July, Chimera completed a second rate of securitization of the year.
We issued CIM 2020-R5 with $338 million underlying loans with an average coupon of 4.98%.
The R5 securitization had a weighted average loan age of 149 months and an average loan size of $152,000.
The loans had a weighted average FICO of 678 with an average LTV of 70%.
We sold $257 million of investment-grade securities with a 2.05% cost of debt, more than 200 basis points tighter than our early May deal.
And in late July, we issued $362 million CIM 2020-J1, our first jumbo securitization of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with the current investment portfolio and its long-term prospects.
We were able to navigate through this difficult period by executing transactions, which enables us to retain our high-yielding and unique mortgage credit portfolio.
Strong credit performance, strength of institutional buying, and the tightening of new issue credit spreads were all positive components of Chimera's long-term securitization strategy.
We have 13 existing CIM securitization totaling $7.5 billion available for call and refinancing over the next 12 months.
This provides an additional avenue for portfolio performance and complements potential new investment opportunities.
We are continually monitoring our outstanding securitization for the best timing and the opportunity to execute our call optimization strategy and maximize long-term portfolio performance for our shareholders.
Our Agency CMBS continue to provide attractive spread income and liquidity for the portfolio while providing superior call protection relative to residential agency pass-throughs in this low rate environment.
Lastly, the reduction in mark-to-market achieved this quarter leaves us with plenty of dry powder to make new credit investments.
I'll review Chimera's financial highlights for the second quarter.
GAAP book value at the end of the second quarter was $10.63 per share.
Our GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $73 million or $0.37 per share.
On a core basis, net income for the second quarter was $76 million or $0.32 per share.
Our economic net interest income for the second quarter was $121 million.
For the second quarter, our yield on interest-earning assets was 5.7%, our average cost of funds was 3.3%, and our net interest spread was 2.4%.
Total leverage for the second quarter was 4.3:1 while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 1.8:1.
Expenses for the second quarter, excluding servicing fees and transaction expenses were $17 million, down from last quarter, primarily related to lower compensation expenses.
We currently have approximately $850 million in cash and unencumbered assets.
This is after we've paid both our preferred and common dividends in full.
We continue to monitor liquidity closely and look for attractive financing options to support our portfolio.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The company undertakes no obligation to update this information.
Whitestone's third quarter earnings news release and supplemental operating and financial data package have been filed with the SEC and are available on our website www.
whitestonereit.com in the Investor Relations section.
Now over to Jim Mastandrea, our Chairman and CEO, to update you on our third quarter results.
Operating portfolio occupancy increased to 90.2% from 89.9% last quarter and annualized base rent increased to $20.41 from $19.95 last quarter.
Our overall foot traffic at our centers in 3Q '21 was 35% higher than the same quarter in 2020.
With the resurgence of the COVID through its delta variant, we maintained a steady, but slightly lighter pattern versus 2Q '21.
We continue to experience active recurring traffic from existing and new community members visiting our centers as population shifts continue with the ongoing migration from corporations and individuals to Arizona and Texas.
Regarding our financial performance for the quarter, revenue grew by 9% to $32.4 million this quarter compared to $29.9 million in 3Q '20.
Same-store net operating income growth of 7% in this quarter and 8% in Q2 was driven by increases in occupancy and annual base rent per square foot as previously noted, as well as positive leasing spreads.
A key financial indicator for REIT is FFO.
Funds from operations core was $0.25 per share and $0.75 per share in the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 respectively.
Along with this noted growth, we continue to make progress toward one of our long-term goals of deleveraging the trust.
We reduced our debt to EBITDA, which is now 8.1 times down from 9.4 times a year ago.
Equally important to the trust is our dividend, which we consider sacred.
Regarding our quarterly dividend, we now have paid dividends to our shareholders for the 134th consecutive months since our IPO.
Our dividend yield of 4.3% remains at a premium and our payout ratio to FFO core is exceptionally strong at 42%.
This quarter we reactivated our external growth plan with the acquisition of Lakeside Market in Plano, Texas at a purchase price of $53.25 million.
Importantly, this acquisition did not require any additional corporate overhead, which is a key component toward our attaining economies of scale.
Along with this acquisition, we're actively pursuing additional properties in our strong pipeline of assets in Austin, Dallas and Phoenix.
Looking at our current portfolio, we now have 4.6 million of our 5.1 million square feet of space leased.
Our approximately 1,500 tenants' average lease space is 3000 square feet per tenant, complemented by a mix of larger square footage leases by our grocery anchors.
Our strong tenant relationships and rigorous vetting process ensures the quality of our revenue for our portfolio and stability of our cash flow.
I would like to point out that our tenant improvement costs to bring a new smaller tenant into one of our centers is much lower per square foot than the cost of a big box tenant.
By doing so, we spread our risk among a group of tenants in a relatively the same space as a larger tenant, achieve higher rent per square foot, annual escalators of 2% or 3% and some of our tenants pay percentage lease of revenues.
In addition, typically our tenants pay taxes, insurance and common area maintenance.
Our strong leasing activity is one of the key drivers and performance this quarter.
Some important metrics to highlight that our new lease count for 3Q '21 is 38 versus 35 in the prior quarter and 32 in the prior year.
Our leasing spreads for 3Q '21 are 5.4% versus 3.1% in the prior quarter and 2.9% in the prior year, both of which are moving in a positive direction.
In summary, the update I've shared with you today highlights, in particular, our business model continues to perform exceptionally well.
Our leasing strategy focusing on entrepreneurial tenants continues to produce consistent results.
And most notably, we a...
...rowth, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter topline revenue, NOI and FFO growth, robust leasing spreads, strong same-store NOI growth, reduced debt levels and interest cost resulting in improved debt leverage metrics and greater scale of our G&A infrastructure.
Total revenue was $32.4 million for the quarter, up 6% from the second quarter and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.
The revenue growth was driven by a sequential 0.3% increase in same-store occupancy from Q2 and a 1.2% improvement compared to Q3 of 2020.
We are also benefiting from our ABR per square foot, rising 2.3% sequentially and 5.3% from a year ago along with lower and collectability reserves.
Property net operating income was $23.2 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.
Q3 same-store NOI increased 7% from Q3 of 2020.
Net income for the quarter was $0.06 per share, up from $0.02 per share in the prior year quarter.
Funds from operations core was $0.25 per share in the quarter, up 9% from the second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date FFO core per share was $0.75 per share, up 9% from the same period of 2020.
Our leasing activity in the quarter continued to build on our very strong first and second quarters, with 38 new leases, representing 90,000 square feet of newly occupied spaces.
Our new leasing activity for the nine months was 56% higher on a square foot basis than 2020 and 48% higher than 2019.
On a total lease value basis, our new leasing activity for the nine months was 112% higher than 2020 and 191% higher than 2019.
Leasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been a positive 8.5% over the last 12 months and third quarter leasing spreads increased by 5.4% on new leases and 14.1% on renewal leases signed.
Our annualized base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis at the end of the quarter grew 2.3% to $20.41 from $19.95 in the previous quarter and increased 5.3% from a year ago.
Total operating portfolio occupancy stood at 90.2%, up 1.2% from a year ago and up 0.3% from the second quarter.
Including our newest acquisition Lakeside Market, our total occupancy is 89.9%, up 1% from a year ago.
Our collections continued to be very strong in the third quarter, reflecting the overall high collection levels and collections on tenants classified as cash basis.
Our tenant receivables decreased by $1 million, an improvement of 4.4% from year-end 2020.
Our interest expense was 4% lower than a year ago, reflecting our lower net debt.
At quarter end, we had $22 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable.
Included in this amount is $17.8 million of accrued straight-line rents and $1.3 million of agreed upon deferrals.
Our agreed upon deferral balance is down 43% from year-end reflecting tenants honoring their payment plans.
Turning to our balance sheet.
Since early last year, we have implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity.
Our total net debt was $616.6 million, down $20.5 million from a year ago, improving our debt to gross book real estate cost ratio to 51% down from 55% a year ago.
Our debt to EBITDA ratio improved 1.3 turns from a year ago and 0.1 turn from the second quarter to 8.1 times in Q3.
We are pleased with the significant progress we are making toward our long-term debt reduction goal and remain steadfast in our commitment in this area.
As of quarter end, we have $155.5 million of undrawn capacity and $81.8 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.
During the quarter, we sold 3 million common shares under our ATM program, resulting in $28 million in net proceeds to the company at an average sale price of $9.49 per share.
These strong results in 2021 are a testament to the strength of Whitestone's strategic geographic focus and business model.
We are encouraged by the acquisition of Lakeside Market in the quarter and look forward to continued delivery of value to all of Whitestone's stakeholders.
With that now -- we will now take questions.
Operator, please open the lines.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We are conducting the call from different locations again this quarter.
Please bear with us if you experience minor delays or mixed audio quality.
On the call today are Karl Glassman, Chairman and CEO; Mitch Dolloff, President and COO; Jeff Tate, Executive Vice President and CFO; Steve Henderson, EVP and President of the Specialized Products and Furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment; Cassie Branscum, Senior Director of IR; and Tarah Sherwood, Director of IR.
This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.
A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.
As we reported yesterday, we changed the accounting methodology used for valuing our domestic steel-related inventories from LIFO to FIFO.
Recast financial information for prior periods can be found in the Form 8-K we filed yesterday.
Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.
We had a very strong start to 2021.
Yesterday, we reported first quarter sales increased 10% to $1.15 billion.
Organic sales grew 11% from a combination of raw material related price increases, higher volume and currency benefit.
Volume grew 4%, with continued strong demand in residential end markets, growth in automotive and modest recovery in hydraulic cylinders, partially offset by sales declines in Aerospace.
Divestitures net of acquisitions reduced sales 1%.
EBIT was a first quarter record of $128 million.
EBIT increased $49 million in the versus first quarter of 2020, primarily due to volume growth, lower fixed cost and the non-recurrence of 2020's $8 million impairment charge related to a note receivable and a $4 million charge to write off stock associated with a prior year divestiture.
EBIT margin increased 360 basis points to 11.1% and increased 240 basis points versus adjusted first quarter 2020 EBIT margins of 8.7%.
First quarter EBITDA margin was 15.1% compared to 2020's first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.2%.
Earnings per share were a first quarter record of $0.64.
First quarter 2020 earnings per share was $0.33, including a $0.07 per share reduction from the non-recurring items mentioned.
Excluding these charges, first quarter earnings per share increased $0.24 or 60% versus first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $0.40.
These improvements occurred versus a first quarter of 2020 that was heavily impacted in the final two weeks by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compared to first quarter 2019, sales were down slightly, but EBIT, EBIT margin and earnings per share improved significantly.
We also reported yesterday that our Board of Directors increased our second quarter dividend to $0.42 per share, a $0.02 per share or 5% increase versus the first quarter of 2020.
This marks our 50th year of consecutive annual dividend increases and places us among 31 other companies with at least 50 years of consecutive annual dividend increases known as Dividend Kings.
At Friday's closing price of $49.67, the current yield is 3.2%, which is one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.
I also wanted to update you on some recent activities.
In mid-April, we issued our inaugural sustainability report.
We believe that reporting on environmental, social and governance issues is critical for our stakeholders' growing need for information, and we are pleased to begin this vital initiative.
We strive to advance sustainable solutions for our customers to achieve the highest standards of ethical conduct to demonstrate strong environmental stewardship and safety performance to enable a culture of inclusion, diversity and equity, and employee development at all levels of the Company, and to embrace our supply chain responsibilities.

...-in, first-out, or FIFO, cost method.
This change more closely resembles the physical flow of inventory, establishes a more consistent method of inventory valuation across our businesses and better aligns with how many of our diversified manufacturing peers report financial results.
In addition, we believe this change will provide greater shareholder visibility into the Company's year-to-year profitability.
Over the past 15 years, LIFO has netted to only $9 million of expense to the Company.
While this average is less than $1 million annually, year-to-year changes have been significant at times.
Changes in our portfolio and global growth have resulted in a smaller percentage of LIFO inventories over the last few years.
We believe now is the right time to make this change due to the combination of last year's low ending LIFO inventory levels and historically low tax and interest rates.
As a result of this accounting change, we expect to make tax payments of approximately $21 million based on current tax rate.
The cash outlay will occur over the three-year period of 2021 through 2023, with approximately $11 million of that to be paid in 2021.
Now moving on to the first quarter performance.
First quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter of the year with increased working capital driven by the normal cadence of our business.
Consistent with that pattern, cash from operations was a negative $11 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $21 million versus $10 million in the same quarter of 2020.
Higher earnings were more than offset by planned working capital investments to replenish the inventories and certain businesses, and inflation in the cost of those inventories.
We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 12%.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
We ended the quarter with net debt-to-trailing 12-month EBITDA of 2.46 times and $1.4 billion of total liquidity.
In addition, we brought back $24 million of offshore cash during the quarter.
As announced yesterday, we are increasing our 2021 sales and earnings per share guidance.
2021 sales are now expected to be $4.8 billion to $5 billion, or up 12% to 17% over 2020 resulting from mid-to-single -- mid-to-high single-digit volume growth, raw material related price increases, and currency benefit.
The increase versus prior guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion reflect the combination of higher raw material related price increases and modestly higher volume growth.
We expect continued strong consumer demand for home-related products and Global Automotive, along with improvements in supply chain constraints as we move through 2021.
We also expect continued inflation in steel costs and recovery of those higher costs through selling price increases.
2021 earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.75, primarily reflecting higher volume and higher metal margin.
This guidance also assumes fixed cost savings as a result of actions taken in 2020 to be approximately $70 million.
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2021 full year EBIT margin should be in the range of 11% to 11.5%.
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23%, depreciation and amortization to approximate $195 million, net interest expense of approximately $75 million and fully diluted shares of 137 million.
Additionally, we expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $500 million, capital expenditures to approximate $150 million, dividends of approximately $220 million and debt repayment of at least $51 million.
In closing, our primary financial focus in 2021 remains on generating cash, maintaining discipline in capital allocation and reducing debt.
With the deleveraging progress made over the past year, we are in a strong position to capture both near and long-term growth opportunities that add capabilities or products products to our existing businesses.

[/INST] # Leggett & Platt reported strong first-quarter results with a 10% increase in sales to $1.15 billion, driven by volume growth, price increases, and currency benefits. EBIT rose to a record $128 million, leading to a significant increase in EBIT and EBITDA margins. Notably, earnings per share hit a first-quarter record of $0.64, reflecting a 60% increase compared to the adjusted EPS in Q1 2020. The company also announced a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share, marking its 50th consecutive year of dividend increases. Management increased its 2021 sales guidance to $4.8-$5.0 billion and EPS to $2.55-$2.75 due to higher raw material prices and improved volume growth. To align with inventory valuation practices of its peers, the company transitioned from LIFO to FIFO accounting, resulting in $21 million in expected tax payments over the next three years.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Last night, we released results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2021, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to the GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica will review the business segment and corporate financial results.
I'm very pleased with the exceptional operating results we generated this quarter as we saw continued strength across our businesses.
For the quarter, we generated a second consecutive record adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 and segment EBIT of $149 million.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 79% over the second fiscal quarter of 2020 largely due to strong volumes across all regions, robust unit margins, disciplined operational execution and strong performance in our targeted growth initiatives.
The Cabot team demonstrated great operational flexibility in the face of continued COVID restrictions, weather related interruptions and tightness in the global shipping markets.
This operational adaptability was made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our commercial and supply chain teams and the strength of the Cabot manufacturing network.
During the quarter, we saw strong volumes in the tire and automotive markets and continued strength in our infrastructure, packaging and consumer-driven applications.
We are pleased to see that automotive builds and passenger car miles driven have improved, though still generally lag pre-COVID levels.
On the other hand, truck miles driven are very robust, driving a large replacement tire market.
With both automotive and tire markets still expected to be below prior peaks on a 2021 forecast basis, we are optimistic about our growth runway in the coming years.
In the near term, COVID cases remain persistently high in certain regions, particularly across Europe, South America and India.
While vaccines are offering promise, the economic recovery will likely remain uneven and challenge to reach its full potential until the public health crisis is fully under control.
Raw material prices continue to rise across most value chains and our businesses were no different.
We effectively implemented price increases to recover these rising costs, which combined with favorable product mix to drive robust unit margins.
Looking at our major segments, Reinforcement Materials generated record EBIT performance in the quarter of $89 million, driven by robust customer demand and strong Asia pricing.
Results in Performance Chemicals were up sharply over the prior year with segment EBIT of $58 million compared to $31 million last year, as the business drove double-digit volume growth in both Performance Additives and Formulated Solutions businesses, and benefited from favorable product mix.
Overall I am very pleased with the way we have navigated the pandemic, and I believe that Cabot is emerging from the COVID crisis a stronger company.
Our global manufacturing footprint and service capabilities and leading product portfolio are increasingly valued by our customers.
While the recession of 2020 required an intense focus on cost and cash preservation, we continue to sustain our assets and make important investments in sustainability and growth for the long term.
One of the most exciting growth investments is in the space of batteries and I would like to take a few minutes to update you on our progress here.
We are seeing a real inflection point in terms of demand for electric vehicles and energy storage as pressures to reduce greenhouse gases increase.
Cabot is well positioned and is supporting this transition with our leading portfolio of highly engineered, conductive carbon additives and formulation capabilities.
Our business is demonstrating strong growth this year and we expect this will contin...
...quarter of 2021 declined by $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2020.
The reduced demand in mercury removal applications was partially offset by a reduction in fixed costs, resulting from the sale of our mine in Marshall, Texas and the related long term supply agreements.
Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect EBIT to improve driven by seasonally higher volumes.
I'll now turn to corporate items.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $146 million and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.3 billion.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $65 million which included a working capital increase of $80 million.
The working capital increase was largely driven by growth related networking capital as accounts receivables increased with higher sales and inventory increase from purchases of higher cost raw materials.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $40 million, for the full year we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million.
This estimate includes continued EPA related compliance spend and capital related to upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty products.
Additional uses of cash during the quarter included $20 million for dividend.
Our year-to-date operating tax rate was 28% and we forecast our operating tax rate will be between 27% and 29% for the fiscal year.
We are very pleased with the record results in the second quarter of 2021 with volumes continuing to recover from the COVID related lows we experienced in fiscal 2020 and great execution across the organization.
We achieved another record setting quarter in reinforcement materials and very strong results in the performance chemicals segment.
Throughout the first half of the year, I am pleased with how well the team has been executing.
Our manufacturing plants continue to operate effectively in the COVID environment to meet the needs of our customers.
Furthermore, we achieved an important milestone on our sustainability journey with the completion of the air pollution control project at our Franklin Louisiana plant.
We continue the integration of our CNT acquisition in China and our investments in inkjet are on track, to deliver on the promise of growth in the packaging segment.
And finally, we continue to renew our ways at working to drive more efficient and effective processes through the implementation of digital solutions.
I'm proud of the Cabot team for their work to strengthen our foundation and establish our platform for sustainable growth.
Moving to our current outlook, we continue to see robust and broad-based demand globally including in our key tire, automotive and industrial end use markets.
Our current view is that the underlying demand will remain strong during the second half of the year.
Against this demand outlook, we expect some impact from the flow-through of higher raw material costs in Asia, moderating volumes into automotive applications due to the semiconductor chip shortage and higher fixed costs as we perform some maintenance and turnarounds that are necessary to ensure we can meet customer demand in 2022.
Based on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95.
On the cash side, we anticipate our cash and liquidity will remain robust.
Networking capital increases, driven by a sharp recovery in demand and a steady increase in oil prices should moderate in the second half of the year.
We expect to see better conversion of our strong EBITDA and to operating cash flow as this happens.
We anticipate operating cash flow for the year will cover our cash needs for capital expenditures and dividends.
Our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of March and we expect this will be reduced further by year end.
The strength of our culture and the resilience of our employees has never been more apparent than it has during these challenging times.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Steve Rolfs, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sensient Technologies Corporation.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide investors with additional information to evaluate the Company's performance and improve the comparability of results between reporting periods.
These non-GAAP financial results should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Our actual results may differ materially, particularly in view of the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental attempts at remedial action and the timing of a return of more normal economic activity.
We urge you to read Sensient's filings, including our 10-K, our second quarter 10-Q and our forthcoming third quarter 10-Q for a description of additional factors that could potentially impact our financial results.
Please bear these factors in mind when you analyze our comments today.
Due to changes we have made to our portfolio and the divestitures we announced last year, we are updating our group and product lines.
The most notable change is that our flavors and fragrances segment will now be named the flavors and extracts segment.
You will also notice some small changes to the names we use for some of our product lines.
Sensient's focused portfolio strengthens our ability to service the food, pharmaceutical and personal care markets.
We will continue to report the three divested product lines of fragrances, yogurt fruit preparations and inks as long as these product lines impact our comparisons.
Now we'll hear from Paul.
And I'm pleased to report that results were in line with our expectations and our overall guidance for the year.
I'm very pleased with the continued revenue and profit growth in our flavors and extract group as well as our food and pharmaceutical business in the color group.
Our Asia Pacific group also posted solid profit growth in the quarter.
Overall, each of our groups performed well despite the adverse impact of COVID-19.
COVID-19 continues to be a net negative to the Company.
The market decline in the makeup industry continues to impact the color group's personal care business.
And on a geographic basis, we continue to see headwinds in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America.
In the midst of this pandemic, we have ensured our employees are safe and healthy, our facilities remain open, our supply chain remains strong and we have delivered our products on time to our customers.
Based on current trends, I expect that we will deliver on our earnings per share outlook for the year as the foundation of our business remains strong.
Our focus over the years on customer service, on-time delivery and sales execution has led to a high level of revenue from new product wins during the second half of 2019 and the first half of this year.
Furthermore, as the pandemic continues and new product development at certain companies has slowed, we have focused on regaining lost business and gaining share at our customers.
This focus, coupled with lower overall sales attrition, is paying off in our results and should continue to benefit future periods.
Last year at this time, we announced three divestitures.
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of inks.
And I'm pleased to say that we completed the sale of the yogurt fruit prep business during the third quarter.
This is our second completed divestiture in 2020, and I am optimistic that we will complete the divestiture of fragrances in the near future.
As I mentioned last year, the divestiture of these three businesses allows us to focus on our key customer markets, food, pharmaceutical and personal care.
I'm very pleased with the progress of our flavors and extracts group this year.
The group had an impressive quarter with adjusted local currency revenue growth of 13% and profit growth of 24%.
This is the third straight quarter of revenue growth, which ...
...onsolidated adjusted revenue was $300 million, an increase of approximately 6.1% in local currency compared to the third quarter of 2019.
This revenue growth was primarily a result of the flavors and extracts group, which was up approximately 13% in local currency.
Consolidated adjusted operating income increased 10.1% in local currency to $41.5 million in the third quarter of 2020.
This growth was led by the flavors and extracts group, which increased operating income by 24.1% in local currency.
The Asia Pacific group also had a nice growth in operating income in the quarter, up 15.5% in local currency.
And operating income in the food and pharmaceutical business in the color group was up over 20% in local currency.
The increase in operating income in these businesses is a result of the volume growth Paul explained earlier combined with the overall lower cost structure across the Company.
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.77 in this year's third quarter compared to $0.74 in last year's third quarter.
As Paul mentioned, the overall impact of COVID on the Company's results has been a headwind.
The impact on our food and pharmaceutical businesses is mixed, but as we have discussed, the negative impact in our personal care business is significant.
We have reduced debt by approximately $60 million since the beginning of the year.
We have adequate liquidity to meet operating and financial needs through our cash flow and available credit lines.
Our debt-to-EBITDA is 2.6, down from 2.9 at the start of the year.
Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the first nine months of 2020, an increase of 12% compared to prior year.
Capital expenditures were $34 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $26.1 million in the first nine months of 2019.
Our free cash flow increased 7% to $109 million for the first nine months of this year.
Consistent with what we communicated during our last call, we expect our adjusted consolidated operating income and earnings may be flat to lower in 2020 because of the level of non-cash performance-based equity expense in 2020.
We also expected a higher tax rate in 2020 compared to our 2019 rate, which was lower as a result of a number of planning opportunities.
Based on current trends, we are reconfirming our previously issued full-year GAAP earnings per share guidance of $2.10 per share to $2.35 per share.
The full-year guidance also now includes approximately $0.05 of currency headwinds based on current exchange rates.
We are also reconfirming our previously issued full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.60 to $2.80, which excludes divestiture-related costs, operational improvement plan costs, the impact of the divested or to-be-divested businesses and foreign currency impacts.
The Company expects foreign currency impacts to be minimal in the fourth quarter.
We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance of low-to-mid single-digit growth.
In conclusion, we continue to expect long-term revenue growth rates of mid-single digits in each of our groups.
Our stock-based compensation and other incentive costs have reset this year.
Going forward, this should be less of a headwind for us.
We do expect our tax rate to trend up slightly in future years under current law.
As a result, we believe adjusted EBITDA is a better measure of the Company's operating performance, and expect this metric to grow at a mid-single digit rate or better.
In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we will continue to pay down debt in the near term.
We also continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities.
Absent an acquisition, we have the ability to buy back shares.
We expect our capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $60 million annually.
Our divestiture activity and our operational improvement plan allows us to focus on our key customer markets of food, pharmaceutical excipients and personal care, while providing the foundation for future revenue and margin growth.

Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica McLaughlin will review the business segment and corporate financial details.
I'm very pleased with our results this quarter as we generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.35.
This marks the second strongest quarterly earnings performance in the company's history.
Demand across all businesses were strong and we continue to leverage our global network of plants to serve our customers while managing the persistent challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions in international transportation and logistics markets.
I'm very proud of the entire Cabot team for demonstrating great operating discipline across all aspects of our business and for their resilience in this very dynamic environment.
Our culture of teamwork and our commitment to commercial and operational excellence serves as the foundation for our strong performance.
While raw material markets remained somewhat volatile during the quarter, we were successful in implementing price increases to maintain robust margins.
I am also very excited about our continued progress across our portfolio of targeted growth initiatives, particularly in the battery application.
I believe the battery market presents one of the most compelling new growth opportunities for the materials sector and our strategic investments over the last several years have positioned Cabot very well to capitalize on this unique opportunity.
Our energy materials business continued to build strong momentum in the quarter as we achieved qualification milestones and began commercial sales to an additional two of the global electric vehicle battery leaders.
The Top 8 EV battery producers represent approximately 90% of the industry and we now have commercial sales to six of these Top 8 manufacturers.
In addition, we are supplying conductive carbon additives to the Top 5 EV battery producers in China.
The Cabot value proposition to the battery market is based on three factors.
First, the breadth of our product line of conductive carbon additives including conductive carbon blacks, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanostructures and blends of conductive carbon additives.
Second, the depth of our application knowledge in our global research and development centers allow us to tailor products for our customers and respond quickly in this fast changing environment.
And finally, our global footprint of manufacturing plants and our sales and technical service support.
As battery producers expand their manufacturing footprints outside of Asia to support auto OEMs with robust regional supply chains, we see the value of our global footprint becoming even more important for our customers.
We believe these capabilities represent a compelling differentiator for Cabot and position our company as a key supplier and innovator to the leading battery manufacturers.
Transitioning now to cash.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $71 million and $157 million year-to-date.
While EBITDA generation has been very strong, conversion to operating cash has been impacted somewhat by higher oil prices, which contributed to over $100 million of the net working capital increase year-to-date.
While oil price volatility can create short-term fluctuations in working capital balances, history has shown that over the long-term, oil driven working capital fluctuations tend to balance out.
Given the size and strength of our balance sheet, we can easily absorb these changes in working capital without impacting our long-term capital allocation priorities.
As oil prices stabilize, we expect to see a gr...
...ear.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect EBIT to decline due to lower volumes in our mercury removal applications and we will not have insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter.
I will now turn to corporate items.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $173 million and our liquidity position remained strong at $1.3 billion.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $71 million which included a working capital increase of $47 million.
The working capital increase was largely driven by the impact of higher raw material costs that cause [Phonetic] higher inventory balances and as we pass these higher costs on in our pricing, which drove accounts receivable higher as well.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter of fiscal '21 were $46 million.
For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $20 million.
This estimate includes continued EPA-related compliance spend and the capital related to upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty products.
We anticipate the new plant in China will be online in the second half of fiscal '22.
Additional uses of cash during the quarter included $20 million for dividends.
Our year-to-date operating tax rate was 28% and we forecast our operating tax rate will be between 27% and 28% for this fiscal year.
I'm very pleased with our third consecutive quarter of strong operating results and we are raising our expected full year outlook of adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.05.
This is truly exceptional performance for our company and reflects our strong commercial and operational execution and the value of the strategic choices we have made in recent years.
Our advancing the core strategy is focused on strengthening our industry-leading positions through great execution and by making smart targeted growth investments.
We've invested aggressively in our operating platform to build excellence in our commercial and manufacturing operations.
On the commercial front, our focus has been on strengthening our capabilities and the disciplines of key account management, data analytics, strategic pricing and voice of the customer and all of these have been underpinned by a world-class CRM platform.
On the manufacturing front, our focus has been on overall equipment effectiveness or OEE, energy recovery process and yield optimization, and capital efficiency.
Through these actions, we have demonstrated the earnings power of our two high-margin segments in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals and we have enabled this growth in a more capital-efficient manner.
On the growth front, we have a philosophy of building from positions of strength and investing in market spaces where we believe we have a right to win.
This led us to invest for breakout growth in conductive carbon additives for batteries and to complete the Sanshun acquisition and we are growing in the battery space as we expected.
In addition, our capacity investments in Asia over the years have positioned us as a leader in the region across carbon black, fumed silica, and specialty compounds.
These investments are enabling us to drive strong earnings and returns in this high growth area of the world.
Through these foundational capability investments and smart growth choices, we have structurally increased the profitability of the company and have moved the EBITDA base to a new level.
As I look forward, the underlying performance of our business is very strong and customer demand remains robust.
Our growth investments are well positioned to take advantage of macro trends in the area of mobility, alternative energy generation and storage, connectivity, and infrastructure reinvestment.
I feel very good about how Cabot is positioned for fiscal '22 and the coming years.
The strength of our culture and the resilience of our employees has never been more apparent than it has been during these challenging times.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is Ned Zachar.
We very much appreciate your participation.
Part of my new duties includes covering the usual and customary safe harbor information for these calls.
So please bear with me for just a few minutes.
pb.com and by clicking on Investor Relations.
Our format today is going to be familiar.
Marc, the floor is yours.
Ned brings a wealth of experience to the role including investing and analyst experience.
Ned has also been an investor in our debt [Phonetic], so he is familiar with our company.
Turning to the quarter.
Given a return to pre-COVID top line seasonality, the distortions in last year results in supply and demand imbalances, there were many different crosscurrents running through the quarter and year-to-year comparisons.
While it's easy to get lost in the numbers, from my perspective, the headline is this.
Demand for our products and services remain strong, and we continue to make progress, repositioning our company for long-term success.
Our Presort business had an excellent quarter from both a top and bottom line perspective.
The Presort team was able to overcome labor and transportation inflation by managing price and productivity and moved back into our long-term profit model.
Importantly, the investments we have made in our network and technology have positioned us well to drive even more productivity and help more clients.
Our SendTech business performed close to the long-term model even though supply constraints hit the top and bottom line.
Equipment sales in our backlog both increased in the quarter, evidencing strong demand.
We will continue to battle through supply demand dynamics, but clearly our new product innovations are making it a very positive difference.
In addition, more of our business is moving to a subscription model.
While this depresses short term revenue, increased subscription revenue is a very positive harbinger for the future.
Within Global Ecommerce, while there are year-to-year aberrations, there are two things that are important to the long-term success of this business.
The first is service to our clients.
We have improved our end to end cycle times by 25% and since the beginning of the year, which is a significant improvement.
And secondly, gross margin.
It is notable that gross margin improved from prior year despite the fact that we had a substantial capacity and without the benefit of peak volumes.
We have foreshadowed that as volumes normalize, thus, margin improvement would happen, and it did.
We have been very disciplined about the kind of volumes we have committed to the fourth quarter, and we like what we have, both in terms of overall volume commitments, the economics and the kind of volume we anticipate receiving.
Like others in the industry, we saw volumes decreased year-to-year in the quarter, but we very much like how we are positioned for the fourth quarter and going forward.
However, to be clear, we expect there to be some challenges this peak season.
Daily headlines talk about the supply chain disruptions, and larger players are already carrying out an impact on the results or outlook.
We are not immune to these supply chain constraints more as it relates to our Ecommerce client supply levels and, to a degree, our SendTech products.
While it remains a level of uncertainty, our team is substantially better positioned this year based on the actions we have taken thus far.
Additionally and similar to the market, we're looking at pricing to help offset some of the higher costs, particularly as it relates to transportation and labor.
For example, within Ecommerce, we have put in place a surcharge for this peak season and recently announced our annual general rate increase effective for 2022.
And we've implemented pricing increases in other parts of our business where it's justified by the new and increased value we are delivering for clients through our new product portfolio.
So lots of moving pieces, but from my perspective, a successful quarter across many dime...
... the strength of our management systems, as well as the investments we have made in technology, have enabled us to hold productivity levels flat to prior year.
In the end, we are pleased that volumes and revenue growth more than offset the market-driven increases in our Presort costs.
We will continue to invest in automation and productivity in order to help us continue to grow EBIT dollars and expand profit margins.
For the quarter, Presort EBITDA was $27 million, and EBITDA margin was 20%.
EBIT was $21 million, and EBIT margin was 15%.
All of these are significant improvements from prior year and aligned with our long-term targets.
Moving to the SendTech segment.
SendTech revenue was $338 million, which was down 5% from prior year.
As noted earlier, last year's third quarter included investment gains which benefited financing revenue and created a challenging year-over-year comparison.
Last year's investment gains represent about 200 basis points of the year-over-year revenue decline for SendTech in the quarter.
Inside SendTech, I'd like to highlight Equipment Sales, which is a leading indicator for future revenue streams.
For the quarter, Equipment Sales saw 4% growth despite some supply chain challenges in obtaining product.
I'd also highlight our efforts to shift our business mix to the growth areas of the shipping and mailing markets.
Our new SendTech products and offerings have been gaining traction in the marketplace led by the SendPro family, which is an all-in-one system that offers multi-carrier alternatives to find the best rates and delivery options, track parcels, gain postage discounts and manage spend.
In North America, more than 25% of our revenue comes from these new products, and we have begun to launch these products in select international markets.
We are also seeing strong demand for our SendPro mailstation product, which we launched in April 2020 and have shipped over 40,000 of these devices to date.
Our SaaS-based Subscription revenue grew 21%, and paid subscribers for our SendPro online product were up 58% over prior year.
I am also pleased to report that we have been able to satisfy the strong demand for our products, while managing supplier and transportation disruptions that have become prevalent across global supply chains.
SendTech EBITDA was $107 million, and EBITDA margin was 32%.
EBIT was $99 million, and EBIT margin was 29%.
Margins reflect the decrease in high-margin financing results as well as increased freight and shipping costs that have become a theme across the corporate sector.
It's important to note that we have implemented pricing actions where it is justified by the new and increased value we are delivering for clients through our newer product portfolio.
Let me now turn to our outlook.
As Marc discussed, we expect there will be some supply chain disruptions.
We are not immune to the marketwide supply chain challenges, but we believe our outlook takes this into consideration, and we are reaffirming what we have previously communicated.
We still expect annual revenue at constant currency to grow over prior year in the low to mid-single-digit range.
We still expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.42.
And we continue to expect Global Ecommerce to be EBITDA positive for the year.
We still expect free cash flow to be lower than prior year driven primarily by a rebound in Capex investments largely as it relates to the expansion of our Ecommerce network and productivity initiatives, along with a slower decline in our finance receivables.
We also expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to return to a normalized level.
In summary, I feel that Pitney Bowes is in very good shape both operationally and financially.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Such statements are based on certain estimates and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
We encourage you to read the risks described in the Company's public filings and reports, which are available on the SEC's or the Company's corporate website.
Now I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.
I'm pleased to discuss our results with you today.
I'll begin with a high-level summary of our second quarter financial results and will then turn to a more detailed discussion on our key performance drivers along with the actions we've been taking in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We executed a strong second quarter with sales of $326.1 million, improving 7% year-over-year and 15% quarter-over-quarter on higher volume despite the significant level of macroeconomic challenges resulting from COVID-19.
We maintained a strong gross profit margin of 45.9% due to a combination of sales mix and lower material costs on improved overhead absorption.
This, when coupled with our effective expense management, resulted in a 35% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $72.2 million and strong earnings of $1.22 per diluted share.
Our sales volume improved primarily due to the return of the home center customer during the quarter which resulted in significantly higher demand associated with the initial product rollout into those stores.
I'll give more details on this new customer relationship momentarily.
In addition, we saw improved sales in the repair and remodel market which were stronger than anticipated as a result of a shift in consumer behavior toward home renovation which we believe stems from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter-in-place orders.
Partially offsetting this strength were volume declines specific to Europe following government shutdowns in the United Kingdom and France in late March affecting our operations there.
These facilities are now back up and running at near full capacity.
We've been extremely diligent in our efforts to ensure Simpson remains a safe place to work.
We've been enacting rigorous safety protocol in all of our facilities, including improved sanitation measures, mandatory social distancing, temperature screening, staggered shift schedule and remote working when possible.
These actions, in addition to being deemed an essential business, have enabled us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions during the pandemic.
Importantly, we have not experienced any supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 and have been able to continue meeting our customer needs.
I'd now like to discuss the key driver of our performance during the second quarter.
As some of you may recall, we had a prior relationship with Lowe's back in 2011 and we are delighted to have the opportunity to once again supply their customers with our industry-leading mechanical anchor, connector and fastener product solutions.
During the second quarter, we shipped our connector product into Lowe's and expect to ship selections of both our mechanical anchor and fastener product in the current quarter.
Please note that the sell-through into the Lowe's stores required for initial inventory stocking in Q2 and Q3 will not be indicative of volume trends moving forward.
In addition, we anticipate some of our mechanical anchor and fastener products will be phased out of the Home Depot throughout the remainder of the year.
These products were in some, but not all, Home Depot locations.
Next, I'll turn to an update on our SAP implementation, which has continued to progress on track despite travel interruptions related to COVID-19.
We have transitioned our rollout and training efforts to a virtual format for the time being which has been working out quite well.
As of the end of the first quarter of 2020, all of our US based sales organizations have been transitioned over to SAP.
And as of today, we still anticipate a companyw...
...g expenses were 23.8%, an improvement of 280 basis points compared to 26.6%.
Stock-based compensation expense included adjustments to performance-based shares of 5.2 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Our strong gross margin and diligent management of costs and operating expenses helped drive a 34.6% increase in consolidated income from operations to $72.2 million compared to $53.7 million.
In North America, income from operations increased 41% to $72.2 million due to the strength of our gross profit margin coupled with reduced operating expenses.
In Europe, income from operations was $2.7 million compared to $4.7 million due to a combination of lower sales and slightly higher operating expense.
On a consolidated basis, our operating income margin of 22.1% increased by approximately 450 basis points.
The effective tax rate decreased to 25.8% from 26.4%, primarily due to a reduction in foreign losses subject to valuation allowances.
Accordingly, net income totaled $53.5 million or $1.22 per fully diluted share compared to $39.6 million or $0.88 per fully diluted share.
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our balance sheet remained healthy with ample liquidity to operate our day-to-day operations.
At June 30th cash and cash equivalents totaled $315.4 million, an increase of $13.7 million compared to the balance at March 31st.
Our inventory position of $265.4 million at June 30th increased $9.6 million from our balance at March 31st, in line with the seasonal increase in inventory we typically experienced in the summer and fall months due to increased construction activity.
We continue to be highly selective in regard to inventory purchases in line with our goal to improve our inventory balance through careful management and purchasing practices.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $29.3 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $14.6 million or 33.2%.
During the second quarter, we used approximately $7.3 million for capital expenditures which included a minimal amount for our ongoing SAP implementation project.
In regard to stockholder returns, we paid $10.2 million in dividend to our stockholders during the second quarter.
On July 13th, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share which will be payable on October 22nd to stockholders of record as of October 1st.
As such, based on business trends and conditions as of today, July 27th, we estimate our outlook for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 to be as follows.
Net sales are estimated to increase in the range of 1.5% to 4% compared to the full year ended December 31, 2019.
Gross margin is estimated to be in the range of approximately 43% to 45%.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are estimated to be in the range of approximately 27% to 29% and the effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 24% to 26%, including both federal and state income taxes.
Notwithstanding the improved visibility, it is important to note that the potential economic impact related to COVID-19 on our operations, raw material costs, consumers, suppliers and vendors, which we are unable to predict at this time, may have a material adverse impact on our 2020 financial outlook.
In summary, despite broader COVID-19 related challenges in the marketplace, we were very pleased with our second quarter financial results and operating performance.
We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive improved performance moving forward.
Our industry leadership position, geographic reach and diverse product offering, combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position gives us confidence in our ability to maintain our operations and support current and future demand trend.
We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.
For the second quarter of 2020 we generated strong cash flow from operations of $30 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $14 million or 31.2%.

Additionally, we have provided slides that summarize many of the points we will discuss during the call.
These slides can also be found on our Investor Relations' website.
We delivered a solid quarter and first half of the year and continue to make progress against our overall objectives.
Every business grew revenue and improved EBIT from prior year.
Overall, revenue at constant currency grew 6% and EBIT grew 16%.
SendTech and Presort both grew revenue, albeit as expected, given the easier compare, and both businesses grew EBIT.
Presort continues to see a nice recovery in volumes from pandemic levels and EBIT margins remain in the double-digit range, moving back toward the long-term model.
SendTech's revenue growth was led by a strong performance in our SendPro product family in addition to continued double-digit growth in our SaaS-based shipping portfolio.
The business recorded its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year EBIT growth and continues to maintain its EBIT margin above 30%.
Global e-commerce grew revenue this quarter despite a tough prior year comparison, and importantly, also improved quarter-to-quarter.
EBITDA turned positive in the quarter, and both EBIT and EBITDA improved meaningfully over prior year and prior quarter.
The path to profitability for e-commerce is an integrated approach around talent, training, automation and execution.
We've made several important additions to our team and the new management talent, along with the maturation of our existing workforce are clearly yielding results.
We continue to work to optimize our shipping lanes and continue to focus our investments toward more automation.
We continue to make good progress with substantial opportunity still in front of us.
Entering the second half of 2021, I like where we sit.
The revenue comparisons will get more difficult in the second half of the year compared to the first half, but this quarter was a glimpse into what the business can look like when we hit on all cylinders and that improved profitable revenue growth is within our grasp.
Over the course of the last year or so, I have said that Pitney Bowes will come out of this pandemic, a bigger and better company.
And while we are not out of the woods with the pandemic, we're certainly on the trajectory of being a bigger company, and we are working every day at becoming a better company.
Our second quarter results reflect solid momentum across all of our businesses.
We continue to make good progress and are set up well for the second half of the year.
Revenue was $899 million and grew 6% over prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.11 and included a $0.03 tax benefit in the quarter.
Free cash flow was $87 million, and cash from operations was $79 million, which was a solid performance in the quarter and in line with our expectations.
Although down from prior year, it is important to remember that last year included $66 million contribution from the decline in our finance receivables, which was largely COVID related.
This was an item that we identified as a headwind to our free cash flow comparison earlier this year.
During the quarter, we paid $9 million in dividends and made $5 million in restructuring payments.
We spent $40 million in capex as we continue to invest in our network and productivity initiatives across the business.
We ended the quarter with $814 million in cash and short-term investments.
Total debt was $2.4 billion, which is down $289 million.
When you take our finance receivables and cash into account, our implied operating debt is $567 million.
Let me turn to the P&L.
Starting with revenue versus prior year.
Equipment sales grew 46%.
Supplies grew 14% and business services grew 6%.
We have decline in support services of 1%; rentals of 2%; and financing of 16%.
Gross profit of $301 million improved about $17 million over prior year on growth across all segments.
Gross margin was 33%, which was slightly down from th...
...ear.
Within SendTech, revenue was $346 million and grew 6%.
We continue to differentiate ourselves in the market with a wide range of end-to-end mailing and shipping offerings that are attractive to businesses ranging from large enterprises to small offices.
SendTech's SaaS-based shipping products grew at a low double-digit rate over prior year to $31 million this quarter.
The number of labels printed through our shipping offering grew over 30% and paid subscriptions grew about 70% over prior year.
Additionally, shipping volumes that our U.S. clients finance grew nearly 70% over prior year.
Our end-to-end value proposition continues to resonate with clients as they adopt and use these new offerings, which bring value to their businesses.
Equipment sales grew 46% over prior year.
Compared to the second quarter 2019, equipment sales grew 1%, which is an important metric as this is a key indicator for future streams in the traditional side of the SendTech business.
This also points to how our new sending products are resonating with clients and helping to strengthen our portfolio.
We continue to see strong placement of our SendPro C and mailstation multipurpose devices.
Our international operations also saw strong equipment sales growth, and we continue to roll out new products in these markets.
Through the quarter, we, like many others, experienced some transportation challenges related to our supply chain.
We are proactively managing our inventory and are able to place a significant level of new equipment despite those challenges.
Looking ahead at the second half of the year, we continue to closely monitor the semiconductor industry and potential supply shortage concerns.
While it is still a bit too early to tell, we would expect the impacts, if any, to be more pronounced in the fourth quarter.
We will look to mitigate any potential supply shortages by working closely with our suppliers and repositioning our solutions with our clients as necessary.
EBITDA was $115 million and EBITDA margin was 33%.
EBIT was $107 million and EBIT margin was 31%.
EBIT and EBITDA dollars improved from prior year and was the third consecutive quarter of improvement for both metrics.
Let me now turn to our full year outlook, which is in line with what we have previously communicated.
As we all know, there is still a level of uncertainty in the macro environment, particularly as new COVID variants continue to ramp up and concerns around supply chain remain, and we will continue to monitor any potential impacts closely.
We still expect annual revenue at constant currency to grow over prior year in the low to mid-single-digit range.
We still expect adjusted earnings per share to grow over prior year and more specifically, to be in the $0.35 to $0.42 range.
We still expect free cash flow to be lower than prior year due to items that benefited 2020 and are not expected to continue at the same level this year.
Prior year included a lower level of capex and finance receivables and higher customer deposits.
We also expect our tax rate in the second half to be higher and return to more normal levels.
Looking at the timing, we expect third quarter revenue to be in line with second quarter and the fourth quarter to be larger than the third, given a strong holiday peak season.
Taking the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance into consideration, we currently expect our third quarter to represent nearly 20% of our full year attainment.
Let me conclude on this.
In the beginning of the year, we said that we expected revenue and adjusted earnings per share to grow, and we remain committed to this outlook.
Each segment has delivered a solid performance through the first half of the year, improving revenue, EBITDA and EBIT from prior year.
We continue to generate good free cash flow and remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We also continue to make measurable progress and are confident in our ability to achieve our financial objectives.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm pleased to report that we started the year strong, delivering another solid quarter.
Both segments got off to a good start.
As a company, we achieved $222 million in revenues and excellent bottom line performance, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 or $0.87 per share on an adjusted basis.
Our cash flow generation was particularly good for first quarter.
And we continue to pay down debt and have a healthy balance sheet, which enables investment in future growth.
I'm particularly proud of how our employees continue to perform through the pandemic.
Even while following our COVID-19 protocols and safety procedures, our operating teams are driving process improvements with Lean Kaizen.
Our R&D teams are working on the next generation of materials and products, and we continue to do a great job for our customers in delivery, quality and service.
Our Machine Clothing segment had its strongest quarterly top line performance since 2015, with revenues up nearly $12 million year-over-year and good order activity in Q1, which bodes well for this year.
In fact, other than the secular decline in publication grades, Machine Clothing end market demand in packaging, tissue, pulp and engineered fabrics were all positive in Q1.
In addition to a solid backlog, our engineering teams are hard at work developing new technology belts for our customers, which is critical to our success and value proposition.
We have seen some instances of isolated supply constraints impacting raw material pricing and delivery timing in this segment, and we continue to actively manage our supply chain, securing the materials we need to support our customers' demand.
In summary, our Machine Clothing segment continues to perform well.
serving customers around the world as the recognized global leader supplying these critical consumable components to the paper industry.
This success is the result of a disciplined execution of our long-term strategy.
In Aerospace, as we reported last quarter, our Engineered Composites segment will be grinding through a year of destocking of excess inventory in the channels for LEAP, Boeing 787 and F-35 products.
That said, Engineered Composites is on track with their plan and ready for the upturn as commercial air transport improves, inventory in the channels is consumed and our production is back in sync with aircraft OEM production.
We're on good platforms that we expect will recover, and we continue to do this as a time to further improve our operations.
We're ready and looking forward to the upturn.
We're working closely with Safran to coordinate our operations as the LEAP engine production ramps up, supporting the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX.
With domestic air travel recovering first and fueling demand for narrow-body aircraft, A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX are in the sweet spot of the air transport recovery.
In Engineered Composites, looking beyond our current portfolio of programs, our opportunity pipeline is as full as it's ever been.
We're developing a breadth of capability to be the next-generation supplier of advanced composite materials.
This ranges from our proprietary 3D woven composites currently used on LEAP engine fan blades and hand cases to automated fiber placement composite wing skins for Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to complex components on the Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter.
We continue to develop applications for the Wing of Tomorrow program with Airbus Industries, and we're investing more this year in R&D projects with new customers and new platforms using advanced materials such as our 3D woven composites on a range of exciting applications, including unmanned hypersonic and electric aircraft.
The sum of these efforts furthers our goal to diversify and grow our customer base and broaden our material science capabilities.
As I mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet and good free cash flow generation.
These allow us to sustain our investment in the technology and customer programs that expand...
...ed as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, of $21.1 million, compared to a use of over $19 million in the same quarter last year, driven primarily by improvements in AEC working capital.
We were pleased with the cash flow performance of the AEC segment this quarter, which swung from a significant use in the same quarter last year to significant cash generation this year.
Capital expenditures in Q1 of each year were approximately $13 million.
Our absolute net leverage ratio is now 0.65, providing us with a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to take advantage of organic and acquired growth opportunities.
As we look forward to the balance of 2021, the outlook for the Machine Clothing segment remained strong.
Compared to the same quarter last year, MC orders were down 2%.
However, as you may recall, near the end of Q1 in 2020, orders spiked from customers who are concerned about the availability of supply in light of the emerging pandemic.
Further, from a backlog perspective, we are in a stronger position entering Q1 in 2021 than we were in 2020.
So overall, we are feeling good about our previously issued guidance of revenue for the segment of between $570 million and $590 million.
From a margin perspective in Machine Clothing, we delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins north of 37%.
I should note that some of the headwinds we projected this year, most notably a return to normal levels of travel and the absence of the foreign exchange benefits we enjoyed during the middle last year, have yet to impact our comparative results.
That said, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter.
While we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the segment of $195 million to $205 million, we are currently trending toward the upper portion of that range.
Turning to Engineered Composites.
We are seeing the expected impact of the 787 frames channel destocking in our top line results.
During the quarter, we generated less than $1 million of revenue from the 787 frames program compared to over $12 million in the same quarter last year.
I already noted that the ASC LEAP program was also down by about $12 million during the quarter.
These two programs account for almost all of the year-over-year decline in AEC revenue that we saw during the quarter.
As a result of these declines, the share of AEC revenue derived from defense programs grew to over 48% during the quarter.
That said, we will still see the previously disclosed revenue impact from F-35 channel destocking in the second and third quarters.
So I would expect the defense program share of AEC revenues to dip somewhat over the next couple of quarters.
This will also make the second and third quarters quite challenging for the segment overall.
The year is shaping up in line with expectations for the segment, and we are maintaining our guidance range of $275 million to $295 million for segment revenues.
From a profitability perspective, our performance to date is broadly in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our AEC adjusted EBITDA guidance of $55 million to $65 million.
We are also maintaining all of our previously issued guidance ranges for company-level performance, with the exception of guidance for GAAP earnings per share, which has been updated to reflect non-GAAP adjustments recorded in Q1.
Current guidance is as follows: revenue of between $850 million and $890 million; effective income tax rate of 28% to 30%; depreciation amortization of between $70 million and $75 million; capital expenditures in the range of $50 million to $60 million, GAAP earnings per share of between $2.38 and $2.78, down slightly from prior guidance of $2.40 and $2.80; adjusted earnings per share of between $2.40 and $2.80; and adjusted EBITDA of between $195 million and $220 million.
Overall, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing and hope to see a continued progression to normalcy in the balance of the year.
Over to you, Greg.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures.
We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results.
On the call today are Mitch Butier, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I'm pleased to report, we delivered another strong quarter.
Our two primary businesses achieved impressive top and bottom line growth and momentum in our Intelligent labels platform continues.
We are in a higher demand environment that comes at a time of continued and increasing challenges.
The ramping up of COVID infections and restrictions in some countries, continued supply chain challenges and additional inflationary pressures are taxing the industry, our customers and our teams.
The biggest challenges have been in LGM North America due to raw material shortages and labor and capacity constraints, and in RBIS Vietnam, where output was significantly constrained in the quarter due to COVID restrictions.
While we are encouraged by recent trends in these businesses as we've been able to increase output in recent weeks, the supply chain constraints continue.
As for inflation, the pressures continue to increase.
We previously expected some abatement in raw material input cost toward the end of the year, whereas, we now expect additional inflation in Q4, as well as Q1 of next year.
Now for context on the magnitude of the inflation, in our materials businesses alone, we will be exiting this year with annualized inflation of more than $600 million.
That's a nearly 20% increase; a rate we have not seen in decades.
We are thus in the midst of another round of price increases.
Despite these hurdles, we continue to achieve impressive results.
The team is doing a tremendous job managing through these compounding challenges, focusing on keeping our team safe and delivering for our customers.
Now a brief recap of the segments.
Label and Graphic Materials posted strong topline growth for the quarter over coming the challenges I just highlighted as demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends continued to drive strong volume growth in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while growth in our Graphics and Reflective Solutions business continues to rebound.
LGM's profitability remained strong, though margins were down from last year due to the increasing inflationary headwinds and higher costs in the quarter from the supply chain constraints.
Given the increasing inflationary pressures, we have redoubled our efforts on material reengineering and, as I mentioned previously, are raising prices again.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and continued to expand margins significantly.
The segment grew 22% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically, driven by strength in both high-value product categories, as well as the core Apparel business.
[Technical Issues] Impressive performance is despite the significant constraint in South Asia where we have major manufacturing hubs, once again demonstrating the advantages of our global manufacturing network.
Intelligent Labels sales, enterprisewide, were up 15% in the quarter and we are on track for approximately 30% organic growth for the year versus 2020 and 40% versus 2019, toward the higher end of our long-term target.
As expected, the continued strong growth in our RFID business was primarily driven by Apparel.
Applications outside of Apparel, particularly food and logistics grew faster than the average, though obviously off of a small base.
And in Q3, we also closed the acquisition of Vestcom, a business that further expands our position in high-value categories and has the potential to further advance our Intelligent Labels strategy.
In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales continue to rebound off ...
...with double-digit growth in both ASEAN and Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in China.
While LGM's profitability remained strong, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from last year to 15.9%.
This was partially driven by the increased inflationary pressures and the impact of supply constraints, which led to some incremental costs in the quarter, such as expedited freight and overtime to minimize disruptions to customers.
And as you know, our goals are to deliver GDP-plus growth and top-quartile returns on capital, with a focus on driving EVA.
Our approach to price increases in material reengineering is designed to do just that as we looked [Technical Issues] at higher material costs on a dollar basis by the end of an inflationary cycle.
However, the revenue base from such price increases alone, especially the magnitude we are seeing in the back half of this year, reduces operating margin on a percentage [Technical Issues] with no impact to returns.
This pricing impact led to a reduction in operating margin by roughly 0.75% [Phonetic] in the third quarter.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions.
RBIS sales were up 22% ex-currency and 14% on an organic basis as growth remained strong in both the high-value categories and the base business due, in part, to lower prior year comps.
Compared to 2019, organic growth was up 9%.
The Apparel business saw particular strength in the performance and premium channels, and continued double-digit growth in external embellishments.
As Mitch mentioned, Intelligent Labels sales were up organically, roughly 15% and up about 40% compared to 2019.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.8% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwinds from prior year temporary cost reduction actions, higher employee-related costs, and growth investments.
The RBIS team is continuing to deliver in this high-growth, high-margin business.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment.
Sales increased 20% ex-currency and 15% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in both the Industrial and Healthcare categories.
Compared to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis.
Adjusted operating margin decreased to roughly 10% as the benefit from higher volume was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, higher freight and raw material costs and higher employee-related cost.
Freight, in particular, had an outsized impact on IHM in the quarter, given the significant increases in global shipping costs.
Now, shifting to our outlook for 2021.
We have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.80 and $8.95, a roughly $0.08 increase to the midpoint of the range.
And we now anticipate roughly 15% organic sales growth for the full year, at the high end of our previous range reflecting strong volume growth and the impact from higher prices.
In particular, the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the resulting calendar shift will be a headwind to reported sales growth of roughly 8 points in the fourth quarter of this year, with a roughly $0.30 earnings per share headwind.
The anticipated tailwind from currency translation is now $30 million in operating income for the full year, based on current rates.
Most of this benefit came in the first half and will thus create a headwind as we go into 2022 if rates stay where they are now.
And we expect a modest earnings per share benefit from Vestcom in 2021, net of purchase accounting amortization, which we estimate to be nearly $60 million on an annualized basis and net of financing costs.
[Technical Issues] target over $700 million of free cash flow this year, up significantly from previous years.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP-plus growth and top-quartile returns on capital, which together will drive sustained growth in EVA.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President-Investor Relations.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.
More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.
Strong nitrogen demand and lower overall production have tightened the global supply demand balance, supporting much higher prices than in recent years.
At the same time, energy spreads between North America and high-cost regions have expanded considerably, increasing margin opportunities for our cost advantaged network.
These factors helped drive an increase in adjusted EBITDA of nearly 25% compared to last year, and we produced our strongest first half financial results in six years.
Additionally, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow, giving us tremendous flexibility as we focus on achieving investment grade metrics and executing our clean energy initiatives.
The first half was not without its challenges, including the natural gas-driven production interruptions we described on the first quarter call.
The first half also saw a continued demonstration of the harm the UAN industry in the United States faces from subsidized and dumped imports from Russia and Trinidad.
Until the last few years, UAN earned a substantial premium to other upgraded nitrogen products due to the higher capital investment required to produce it and the meaningful agronomic and operational benefit it offers to farmers.
As you can see from our recent results, UAN now trades at a significant discount to all upgraded nitrogen products due to unfair trade practices.
We have taken the necessary steps to address this situation by petitioning the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission to initiate anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations.
We look forward to the result of the ITC's preliminary vote later this week.
Looking forward, we are very bullish about the next two years.
As Bert will describe in a moment, the need to replenish global coarse grains stocks driving agricultural demand along with the impact of increased economic activity driving industrial demand, should support all-time record global nitrogen demand over the next two years.
Forward energy curves are also very favorable over this timeframe.
We expect these factors to help keep the global nitrogen supply and demand balance much tighter than we've seen in recent years, supporting an extended period of higher nitrogen pricing and higher margins for our cost advantaged network.
Longer term, we believe increased demand for ammonia and its clean energy attributes will become a significant factor in the tighter supply and demand balance, driving further value for our network.
We continue to see broad interest in clean hydrogen and ammonia to help meet the world's clean energy needs.
As we continue to have discussions with market participants, our focus remains on being at the forefront of this significant opportunity, from positioning our network to be the world's leader for blue and green ammonia production to collaborating with other global leaders where our unique capabilities can provide value.
We are pleased with the progress we've made and look forward to additional developments in the coming months.
The global nitrogen supply and demand balance remains far tighter than we have seen in recent years, underpinned by strong agricultural and industrial demand plus higher energy prices in Europe and Asia.
This has created a highly favorable pricing environment that has persisted into the second half of this year.
Based on the agricultural and energy outlook we see today, we believe a positive pricing environment for fertilizer will remain in pla...
....
Globally, industrial related demand in China and from phosphate producers has also increased.
While we expect demand to remain strong for some time, we believe that global fertilizer inventory in the channel today is low and will need to be rebuilt.
So far in 2021, high energy costs in Europe and Asia have lowered operating rates and reduced supply availability, particularly for ammonia and urea, further supporting global pricing.
As you can see on Slide 9, energy costs in these regions have increased to over $14 per MMBtu and Eastern European producers have become the global marginal producer for the time being.
The higher energy cost has steepened the global nitrogen cost curve substantially, increasing margin opportunities for low-cost producers such as CF.
Forward curve suggests CF will benefit from favorable energy differentials for the foreseeable future.
As a result, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we leverage our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to deliver for our customers.
For the first half of 2021, the Company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $397 million or $1.83 per diluted share.
EBITDA was $994 million and adjusted EBITDA was $997 million.
The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $700 million.
Based on the outlook Tony and Bert have shared, we are well positioned to build on these results and continue to generate significant free cash flow.
First, we raised our estimate for capital expenditures for 2021 from around $450 million to approximately $500 million.
The increase is driven primarily by our decision to pull a significant maintenance event scheduled for next year into this year.
We believe that performing this activity in 2021 is best for the asset and reduces the risk of an unplanned outage during the 2022 spring application season.
Going forward, we expect capital expenditures to return to the range of $450 million per year.
With this additional maintenance project, the high level of previously planned maintenance, and the additional maintenance from severe weather in February, we estimate that gross ammonia production and sales volume will be around 9.5 million tons and 19 million product tons respectively; both at the low end of our forecasts earlier this year.
Looking into 2022, we have a more typical maintenance schedule and we'd expect to return to approximately 10 million tons of ammonia production and sales volume of 19.5 million to 20 million product tons.
Second, we are taking additional steps in line with our focus on achieving investment grade ratings and positioning the Company to execute our clean energy initiatives.
We have announced that we will redeem $250 million of our senior notes due June 2023, which will reduce our gross debt to $3.5 billion.
We expect to lower our gross debt to $3 billion by or before the maturity of the 2023 notes.
We also continue to return cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases at attractive levels.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.
They successfully managed many challenges in the first six months of the year, setting us up well for the second half.
Most importantly, we did this safely with our recordable incident rate at the end of June at just 0.28 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages.
As we look ahead, we expect strong agricultural and industrial demand to create all-time record global nitrogen demand.
Forward curve show very favorable energy spreads to Europe and Asia over the same timeframe, which should support robust margins and cash generation.
We see good progress on our clean energy initiatives.
Taken together, we are well positioned to create significant shareholder value in the near and longer term.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 An audio recording of today's call will be available on the internet for a limited time and can also be accessed on the VPG website.
Turning to Slide 2.
Today's remarks are governed by the safe harbor provisions of the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
For a discussion of the risks associated with VPG's operations, we encourage you to refer to our SEC filings and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our other recent SEC filings.
On the call today are Ziv Shoshani, CEO and president; and Bill Clancy, CFO.
I will begin with some commentary on VPG's consolidated results and our sales trends and operational highlights by segment.
Bill will provide financial details and then our Q1 2020 outlook.
Moving to Slide 3.
The fourth quarter capped the second best year in VPG's history in terms of revenue and profitability.
In spite of some macro headwinds after beginning the year in Q1 with one of our strongest quarters ever, business trends and our revenue slowed in the second half of the year reflecting a global economic slowdown that impacted many of our end markets.
Despite the headwinds, we achieved solid results for fiscal 2019 with sales of $284 million and adjusted operating margin of 11.7% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 and $20.4 million of adjusted free cash flow.
Moving to Slide 4.
For the fourth quarter, sales of $69.1 million were at the high end of our expectations and grew 2.6% sequentially.
Bookings were strong as total orders for the fourth quarter of $79.8 million grew 24% from the third quarter and reflected growth in all three segments.
The result was an overall book-to-bill of 1.15 in the fourth quarter, an improvement from 0.96 in Q3.
Looking at our fourth-quarter business trends by market.
In test and measurement, demand for our precision resistors in semiconductor test applications rebounded.
In the general industrial market, we saw continuous softness in oil and gas and in industrial process applications.
In transportation, where we focus on track in one market orders for our VPG onboard weighing solutions were solid in both the avionics, military and space market or AMS and steel market trends continue to be directionally positive, but our orders reflected the project-driven nature of our products.
In the industrial wing and other markets which includes precision, agriculture, construction and medical applications, we saw signs of bottoming as customers replenished their inventories.
From an operation and financial perspective, our profits in the fourth quarter were impacted by a number of factors.
First, our results include -- included $1.7 million of an acquisition-related charges and costs associated with the addition of Dynamic Systems, Inc. or DSI in November of 2019.
Second, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.7 million which primarily relates to the closing and downsizing of facilities as part of our ongoing strategic initiative to align and consolidate our manufacturing operations.
Third, our margins were further affected by approximately $1.1 million related to inventory reductions as well as one-time inventory adjustments, mainly for manufacturing relocations and system implementations.
The results of these factors was an operating income in the fourth quarter of $1.8 million or 2.5% of revenues, and adjusted operating income was $5.2 million or 7.5% of revenues.
Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.28.
And adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.27.
Moving to Slide 5.
Looking at our reporting segments in detail.
Sales of foil technology products of $29.6 million declined 7.7% sequentially and were 19.3% lower than the fourth quarter a year ago.
The quarter-to-quarter decline was due to lower sales of precision resistors in the test and measurement market.
However orders for these products grew robustly in the fourth quarter of 2019 for both test and measurements and AMS customers as they place their semi-annual and annual orders.
The resu...
...rter 2019 revenue of $69.1 million increased by 2.6% as compared to $67.4 million in the third quarter, and we were down 10.2% as compared to $77.0 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $500,000 for the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to a year ago and had no impact as compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 35%.
Excluding $1.3 million related to purchase accounting adjustments for the DSI acquisition, our gross margin on adjusted basis was 36.8% which declined from 38.3% in the third quarter.
Our operating margin was 2.5% for the fourth quarter of 2019.
If we exclude the above-mentioned purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition cost of $400,000 and restructuring expense of $1.7 million related to the facility closures and downsizing, as Ziv mentioned, our fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin was 7.5% as comparted to 10% in the third quarter of 2019.
The adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 included approximately $1.1 million of inventory reductions and inventory-related adjustments which are not expected to reoccur.
Excluding these inventory-related factors, adjusted gross margin would have been 38.5%, above the 38.3% we reported in the third quarter of 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $20.2 million or 29.2% of revenues.
This compared to $20.9 million or 27.2% for the fourth quarter last year and $19.1 million or 28.3% in the third quarter.
The higher sequential SG&A in the fourth quarter reflected the inclusion of two months of SG&A expenses for DSI which were partially offset by a reduction in bonus accrual reserves.
The adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $3.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $5.0 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2019.
While impact of foreign exchange rates for the fourth quarter was modest compared to the third quarter, they had a much bigger effect compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, impacting net earnings by $900,000 or $0.07 per diluted share.
We generated adjusted free cash flow of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2019.
We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations which was $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, less capital expenditures of $2.6 million and sales of fixed assets of $400,000.
We recorded a tax benefit of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the acquisition of DSI, utilizing our deferred tax liabilities against deferred tax assets.
We are assuming an operational tax rate in the range of 27% to 29% for our 2020 planning purposes.
Reflecting the $40.5 million paid for DSI, we ended the fourth quarter with $86.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and total long-term debt of $44.5 million.
With a net leverage ratio of about one time, we believe that our balance sheet remains very strong and we have ample liquidity to support our business requirements and to fund additional M&A opportunities.
Turning to our outlook.
While we see signs of bottoming in some of our industrial markets, there continues to be a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment including the potential spread of the coronavirus.
We currently expect net revenues in the range of $63 million to $70 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2020 which reflect the portions of our project-driven business and customers longer lead time orders that are expected to ship in the quarter and assumes constant fourth-quarter 2019 exchange rates.
In summary, our sales for the fourth quarter were at the high end of our expectations, and we ended the quarter with a very strong book-to-bill.
Our manufacturing consolidation projects are on track for on-schedule completion.
And we believe we have the long-term growth and cost strategies in place to achieve our three-year financial targets.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer.
After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session.
During the Q&A session, we request that you ask one question, followed by one follow-up question, after your follow-up question, please return to the queue.
We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter, with earnings of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.54 per share.
In many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants and differentiating our brand.
These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology and analytics, while generating substantial capital in an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth.
Underlying our results this quarter were three important advancements.
The first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and continued strong sales trends.
Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories, even travel sales increased, and while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since then.
We also continue to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investments to take advantage of this.
While the competitive environment has intensified, new accounts are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition.
This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees and useful and transparent rewards.
While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings and substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending as evidenced in our strong discount revenue.
Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts, as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and our robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022.
The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong.
Our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge off rate and continued low delinquencies.
The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full-year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter.
And third is the continued expansion of our payments business.
PULSE saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit used through the pandemic.
Our Diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year as the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach.
In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive in our integrated digital banking and payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital generative.
I continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.
Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and that continued economic recovery.
Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are three key things I want to call out.
First, our t...
...oints.
These were our lowest ABS coupons ever and show good execution in timing by our Treasury team.
Looking at revenue on Slide 7.
Total non-interest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments.
Net discount and interchange revenue was up $61 million or 26% driven by strong sales volume.
This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last.
We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered.
Loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees.
Looking at Slide 8.
Total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year.
The details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating cost.
Employee compensation increased $12 million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year.
Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from their prior year from lower headcount.
Marketing expense increased $70 million supporting another quarter of strong new account growth.
Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual.
Professional fees were up $47 million, primarily due to higher recovery fees.
Courts reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees.
Year-to-date, recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year.
The benefits of these cost is reflected in lower credit losses.
Moving to Slide 9.
The trend of sustained strong credit performance continued.
Total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46%, down 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially.
Total net charge dollars decreased $343 million from their prior year and were down $131 million quarter-over-quarter.
Credit performance was strong across all products, as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans and personal loans.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10.
This quarter, we released $165 million from reserves and our reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%.
The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance.
And a largely stable macroeconomic outlook.
The impact of these was partially offset by a 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter.
Our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of just over 6%.
These assumptions were slightly less positive to no issues in the second quarter, but still reflect a strong economic outlook.
Looking at Slide 11.
Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target.
We repurchased $815 million of common stock and as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share.
These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.
On funding, we continue to make progress toward our goals of having deposits be 70% to 80% of our funding mix.
Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior year.
Wrapping up on Slide 12.
Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives.
In summary, we remain well positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends.
Credit performance trends remain favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management.
Investments for growth have supported a significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses.
Lastly, our integrated digital banking and payment model is highly capital generative allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders.
We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in January.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We're very pleased with the performance of all of our business lines as 2021 is off to a very strong start.
In the first quarter, we delivered core FFO per share of $1.26, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of $1.17.
Due to this outperformance and strong visibility into our second and third quarter transient RV bookings, we are raising our 2021 core FFO per share annual guidance range by $0.13 to $5.92 to $6.08 and our expected same community NOI growth for the full year by 190 basis points to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%.
The momentum we experienced in our RV resorts in 2020 has only accelerated this year as the country continues to reopen.
For the quarter, same community NOI growth was 2.7% over last year, despite the continued Canadian border closure and the California stay-at-home order which dictated the closure of our California resorts through early February.
We achieved total portfolio occupancy of 97.3%, a 60 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2020 by selling 514 revenue-producing sites.
We also delivered approximately 350 ground-up and expansion sites in the first quarter, which include the grand opening of our premier 250 site Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay Resort.
Since the beginning of the year, we have deployed $183 million into acquisitions, comprised of two manufactured housing communities, six RV resorts, and four marinas.
Our team continues to find ways to add irreplaceable assets to our portfolio that serve to reinforce the high quality of our brand, enhance our offerings to our guests and foster continued growth of our revenues and earnings over time.
In our manufactured housing business, our operations are benefiting from sustained strength and fundamentals and demand for affordable housing, evidenced by new, pre-owned, and brokered home sales.
Furthermore, applications to live in a Sun community remain at record high levels, up 21% over this time last year.
Our RV business, while impacted by the closures and the travel restrictions associated with the pandemic during the quarter, is showing resilience with forward bookings well ahead of both 2020 and 2019.
As we emerge from the pandemic and as the percentage of the vaccinated population rises, we anticipate our best-in-class resorts to remain a preferred vacationing option.
Our assertion is supported by the RV Industry Association stating record-year unit sale expectations for 2021 as well as our strong advance bookings for the second and third quarters.
A broader segment of the population rediscovered the outdoors during 2020 and we are seeing that interest carry forward.
In an environment impacted by COVID, RV provides travelers with an incremental level of safety and control.
Moreover, we believe that increased demand is being driven by the continued desire of consumers to get back to a degree of normalcy, resuming vacation and leisure travel after last year's travel restrictions.
In our marina business, results continue to track ahead of our underwriting and the team is preparing for an active boating season.
According to multiple industry sources, boat sales have increased in demand year-over-year.
With our expanded presence in this sought-after and scarce asset class, we are well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for slips and moorings.
We are relying on our four core investment strategies to support long-term resilience and the growth of our platform, further solidifying our position of delivering industry-leading results.
An important part of these core strategies includes expansion and ground-up development.
We wanted to highlight the recent opening of Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay first announced nearly four years ago.
It is now open for guests and we are pleased to continue to realize meaningful accretion from our capital deployment activities.
In early March, we executed a $1.1 billion equity raise to secure capital to fund our growing acquisition pipeline and other opportunities.
We will match fund these growth initi...
...live in a Sun community.
Brokered home sales throughout Sun's portfolio saw 36% increase year-over-year, as the resale market continues to show strength.
Average brokered home prices in our communities increased by over 20%, as compared to the first quarter of 2020.
We believe that a vibrant resell market for homes in our communities demonstrates the benefits of the consistent reinvestment in our properties, creating equity value for our homeowners and increasing the overall value of our portfolio.
Moving on to Safe Harbor.
During the quarter, the marina portfolio contributed over $31.4 million to total NOI.
The marinas are performing ahead of our underwriting, and the team continues to source acquisitions in irreplaceable locations, which for the first quarter, include two marinas on Islamorada in the Florida Keys and two marinas on Martha's Vineyard.
We are optimistic about the underlying trends we are observing across all of our business lines.
With the vaccination rate increasing across the country, we are anticipating accelerated growth in our RV and marina businesses.
We are well positioned to see follow-through of this quarter's outperformance and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.
Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail.
For the first quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.26, 3.3% above the prior year and $0.09 ahead of the top-end of our first quarter guidance range.
During and subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired $183 million of operating properties comprised of two manufactured home communities, six RV resorts and four marinas.
To support our growth activities, we completed a $1.1 billion equity raise, representing approximately 8 million shares of our common stock.
To date, we have settled 4 million shares, receiving $538 million in net proceeds, which was used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility.
We expect to settle the remaining 4 million shares no later than March 2022.
We ended the first quarter with $4.4 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.4% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.5 years.
As of March 31, we had $105 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.1 times.
On a pro forma basis, including the estimated full year EBITDA contribution from Safe Harbor and other acquisitions, our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio is in the low-5 times.
As a result of our outperformance during the quarter, we are raising our core FFO expectations for full-year 2021 to a range of $5.92 per share to $6.08 per share.
We expect core FFO for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.57 per share to $1.63 per share.
We are also revising full year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%.
As Gary mentioned earlier, we enhanced our financial disclosures this quarter.
The addition of the marina portfolio gave us the opportunity to reenvision how we report key aspects of our business.
To provide more insight into each of our business lines, we now have a same community schedule which details performance by our MH and RV portfolio separately.
Additionally, our same community revenues now include rental home program revenue and vacation rental home revenues.
So the entire payment for these rentals is now included in real property revenue.
Same community property operating expense now includes the related costs for these rental home programs.
We are also netting all utility income against utility expense, which provides a better view on what Sun's direct utility costs are since the majority of these costs are passed through to our customers.
We have retained our legacy disclosures for our rental program and have added a new page on the marina portfolio.
Please see the 2021 summary of reporting changes document, which is contained in the Investor Relations section of our website for additional information and an illustration of these changes.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining us today are Pedro Heilbron, Chief Executive Officer of Copa Holdings; and Jose Montero, our Chief Financial Officer.
First, Pedro will start by going over our second quarter highlights, followed by Jose, who will discuss our financial results.
Copa Holdings' financial reports have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
In today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures.
Many of these are discussed in our annual report filed with the SEC.
To them, as always, my utmost respect and admiration.
As many of you know, Raul Pascual decided to take on a new professional challenge and left the company earlier last month.
We're very grateful for the more than 15 years of outstanding work he dedicated to Copa.
Daniel has over 12 years of experience with the company in many areas, including airports, scheduling and most recently, fleet and network planning.
We're very confident in Daniel's ability to lead our Investor Relations group.
As you may remember, in our last earnings call, we discussed two diverging themes happening in Latin America.
On the one hand, some countries, including Panama, were experiencing a downward trend in infection rate, which led to fewer travel restrictions and an improved demand environment.
On the other hand, several other countries continued to struggle with the virus, which led many of them to reimpose air travel restrictions and/or new health requirements affecting demand for international travel.
As of today, the story has not changed much.
Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, several countries have maintained and, in some cases, increased travel restrictions, which has affected our ability to reinstate capacity.
On the other hand, markets without significant restrictions, mainly to and from the U.S. and certain leisure destinations have continued to recover, which has allowed us to increase capacity quarter-over-quarter while also growing load factors.
In the month of June, we successfully transitioned our Hub of the Americas in Panama back to a six bank connecting structure, which enables cost efficiencies and lets us continue adding back frequencies and destinations.
Moreover, we started to reactivate some of the aircrafts sent to temporary storage during 2020.
Going forward, we assume ongoing vaccination efforts will have a positive effect on COVID-19 infection rates in the region, which we expect will lead to the relaxation of travel restrictions and a faster demand recovery, supporting the capacity deployment for the second half of the year.
Now I'll highlight some of our second quarter results.
In terms of capacity, we reached 48% of second quarter 2019 ASMs compared to 39% in the first quarter.
Load factor came in at 77%, which is an improvement of eight percentage points compared to the first quarter.
Revenues increased by 64% over the previous quarter to $304 million, as a result of the additional capacity, higher load factors and improved yields.
The additional capacity also allowed us to reduce our ex fuel CASM from $0.085 in Q1 to $0.076 in Q2.
We reported an operating profit of $8.7 million in the quarter.
Excluding a $10.4 million passenger revenue adjustment the company would have reported an operating loss of $1.7 million.
Cash accretion averaged $21 million per month, which was better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger sales in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion and total liquidity of over $1.6 billion.
In terms of our operations and despite the complexity imposed by the multiple biosafety protocols, we're pleased to report an on-time performance of 92% for the quarter and a flight completion factor of 99.5%, which again, places us among the best in the world and is a true testament to our employees' continuous commitment to providing a world-class product to our passengers.
Turning now to Wingo.
We can report that it's now operating six 737-800s compared to the four it operated pre...
...ctor came in at an average of 77% for the quarter.
We reported a net profit of $28.1 million or $0.66 per share.
Excluding special items, we would have reported a net loss of $16.2 million or a loss of $0.38 per share.
Special items for the quarter are comprised mainly of an unrealized mark-to-market gain of $33.9 million, related to the company's convertible notes issued in 2020 and $10.4 million in revenues related to unredeemed tickets, which corresponds to sales made during 2019 and early 2020.
We reported a quarterly operating profit, which came in at $8.7 million.
On an adjusted basis, not including the $10.4 million in unredeemed ticket revenues, we had an adjusted operating loss of $1.7 million for the quarter.
It's worth noting that we achieved this result while operating at 48% of our pre-COVID capacity.
Unit costs, excluding fuel for the second quarter came in better than the first quarter at $0.076 per ASM, driven by quarter-over-quarter capacity growth as well as our continued focus on maintaining the savings achieved during the past year.
We continue with our cost savings initiatives, and we are targeting to achieve our unit cost below $0.06 once we reach 100% of our pre-COVID-19 capacity.
Aside from our cost performance, our operating results for the quarter were driven primarily by our yields, which at $0.119 on an underlying basis, came in 1% better than those in Q2 2019.
We also achieved cash accretion of approximately $21 million per month for the quarter, which is ahead of our expectation and driven mainly by increased sales during the period as well as some timing of operational cash outflows.
As a reminder for our cash accretion measure, we exclude all extraordinary proceeds from asset sales but include capex and the payment of our financial obligations.
I'm going to spend some time now discussing our balance sheet and liquidity.
As of the end of the second quarter, we had assets of close to $4.1 billion and our cash, short and long-term investments ended at $1.3 billion.
We also ended the quarter with an aggregate amount of $345 million in unutilized committed credit facilities, which added to our cash brought our total liquidity to more than $1.6 billion.
In terms of debt, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in debt and lease liabilities, similar levels to the ones reported for the end of the first quarter.
Turning now to our fleet.
During the second quarter, we finalized the sale and delivery of three Embraer-190s.
And in the month of July, we delivered the last remaining Embraer-190 aircraft in our fleet.
During the month of July, we also entered into an agreement for the sale of six 737-700s and decided to keep in our fleet the remaining six 737-700s.
We ended the second quarter with 81 aircraft.
68 737-800s and 13 737-MAX9s.
In these figures, we include our 737-800s that were sent to temporary storage during 2020.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive two more 737 MAX 9s and considering we are now keeping the six 737-700s, we expect to end the year with a total of 89 aircraft.
As to our outlook for the rest of 2021, we're still in an uncertain unpredictable demand and operating environment.
And as such, we will not be providing full year guidance.
However, based on preliminary results for the month of July, and the current state of the demand environment and air trial restrictions that can provide the following outlook for the third quarter of 2021.
We -- We expect capacity to be approximately 70% of Q3 2019 levels at about $4.5 billion ASMs, revenues to be approximately 58% of Q3 2019 levels at about $415 million.
We expect our CASM ex fuel to be approximately $0.66, a decrease of 14% versus the second quarter.
Given these operating assumptions, an all-in fuel price of $2.15 per gallon, as well as the incremental capex that we will incur during the quarter to reactivate our fleet, we expect to be cash neutral for the third quarter.
And with that, we'll open the call to some questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 danaher.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.
The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.
We may also describe certain products and devices which, have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets.
As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we're presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales.
References to core revenue growth, including Cytiva sales, and the calculation of period to period sales growth.
And we really appreciate you joining us on the call today.
Our team delivered another outstanding results in our third quarter with over 20% core revenue growth, nearly 40% adjusted earnings-per-share growth and strong free cash flow generation.
This well-rounded performance is a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team, who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day.
We highlighted our fantastic portfolio of market-leading franchises in highly attractive end markets, the exceptional team we have out on the field every day and how we differentiate with the Danaher Business System.
And we certainly saw this powerful combination in action during the third quarter as our results attest.
Now we also talked about our sustainability efforts, and just last week, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report.
This year's report reflect the measurable progress we've made across the three pillars of our sustainability program, which are innovation, people, and the environment, and how we use the Danaher Business System to execute on this increasingly important strategic priority.
Now I hope you all get a chance to read through the report and learn more about the important work that we're doing across Danaher to positively impact the world around us for generations to come.
So, with that, let's turn to our third quarter results.
Our sales were $7.2 billion and we delivered 20.5% core revenue growth with portfoliowide strength led by Diagnostics and Life Sciences.
Geographically, high growth markets grew approximately 25% and developed markets were up nearly 20%.
In fact, revenue in each of our three largest markets, North America, Western Europe and China was up approximately 20% or more in the quarter.
Our gross profit margin increased by 550 basis points to 60.3% primarily due to higher sales volume, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix, and the impact of prior-year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021.
Now, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.39 and were up 39% compared to 2020 and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $5.2 billion, which is up 46.5% year-over-year.
We continue to accelerate organic growth investments across the entire portfolio and increased our research and development spend by approximately 30% year-over-year.
At our Investor Day recently, we highlighted how we use DBS growth tools and processes to accelerate innovation and bring more impactful solutions to our customers faster.
In fact, recently launched products like the SCIEX Zeno 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500 and Beckman Life Sciences' CytoFLEX SRT benchtop cell sorter are just a few great examples of how we're driving market share gains through proprietary innovation and enhancing our growth trajectory going forward.
We're also making substantial investments to expand production capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and at Cepheid.
Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand and driving meaningful share gains.
But they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see significant runway ahead, given the underlying structural growth drivers in the sectors they serve.
And we ...
...o across Cytiva and Pall Biotech is the broadest offering in the industry with leading position in upstream and downstream applications.
And we further support our customers with best-in-class scientific services partnering to solve their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale.
And our global reach enabled us to reliably and consistently meet our customers' needs.
Now in addition to the industrywide opportunities in biologics and genomic-based medicines, we continue to see significant demand related to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics.
Our customers are working to address emerging variants and increased global supply, and given that only about a third of the global population has been vaccinated, we believe we'll see durable growth in this biopharma segment for the foreseeable future.
We continue to expect about $2 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021.
And since we spoke at our Investor Day, we now expect to enter 2022 with approximately $2 billion in COVID-related backlog versus our previous expectation of $1.5 billion of backlog.
And moving to the clinical diagnostic market, non-COVID testing volumes are essentially back to pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening, and other elective procedures.
In molecular diagnostics, strong global demand persists for Cepheid point-of-care PCR respiratory testing as a result of the Delta variant and outbreaks, along with lower vaccine vaccination rates in many regions.
As I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 16 million respiratory tests during the third quarter and we now expect to ship approximately 55 million tests in 2021 versus our prior expectation of 50 million.
Now as we head into the traditional respiratory virus season, we're hearing from customers that they expect this to be a much more active season than last year's.
In preparation, their preference is for our 4-in-1 combination test, so we're seeing an uptick in demand for those cartridges, particularly given the recent outbreaks of RSV across the U.S. Cepheid's 4-in-1 test was also recently approved with a third gene target for SARS-CoV-2 detection, ensuring it can continue to accurately detect future COVID-19 viral mutations and reinforcing Cepheid's competitive advantage in the respiratory testing market.
Now moving to the applied market.
Customer activity has largely rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates across both consumables and equipment.
In the global municipal market, consumables demand remains solid and the pace of instrument oriented project activity continues to pick up with the improving funding environment and broad return to work.
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year.
We expect to deliver fourth quarter core revenue growth in the low to mid teens range, with high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a mid to high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind.
Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall through of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter, a similar level to what we achieved in the third quarter.
Now for the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver more than 20% core tailwind and our base business will each contribute more than 10% to our 2021 core revenue growth rate.
So to wrap up, we're proud to deliver another terrific result here in the third quarter.
Our performance is a testament to the power of our unique portfolio, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System.
And this unique combination differentiates Danaher today and it reinforces our opportunities ahead for sustainable long-term outperformance.
So with that, back over to you, Matt.
That concludes our formal comments.
Emma, we're now ready to take questions.

References to core revenue growth exclude Cytiva sale in the calculation of period to period sales growth.
We appreciate you joining us on the call today.
We're very pleased with our strong start to the year with another terrific results in the second quarter.
We saw broad-based strength across the portfolio, which helped us deliver over 30% core revenue growth, more than 70% adjusted earnings-per-share growth and outstanding free cash flow generation.
This well-rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day.
During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through significant high impact organic growth investments and enhanced our portfolio with strategic growth accelerating acquisition.
We prioritize innovation across Danaher and increased our production capabilities, all of which we believe contributed to the market share gains in several of our businesses.
We also announced our pending acquisition of Aldevron which will expand our presence into the fast-growing and important frontier of genomic medicine.
Putting it all together, we believe the combination of our leading portfolio and DBS driven execution differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance.
So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results.
Our sales were $7.2 billion and we delivered core revenue growth of 31.5% with strong contributions from all three of our reporting segment.
Geographically, high growth markets grew nearly 35% and developed markets were up more than 25%.
Revenue in each of our three largest markets, North America, Western Europe and China was up 30% or more in the quarter.
Our gross profit margin increased by 710 basis points to 60.9% primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix and the impact of prior year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021.
Our operating profit margin increased to 27.8% including 775 basis points of core operating margin expansion, primarily as a result of higher gross margin and continued lower operating expense as travel and other related costs remains below pre-pandemic levels.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.46 were up 71% compared to 2020.
We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up over 40% year-over-year.
In June, we announced our intention to acquire Aldevron a producer of high quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and protein serving academic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers.
The addition of Aldevron will expand our capabilities into the important field of genomic medicine where we're seeing the accelerated adoption of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and gene editing technology.
We anticipate Aldevron will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels as we expect the business to generate $500 million of revenue in 2022, with more than 20% annual revenue growth and a strong margin profile.
We look forward to welcoming this incredibly talented and innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes.
In addition to announcing the Aldevron acquisition we also accelerated several organic growth investments across the portfolio.
One of our core values at Danaher is innovation defines our future and we have made a significant commitment t...
...related backlog.
These assumptions do not include the potential contribution from booster shot or an expansion of availability to populations under 12-year-old due to the level of uncertainty around each of these scenarios.
Given the growing numbers of drug being developed and the increasing scientific sophistication required to discover and manufacture these complex therapies, customers are looking to partner with vendors who can reliably supply them solutions for their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale.
Our comprehensive bio-processing portfolio and scientific expertise positions us well to do just that and we're confident, our proactive investments in innovation and capacity will help us meet this growing customer demand now and far into the future.
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screenings and other elective procedures.
In molecular diagnostics, while PCR, respiratory testing volumes in the US have declined we're seeing persistent demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care.
Outside of the US, which makes up approximately half of Cepheid's revenue, we continue to see strong demand for our testing as vaccination rates lag and emerging variants drive outbreak.
Now, as I mentioned earlier we shipped approximately 14 million respiratory tests during the second quarter, up from 10 million shipped in the first quarter and we now expect to ship approximately 50 million tests in 2021.
Looking ahead with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point of care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic and given Cepheid's leading positioning around speed, accuracy and the ease of use workflow advantages we believe will continue to gain market share.
The combination of these market share gains, the expansion of Cepheid's leading global installed base and the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market, create significant opportunities ahead for broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point of care molecular testing solutions.
Moving to the applied markets, we're seeing a continuation of the steady improvement over the first half of the year.
Customer activity is accelerating in line with broader economic activity, which we see in healthy order rates for consumables and increasing investments equipment.
Across municipal markets globally consumables demand remains solid as customers continue to test and treat water and instrument-oriented project activity is accelerating with the improving funding environment.
Now, let's look ahead to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year.
We expect to deliver third quarter core revenue growth in the mid to high teens range.
We anticipate high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID related revenue tailwind.
Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall through of approximately 40% in the third quarter and for the remainder of 2021.
For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver approximately 20% core revenue growth.
We anticipate that COVID related revenue tailwinds will be an approximately 10% contribution to the core revenue growth rate and in our base business we now expect that core revenue will be up 10% for the full year, an increase from our prior expectation of high single-digit.
So, to wrap up we've had a great start to the year and we see meaningful opportunities across Danaher to build upon this outstanding performance.
Our second quarter results reiterate the power of our portfolio and our exceptional team, a unique combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable, long-term outperformance.
And with that, back to you, Matt.
That concludes our formal comments.

 Actual results may differ.
Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures.
Sales of $2.2 billion were up from $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share of $3.20 was up significantly from $1.30 in the second quarter of last year and pension adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.05.
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a backlog of approximately $48 billion, of which approximately $24 billion is funded.
And Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks.
Shifting to activities in Washington, we are pleased that the congressional markup process for fiscal year 2022 has begun in earnest, following the release of the President's budget request in May.
Of note, the budget requests continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet and supported funding for CVN 80 and CVN 81 forward class aircraft carriers, two Virginia-class submarines, one DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and LHA 9.
We were also pleased that a second DDG 51 class destroyer was included as the number one priority on the Navy's unfunded requirements list for fiscal year 2022, and we look forward to working closely with the Congress during the FY '22 markup process to urge support for the second DDG and other critical priorities, including the efficient production of amphibious warships.
In closing, slide four provides some key takeaways from the recently announced agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology.
The team is preparing for closing of the transaction, and we are very excited about the addition of Alion to the HII family.
Alion is a perfect complement to our existing capabilities in the technology-driven defense and federal solutions space.
The solutions and products they provide are directly in line with the strategic focus that we have articulated for our Technical Solutions business and it enhances our technical capabilities and customer access in high-growth national security markets, including C5ISR, military training and simulation and next-generation technologies and solutions.
We firmly believe that Alion offers significant growth potential and represents an investment in capabilities that support the evolving DoD national security requirements, which, in turn, are expected to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
This was another solid operational quarter, and I'm very pleased with the consistent progress being achieved across our shipbuilding and technical solutions programs.
With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter.
At Ingalls, the team received a contract modification from the U.S. Navy for $107 million to provide additional long-lead time material and advanced procurement activities for amphibious assault ship LHA 9, which increases current funding on this ship to approximately $490 million.
Regarding the potential bundled acquisition of LHA nine with LPD 32 and 33, discussions are ongoing with the customer.
We believe that a bundled acquisition continues to be the most cost-effective method, a procurement of these critically important ships.
In addition, Ingalls was awarded a contract with a potential total value of $724 million over seven years for planning yard services in support of a variety of in-service amphibious class ships, including the LPD 17 San Antonio class and LHA six America class.
Shifting to program status, LHA eight Bougainville is making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction with cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations.
On the DDG program, the team successfully launched the first Flight III Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer, DDG 125, Jack H Lucas in June.
And DDG 121, Frankie Pet...
...the tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to research and development tax credits recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.3% of revenues resulting in free cash flow of $23 million.
This compares to cash from operations of $201 million and $75 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $126 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $12 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits.
During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million and repurchased approximately 95,000 shares at a cost of $20 million.
Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $670 million increased $48 million or 7.7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues on the NSC program.
Ingalls operating income of $80 million and margin of 11.9% in the quarter were up from the second quarter of 2020, driven by the recognition of a capital investment related incentive for the DDG program that was recognized in DDG-125 as well as higher risk retirement from the LHA 8, LP 28 and LP 29 ships.
Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased $241 million or 21.5% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both the submarine and aircraft carry construction.
Newport News operating income of $76 million and margin of 5.6% in the quarter were up year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts related to the Virginia class performance and COVID in the prior year period.
Now to Technical Solutions on slide 10.
Technical Solutions revenues of $237 million in the quarter decreased 25.9% from the same period last year mainly due to the divestiture of the oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard through a joint venture in the first quarter of this year as well as lower volumes in unmanned systems, partially offset by increases in volumes in the Defense and Federal Solutions.
Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million in the quarter compares to income of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
This increase was primarily driven by higher equity income related to our ship repair partnership with Titan as well as improved performance at Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services, partially offset by lower volumes in the unmanned systems.
Finally, a perspective on the outlook of the shipbuilding for the remaining part of the year.
We continue to see limited opportunities for risk retirements in the third quarter with the remainder of the milestones weighted toward the end of the year.
Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect that the shipbuilding margin for the full year will be in the 7.5% to 8% range.
We continue to expect the Alion acquisition will close in the coming weeks and that we will incur approximately $25 million of onetime pre-tax transaction and financing-related expenses in 2021.
We completed the syndication of the term loan component of the acquisition funding earlier this week, and more details of the specifics are available in the 10-Q.
We will provide a more comprehensive update on our 2021 outlook for Technical Solutions on our third quarter call following the closing of the acquisition.
As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is a particular note during the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when the length severity of the crisis and results of economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict.
For information on some of the factors that can affect our estimates, I urge you to read our 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021, and Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, customer-mandated timing of shipments, weather conditions, political and economic environment, government regulation and taxation, changes in exchange rates and interest rates, industry consolidation and evolution and changes in market structure or sources.
Finally, some of the information I have for you today is based on unaudited allocations and is subject to reclassification.
In an effort to provide useful information to investors, our comments today may include non-GAAP financial measures.
We are off to a good start for fiscal year 2022.
Results for our tobacco operations segment improved on higher African carryover tobacco shipments and a favorable tobacco product mix in the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020.
Our Ingredients Operations segment, which includes our October 2020 acquisition of Silva International delivered very strong performance in the three months ended June 30, 2021.
It is exciting to begin to see the positive outcome from our capital allocation strategy, which we put in place in May 2018 with the goal of ensuring that we are well positioned for the future.
investments in our tobacco business have enabled us to expand the supply chain services we provide our customers and to create footprint rationalization efficiencies, and we are seeing the returns from those investments in our results.
Our plant-based ingredients platform is coming together nicely.
We continue to believe we are on track for our ingredients businesses to meet our previously announced goal of representing 10% to 20% of our results in fiscal year 2022.
We are excited about the performance of our investments thus far, and we'll continue to see prudent strategic opportunities to enhance our businesses and return value to our shareholders.
Turning to our results.
Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, was $6.4 million or $0.26 per diluted share compared with $7.3 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
Consolidated revenues of $350 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, increased by $34.2 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2021.
The increase was mainly due to the addition of the business acquired in October 2020 in the Ingredients Operations segment, partly offset by modestly lower comparative leaf tobacco sales volumes.
Turning to the segments.
The first fiscal quarter is historically a slow quarter for our tobacco businesses.
Operating income for the Tobacco Operations segment increased by $3.8 million to $8.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
Although tobacco sales volumes were down modestly, segment results improved on carryover shipments, product mix and increased supply chain services to customers in the quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year.
Carryover crop shipments were higher in Africa in the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year, in part due to some shipments that were delayed from fiscal year 2021.
Brazil experienced an improved product mix on lower volumes in the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year when high volumes of lower-margin carryover crops shift.
Carryover tobacco crop shipments were lower and product mix was less favorable in Asia in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2021.
And in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we also provided increased supply chain services to customers for wrapper tobacco compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the tobacco operations segment were lower in the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to June 30, 2020, primarily on higher recoveries of value-added taxes and advances to suppliers.
Operating income for the Ingredients Operations segment was $4.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to an operating loss of $0.7 million for the comparable quarter in the prior fiscal year.
Results for the segment improved year-over-year on the inclusion of the October 2020 Silva acquisition.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, our Ingredients Operations saw strong volumes in both human and pet food categories as well as some rebound in demand from sectors that have been suffering during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year on the addition of the acquired business.
Our tobacco and plant-based ingredients businesses are both currently performing according to our plans.
Like other industries, we are seeing some logistical constraints around the world with regard to vessel and container availability stemming from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
However, at this time, we do not know what significant such constraints may have on shipment timing or our results.
We are continuing to monitor these and other pandemic-related conditions, which affect our operations.
And lastly, as part of our ongoing efforts to set high standards of social and environmental performance to support a sustainable supply chain, we have developed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are consistent with the levels required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, limiting global warming to well below two degrees centigrade above preindustrial levels.
Our targets were recently approved by the science-based targets initiative and reflect our commitment to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.

 Such factors may include, without limitation, the following: impact from pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; dependence on the automotive, appliance, commercial vehicle, computer and communications industries; dependence on a small number of large customers, including two large automotive customers; recognition of goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges; costs associated with restructuring activities; international trade disputes resulting in tariffs and our ability to mitigate tariffs; timing, quality, cost of new program launches; ability to withstand price pressure, including pricing reductions; failure to attract and retain qualified personnel; ability to successfully market and sell Dabir Surfaces products; currency fluctuations; customary risks related to conducting global operations; costs associated with environmental, health and safety regulations; ability to withstand business interruptions; ability to successfully benefit from acquisitions and divestitures; investment in programs prior to the recognition of revenue; dependence on the availability and price of materials; dependence on our supply chain; judgments related to accounting for tax positions; income tax rate fluctuations; ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes; breaches to our information technology systems; ability to avoid design or manufacturing defects; ability to compete effectively; ability to protect our intellectual property; success of recent acquisitions and/or our ability to implement and profit from new applications of the acquired technology; ability to manage our debt levels and any restrictions thereunder; and impact to interest expense from the replacement or modification of LIBOR.
I'm joined today by Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer.
Let's begin on Slide 4 with the business highlights from the first quarter.
I'll start with the situation with COVID-19.
I continue to be proud of our employees' incredible commitment to Methode and to supporting our efforts to provide a safe work environment.
All of our facilities have remained open to some degree through this challenging period and most of our hourly employees have returned to a full work week.
Our offices have systematically begun to reopen, but we're also still making prudent use of work-from-home for our office staff.
We anticipate that we will see some level of headwind risk and uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the fiscal year.
However, as I stressed last quarter, we will continue to invest in our business for long-term growth.
Turning to the business performance.
While the quarter was clearly down due to the pandemic, we saw significant rebound in automotive demand in the latter half of the quarter.
As you recall, most of the auto OEMs were effectively shut down in the first half of the quarter.
And when we reported our fourth quarter results, we were concerned about the stability of OEM production schedules based on the pandemic circumstances.
Methode's first quarter sales decreased 29.3%.
Our net income decreased 26.9%.
And our diluted earnings per share decreased 28% for the fiscal quarter ended August 1st of 2020.
The resulting decremental net income margin of 10% was helped by cost reductions and operational efficiency initiatives.
The net income in the quarter was also aided by discrete tax benefit of $7.8 million.
Adding back the discrete tax benefit, the decremental net income margin would have been 19%.
Ron will provide more detail on these tax items later.
Returning to the automotive business on Slide 6.
It was a particularly strong quarter for awards in EV and hybrid applications.
We received award of a total annual expected sales of approximately $30 million.
Given our ongoing strategy to cross-sell our technologies into the space, we now expect a high-single digit percentage of our fiscal 2021 consolidated sales to come from EV and hybrid programs.
This is an area where we are globally well positioned and we anticipate co...
... current COVID-19 environment.
In addition to the $3.4 million incurred in the first quarter from actions taken in the first quarter, the company currently expects an additional expense of $2 million in the second quarter from those first quarter actions.
The company may take additional actions in future period based upon business conditions as required.
Moving to slide 11.
Net income was $20.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as opposed to $28.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20.
The main drivers between the fiscal years were lower sales due to COVID, a favorable change in discrete tax items of $9.1 million, an unfavorable change in restructuring expense of $3.4 million and the receipt of $2.9 million of foreign government assistance due to COVID.
Shifting to EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, fiscal first quarter '21 EBITDA was $29.3 million versus $50.3 million in the same period last year.
EBITDA was negatively impacted by the significant headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic and included $3.4 million of restructuring expense.
A few other financial items to review.
Year-over-year depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal '21 to $12.1 million from $11.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20.
In the first quarter of fiscal '21, we invested approximately $11.6 million of capex as compared to $13.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20.
The first quarter investment represents an approximate $45 million run rate for the current fiscal year, but it is too early to tell if the rate will be maintained throughout the remainder of the year.
However, we have a strong balance sheet and intend to utilize it during this COVID impacted year to make continued investment in our businesses to grow them organically in the future.
In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for inorganic growth.
Our intent is to come out of the COVID pandemic stronger than we were when we went into the crisis by judiciously using our strong balance sheet to our long-term advantage.
We had an income tax benefit of $5.1 million as compared to a tax expense of $7.3 million in the fiscal '20 first quarter.
The main driver of the benefit in fiscal '21 was $7.8 million of discrete tax items recorded during the quarter, mainly due to investment tax credits and other credits earned in foreign jurisdictions.
In the fiscal first quarter of '20 -- fiscal year '20, there was a discrete tax expense of $1.3 million.
Without the discrete tax items, the fiscal '21 first quarter effective tax rate would have been 17.2% as compared to 16.6% in the same period last year.
As shown on Slide 12, we did leverage gross debt by $2.3 million in the first quarter.
Since our acquisition of Grakon when adjusting for the $100 million precautionary credit facility draw in March of 2020, we have reduced gross debt by nearly $108 million.
Net debt increased by $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the fiscal '20 year end.
We ended the first quarter with $211 million in cash, which includes $100 million precautionary draw on the credit facility in March.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is used for our bank covenants, is approximately 1.9.
This figure includes the impact of the precautionary $100 million draw.
Without the draw, the ratio would have been approximately 1.3.
Let's move to Slide 13.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, which is now defined as cash provided from operating activities minus capex as opposed to prior to fiscal '21 where it was defined as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capex.
For the fiscal '21 first quarter, free cash flow was $4.8 million as compared to $5.9 million in fiscal '20.
As Don mentioned in his remarks, we are providing revenue guidance for the second quarter.
The revenue range for the second quarter will be between $230 million and $250 million.
Don, that concludes my comments.
Melinda, we're ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties.
Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings are up $125 million and net earnings are up $112 million.
Earnings per share are up $0.43.
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%.
The Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned.
Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million, or 14.3%, and operating earnings in Aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year-ago quarter.
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side.
However, operating margin is 20 basis more than anticipated, coupled with a somewhat lower share count.
This led to the earnings bit.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%.
Overall, margins are up 40 basis points.
The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%.
On the Aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins.
The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective.
Free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income.
Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income.
In summary, we enjoyed a very good growth in the defense businesses in the quarter and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board.
The year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year and enable us to raise our forecast for the full year, which I will share with you at the end of these remarks.
Let me put the aerospace results in some recent historical context so as to put our performance into our perspective where it can be understood.
As you recall that in April of last year, we told you we were cutting production as the result of certain supply chain issues.
It subsequently became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID-19 that resulted in additional cuts to production.
Those production cuts were implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point this quarter.
You may also recall that I told you last quarter that the second quarter would be the most challenging for Gulfstream because of these preplanned production cuts.
On the good news side of the story, we had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half.
In short, you will see more deliveries, revenue and operating earnings in the second half as a result.
With that, let me turn to the aerospace results in the quarter.
Aerospace had revenue of $1.6 billion and operating earnings of $195 million, with a 12% operating margin.
Revenue was $352 million less than the year-ago quarter or 17.8% as a result of fewer planned aircraft deliveries.
On the other hand, operating earnings are up $36 million or 22.6% on a 390 basis point improvement in margins.
From a pure operating perspective, we did very well.
From an order perspective, the quarter border long is spectacular.
In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1.
Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1, even stronger if expressed in unit terms.
This is the strongest order quarter in number of units in quite some time.
It was all the more remarkable in that it did not include any fleet sales.
As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter.
The pipeline th...
...ains in the range of 2.5% of sales.
We also paid $336 million in dividends and spent approximately $600 million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares.
That brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share.
We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.
We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May.
We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity phasing purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year.
After all this, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of just under $3 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, consistent with the end of last quarter and down more than $900 million from this time last year.
As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $109 million, down from $132 million in the second quarter of 2020.
That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $232 million, down slightly from $239 million for the same period in 2020.
We repaid another $500 million of notes on July 15, as we continue to bring down our debt balance this year and beyond.
At this point, we expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $425 million.
The tax rate in the quarter and the first half at 16.3% is consistent with the full-year expectation.
So no change to our outlook of 16% for the year.
Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole.
As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the aerospace group led the way with a twice book-to-bill, while combat and technologies each recorded a book-to-bill of 1:1 on solid year-over-year revenue growth.
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.2 billion.
That's up over 8% over this time last year.
And total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts, was $130.3 billion.
Finally, a quick note on the operating results in the technologies group.
You'll recall in the second quarter of last year, we recognized a loss of approximately $40 million on an international contract that resulted from scheduled delays caused by COVID-related travel restrictions.
We formally closed out this matter with the customer this quarter.
And despite the fact that our activity on the contract has been dormant for over a year, the accounting rules required us to reverse approximately $45 million of previously recognized revenue in the quarter.
Without this reversal, the technologies group would have seen organic growth of 6.4% in the quarter.
Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast.
The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat.
In our aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4%, which is 10 basis points below what we previously forecasted.
This will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings.
There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year.
With respect to the defense businesses, combat systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin.
So total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin number around 14.6%.
Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin.
So annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%.
Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast but adds 30 basis points of operating margin.
So annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%.
So on a companywide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion and an overall operating margin around 10.6%.
This rolls up to earnings per share around $11.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today, we will discuss our operational and financial results for the three months ended March 31st, 2020.
Avi Goldin, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow my discussion with a deeper dive into the quarter's financial results.
My remarks today will focus on our operational results.
I will also review the effects of the restrictions imposed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had its first full month of impact in April following the quarter close.
Finally, I'll touch on some of our promising growth opportunities.
Genie Energy achieved very strong first quarter results.
Robust growth in our customer base and strong electricity margins here in the US helped us achieve record levels of revenue and gross profit.
Our global customer base surpassed both the 400,000 RCE and 500,000 meter milestones, powered by expansion in both our domestic markets and overseas books.
Here in the US, Genie Retail Energy added a net 20,000 RCEs and 15,000 meters during the quarter.
The RCE over meter ratio has increased from our historical levels, reflecting our recent focus on adding high-quality, high consumption meters.
GRE closed the quarter serving 330,000 RCEs comprising 384,000 meters.
Overseas, where more of our customer base resides in apartments and average consumption is significantly lower, GRE International added 7,000 RCEs and 20,000 meters to close the quarter serving 72,000 RCEs comprising 148,000 meters.
By March 31st, we had increased our global customer base to 401,000 RCEs served and 532,000 meters.
During the trailing 12 months, we increased our RCEs served by 20% or just over 68,000 and increased global meters served by 33% or 133,000 meters.
Part of our success, growing our customer base is attributable to improvements in domestic customer churn profile that we have achieved over the past couple of years.
We have put into place initiatives across our business to mitigate churn, including customer service processes, acquisition and offering mix.
Customer churn in the first quarter decreased again to 4.7% per month from 5.3% per month in the first quarter of 2019.
For additional perspective, our average churn over the past 12 months is 5.4% versus 6.6% in the 12 months proceeding.
At Genie Energy Services, our Prism Solar unit delivered most of its outstanding orders to JP Morgan Chase.
As the solar market continues to evolve, we've begun to rightsize overhead and streamline Prism's operations.
Diversity, meanwhile, continues to progress toward profitability after delivering the most successful year in its history in 2019.
At GOGAS, we still hope to complete the final well test in Northern Israel, as early as the close of the second quarter.
We have reduced cost and overhead to the bare minimum in the interim.
Turning now to the impact of the coronavirus.
Due to the timing of the impact, COVID-19 and associated public health measures did not significantly affect customer acquisition activities this quarter.
We suspended all door-to-door customer acquisition toward the end of March, at about the same time as most, if not all, other retail providers who use that channel.
We then pivoted to focus more resources on our other acquisition channels.
In April, after the quarter closed, the near-term impact of the pandemic became clear.
With quarantines in place in all of our markets, we nevertheless had a strong month highlighted by three developments.
First, we benefited from an increase in per-meter electricity consumption, compared to the seasonally adjusted averages.
Residential customers who comprise the great majority of our book are spending more time at home and consequently using more electricity.
Second, suspension of door-to-door customer acquisition across all of our geographic markets reduced our customer acquisition expense in April.
Door-to-door is typically our most expensive acquisition channel in the US and the alternative channels that we have transitioned to have lower costs.
And finally, because one of the most pot...
...icantly impact our first quarter financial results.
Consolidated revenue in the first quarter increased $17.4 million to $104.1 million.
$12.7 million of the increase was contributed by our Genie Energy Services division.
Revenue jumped to $18 million on the fulfillment of outstanding solar panel orders by our Prism Solar subsidiary.
Going forward, we do not anticipate comparable order volumes or revenue.
And as Michael indicated, we are taking steps to reduce costs and position that business for the future.
Genie Retail Energy contributed $79.1 million in revenue, an increase of $2.6 million, compared to the year ago quarter.
Robust growth in our electric meter customer base over the past 12 months drove a 17% increase in kilowatt hours sold, more than offsetting a slight decrease in per unit revenue.
This was partially offset by a decline in revenue contribution from the gas book as we experienced lower consumption and pricing per therm.
At Genie Retail Energy International, revenue totaled $7 million, an increase of $2.1 million from the year ago quarter.
The increase reflects customer base expansion at both Lumo and Finland and Genie Japan.
And its results of operations are not consolidated in our revenue, gross profit or SG&A.
Consolidated gross profit in the first quarter increased $3.3 million to $28.9 million, also a record for the company.
GRE contributed $27.6 million of that total, an increase of $2.9 million from the year ago quarter, predominantly reflecting the increase in kilowatt hours sold, a modest increase in margin per kilowatt hour and a decrease in cost per therm sold.
Increased rates of customer acquisition at GRE drove an increase in consolidated SG&A expense to $19.5 million in the first quarter, $3.7 million higher than the year ago period.
Equity and the net loss of investees, which is comprised of our investments in Orbit Energy and our minority stake in Atid, decreased to $379,000 from $797,000 in the first quarter of 2019, as we made no additional investments in either entity during the quarter.
We now expect to provide Orbit with some additional growth capital later this year.
Our consolidated income from operations came in at $9.2 million, compared to $9.8 million in the year ago quarter, as the increase in customer acquisition expense narrowly offset the gain in gross profit.
Adjusted EBITDA was $10.3 million, effectively even with the year ago quarter.
EPS was $0.20 per diluted share, $0.01 below the year ago quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very strong.
At March 31st, we reported $157.2 million in total assets, including $36.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Liabilities totaled $71.5 million, of which just $2.2 million were non-current.
And net working capital totaled $51.5 million, an increase of $10.3 million from our total three months ago.
Cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $7 million in the year ago period.
The first quarter's operating cash flow is negatively impacted by the deliveries of Prism Solar, as we received payment for this activity upfront at the end of 2019, as well as the posting of cash collateral in support of certain hedge positions at GRE.
To wrap up, the strong financial results this quarter reflect the impact of our sustained investment in meter acquisition over the past year.
Looking ahead, and as Michael discussed, though the COVID-19 pandemic creates uncertainty, its impact is likely to be mixed in the near-term with certain factors, improving performance and others working against it.
While the long-term holds a greater uncertainty, we are confident that Genie is well positioned to continue to realize value for shareholders.
As Michael mentioned, supported by a strong outlook, the Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.085 a share, a 13% increase.
The indicative annual dividend rate is now $0.34 per share.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 All went very well, and we expect him fully back in just a few days.
I'm quite confident he is listening now, so I hope you're doing well, Boss.
We're here today to discuss third-quarter results and the expanding opportunities we see looking ahead.
As a result of the progress at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we have increased our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share.
We continue to prioritize three themes Andrew has discussed before which our -- before which are foundational to the growth of our enterprise.
First, unlocking the collaborative potential within Optum and UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of all.
Second, further developing our technology and data science platform to aid patient care and experience and to help the system run better.
Third, strengthening our consumer experience, capabilities and value.
I'll briefly highlight a couple of items for you.
You will likely have seen the CMS Medicare Advantage Star quality rating showing 95% of our UnitedHealthcare members will be in four star-rated plans or better for 2023, up from 78% for 2022 and a new high for our company.
Within Optum Care, on behalf of the many payers we serve, 99% of Medicare Advantage patients will be in four-star plans or better for 2023.
A second important highlight in the quarter.
We were encouraged by the ongoing strength in our employer and individual business, which has now grown by over 330,000 people this year with revenue up 7% year over year.
We continue to see active interest in our product innovations, such as our All Savers level-funded offering and are encouraged by our competitiveness in the market and momentum heading into '22.
We also elevated consumer connectivity by incorporating fitness offerings from industry-leading partners.
OptumHealth continues to build momentum as well.
Entering the open enrollment period for Medicare Advantage, we have more than 2.2 million people served under physician-led, fully accountable arrangements and expect '22 to be another year of record expansion in this key part of our portfolio.
Our broad home-based clinical care initiatives at Optum and UnitedHealthcare are central to improving near and longer-term health outcomes for people with medical, behavioral and social needs.
These efforts include Optum at Home, which delivers high-quality primary care services in the convenience of the home setting and support recovery after hospitalizations.
Seniors served by our home and community offering experienced a 14% lower rate of hospital admissions and about a 4% higher rate of physician encounters.
In addition to caring for people in their homes, we continue to expand capabilities in other optimal sites of care, including via digital means.
Optum is distinctively enabling virtual care for patients using their own primary care physicians and with behavioral clinicians.
For example, a physician engaging in a virtual visit with a patient can easily bring in a behavioral health professional for a real-time consultation.
UnitedHealthcare is using Optum's virtual capabilities to introduce a new suite of digital-first products, offering a near seamless experience between virtual and traditional primary, specialty, and urgent care.
We expect during 2022 and beyond to further build on these opportunities to connect and integrate multiple channels of care, simplify the experience for patients and providers and deliver quality care that is affordable and in the optimal setting.
Let me now go a little deeper in a few areas to give you an assessment of how we're doing on the themes I mentioned at the outset.
OptumInsight continues to drive better clinical and operational performance at the health system level.
Last week, we reached a new multiyear partnership with a leading and innovative health system, SSM Health, whose 40,000 employees, 33 hospitals and post-acute facilities and 300 physician clinics serve the people of Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Illinois.
OptumInsight b...
...he expectations we had nearly a year ago, we again saw elective care offsetting the impacts of higher case rates, much like previous cycles in the pandemic.
This quarter, there were approximately 60,000 COVID hospitalizations meaningfully above the second quarter, with the month of August peaking at nearly 30,000 and then declining in September.
Looking at specific business performance.
OptumHealth's third-quarter revenue and earnings increased 32% and 37%, respectively, year over year.
Revenue per consumer grew by 30%.
This reflects the increasing impact and number of value-based relationships within OptumCare.
The expansion of our in-home and community health platform, as well as the growing acuity of the needs we can serve.
OptumInsight's revenue grew 13% in the quarter, and earnings grew 15% as the revenue backlog increased by 12% to $22.3 billion.
We see overall business development sourcing and activity levels increasing, particularly with care provider customers, and for our software and analytics offerings.
OptumRx revenue and scripts grew 6% year over year and earnings, 5%.
OptumRx has seen both strong customer retention levels and sales success for the largely completed '22 selling season and early activity for '23.
The third quarter showed increasing member growth in our commercial offerings, particularly in employer-sponsored benefits.
Increased employment is a broad underlying contributor, but we are particularly encouraged by the growth we are achieving in our affordable consumer-centric offerings.
Medicare Advantage membership has grown 745,000 this year, inclusive of plans which serve dual special needs members.
We expect to add a total of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members.
The number of people served through managed Medicaid grew by more than 1 million members over last year as we began to serve people in new regions such as North Carolina, Kentucky and Indiana, and as state-based redetermination activities remained paused.
We were honored to begin serving people in the Missouri Medicaid expansion this month.
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with third-quarter cash flows from operations at $7.6 billion, or 1.8 times net income, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39%.
Now, with the close of the third quarter, your attention understandably turns to next year.
As is our custom, we will offer a few early observations here while reserving the majority of this conversation for our November 30 investor conference, which we hope will be held in person in New York.
Our businesses are both growing and operating well with strong momentum heading into next year.
While the pandemic-related impacts remain difficult to predict, given the current trends, we would expect a lower unfavorable COVID impact than experienced in '21.
Still, as the dramatic variation over the last 20 months has demonstrated to all, prudent management suggests we should offer an outlook respectful of the fact that the current situation is without precedent.
Taking all elements together at this distance, we see current analyst consensus as reasonably beginning to calibrate a '22 outlook.
Envisioning that consensus as being toward the upper end of our initial adjusted earnings per share outlook range, with the range being similar to that offered initially for '21.
The still untapped collaborative potential between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to benefit individuals in the system, the power of applied technology to advance care and service, improved opportunity in consumer health and experience and the passion of our people.
These and so many other elements lead us to believe our performance expectations for the years ahead remain fully supportive of our long-term 13% to 16% earnings-per-share growth outlook.
We look forward to going into more detail on both our view of '22 and the many years of growth beyond at our investor conference.
With that, operator, let's open it up for question.
One per caller, please.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Mr. John Bullock is attending a college graduation today and family comes first.
A year ago, like many other management teams, we all had the deer in the headlights there happening as a result of the pandemic.
Today, we see a very clear future for Darling Ingredients as our dedicated global team of 10,000 plus employees continue to execute our business strategy in a safe and efficient manner.
Our earnings for the first quarter of 2021 we're certainly energized by a rising commodity price environment, which undoubtedly had a positive impact and enabled Darling to report a record $284.8 million of combined EBITDA for the quarter.
The Feed segment's EBITDA was $124.4 million, which was $34 million better than the fourth quarter of 2020 and $54 million higher than the first quarter of 2020.
Protein and fat prices averaged in the range of 40% to 60% higher than the year ago period and have continued to move higher into the current period.
Our Food segment turned in a solid performance to start 2021 with an EBITDA of $46.4 million, which was approximately 18% higher than a year ago.
We continue to see solid growth in our collagen peptide sales and look forward to our biomedical products having an impact in the future on this segment's earnings.
In the Fuel segment, we continue to see solid results from our European bioenergy business, which reported another solid quarter, producing $20.5 million of EBITDA in Q1.
Diamond Green Diesel generated another outstanding quarter with a $2.77 EBITDA per gallon on 78 million gallons sold.
Darling's half was $108.2 million of EBITDA plus our bioenergy results produced a strong $128.7 million of combined EBITDA in Q1 for our Fuel segment.
We continue to experience a favorable commodity pricing environment as the U.S. economy recovers with more and more states lifting COVID restrictions.
As travel increases, we are seeing energy prices go higher as ultra low-sulfur diesel is trading above $2 a gallon in the NYMEX spot for the first time in a couple of years.
Higher levels of economic activity here and abroad we believe will support continued strength in the demand-driven commodity cycle that I'll discuss a little later on the call.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Brad to take us through the financials, then I'm going to come back and discuss the outlook and our increased guidance for 2021.
Net income for the first quarter of 2021 totaled $151.8 million or $0.90 per diluted share compared to net income of $85.5 million or $0.51 per diluted share for the 2020 first quarter.
Net sales increased 22.7% to $1.05 billion for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $852.8 million the first quarter of 2020.
Operating income increased 62% to $199.5 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $122.8 million for the first quarter of 2020.
The 62% increase in operating income was primarily due to the first quarter 2021 gross margin improving approximately $68 million over the prior year and increasing from 24.1% to 26.2%.
This is primarily the result of higher protein and fat prices in our Feed segment during the first quarter as Randy mentioned earlier.
Depreciation and amortization declined $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 when compared to the first quarter of 2020.
This reduction was due primarily to certain assets in our Food segment which became fully depreciated and amortized by the end of 2020.
SG&A increased slightly by $1.2 million in the quarter as compared to the prior year and there were $778,000 of additional restructuring and impairment charges related to the biodiesel facilities shutdown in the prior quarter.
Lastly, regarding the improved operating income, our 50% share of Diamond Green diesels net income was $102.2 million as compared to $97.8 million for the first quarter of 2020.
Interest expense declined $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the 2020 first quarter.
Now turning to income taxes.
The company recorded income tax expense of $28.7 million for ...
...still 30% to 50% higher than the historical price when you get to that future period.
For now, we think the Feed segment will perform well for the rest of 2021.
We remain disciplined in our evaluation of the volatility this segment can experience and continuing to reduce our expenses and improve efficiencies to enhance the margin environment we are experiencing today.
The other increase in our guidance is the Fuel segment.
DGD turned in a record EBITDA per gallon in Q1.
And with that, the Q2 margin is averaging in the current environment, we are putting a potential range of $2.25 to $2.40 EBITDA per gallon for DGD for 2021.
As our joint venture partner announced several weeks ago, we believe the start-up at Norco expansion will be in the middle of Q4, that DGD will ultimately sell 365 million gallons of renewable diesel in 2021.
Those higher gallons and the range of EBITDA per gallon provided puts Darling's half of the EBITDA from DGD between $410 million and $435 million for 2021.
We are targeting this facility to be operational in the back half of 2023, but the team continues to evaluate if we can improve the timeline and start up Port Arthur earlier.
For Darling, we continue to investigate multiple avenues to expand our feedstock footprint and we believe that we are on a solid pathway to achieve this objective in the very near future.
We are encouraged to see more and more states in the U.S. and other countries passing and preparing legislation for low carbon fuel standards.
In our view of the renewable diesel supply and demand equation, we continue to believe that renewable diesel demand will outpace supply for the next three to four years, then we believe that sustainable aviation fuel market demand should begin to develop and have demand pull for DGD somewhere in that timeframe.
We think our DGD Joint Venture is a highly innovative platform and employees one of the most advanced processes for turning waste animal fats and oils into the greenest hydrocarbon in the world.
And it goes without saying, DGD is one of the best investments we can allocate capital to for high returns for our stakeholders.
But we have other areas of innovation as well.
Since the beginning of 2020, Darling has had 100% ownership of EnviroFlight.
EnviroFlight is a leader in sustainable insect Ingredients designed for animal and plant nutrition, aiming to drive transformative change in the global food supply.
We have made several recent announcements on expanding our operations of EnviroFlight earlier this year and we believe this project will position us as the leading developer of proprietary technologies with the first commercial scale black soldier fly larvae manufacturer in the U.S.
We are also pleased with the development of work going on in Europe with our Biomedical technology team.
Our X-Pure GelMA is our latest addition to our Biomedical range of ultrapure gelatin and collagens to the medical industry, and we anticipate that the product offerings will grow as we move forward and the new products bringing added value to our industry.
Our X-Pure products are unique on the market as they come with ultra-low levels of impurities and fully validated traceability of raw materials.
Our innovative spirit grows as we continue to look for ways to improve our product offerings across the spectrum of the markets we serve.
We view our efforts to add innovative products as well as the ongoing investments we have made to build new and expanded rendering capacity over the past several years as key to improving long-term shareholder value.
Sometimes the cycles may not lineup for us, but when they do, Darling can generate solid returns and strong free cash flow.
I'd like to note that we are proud to be selected by Bloomberg and TV Media Group as one of the 50 sustainable climate leaders in the world.
Darling is the original recycler.
And to us, that makes Darling Ingredients the greenest company on the planet.
With that, lets go ahead and open it up to Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting held earlier this week.
Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, chief executive officer; and Stephane Biguet, chief financial officer.
These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.
I therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings.
Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures.
Thereafter, I will follow with our view of the 2022 outlook and some insights into our near-term financial ambitions.
The fourth quarter was characterized by broad-based activity growth.
With continued momentum in North America, activity acceleration in the international markets and an accretive offshore market contribution, upon which we delivered strong sequential revenue growth, our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion and outstanding double-digit free cash flow generation.
These financial results conclude an exceptional year of financial performance for Schlumberger, at a pivotal time for the company and in our industry at large.
Underlying these results are the following highlights from the quarter.
Geographically, sequential growth in North America exceeded rig activity, growing in excess of 20% offshore and international revenue growth accelerated, closing the second half of 2021, up 12% versus the prior year.
All international areas posted growth, driven by gains in more than 75% of our international business units.
By division, revenue in all four divisions grew sequentially and when compared to the same period last year.
Digital Integration led growth, posting double-digit sequential growth and record-high margins.
well construction and reservoir performance, our predominantly service-oriented Divisions, outperformed expectations with strong sequential growth and approximately 30% growth year over year on a pro forma basis.
production systems recorded year-end sales, which drove mid-single-digit growth, though partially impacted by logistics challenge.
Operating margins expanded in spite of seasonality effects, improving further beyond prepandemic levels.
And finally, we generated outstanding cash flow from operation exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter.
All in all, I am very pleased with our operational execution, our safety performance and our financial results through the fourth quarter.
Now, let me briefly reflect on what we achieved in 2021.
In our core, we fully operationalized our returns-focused strategy, leveraging our new division and basin organization to seize the start of the upcycle.
In North America, this resulted in full year topline revenue growth, excluding the effects of divestures and significantly expanded margins achieving double digits, one of the financial targets we laid out in 2019.
Internationally, we also grew the topline and expanded margins significantly, as international activity strengthened in the second half of the year.
This also resulted in full year international margins that exceeded 2019 levels.
Taken together, these margins resulted in the highest global operating margins of the last six years, setting an excellent foundation for further expansion, as activity accelerates and market conditions further support pricing improvement.
In Digital, our second engine of growth, I am very proud of the momentum we established during the year.
We advanced on our goals to expand market access and accelerate adoption of our platform, AI capabilities and powerful digital tools to reduce cycle time, improve performance and lower carbon intensity.
We built partnerships to achieve comprehensive cloud access globally, collaborated with AI innovators to deploy machine-learning and AI solutions and enabled digital operations through the automation of key workflows in well construction and production operations.
At the end of 2021, we have more than 240 commercial DELFI customers, record...
...ially to $1.3 billion.
This growth was primarily due to higher intervention and stimulation activity in the international offshore markets.
Margins were essentially flat at 15.5% as a result of seasonality effects and technology mix, largely driven by the end of summer exploration campaigns in the Northern Hemisphere.
Well construction revenue of $2.4 billion increased 5% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both in North America and internationally.
Margins of 15.4% were essentially flat sequentially as the favorable combination of increased activity and pricing gains was offset by seasonal effects.
Finally, production systems revenue of $1.8 billion was up 5% sequentially, largely from new offshore projects and year-end sales.
However, margins decreased 85 basis points to 9%, largely as a result of the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistic constraints.
Now, turning to our liquidity.
Our cash flow generation during the fourth quarter was outstanding.
We delivered $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.3 billion during the quarter.
This was the result of a very strong working capital performance driven by exceptional cash collections and customer advances.
Cash flows were further enhanced by the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, generating net proceeds of $109 million during the quarter.
Following this transaction, we hold a 31% interest in Liberty.
On a full year basis, we generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $3 billion of free cash flow.
We generated more free cash in 2021 than in 2019, despite our revenue being 30% lower.
This is largely attributable to our efforts of the last two years relating to the implementation of our capital stewardship program and the high grading of our portfolio.
As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $11.1 billion.
This represents an improvement of $2.8 billion compared to the end of 2020.
We are proud to say that net debt is now at its lowest level of the last five years.
During the year, we also continued to reduce gross debt by repaying $1 billion dollars of notes that were coming due in May of this year.
In total, our gross debt reduced by $2.7 billion in the last twelve months thereby significantly increasing our financial flexibility.
Now, looking ahead to 2022.
We expect total capital investments, consisting of capex and investments in APS and exploration data, to be approximately $1.9 to $2 billion dollars, as compared to just under $1.7 billion in 2021.
This increase will allow us to fully seize the multiyear growth opportunity ahead of us, while still achieving our double-digit free cash flow margin objective.
We are entering this growth cycle with a business that is much less capital-intensive as compared to previous cycles.
As a reminder, during the last growth cycle of 2009 to 2014 our total capital investment as a percentage of revenue was approximately 12%.
We are, therefore, well positioned to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle with the potential for enhanced free cash flow margins and return on capital employed.
With this backdrop, I would like to emphasize that based on the industry fundamentals and positioning of the Company that Olivier highlighted earlier, our financial outlook for 2022 is very strong.
We have high expectations and in 2022, we expect a triple double consisting of double-digit return on capital employed, double-digit return on sales and double-digit free cash flow margin.
It is worth noting that we have not experienced this combination in a single year since 2015.
Finally, I am pleased to announce that we will hold a Capital Markets Day in the second half of the year.
This event will allow us the opportunity to provide you with additional details relating to Schlumberger's strategy and financial objectives.
Further information regarding this event will be forthcoming shortly.
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 When we spoke last in February, I was optimistic that we would soon be returning to live events.
And since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets.
In the U.S., over 40% of the population have received at least one vaccine dose, and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily.
In the U.K., over 50% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose, and their reopening road map is tracking to plan.
And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing, and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging.
Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one.
This is generally already in the case in the U.S. where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly for outdoor shows.
And we expect other major markets will follow this summer.
Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand.
The fans are buying tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever.
In the U.S., Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity.
In the U.K., we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones, Reading, Leeds and Parklife, where tickets are already sold out.
New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines, quickly sold out.
And as we get further clarity on reopening time lines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon five and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this summer.
Given the longer lead times associated with global arena and stadium tours, we expect these will start later this year and into 2022.
As we've discussed, we are already seeing confirmed major tour dates for 2022, up double digits from the same time prepandemic.
Many of these artists will have multiyear tours spanning in the U.S., Europe and often Asia or Latin America, setting up for a strong multiyear growth run.
Complementing our event pipeline, Ticketmaster continues to build its global client base to further accelerate its growth.
This year, we have already added new clients representing over five million net new fee-bearing tickets, which we expect to grow further throughout the year as more venues prefer for 2022.
And with Ticketmaster's client base increasingly shifting to digital ticketing, we continue to enhance our offering, ranging from upsell and improved advertising opportunities as well as blockchain and NFT ability at the Ticketmaster platform.
Our brand partners remain engaged and are responding well to our reopening.
And like our concert business, our sponsorship pipeline of committed activity for 2022 is up double digits for next year relative to where it was prepandemic.
Like so many of you, I'm excited to go back to concerts over the next few months and even more excited to see what I expect to be a nonstop 2022 that continues roaring into '23 and beyond.
For the first quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter.
We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer.
As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management.
We're now making the necessary investments to grow the business.
While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019 and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion rela...
...inesses, artists continue to generate revenue through nontrain activity, including publishing rights, while our merchandise business has grown its retail and e-commerce businesses.
Looking at free cash and liquidity.
We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in free cash compared to $643 million at the end of 2020, an increase of $462 million.
Our free cash, along with $964 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020.
Benefiting our free cash position, in January, we raised $417 million of net debt, and we had a $181 million timing benefit, largely associated with deferred revenue classification.
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $136 million or $45 million per month, which included $100 million per month of average operational burn, roughly in line with Q4, plus another $4 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $104 million average per month in gross burn.
This gross burn includes the benefits we realized from the sale of a nonstrategic minority investment and timing on interest payments and severance costs.
And in Q1, we had $59 million average cash contribution margin per month, roughly 50% higher CM than we averaged in Q4.
Now on the other balance sheet items, ticket refunds.
The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q1.
For tours that have gone for a second refund window, the refund levels continue to generally be much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window.
On our festivals where fans were able to retain their tickets for the next scheduled event, 65% of fans are doing so.
On deferred revenue, at the end of the first quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion, the same as at the end of Q4.
Ticket sales in the first quarter were $200 million, but this was offset largely by a shift of deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into 2022.
This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short term during Q2 and Q3, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter.
Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale this summer in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. Given this expected activity through Q2, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its own sales, the concerts division to staff up for the amphitheater and festival season, and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands of these events.
Between this ramp-up and the reversion of some of the Q1 timing benefits, we expect the average monthly net burn for the first half of 2021 to be roughly in line with Q4 of last year.
Before taking questions, I wanted to cover one other thing.
Kathy Willard, our CFO for the past 15 years, will be retiring as of June 30.
She will be then staying on as an advisor throughout the end of the year.
As of July 1, the plan is for Joe Berchtold to become CFO.
Kathy, as you know, has been an invaluable part of our executive team for the past 15 years and been with Live Nation for over 20.
We are a much stronger company because of her, not just from her role as CFO, but as a champion for women at the company and the industry, an important advisor to me on a range of issues.
Because she built such an effective finance organization, I'm confident we will remain in good shape as Joe steps in.
He and Kathy have been working together closely for over a decade now, and he has gotten more deeply involved over the past year as we have been planning this transition.
In addition, late last year, we elevated Jackie Viato to EVP of Operations to take on greater responsibility and give Joe the bandwidth he will need for the job.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.
With Josh and me on the call today are Mark Olear, our Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Dickman, our Chief Financial Officer.
I will lead off today's call by providing an overview of our performance for the third quarter of 2021 and highlight the company's investment and capital markets activities.
And then I'll pass the call to Mark and Brian to discuss our portfolio and financial results in more detail.
The net result of our well-positioned in-place portfolio and the continued execution of our active and accretive investment program was a 5.8% increase in total revenues, a 13.2% increase in adjusted funds from operations, and a 6.4% increase in AFFO per share.
The company benefited from the stability of its portfolio of convenience and automotive retail assets, which continued to perform well, meaning that we had another quarter of full rent collections, including all amounts owed to us as a result of our 2020 COVID-related rent deferments.
The success of our investment strategies year-to-date has been a key contributor to our earnings growth.
We invested $61.1 million in 25 properties during the quarter, and another $8.8 million just after quarter-end, bringing our year-to-date total investment activity to more than $144 million.
This accelerated pace of investment activity was highlighted by our ability to bring new high-quality tenants into our portfolio, including Flash Market with sites located across the Southeastern U.S. and Splash Carwash, whose footprint spans the Northeast.
We also continue to successfully execute on our multiple investment strategies, which include [Indecipherable] leasebacks, accretive acquisitions of net leased properties, and development funding for new industry assets.
In addition, rent commenced on three redevelopment projects during the quarter including our second and third projects, with 7-Eleven for remodeled C&G locations in the Baltimore and Dallas-Fort Worth MSAs, bringing our completed projects to 22 since the inception of our redevelopment program.
We also announced yesterday that we successfully amended and extended our $300 million credit agreement, which now will mature in October 2021.
The improved terms of our facility further validate the company's platform and strong performance over the last several years.
When combined with our active ATM program, which we've used to raise more than $50 million this year, and our strong balance sheet, we continue to have access to capital and the right credit profile to support our growth objectives.
Given our performance year-to-date, I am pleased that our Board approved an increase of 5.1% in our recurring quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share.
This represents the eighth straight year with a dividend increase.
Our Board believes this annual increase is appropriate, as it maintains a stable payout ratio and is tied to the company's growth over the past year.
Furthermore, we are again pleased that our year-to-date accretive investment activity has positioned the company to raise its 2021 AFFO per share guidance.
I want to reiterate our commitment to effectively executing on both new investment activity and the active asset management of our portfolio.
Our teams continue to work diligently to source and underwrite new opportunities to invest across our target asset classes including convenience stores, car washes, automotive-related retail properties in strong metropolitan markets across the country as well as to unlock embedded value through selective redevelopments.
We believe our success year-to-date demonstrates our ability to source opportunities that align with our investment strategies, and that will continue to drive additional shareholder value.
As of the end of the third quarter, our portfolio includes 1,011 net lease properties, five active redevelopment sites, and five va...
...ease of 6.4%.
FFO was $0.48 per share for the quarter.
Our total revenues were $40.1 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.8%.
Rental income, which excludes tenant reimbursements and interest on notes and mortgages receivables was 7.5% to $34.3 million.
Strong acquisition activity over the last 12 months and recurring rent escalators in our leases were the primary drivers of the increase, with additional contribution from rent commencements at completed redevelopment projects.
On the expense side, G&A costs increased in the quarter, primarily due to employee-related expenses, including noncash and stock-based compensation.
Property costs decreased marginally due to reductions in real estate tax expense and environmental expenses, which are highly variable due to a number of estimates and non-cash adjustments, increased in the quarter due to certain legal fees and changes in net remediation costs and estimates.
We turn to the balance sheet and our capital markets activities.
We ended the quarter with $567.5 million of total debt outstanding, including $525 million of long-term fixed-rate unsecured notes and $42.5 million outstanding on our $300 million revolving credit facility.
Our weighted average borrowing cost was 4% and the weighted average maturity of our debt was 6.3 years.
In addition, our total debt to total market capitalization was 29%.
Our total debt to total asset value was 37%, and our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.1 times.
Each of these leverage metrics are calculated according to the definitions in our loan agreements.
As Chris mentioned, yesterday, we announced the amendment and extension of our $300 million revolving credit facility, which is now set to mature in October 2025, with two 6-month extensions, where we have the option to extend to October 2026.
In addition to extending the term, we were able to reduce the interest rate by 20 to 50 basis points, depending on where we are in the leverage-based pricing grid, and amend certain covenant provisions to align with those generally applicable to investment-grade rated REITs.
We also amended each of our outstanding unsecured notes to conform to the new credit facility covenant provisions.
All in all, this is a good transaction for Getty.
We reduced our cost of capital, improved some terms, and importantly, demonstrated the continued support of our bank group and unsecured noteholders.
With the credit facility extended, our nearest debt maturity is now the $75 million of senior unsecured notes that come due in June of 2023.
Moving to ATM activity.
We continue to be selective with our equity issuance during the quarter, raising $19.8 million at an average price of $31.12 per share.
Year-to-date, we raised a total of $50.1 million through the ATM.
We think about our future capital needs more broadly, we remain committed to maintaining a strong credit profile with meaningful liquidity and access to capital, low-to-moderate leverage, and a well-laddered and flexible balance sheet.
With respect to our environmental liability, we ended the quarter at $47.8 million, which was a decrease of approximately $300,000 from the end of 2020.
For the quarter, net environmental remediation spending was approximately $1.3 million.
And finally, as a result of our investment in capital markets activities in the first nine months of the year, we are raising our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $1.93 to $1.94 from our previous range of $1.89 to $1.91.
Our guidance includes transaction activity completed year-to-date but does not otherwise assume potential acquisitions or capital markets activities for the remainder of 2021.
Factors which may impact our guidance include variability with respect to certain operating costs and our expectation that we will remain active in pursuing acquisitions and redevelopments, which could result in additional expenses, including certain property demolition costs and transaction costs for deals that are ultimately not completed.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We are off to a strong start to 2021, with solid first quarter results.
Including, close to 12% top line growth, margin expansion in excess of 200 basis points, and a total annualized return on average equity of 23.2%.
We continue to make progress on our reinsurance program renewal and were oversubscribed on our first cat bond in March at rates below the low end of our initial range.
We have now completed procurement of our Allstate's first event reinsurance program for UPCIC for the 2021 wind season, and we'll have additional details in May as we finalize the remaining pieces of our risk management strategies for our insurance company subsidiaries.
In addition, we were encouraged earlier this month when the Florida Senate passed Bill 76, which would enable Floridians to have reliable access to property insurance.
For a number of years, Florida has been a significant outlier compared to the rest of the country when it comes to litigated property claims, which has put significant pressure on the Florida property insurance marketplace.
We have not been immune to these market dynamics.
And during the first quarter, we actively reduced our policies in force sequentially and reduced new and renewal policy counts in aggregate this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2020.
That being said, we continue to monitor closely the companion bill in the House, House Bill 305, which has differences from the Senate Bill 76.
We look forward to continue to make positive strides throughout 2021 and should have additional details on our reinsurance program renewals in the next several weeks.
As a reminder, discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments and extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
Adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense.
We ended the first quarter with total revenue up 11.7% to $262.8 million, driven by primary rate increases from 2020, earning through the book as policies renew and an improvement in the unrealized portion of the investment portfolio, partially offset by the impact of higher reinsurance costs when compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Margins expanded by 210 basis points for the quarter, driven by the incremental fall-through profit from the top line as previously discussed, lower losses in LAE and lower operating expenses as a percentage of direct premiums earned.
EPS for the quarter was $0.84 on a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
As to underwriting, direct premiums written were up 9.2% for the quarter, led by direct premium growth of 10.2% in Florida.
On the expense side, the combined ratio improved one point for the quarter to 93.1%.
The improvement was driven by a two-point improvement in the loss and LAE ratio from decreased weather, favorable prior year reserve development, and a benefit from our claims adjusting business, partially offset by increased reinsurance costs and less than one point of current year strengthening on a direct basis, when compared to the first quarter of 2020.
The expense ratio improved on a direct earned basis by 45 basis points as a result of operating efficiencies but was more than offset by the impact of increased reinsurance costs on the net ratio resulting in a one-point increase in the net expense ratio for the quarter.
On our investment portfolio, net investment income decreased by 56.3% to $3 million for the quarter, primarily due to significantly lower yields on the reinvested portfolio following the sale of a majority of securities in the portfolio that were in an unrealized gain position in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
Unrealized equity losses improved substantially during the quarter when compared to the market volatility seen last March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total invested assets increased 10.6% to $1 billion since year-end 2020.
In regards to capital deployment, during the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 15,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $245,000.
On April 22, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, which is payable on May 21, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 14, 2021.
As mentioned in our release yesterday, we are maintaining our guidance for 2021.
We still expect GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share range of between $2.75 and $3 and a return on average equity of between 17% and 19%.
The guidance assumes no extraordinary weather events in 2021 and also assumes a flat equity market for GAAP EPS.
If weather events exceed plan, we expect to see both a benefit from our claims adjusting business and increased loss costs.

Margins expanded by 210 basis points, leading to adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84, equal to GAAP EPS. Direct premiums written increased by 9.2%, primarily due to growth in Florida. The combined ratio improved to 93.1% with favorable loss development and claims adjusting benefits. Despite higher reinsurance costs, operating efficiencies led to an improvement in the expense ratio. Net investment income declined due to lower yields, while total invested assets increased by 10.6%.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement.
These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions current expectations, estimates and forecasts.
The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company.
During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS.
We are excited to discuss our 2021 results and outlook for 2022.
We will start on Slide 5.
West delivered a remarkable year of success.
As I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me.
We serve to improve patient lives, and we understand the criticality of our role in the containment and delivery of life-saving and life-changing medicines, including the battle against COVID-19.
Our team members have rallied together with great strength and resolve to meet the accelerated customer demand.
Second, our proven market-led strategy.
We have continued to meet shifting market and customer needs with unique value propositions across our business segments.
This is evident in the continued strength of our financial performance in 2021.
As the global leader, customers come to West knowing that we will deliver superior value through our high-quality products and solutions.
And we remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis and doing our part to support the healthcare industry.
As highlighted on Slide 6, 2021 was an exceptional year of sales and margin expansion driven by strong demand in our base business and accelerated demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.
We ended the year with 28% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter.
And adjusting for COVID-related sales, our base business grew by mid-teens organically.
Our proprietary products segment led the way with 37% organic sales growth, and all of this was fueled by high-value products, resulting in impressive gross and operating margin expansion for the quarter.
Looking ahead, we are well positioned with the right growth strategy around execute, innovate and grow.
Our committed order book is at an all-time high.
We continue to realize the benefits of the globalization of our operating model and continued capital investments to support the increase in demand driven by the attractive end markets.
Turning to Slide 7.
In addition to our financial momentum, West has several other notable accomplishments in 2021.
We shipped over 45 billion components touching billions of patient lives.
This was done with the continued safety of our team members as top priority and the importance of ensuring the continuity of supply for our customers.
We launched five product extensions that continue to bring additional value to our customers.
And we donated over $2.5 million, but more importantly, over 3,600 hours, volunteer hours were donated by team members to help our local communities with the greatest needs.
As we move to Slide 8, a we strive to be stewards of a sustainable future by factoring environmental considerations into every aspect of our business.
In 2021, we expanded our ESG transparency reporting by aligning with the task force for climate-related financial disclosure recommendations.
This includes reducing energy dependencies and lessening emission production through renewable and greener energy, developing more carbon-friendly products and actively engaging with stakeholders to seek out opportunities to have an impact on climate.
Aligned with our focus to improving patient lives across the globe through our products, we remain strongly committed to creating a healthier environment with efforts that will have a positive impact on our communities and future generations.
Turning to Slide 9 and the recent announcement of our collaboration with Corning.
As you look across biotech and pharma companies' drug pipelines, there is a growing need to provide system solutions to support inc...
...let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash.
On Slide 14, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $584 million for the year, an increase of $111.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 23.6% increase.
Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by our working capital increase as well as an increase in tax payments.
In 2021, we spent over $253 million on capital expenditures, a 45% increase over 2020.
The majority of the incremental capex has been leveraged to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities.
We expanded capacity at 13 existing sites with 13 major facility modifications and over 400 pieces of equipment, all while keeping pace with the growing demand.
We have continued to increase capacity at our HVP sites in the U.S., Germany, Ireland and in Singapore.
And we have been able to leverage our existing asset base to support proprietary products manufacturing.
For example, our Williamsport, Pennsylvania site, formerly a contract manufacturing site, will be transformed with over half its manufacturing capacity to support proprietary products with elastomer mixing and batch off line.
And this leverages the close proximity to our HVP site at Jersey Shore.
As we flex our global infrastructure with the phased capacity expansions, we are well positioned for the continued growth in 2022.
Working capital of approximately $1.1 billion increased by $277.6 million from 2020 primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales, higher inventory levels and an increase in our cash position.
Our cash balance at December 31 of $762.6 million was $147.1 million higher in our December 2020 balance.
The increase in cash is primarily due to our strong operating results in the period, offset by our share repurchase program and higher capex.
Slide 15 provides a high-level summary.
Full year 2022 sales guidance will be in a range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion.
There is an estimated headwind of $70 million based on current foreign exchange rates.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 10%.
This comprises a mid-teen growth in our proprietary business.
The forecast includes mid-teen growth in our base business and mid-teen growth in our net COVID-related revenues.
For contract manufacturing, we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit negative growth in 2022.
We do expect contract manufacturing to return to growth in 2023.
We expect our full year 2022 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $9.20 to $9.35.
Also, our capex guidance is $380 million for the year.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance.
Estimated FX headwind on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.21 based on current foreign currency exchange rates.
And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
To summarize the key takeaways for the fourth quarter, strong top-line growth in proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.
To summarize on Slide 16, the excellent financial performance reported today continues to reaffirm that our strategy is working.
We have a strong base business proven by our market-led approach is delivering unique value to our customers.
Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality.
And we're continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth.
We realize that our products are critical for healthcare across the globe, which is why we're so dedicated to support patient health today and well into the future.
Towanda, we're ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.
Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in last year's third quarter.
During this year's third quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $0.82 per share.
Adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021, compared to $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
Segment profit in the quarter was $279 million, up $90 million from the third quarter of 2020.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $271 million in the quarter and $851 million year-to-date.
We continue to execute well across the company in the quarter.
At Aviation, we continue to see a solid recovery in the general aviation market with strong commercial demand, increased deliveries in Citation jets and commercial turboprops and higher aftermarket volume.
We delivered 49 jets, up from 25 last year and 35 commercial turboprops, up from 21 in last year's third quarter.
Order activity in the quarter remained very strong, resulting in backlog growth of $721 million bringing us to $3.5 billion at the quarter end.
Also in the third quarter, the Beechcraft King Air 360 and 260 achieved EASA certification and began to deliver customers throughout the region.
Continuing with our product strategy of upgrading existing models at NBAA, we recently announced the Citation M2 Gen2 and the XLS Gen2 product upgrades.
Also on the new product front, such as SkyCourier is continuing to progress through certification with over 1,600 hours of flight test activity and the Beechcraft Denali successfully completed its initial ground engine runs powered by GE's new Catalyst engine.
The Bell revenues were down 3% in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues.
On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 33 helicopters down from 41 in last year's third quarter.
Moving to future vertical lift.
In September, Bell submitted its proposal for the FARA program, a downselecting award is expected in the second quarter of 2022.
On FARA, Bell is about 60% of the way through its build of the 360 Invictus prototype remains on schedule.
Also in the quarter, Bell inducted the first U.S. Air Force CV-22 for its nacelle improvement modifications.
We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins at 15.1%, up 190 basis points from last year's third quarter.
ATAC continued to expand its fleet of certified F1 aircraft with two additional aircraft entering service in the quarter bringing the total fleet to 19 aircrafts at the end of the quarter.
The fleet continues to support higher customer demand for adversary air services, driving higher revenues in the quarter.
At Air Systems, the team booked $25 million in new orders in the quarter, including both fee-for-service activities, as well as new hardware.
Moving to Industrial, overall revenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience manufacturing disruptions related to supply chain challenges.
In Kautex, we again saw order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted production scheduling and resulting in intermittent line shutdowns of manufacturing efficiencies.
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw continued strong demand in our end markets with higher pricing, which offset production disruptions from part shortages.
To wrap up, Textron delivered a solid quarter with increased aviation backlog, improved manufacturing margins and continued strong cash generation while working to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $386 million from a year ago, largely due to higher Citation jet volume of $290 million, aftermarket volume of $62 million and commercial turboprop volume of $48 million.
Segment profit was $98 million in the third quarter, up $127 million from a year ago, largely due to the higher volume and mix of $96 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $22 million.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.5 billion.
Revenues were $769 million, down $24 million from last year, largely reflecting lower military revenues.
Segment profit of $105 million was down $14 million primarily due to lower military revenues.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $299 million, down $3 million from last year's third quarter due to lower volume of $39 million at Air Systems, which primarily reflected the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on its fee-for-service contracts, partially offset by higher volume, primarily at ATAC and Electronic Systems.
Segment profit of $45 million was up $5 million to a favorable impact from performance and other.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.2 billion.
Industrial revenues were $730 million, down $102 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $156 million primarily at Fuel Systems and Functional Components, reflecting order disruptions related to the global OEM supply shortages, partially offset by favorable impact of $44 million from pricing, largely at Specialized Vehicles.
Segment profit of $23 million was down $35 million from the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the lower volume and mix described above, partially offset by higher pricing net of inflation at Specialized Vehicles.
Finance segment revenues of $11 million -- were $11 million and profit was $8 million.
Moving below segment profit.
Corporate expenses were $23 million and interest expense was $28 million.
With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pre-tax charges of $10 million on the special charges line.
Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $271 million in the quarter and $851 million year-to-date, as compared to $129 million for the corresponding nine-month period in 2020.
Year-to-date, our cash generation reflects improved working capital management, which includes more linearity in quarterly aircraft deliveries and higher customer deposits in Aviation from an increased backlog.
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares, returning $299 million in cash to shareholders.
We're raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share.
This includes revised tax guidance at effective rate of 15.5% for the full year.
We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million.

 On Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement.
These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts.
The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company.
During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS.
West had an extraordinary year of success in the face of the biggest healthcare challenge of our generation.
A record-setting year of sales and margins were driven by base business demand of our components, devices and solutions as well as the accelerating demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.
This was accomplished by our dedicated team members across the globe, working tirelessly to show up each day at our facilities, our labs and remotely at their homes to make a meaningful difference to customers and patients.
The past year has truly brought to life the importance of our mission and values that guides our work each day at West.
We remain steadfast in our purpose to serve society and lead by example for the communities in which we live and work.
Importantly, we continue to manage through these unprecedented times by focusing on two key priorities.
One, keeping our team members safe and two, ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
The criticality of our business today is shown in the character and the perseverance of our team members to deliver on our commitments as a trusted partner for our customers.
The strength of our performance this past quarter and throughout 2020, demonstrates the forward momentum that we have built over time with our market-led strategy, globalization of our manufacturing network and One West team approach to satisfy market demand.
Moving to Slide 6.
These charts show a breakdown of the 2020 sales and the impact of our high-value products that we bring to numerous customers around the world.
As the base business continues to grow, and as we saw a growing demand for components associated with COVID-19, we leveraged our global infrastructure and team's agility to meet the increased demand.
Now, turning to Slide 7.
Proudly, West components are on a majority of the vaccines on the market and in development to combat COVID-19.
The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered.
It became clear to us in early 2020 that would -- we would need to accelerate production capacity for certain high-value products.
As I previously shared, many of our customers are selecting fluoropolymer-coated stoppers from vial configurations made by both West and our partner, Daikyo.
These are the industry standard for packaging sensitive molecules and have an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made the decision to use this best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety.
In addition, we're involved in many therapeutic approvals and our contract manufacturing business is supporting the COVID-19 diagnostic requirements of our customers.
In Q4, we accelerated our capacity expansions and began the installation of additional equipment with a modular approach to expand Flurotec and NovaPure capacity.
This included the installation of several 45-ton hydraulic presses and additional HVP manufacturing processes to produce components for COVID-19 vaccines at several sites.
I'm proud to say that the first presses were installed and validated at the end of 2020, and we're now producing product.
And we're not done yet.
We have more presses that will be installed in the first half of this year.
It should be noted that these i...
...e points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rate increased sales by $16.3 million or an increase of 3.5 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance.
Slide 14 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 36.4% for Q4 2020, up from 32.5% in Q4 2019.
proprietary Products fourth-quarter gross profit margin of 41.7% was 370 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The key drivers for the continued improvement in proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products, reduction efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs.
Contract manufacturing fourth-quarter gross profit margin of 17.2% was 80 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.
This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization.
Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash.
On Slide 15, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $472.5 million for 2020, an increase of $105.3 million compared to the same period last year, a 28.7% increase.
Our 2020 capital spending was $174.4 million, $48 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $870.3 million at December 31, 2020, was $153.2 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $66 million due to increased sales activity and an increase in inventory of $85.6 million to position us to support the increasing needs of our customers.
Our cash balance at December 31 of $615.5 million, was $176.4 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results.
Slide 16 provides a high level summary.
Full year 2021 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.5 billion and $2.2 -- $2.525 billion.
This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $260 million.
There is an estimated benefit of $75 million based on current foreign exchange rate.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 13% to 14%.
We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $6 to $6.15.
We continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand.
Accordingly, we have set capex guidance of $230 million to $240 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance.
Estimated FX benefit on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.23 based on current foreign currency exchange rates and excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
To summarize the key takeaways for the fourth quarter, strong top-line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth and adjusted diluted EPS, and growth in operating and free cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.
To summarize on Slide 17, we have a critical role to support our customers as we work to resolve this global pandemic.
The participation rate remains very high.
And our products are being used in this battle.
We have strength in the underlying core business and long-term growth.
Our focus on execute, innovate and grow, allows us to be more responsive to the changes in the industry.
Our market-led strategy is delivering the right products and solutions to our customers.
Our global operations network continues to flex and respond to increased demand and capacity requirements.
And our investments to fuel R&D and innovation in digital technology will continue to keep us on the forefront of the industry.
The future is promising, but most importantly, we remain grounded for our mission and values each day at West, because every component has a patient's name on it.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Today is important and transformative day for the technology distribution industry as SYNNEX and Tech Data come together.
For over four decades we have each worked to help our customers and partners grow and achieve their strategic priorities.
We have both been leaders in the space and I and the entire SYNNEX management team have the utmost respect for the team at Tech Data and what they have created.
Like us, Tech Data has established a reputation for excellence and we are thrilled to partner with its 14,000 plus talented colleagues.
For SYNNEX, this combination is beneficial as it accelerates our strategic growth initiatives by multiple years versus what we could have done by acquiring several smaller, geographically diverse companies.
Thus, the combined company will be able to bring additional services and capabilities to our respective partners.
Even with a well planned and executed strategy, I'm not sure we could have achieved -- over time -- all that is accomplished with this merger.
For our investors, we have the opportunity to create value by accelerated revenue growth, scaled efficiencies, increased cash flow and greater earnings power.
I am pleased to be able to partner with Rich Hume and the go-forward combined entity.
Rich is a talented leader with significant industry expertise and we're fortunate to have him as the CEO of the business going forward.
[Technical Issues] the transformative transaction we are about [Technical Issues] I along with our shareholder Apollo, believe combining our business with SYNNEX accelerates the momentum that was already under way to create growth opportunity that neither company could achieve independently.
The combined company will deliver superior value for shareholders, offer our customers and vendors exceptional reach, efficiency and expertise across the entire technology ecosystem and be an employer of choice in the IT industry.
Importantly, together, we have the portfolio, the financial strength and the talent to enable us to achieve these objectives.
We will have premier, best-in-class, end-to-end offerings through a broad diversified portfolio of more than 200,000 products and solutions.
The combined company will be positioned to transform value creation from the linear model to the multi-point model, enabling collaboration among all of the ecosystem participants.
This will enable us to drive effective go-to-market strategies that our vendors can capitalize on and help to deliver optimal business-oriented solutions for their customers.
Our ability to orchestrate the access, interaction, delivery and services required to solve business challenges at scale is the foundation of how we will continue to grow.
As you know, change is constant in our business and this is a pivotal time in our industry.
Technologies such as cloud, analytics, IoT and security are changing our customers and their end user customers' buy, sell, consume and finance technology solutions causing the IT ecosystem to evolve faster than ever before.
This evolution has accelerated further due to the work-from-home and return to office trends which are contributing to explosive growth in these areas in which we are ideally positioned to serve.
The combined company will have a solid financial foundation, including an investment grade profile and strong free cash flows to support investments in our core growth platforms as well as investments in these next generation technologies.
The breadth and diversification of the combined company extends well beyond our products and solutions.
Together, SYNNEX and Tech Data will have a global footprint that serves more than 100 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.
This combination brings new market opportunities for both companies.
For example, SYNNEX has a well-established presence in Japan, where Tech Data does not.
Similarly, Tech Data is a well-established business across Europe, where SYNNEX has a more limited access.

...re for the quarter.
The dividend is expected to be paid on April 30, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 16, 2021.
Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q2.
We expect revenue in the range of $4.7 billion to $5 billion.
Non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $94.9 million to $105 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of a $1.80 to $2.00 per diluted share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 51.8 million.
Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes the after-tax cost of $7.3 million or $0.14 per share related to the amortization of intangibles and $4.8 million or $0.09 per share related to share-based compensation.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect a healthy IT spending environment, driven by gradually increasing investments in technology enablement.
We expect full year fiscal 2021 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of approximately $8 per share.
I'm very proud of our associates and the excellent first quarter results that we have delivered.
In Q1, we continued to navigate an unpredictable environment; but through it all, the team again showed flexibility, creativity and dedication to find innovative ways to support our customers and partners with exceptional service.
Our results above our internal expectations were driven by healthy broad-based demand across all our businesses as remote capability and digital transformation investments continued.
Similar to the past few quarters, we saw strong demand for client devices like notebooks and Chromebooks, as well as continued demand for security, cloud, collaboration solutions and related services.
We also saw improvements in areas like enterprise solutions, including server and networking.
Our performance came from across all our customer segments with really no exception in the contribution to the growth in the quarter.
From a geographical perspective, all regions performed well, with Canada and Japan exceeding expectations by the most.
Turning to our Q2 outlook.
Our priority remains on the health and safety of our associates.
Overall, we are encouraged about the IT and spending environment so far in 2021.
As we move closer to a sense of normalcy, it appears investment, especially in IT, is following.
For our Q2, with ongoing execution, we anticipate our business will continue to grow better than the market as our guidance implied a mid to upper single digit year-over-year growth rate.
Perhaps we're being a bit cautious with our expectations for the second quarter given the demand environment is fairly strong currently, evident by our ongoing high backlog and that on-premise purchasing activity is picking up each quarter.
However, given how much we over performed in Q1 and how early we are in Q2, we will start with the current range we have provided.
Overall, we are pleased with the trajectory of our business, evident by Marshall calling out our earnings per share expectations for the year.
As I wrap up, and touching again on the Tech Data merger announcement, those who have followed our space for many years know that M&A has been an important part of this industry.
We and Tech Data have both participated in many transactions over the years and have built up a wealth of knowledge and experience on how to have a successful outcome ensuring that value creation is delivered.
I believe we are very well situated given the strong cultural fit, knowledge of the industry, customers and partners and a strong and talented combined workforce.
We are developing a robust integration plan, and we'll share more with you as we get closer to the transaction close.
We are very excited by the possibilities that this deal creates for our combined company and look forward to realizing the significant value that should produce for our customers, partners, associates and shareholders.
In closing, we remain very focused on our core business.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Sales in the fourth quarter were $123 million, up 7%, compared to the same period in 2019.

Today all of our plants are operational with varying levels of capacity from 85% to 100%.
Fourth quarter gross margin was up 110 basis points to 34.7% from the same period last year.
EBITDA margin of 21.4% was up from 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

In the fourth quarter, we acquired Sensor Scientific, a temperature sensing company, primarily serving medical customers.
Ashish Agrawal, our CFO is with me for today's call as usual and he'll take us through the Safe Harbor statement.
To the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G. The required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investors Section of the CTS website.
I will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO.
In the fourth quarter, our sales increased to $123 million, up 8% sequentially and up 7% from last year.
For full-year 2020 sales were down 10% from 2019, driven lower by the impact of the pandemic.
The quarter's performance was solid.
However, we are operating cautiously as we enter 2021 and monitor for any new pandemic disruptions, semiconductor shortages for our OEM customers and the consistency of the recent robust recovery.
We continue to prioritize safety in our operations, our team's ability to effectively manage through the crisis, their resilience as well as the commitment and strength of the senior leadership team greatly helped us navigate these unprecedented market conditions this past year.
The restructuring plan we announced last year is progressing with small delays due to the impact of COVID-19.
We are still planning to deliver an annualized earnings per share improvement in excess of $0.22 by the second half of 2022.
More importantly, we're focused on returning to growth, building on our performance in the fourth quarter and leveraging the recent acquisition of Sensor Scientific.
Sensor Scientific is a manufacturer of high quality thermistors and temperature sensor assemblies, serving OEMs for applications that require precision and reliability in medical, industrial and defense markets.
Sensor Scientific's products are used in a variety of medical applications; including neonatal equipment, lab freezers, fluid warmers and analytical instruments.
SSI has locations in Turkey and New Jersey and in the Philippines.
The acquisition expands our temperature sensing portfolio has complementary capabilities with our existing platform and expand CTS's presence in medical.
The annualized revenue is in the range of $6 million, the purchase price was slightly less than 2 times revenue.
We remain focused on our strategic growth investments as part of our planning for 2025.
Growing our business and expanding our range of products that Sense, Connect, and Move is the priority.
New business awards were $104 million for the quarter, we added six new customers in the quarter; four in transportation; one in medical and one in telecom.
In Transportation, we were awarded passive safety sensor wins with three OEMs; one of the wins was with a North American customer for electric trucks, a new customer for CTS, this builds momentum on the large passive safety win we recorded last quarter with a Chinese electric vehicle application.
We have accelerated our module wins with several OEMs across China, Europe and North America.
A few of these wins were on plug-in hybrid electric platforms.
We also added the new customer for passive safe...
...h quarter of 2019, sequentially we were up 17% in sales to transportation customers.
Sales to other end markets were essentially flat year-over-year.
We saw solid growth in sales to both the industrial and defense end markets and softness continued in the medical end market.
Our gross margin was 37% for the fourth quarter, up 230 basis points, compared to last quarter, and up 110 basis points, compared to last year.
Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 21.4%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 110 basis points from last year.
Fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $0.46 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.43, compared to $0.37 last year and $0.34 last quarter.
For full-year 2020, sales were $424 million, down 10% from 2019.
Sales to transportation customers declined 19% and sales to other end markets increased by 7%.
Industrial and aerospace & defense end markets sales experienced double-digit growth.
Medical end market was soft, but sales down 7%.
Our gross margin was 32.8% for the year, down from 33.6% last year.
The major driver was lower volume attributable to COVID-19, which was partially offset by temporary and other cost reductions implemented throughout the year.
Our focus is to drive improvements and move toward the higher end of our target range of 34% to 37% gross margin.
In the second half of 2020, we generated $0.05 of earnings per share and savings from our restructuring program announced in July 2020.
Foreign currency rates impacted gross margin favorably in 2020 by approximately $3 million.
Based on recent exchange rates currency could impact our 2021 gross margin unfavorably by approximately 100 basis points.
SG&A and R&D expenses were $92.1 million or 21.7% of sales for the year.
Consistent with prior communication, we expect 2021 operating expenses to be higher as a result of the reinstatement of temporary cost measures.
Our 2020 tax rate was 23.7%, we anticipate our 2021 tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, excluding the discrete items.
This is subject to change, due to the impact of any changes that may be introduced by the new US administration.
2020 earnings were $1.06 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.12, compared to $1.45 last year.
Now I'll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow.
Our controllable working capital as a percentage of sales was 15.5% in the fourth quarter, improved slightly from the third quarter.
We have made progress over the last couple of quarters, but still have more work to do.
We are balancing improvements in working capital with having some safety stock to minimize risk of supply chain disruptions.
Capex was $14.9 million for the full-year, down from $21.7 million in 2019.
We continue to manage capex carefully given the current environment.
In 2021, we are expecting capex to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% of sales.
The primary focus being on growth-related projects.
We finished 2020 with a healthy balance sheet and a strong liquidity position.
Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $26 million, for the full-year operating cash flow was $77 million, compared to $64 million in 2019.
The end of the year with $92 million in cash, compared to $100 million in December 2019.
In the fourth quarter, we reduced our long-term debt balance to $55 million from $106 million at the end of the third quarter.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was at 11.4% at the end of 2020, compared to 19.7% at the end of 2019.
The combination of a strong balance sheet with a net cash position and access to over $240 million through our credit facility gives the flexibility to appropriately deploy capital toward our strategic objectives.
We are progressing on our SAP implementation as we communicated earlier, more than 80% of our revenue comes from sites that are running on SAP.
We expect to complete the implementation in the second half of 2021.
However, COVID-related restrictions could cause some delays.
This concludes our prepared comments.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Revenue increased 79% to $394 million in the quarter, driven by growth in the number of independent OPTAVIA Coaches coupled with further improvements in coach productivity.
The number of active earning OPTAVIA Coaches reached approximately 59,200 at the end of the second quarter, a record high, that is 62% above the same quarter last year and up nearly 13% sequentially.
Revenue per active earning OPTAVIA Coach was $6,662, another new record, up nearly 14% versus last year and 3% sequentially.
The continued productivity gains we are seeing has been fueled by the development of infrastructure and education to help coaches learn how to support a greater number of clients than has historically been possible.
This field-led training approach leverages social media and communication technology platforms to engage clients and support and train coaches.
We've been investing substantially in technology and digital processes, with an emphasis on creating unique infrastructure and education to help OPTAVIA Coaches leverage their time and talent to efficiently serve clients.
While it's still very early, we can already see the benefits from these efforts based on the strong trends in coach level productivity.
Our digital product teams have been developing two apps.
The first is the OPTAVIA app, which primarily targets clients and features lean and green recipes, self-service options related to OPTAVIA Premier orders and returns and other key information to stay engaged.
The OPTAVIA app went live in April for coaches and in July for clients.
The second is the Connect App, which is for coaches on the go, who need data and insights to help them manage their business efficiently.
The beta version of the Connect app went live in April and is currently being utilized by nearly one-third of coaches with a broader rollout expected over the balance of the year.
In addition, to our proprietary apps, OPTAVIA Coaches continue to refine our social media and other communication platform to manage their business to drive deeper connections to serve existing customers to attract new clients.
It's clear that interest in health and wellness across the board continues to be extremely strong.
A recent study of consumer health priorities and motivators commissioned by Medifast found that 93% of U.S. adults of health and wellness goals and 84% are actively working toward achieving them.
2/3 of Americans say the biggest motivator for staying consistent with health and wellness goals is feeling good mentally and physically, defined by having more energy and reducing stress and anxiety.
OPTAVIA's unique model has proven effectiveness in helping people achieve their individual goals around health and wellness and the resonance of this model has demonstrated clearly results we've announced today.
As we drive further demand through a growing number of coaches, it's important that we continue to develop our supply chain capabilities to be able to meet the needs of the field.
We achieved our $2 billion manufacturing capacity target in the second quarter, six months ahead of the original goal through the expansion of relationships with co-manufacturers.
Given our growth trajectory and outlook for the future, this additional capacity is crucial to meeting the needs of our coaches and clients as well as continuing to deliver strong returns for shareholders.
Scaling our fulfillment capacity to an equivalent level is also in process, with an expected completion date in the third quarter of this year, three months ahead of the original goal.
We added an internally managed fulfillment center in April 2021 and for partnerships with 3PL companies to ensure that we are able to efficiently move everything through our supply chain network.
There were no promotions in the quarter as the strength of our coach-based model and field-led training continue to drive strong engagement and activation.
Importantly, since we were lapping the essential start promotion from last year's second ...
...e our costs while investing in supply chain and technology for our long-term growth objectives.
We believe gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue will improve in the longer term as we develop pricing strategies, enhance our distribution network, reduce freight costs by shortening shipping lanes and gain productivity improvements in our supply chain processes as we scale our business.
SG&A for the second quarter of 2021 increased 77% to $232.3 million compared to $131.2 million for the second quarter of 2020.
The increase was primarily due to higher OPTAVIA commissions, increased salary and benefit-related expenses for employees, increased consulting costs related to technology projects and increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 58.9% versus 59.6% in the second quarter of 2020.
Income from operations increased $33.3 million to $61.4 million from $28.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting significant improvement in gross profit margin coupled with leverage of SG&A expenses.
Income from operations as a percentage of revenue was 15.6% for the quarter, an increase of 280 basis points from the year ago period.
The effective tax rate was 23.4% for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 22.1% in last year's second quarter.
Net income in the second quarter of 2021 was $47 million or $3.96 per diluted share based on approximately 11.9 million shares of common stock outstanding.
This compares to net income of $21.9 million or $1.86 per diluted share based on approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock outstanding in last year's second quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $197.4 million as of June 30, 2021, compared to $174.5 million at December 31, 2020.
The company remains free of interest-bearing debt and believes it is well positioned to execute its growth strategy.
On the first quarter call, I provided additional detail around our capital allocation priorities and discussed that we expect higher levels of capital expenditures over the next 24 months to expand our technology and supply chain capabilities.
Additionally, we expect that stock repurchase was going to increase relative to our dividend.
To that end, during the second quarter, we repurchased $12.2 million of stock, which is up from $7.5 million of repurchase activity in the first quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $19.7 million through the first half of 2021.
Given our strong financial condition, expectations for future cash flow growth and the relative valuation of our stock, we anticipate continuing to prioritize buybacks as a means of adding value for shareholders in the foreseeable future.
Finally, in June 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $16.9 million or $1.42 per share, which is payable on August 6.
Turning to our guidance, which we reinstated last quarter.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.425 billion to $1.525 billion and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $12.70 to $14.17.
Our guidance also assumes a 23.25% to 24.25% effective tax rate.
As discussed, we are expecting pressure on gross profit margin in the second half of 2021 due to the increased levels of use of co-manufacturers in the coming months to meet accelerated demand in OPTAVIA-branded products and due to inflation factors.
In Q3 this year, we successfully returned to an in-person convention that will increase SG&A expenses in Q3.
Finally, in Q3, we will be repeating our business builder program and expect this to further grow the number of independent OPTAVIA Coaches and help our business as we head into 2022.
The business builder program will be recorded in SG&A expenses in Q3.
In closing, second quarter results were strong, and we remain confident in our business model and are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Earnings for the quarter was $0.79 per share compared to $1.59 in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.03 in the quarter compared to $1.96 in 2020.
Net sales in the quarter were up 17% from the prior year, primarily due to the pass through of higher material costs and increased beverage can and transit packaging volumes.
Segment income improved to $379 million in the quarter compared to $367 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales unit volumes.
As outlined in the release, we currently estimate fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of between $1.50 and $1.55 per share, and full-year adjusted earnings of $7.50 to $7.55 per share.
Our expected adjusted tax rate for the year is between 23% and 24% consistent with our nine months rate.
Our continued best wishes for the continued health and safety of you and your families.
Before reviewing the third quarter results, we want to again express our sincere appreciation to our global associates for their continued efforts during the ongoing pandemic, with many of us now vaccinated, we're moving in the right direction, but we should expect the next several months to remain challenging as COVID variance make their way through various populations.
Again, we ask all of you to remain vigilant in protecting yourselves, your family members, your associates and your communities.
Demand remained strong across all product lines and geographies with the exception of Vietnam, where hard lockdown measures by the government essentially curtailed all business and consumer activity for much of the third quarter.
We expect Vietnam will slowly reopen during the fourth quarter.
Reported revenues increased 17% during the quarter as higher beverage and transit volumes coupled with the pass through of raw material cost increases offset supply chain challenges.
In the face of these challenges, we continue to grow earnings.
And in July, we discussed with you the step change in earnings that we have experienced beginning with last year's third quarter in which EBITDA over the last five quarters averages approximately $100 million more than the previous six quarters.
Our teams continue to do a great job commercializing new capacity, converting that capacity into income growth and we look forward to more capacity coming online over the next several quarters.
We're also pleased to report that our efforts related to the environment and sustainability have not gone unnoticed.
In September, ESG ratings provider Sustainalytics again ranked Crown in the top position for mitigating ESG risk within the metal and glass packaging sector.
Also during the quarter, the Company joined the Climate Pledge, where we have committed to be net zero carbon by the year 2040.
The sale of the European Tinplate businesses was completed on August 31st, and going forward, our share of net profits will be reflected in equity earnings.
As discussed previously, we continue to experience inflationary pressure across all businesses.
Many of our businesses contractually pass through higher costs, including steel and aluminum, but some businesses will have a timing lag to recovery.
As cost for pass-through revenues will increase, however, percentage margins will decline due to the denominator effect of one-to-one pass-throughs.
Before reviewing the operating segments, we remind you that delivered aluminum here in North America is approximately 75%, 80% higher today than at this time last year.
LME and delivery premiums are contractual pass-throughs, so reported beverage revenues reflect both the volume increase and the higher aluminum cost.
After reading the various analyst reports on magnesium and related aluminum supply, I would say that many of you have a very good understanding of the situation.
The concerns related to magnesium as many of you have noted relate to energy curtailments in China.
China has restarted some production recently, so hopefully that eases some of the concerns recently voic...
...arket has always recovered to even higher levels.
Late in the third quarter, we began commercial shipments from the second line in the Bowling Green, Kentucky plant, with the third line in Olympia, Washington, now operational here in early fourth quarter.
Next month, we will begin operations in the second line in Rio Verde, Brazil, followed by a late first quarter 2022 start-up on the second line in Monterrey, Mexico.
New two-line plants in Uberaba, Brazil; and Martinsville, Virginia will come online late in 2022 followed by the new two-line plant in Mesquite, Nevada scheduled for a mid 2023 start-up.
A lot of activity, but the team is fully committed to continue our growth with a well-balanced customer portfolio.
Unit volumes in European beverage advanced 5% over the prior year with strong volumes across most operations in this segment.
Inflation offset unit volume growth with freight, utilities and labor being most notable and with inflation expected to remain elevated across Europe, we project the income will decline in the European segment in the fourth quarter and during 2022.
In Asia Pacific, unit volumes declined 8% in the quarter owing entirely to a 55% contraction in Vietnam.
Excluding Vietnam, unit volumes grew 20% in the quarter.
The Vietnamese government instituted hard lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID and its variance.
And for example, a hard lockdown means that you're not allowed to leave your house, and the army will deliver to you all food and essentials.
And while we expect Vietnam will slowly reopen during the fourth quarter, we do expect that from time-to-time we will be subject to various lockdowns or movement control orders as the various countries look to prevent the spread of COVID.
Our new plant in Vung Tau, Vietnam, is now qualified to begin commercial shipments to customers.
As expected, transit packaging had another strong quarter, recording double-digit gains in revenues and segment income, volume growth in steel strap tooling and across protective packaging offset inflationary headwinds, notably freight.
The business continues to navigate supply shortages, transportation delays and inflation, and remains well positioned to continue to grow earnings in the fourth quarter and through next year as these conditions ease over time.
Performance in our North American food and beverage can making equipment businesses remain firm throughout the third quarter, and earlier in the year we commenced operations at a new food can plant in Dubuque, Iowa.
And during the third quarter, we began commercial shipments from a new two-piece food can line in our Hanover, Pennsylvania plant.
These line additions provide much needed capacity to our domestic supply footprint, allowing us to eliminate imports and we expect significant improvement earnings from food in 2022 as these new lines come through their learning curves.
So in summary, a very strong first nine months of 2021 with EBITDA up 26%.
As described earlier, we have several capacity projects recently completed and are underway and are pleased to reconfirm the 2025 EBITDA estimate of $2.5 billion first provided during the May virtual Investor Day.
And near-term, while we may experience inflation and supply chain related headwinds over the next few quarters, we currently expect 2022 will be another strong year of earnings growth with EBITDA estimated to be approximately $2 billion.
In addition to North American food, our beverage can businesses in North America and Brazil and our transit packaging business are all expected to have strong years in 2022, allowing us to earn through the dilution related to the European asset sale and headwinds from a persistent inflationary environment.
Before opening the call to questions, there are a number of you in the queue, so we ask that you please limit yourselves to no more than two questions so that others will have a chance to ask their question.
And with that Annie, I think we're now ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The pandemic has given us an opportunity to display our agility as a company.
We increased our communications with retailers.
We changed our marketing messages.
We shifted investments to categories that are most important to consumers.
And we set new production records for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER baking soda.
And we've moved people to focus on the online class of trade.
So we've been proactive in seizing the opportunities presented by the crisis and are increasing manufacturing capacity in our plants and externally with new co-packers.
The agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team is showing up in our results.
Our priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands.
Our plant, warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job in keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain.
Our office employees continue to work remotely and are doing a super job running the company.
So now let's talk about the results.
Q3 was another exceptional quarter.
Reported sales growth was 13.9% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.70.
Revenue, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher in Q3 than last year, driven by the significant increase in demand for many of our products.
Organic sales grew 9.9%, driven by higher consumption.
Regarding e-commerce, we were already strong pre-COVID and well positioned online.
In Q3, our online sales increased by 77% as all retailer.coms have grown.
One example would be gummy vitamins.
In 2019, 8% of our full year sales were online.
This year, we expect full year to be about 14% online.
Recall, we began the year targeting 9% online sales as a percentage of global consumer sales.
In Q1, it was 10% online; Q2, 13%; and Q3, also 13%.
So we expect the full year to be actually close to 13% as well.
We continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers.
There's no surprises here, actually.
There is continued consumer concern that stores will run out of stock and websites will face delivery issues.
Consumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time.
If we look at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally in balance in the 15 categories in which we compete.
With respect to our brands, we had broad-based consumption growth in Q3.
We saw a double-digit consumption growth in VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits and cleaners.
In Household, our laundry business consumption was up 4% and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was up 8%.
Water flossers is another bright spot as consumption turned slightly positive in Q3.
Although our Lunch & Learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to continue to address this with incremental advertising.
In addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, water flossers is another brand we expect to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness.
BATISTE dry shampoo remains impacted by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but improved sequentially compared to Q2 when consumption was down 22%.
TROJAN consumption was down 6% in Q3, but also improved sequentially when we were down 15% in Q2.
There's no doubt that consumers have made health and wellness a priority.
VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw the greatest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%.
The category consumption was even higher.
Our expectation is that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain high.
And we have new third-party capacity coming online in late Q4 to take advantage of this trend.
Consumers are focusing on health and wellness, but also, cleaning, home cooking and new grooming routines.
At...
...orted sales growth of approximately 9%, organic sales growth of approximately 8%.
And as Matt mentioned, we have strong consumption across many of our categories.
Turning to gross margin.
We previously called 150 basis point contraction in the second half.
Now we're saying down 190 basis points.
The change is primarily due to nonrecurring supply chain costs.
We also expect significant expense, and we have called flat for the year in terms of a percent of sales, which implies a step-up in Q4.
We also anticipate a lower tax rate.
As a result, we expect Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share, excluding the acquisition earnout adjustment as we exit 2020 with momentum.
And now for the full year outlook, we now expect approximately 11% for the year 2020 sales growth, which is above our previously 9% to 10% range.
We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 9%, up from our previous 7% to 8% outlook.
We raised our cash from operations outlook to $975 million, which is up 13% versus year ago.
Turning to gross margin.
We expect gross margin to be down 20 basis points for the year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition accounting, COVID costs, incremental manufacturing and distribution capacity investments and the higher tariffs on WATERPIK.
As to tariffs, remember back in 2018, we got caught up in Tier two tariffs for which we were granted an extension in 2019.
That exemption expired and was not extended as of Q3 2020.
We continue to work on mitigating that impact.
Another word or two on gross margin.
Previously, I have said the first half of the year was plus 150 basis points on gross margin and the second half was down 150 basis points on gross margin.
And so our outlook as of last quarter was flat for the year.
And then also last quarter, you heard me walk through investments we were making in the second half of 2020.
Examples here included a new third-party logistics provider, outside storage to handle surge inventories, preliminary engineering on capacity, VMS outsourcing costs as well as other investments around automation, consumer research and analytics.
Now we're calling down 190 basis points for the back half or down 20 basis points for the year, and that implies down 250 basis points for the quarter.
We have some supply chain nonrecurring costs.
Here are a few examples.
First, because of our outsized growth, I mentioned last quarter, we're adding a new 3PL distribution center.
In the quarter, we again had stronger sales.
And as such, had duplicative outside storage locations and the new 3PL distribution center that wasn't operational.
So for a period of time, we had duplicative costs.
We're also in the process of going through make first buy decisions.
And that will trigger a couple of asset write-offs likely in Q4.
We have lean training across the plants.
And finally, due to the great results this year, higher incentive comp cost that flow through COGS.
So our full year tax rate expectations are 19%, and we also raised our adjusted earnings per share growth to 13% to 14%.
Now that we're through the outlook, I also want to spend a minute on FLAWLESS.
As you saw in the release, we had an earnout benefit of approximately $50 million in the quarter in reported earnings.
We exclude any of the earnout movements in adjusted EPS.
Some color on that swing.
As a backdrop, we bought that business for $475 million upfront and a $425 million earnout tied to year-end 2021 sales.
That sales target represented in excess of 15% CAGR for three years off of a baseline of $180 million of trailing sales.
The revised 3-year CAGR for this business is closer to 8%.
And as such, the earnout liability comes down and earnings go up.
We're still positive on this business.
And the strong consumption growth these past six months is a great indicator for the future.
As you heard from Matt, the company is well positioned as we enter 2021.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.
Before turning the call over to Joe, Donald and Shawn, just a quick reminder.
Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.
We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan, with Indiana Commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects.
In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 integrated resource plan, or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023.
We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
Let's turn now to slide three and take a closer look at our key takeaways.
In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share.
Results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts.
We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long term financial commitments.
We expect 2021 earnings of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings.
We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023.
NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023.
As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, that is currently underway, has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community.
In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions.
Safety advancements continue across NiSource, guided by our implementation of the industry's safety management system, which serves as our core operating model.
Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in two more states.
Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment.
I'm pleased to say that we remain on target.
We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels.
That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025.
On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels.
Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements.
Also, last year, more than one million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs.
On that note, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on slide nine.
The Ohio rate case is one of three new rate cases filed in the second quarter.
We are requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates.
Pending a decision from the PUCO, new rates would be effective in mid-2022.
In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers.
And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers, requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase.
New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year.
In Pennsylvania, we fi...
...nologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders.
A few notes about the process and timing.
The IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through will utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs.
We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way.
We expect to develop a stakeholder supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1.
Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects.
Any specific projects then identified, which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments NIPSCO has already filed.
These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we are calling Your Energy, Your Future, as we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust.
Looking at our second quarter 2021 results on slide four, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020.
I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts due to the sale closing in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment three months non-GAAP results on slide five.
Gas distribution [Technical Issues] operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year [Technical Issues] down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA [Technical Issues] upward in expenses also [Technical Issues] offset by higher employee related [Technical Issues] costs and outside services [Technical Issues], which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020.
Operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage.
Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee related costs.
Now turning to slide six.
I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile.
Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, of which about $9.1 billion [Technical Issues] was long term debt [Technical Issues] in years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs.
With Moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021.
Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long term safety and infrastructure investments.
Let's take a quick look at slide eight, which highlights our financing plan.
There are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance.
Last quarter's issuance has significantly derisked our financing plans and it's consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments.
As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long term financial commitments.
I should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the Partnership's future operations and financial performance, including expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Actual results could differ materially and the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events.
During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as adjusted.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Partnership recorded net income of $83 million, adjusted EBITDA was $159 million compared to $168 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Volumes of 1.8 billion gallons were relatively unchanged from the third quarter, but remain down about 12% from levels seen a year ago.
Fuel margin was $0.092 per gallon and included approximately $8 million of one-time write-offs associated with prior period fuel tax and inventory-related items.
Fourth quarter margin also included approximately $9 million of unfavorability related to inventory valuation and associated hedges.
For the full-year 2020, the impact of this inventory valuation and hedging activity resulted in approximately $2 million of margin favorability.
Karl will elaborate further on our fuel margin in his remarks.
Fourth quarter distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $97 million, yielding a coverage ratio of 1.1 times.
We ended the full-year 2020 with the coverage ratio of 1.5 times.
On January 28, we declared an $0.8255 per unit distribution, the same as last quarter.
The proven resiliency of our business and history of delivering results has allowed us to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders.
We continued to deliver strong results in 2020, despite the challenges of the COVID pandemic and fully expect to continue building on the strong performance in 2021 and beyond.
First off, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments for 2020 before walking through the 2021 guidance that we unveiled in December.
Our full-year 2020 accomplishments include the following: adjusted EBITDA of $739 million, a record for SUN and up 11% from 2019 levels; distributable cash flow, as adjusted, was $517 million, also a record for SUN and up 14% from 2019.
We improved our already strong coverage ratio to 1.5 times, up from 1.3 times in both 2018 and 2019.
Our cost reduction initiatives resulted in total operating expenses of $448 million, which was a reduction of 11% from 2019 levels.
Our fuel margin increased $0.018 per gallon from 2019 to $0.119 per gallon.
We successfully refinanced our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023, with new 4.5% Senior Notes due 2029, thereby lowering interest expense, while significantly expanding the weighted average maturity of our debt.
For reference, our nearest Senior Note debt maturity is now the 2026 Senior Notes.
And finally, we improved our leverage to 4.18 times, or 4.1 times when adjusted for total cash on hand from 4.6 times at the end of 2019.
Our liquidity remains strong, with an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and $97 million in cash at year-end.
With all these accomplishments as a backdrop, we enter 2021 poised to continue to deliver strong results.
In December, we provided guidance for 2021 for adjusted EBITDA of between $725 million and $765 million.
Underpinning this guidance are the following: fuel volumes in a range of 7.25 billion to 7.75 billion gallons; annual fuel margin between $0.11 per gallon and $0.12 per gallon; total operating expenses of between $440 million and $450 million; maintenance capital of $45 million; and growth capital of at least $120 million.
Free cash flow generating capability of this business allows us to focus on the pillars of our capital allocation strategy.
First, to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders.
Second, to protect our balance sheet through debt paydown when prudent.
And third, to pursue disciplined investment in our grow...
...u look back at our history, that would have likely resulted in margins close to $0.09 a gallon, maybe even dipping a little lower.
Fast forward to the post-COVID environment and the floor is higher, which is what our fourth quarter results look like after you account for the one-time adjustments and inventory timing impacts as Scott mentioned.
As we have stated before, the higher breakeven environment for many industry participants, both in the wholesale and retail channels, helps support the higher margin floor.
As we look to the first quarter, we've continued to see a steady rise in RBOB prices, putting pressure on margins.
And we still feel like a floor in the $0.095 to $0.10 range is reasonable for these tough market environments, excluding one-time issues in the quarter.
We already discussed some one-time items for the fourth quarter, and we expect the 7-Eleven catch-up payment in the first quarter that will provide a boost to our base margins.
Finally, I want to provide some more color around our expense performance.
For the last few years, we've been extremely focused on looking hard at what it takes to efficiently run our business.
When COVID hit, we took an even deeper look and made some tough choices.
Our expense performance in the third and fourth quarters show that we are able to operate at these levels.
There will always be some fluctuations in timing, and there were a few favorable one-time impacts in the fourth quarter that brought the expenses down even a little further than our run rate.
But the takeaway is that we have continued to deliver on our expense commitments, and are very comfortable with our guidance for this year.
We continue to add volume to our network.
Margins are solid, and our expense focus falls directly to the bottom line.
We delivered very strong results in 2020.
We came into 2020 financially healthy, and we finished the year stronger than where we started.
While countless companies had significant financial difficulties, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.
Last year, we delivered record EBITDA and DCF.
Over the last three years, we have steadily improved our coverage, while at the same time, decreasing our leverage ratio.
Looking forward, we expect to have another good year.
We're about a month and a half into the New Year and both fuel volume and RBOB costs continue to rise.
Since early November, both gasoline and diesel prices has steadily increased.
Over that time period, New York Harbor RBOB has gone up around $0.75 per gallon.
As you know, this is not the most conducive margin environment.
With that said, there are other important factors to consider.
Industry break-evens are higher.
We're seeing this play out, as the market continues to pass on price increases to the rack and to the street.
However, the steady constant rise in costs does create a time lag, resulting in short-term margin pressure.
Taking a step back, there will always be some quarters where the commodity environment provides noticeable headwind.
But there will also be quarters where the commodity environment will be highly supportive of wide margins.
History has shown that run-ups in prices are followed by periods of more volatile or falling prices that provide margin tailwinds.
When you look at our business beyond a quarter-by-quarter basis, we expect to have quality long-term results.
On the volume side, we're seeing positive increases in volume, excluding material regional weather events.
We expect this to continue over the course of this year.
Finally, you can expect us to deliver on expenses.
Moving on to growth, we'll continue to grow our field distribution business.
The opportunity set remains strong, and we expect these organic and M&A opportunities to remain for the foreseeable future.
On the midstream side, we remain patient looking for the right opportunity at the right price.
We'll continue to look for highly synergistic opportunities, while remaining financially disciplined.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors.
We direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations or FFO, core FFO, and Same-Center net operating income.
As such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, February 18, 2021.
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.
We request that everyone ask only one question and one follow-up to allow as many of you as possible to ask questions.
If time permits, we are happy for you to requeue for additional questions.
On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Clearly, 2020 was a year like no other.
And I want to express my deep appreciation for the entire Tanger team who have worked so diligently to navigate the challenges brought on by the global pandemic.
Virtually, all of our tenants have been facing mandates, directing them to close their stores, operate at reduced capacity and comply with additional health and safety measures.
In 2020, there were several retail bankruptcies and restructurings, resulting in space recapture and higher vacancy than historic levels.
But also providing us with opportunities to further diversify and upgrade our tenant mix.
This past year also highlighted the positive characteristics of the Tanger Outlet platform.
As evidenced, by the resilience, our portfolio has demonstrated since governmental mandates were lifted starting in the second quarter of 2020.
Our open-air centers provide an excellent value proposition for both retailers and shoppers that cannot be duplicated by e-commerce or other brick-and-mortar formats.
These desirable characteristics are demonstrated in our recent results, including the rapid pace that stores reopened after mandates were lifted and the positive trends in our traffic and rent collection metrics.
Our balance sheet further differentiates Tanger.
Our financial strategy has always been conservative, with a great emphasis on maintaining sufficient liquidity to provide optimal flexibility.
In January, given the meaningful improvement of our cash flows since the onset of the pandemic, we reinstated out dividend, which is an important part of our total return for shareholders.
As previously announced on January 1, I assumed the role of Executive Chair after 12 years as CEO.
And the more than 35 years that I've been with the company, I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished as the leader in the outlet industry.
We created a brand synonymous with quality Outlet Centers, became the go-to-channel for countless world-class brands and retailers, created thousands of jobs and prioritized our role as a community leader, contributor, and partner.
I have complete confidence in Steve's ability to lead the company during this transformative time and look forward to advising Steve through this transition.
We are encouraged by the opportunities we have identified to position the company to return to sustained growth over time.
Finally, I want to extend our best wishes to those who are in the path of the current winter storms and are being so impacted by the extreme weather and power outages.
I'm grateful and excited for the opportunity to lead Tanger through this important transition, in partnership with Steve, our Board of Directors, and the entire Tanger team.
While the last 11 months' have been challenging for our company, the positive traffic, rent collections and liquidity trends that Steve mentioned are all indicators that our business is stabilizing and our shoppers are quickly returning to our open-air outlet shopping centers.
During 2020, while navigating the pa...
... related to the fourth quarter build rents.
The write-offs were offset by the reversal of approximately $3.5 million in reserves related to rents previously deferred or under negotiation as a result of better-than-expected collections, leaving a net benefit of approximately $400,000.
In addition, we recognized a $1.1 million charge to core FFO related to the write-off of straight-line rents, which are not included in Same-Center NOI.
Through the end of January, we had collected 95% of fourth quarter rents build.
We also continue to collect rents build for prior periods, including amounts related to 2020, we allowed our tenants to defer to 2021.
As of January 31, our second quarter improved to 63% of build rents from 43%.
Third quarter improved to 91% from 89% and 57% of deferred rents had been collected, nearly half of which represented prepayments.
We collected 90% of the deferred rents that were due in January.
As of January 31, 2021, collections of January rents build were similar to collection rates for the fourth quarter.
Core FFO for the quarter was positively impacted by the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $4.1 million, which was significantly elevated over the prior year amount of approximately $100,000.
As previously discussed, we have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position and particularly through the pandemic, this discipline has proven to be critical.
With the improvements in rent collections, the ongoing focus on cost controls and a prudent approach to capital allocation, we had over $680 million of available liquidity, including over $80 million of cash and $600 million of unused capacity on our lines of credit as of the end of January.
We have no significant debt maturities until December 2023.
Given the improved rent collections and our ample liquidity position, our Board declared a dividend of $0.1775 per share, which was paid last week to holders of record on January 29.
We will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to capital allocation.
In addition to dividend distributions sufficient to maintain REIT status, our priority uses of capital include investing in our portfolio to grow NOI, reducing leverage to pre-COVID levels over time, and evaluating selective growth opportunities over the longer term.
While we are encouraged by the pace of leasing and progress of the initiatives that Steve Yalof discussed, we anticipate that there will be variability in our performance.
As the ongoing impact of the pandemic remains uncertain, we continue to anticipate pressure from current vacancies, additional potential store closures and rent modifications.
In light of this backdrop, we expect core FFO per share for 2021 to be between $1.47 and $1.57 per share.
This guidance assumes there are no further government mandated shutdowns and assumes lease termination fees decrease by $9 million to $10 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per share, from the elevated level we recognized in 2020.
Currently, we expect to recapture approximately 200,000 square feet due to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings during 2021, most of which we expect will occur during the first half of the year.
We are not providing any further detailed operational performance assumptions at this time.
However, we do anticipate there will be some variability in quarterly operational performance on a year-over-year comparison basis.
In 2020, we did not see any meaningful impact from COVID it in the first quarter.
And in the first quarter of 2021, there have been widespread winter storms across much of our portfolio.
We expect a combined annual recurring capital expenditures and second generation tenant allowances of approximately $40 million to $45 million for 2021.
Finally, we believe our balance sheet is well positioned from a liquidity perspective.
We are continuing to take the appropriate steps to navigate the current environment and maximize our financial flexibility.
Operator, can we take our first question.

[/INST] # Tanger Outlets reported resilience in the face of pandemic challenges, with rapid store reopenings and positive traffic and rent collection metrics. Despite bankruptcies and restructurings leading to higher vacancies, the company seized opportunities to diversify and upgrade its tenant mix. The financial strategy remains conservative, with ample liquidity exceeding $680 million and no significant debt maturities until December 2023. The dividend was reinstated in January. Core FFO guidance for 2021 is estimated between $1.47 and $1.57 per share, incorporating potential lease terminations and vacancies. Despite ongoing pandemic uncertainties, the company is actively exploring growth opportunities and managing capital allocation prudently. Rent collections remain strong, with 95% of Q4 rents collected. The company maintains a disciplined approach to operational performance and anticipates some variability in quarterly results due to the pandemic's impact and winter storms.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our speakers are Jim Owens, H.B. Fuller President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Corkrean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
First, a reminder that our comments today will include references to organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues.
We believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist their understanding of our operating performance and how our results compare with other companies.
Unless otherwise specified, discussion of sales and revenue refers to organic revenues and discussion of EPS, margins or EBITDA refers to adjusted non-GAAP measures.
Many of these risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by COVID-19 and resulting deterioration of the global business and economic environment.
Last evening, we reported first quarter results, which built upon the momentum we saw in Q4 of last year.
Organic revenues this quarter were up 10.5%, adjusted EBITDA was up 30% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 was nearly doubled last year's first quarter.
The H.B. Fuller team gained share and reduced operating expense in each of our businesses in 2020, which created the momentum that is delivering exceptional financial performance to begin fiscal 2021.
Market innovation and exceptional service led to the share gains as H.B. Fuller solved customer problems faster than competition and growth accelerated as demand continued to strengthen in the first quarter.
As we reported last March, COVID-19 impacted our fiscal Q1 of 2020 only in China and by about $15 million in revenue, $4.5 million in EBITDA and $0.06 of EPS.
Excluding this impact, our revenues were up 8% organically, EBITDA was up 23% and earnings per share was up 65%, exceptional results.
H.B. Fuller works with our customers to solve their toughest adhesive problems.
In today's remote work environment, this means collaborating in new ways and delivering market-driven innovation faster than ever.
For example, we proactively developed and qualified new engineering adhesives for mobile devices, automotive, electronics, electronic vehicle batteries and solar panels to name just a few.
These innovations helped drive one of our strongest quarters for engineering adhesive sales growth.
We created technology and branding opportunities with the new line of GorillaPro MRO adhesives and there will be more H.B. Fuller marketing innovation in the year ahead.
We work with Hygiene, Health and Consumable customers to develop innovative applications and to ensure supply to meet high demand for their products.
As a result, we substantially grew our sales across the majority of our HHC end markets in the first quarter.
H.B. Fuller's revenue growth was also broad based geographically in the quarter with organic growth in all three of our geographic regions.
Importantly, our growth came with positive incremental margins driven by product mix, reduced expenses and structural efficiencies resulting from our business realignment last year.
EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points year-on-year.
Raw material cost increased from where we exited 2020, but we're still relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter and in line with our expectations.
Raw material cost going forward will increase at a faster rate than originally anticipated due to increased demand, reduced inventories and supply constraint.
Winter storm Uri in the Gulf Coast in February has created additional tightening in the United States and is impacting global supply.
Supply has become tight for commodity materials, which make up a smaller portion of our portfolio.
As the year progresses, this will also have an impact on the supply and pricing of the specialty materials, which make up the majority of our purchases.
Most suppliers have made good progress in recovering from Uri.
However, the rate of recovery going forward will mostly depend on the output rates of the impacted assets and the time it takes for sup...
...llion in the quarter compared to $6 million during the same period last year.
Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today and the planning assumptions that Jim laid out earlier, we anticipate revenue to be up high single-digits to low double-digits versus 2020 and EBITDA to be between $455 million and $475 million as continued strong volume growth and pricing actions offset higher raw material costs.
We expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $200 million of debt during 2021.
We were very pleased with our strong start in the first quarter, which follows a strong fourth quarter, both of which greatly outperformed predominantly non-COVID quarters from the prior year.
We are growing through our strategy of delivering sustainable innovation and high value solutions and we are in a great position to continue to grow our business as global economies continue to open up in 2021.
This year, we will focus on three critical priorities to profitably grow our business in a dynamic environment.
Our top priority is to drive continued volume growth as we support our customers success in the current high demand and supply constrained environment.
This means continued growth through innovation, leverage of remote servicing tools as a new standard and finding creative ways to address any raw material shortages we see in the coming months.
Our second imperative is to strategically manage pricing aligned to the value we deliver in this inflationary environment.
Our company has built pricing tools and in-depth training in anticipation of the day when material inflation returned.
And we are already executing with speed and precision to maintain and grow our business while pricing to value.
Our third priority, to help fuel our growth will be to release productive capacity through our operational excellence programs.
Our 2020 operations investment was centered on creating the operational discipline and metrics that enable more productivity per employee work hour.
In a low capital-intensive business like ours, this helps to reduce cost and increase capacity.
We will also deliver an additional $200 million of debt reduction in 2021, moving the company closer to our net debt target of 2 to 3 times EBITDA.
On our conference call a year ago in March of 2020, I told you that because of our extraordinary collaboration with customers, a robust global operations and supply chain and our unmatched expertise and adhesive innovation, I was confident that H.B. Fuller which strengthened its position in this industry, setting ourselves apart from competition and enabling us to grow as global economies recover.
I was confident that we would emerge as an even stronger company than prior to the pandemic.
Our stronger performance throughout 2020 and our exceptional results in the first quarter are proof that my confidence was well founded.
This company is built on an agile business model where people collaborate remotely with each other, with customers and with suppliers around the globe.
In a changing world, these attributes of agility, collaboration and flexibility have enabled H.B. Fuller to excel.
As working conditions changed, supply and demand fluctuated and as supply constraints emerged, the H.B. Fuller team has been first and fastest among adhesive companies at addressing challenges.
Growing the business this year in a period of economic recovery presents exciting opportunities and unique challenges.
In 2021, our business priorities are squarely focused on capturing share and managing inflation risks as we continue to build on our rising leadership position in the global adhesives industry.
Our culture of collaboration and innovation and our improving operational execution gives me confidence that we are strongly positioned to continue to deliver sustained value for our shareholders in 2021 and in the years ahead.
Operator, please open up the call so we can take some questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Leading our call today will be Mike Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Lower, our Chief Financial Officer.
I will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.
Today, we reported all-time record quarterly results with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.43, an increase of 94% compared to last year.
During the fourth quarter, same-store revenue increased $265 million or 5% compared to the prior year, a solid growth and new used and customer financial services revenue was partially offset by decline in customer care which has experienced a slower recovery correlated with lower miles driven.
New vehicle inventory levels remain constrained and we expect demand to exceed supply for an extended period.
Given these dynamics, we remain focused on optimizing our business in the current operating environment.
We expect industry sales to approach $16 million in 2000 -- 2021 with strong retail sales growth compared to last year.
We've seen a solid growth in '21 with January trends in line with our annual forecast.
For the quarter, same-store total variable gross profit per vehicle retailed increased $765 or 21% compared to the prior year.
Same-store new vehicle gross profit per vehicle retailed increased $919 or 50% and same-store used vehicle gross profit per vehicle retail increased $127 or 9% compared to the prior year.
We drove significant SG&A leverage in the quarter, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 63.8% for the quarter, representing an 820 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We remain committed to operating below 68% SG&A as a percent of gross profit on a long-term basis.
We continue -- our continuing our opportunistic capital allocation strategy that balances investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders.
We expect to allocate capital toward the AutoNation USA expansion share repurchase and franchise acquisitions.
Today, we announced our Board authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchase from October 22 through February 12.
We bought back 6 million shares or 7% of our outstanding shares.
We remain on track to open five new AutoNation USA stores by the end of this year.
The stores will be located in Austin, Phoenix and San Antonio and two stores in Denver.
We are also entered the planning phase to open an additional 10 AutoNation USA stores in 2022.
These stores will benefit from the AutoNation brand and its proven customer friendly processes.
We have set the long-term goal of selling over 1 million combined new and used retail units per year.
We recently announced that we have enhanced AutoNation Express, our integrated retailing solution that provides customers with a seamless and intuitive omnichannel shopping and purchase experience.
AutoNation Express is powered by real-time customer insights that provide a highly personalized mobile optimized step-by-step digital experience.
As Mike highlighted, today we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $213 million or $2.43 per share versus $113 million or $1.25 per share during the fourth quarter of 2019.
This represents an all-time high quarterly earnings per share and a 94% increase year-over-year.
The results were driven by solid growth in new used customer Financial Services profitability, partially offset by a decline in customer care.
During the quarter, new vehicle demand continued to exceed supply while our We'll Buy Your Car program supported our used vehicle inventories.
Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted results exclude a non-cash accounting loss of $62 million after tax or $0.70 per share associated with our equity investment in Vroom.
Moving to the balance sheet and liquidity.
Our cash balance at quarter end was $570 million which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of approximately $2.3 billion at the end of December.
Note, in January of this year, we paid the maturity of our $300 million, 3.35% senior notes from available cash on our balance sheet.
Our covenant leverage of debt-to-EBITDA declined to 1.8 times at the end of the fourth quarter, down from 2.0 times at the end of the third quarter, including cash and used floorplan availability, our net leverage ratio was 1.3 times at year-end.
During the fourth quarter, we sold 3.1 million shares of our equity investment in Vroom for proceeds of $105 million.
Early in 2021, we sold the remaining shares of Vroom for proceeds of $109 million.
So in total, we realized a cash gain of $165 million on our investment.
AutoNation remains committing -- committed to delivering shareholder value through capital allocation, which includes attractive organic growth opportunities, a disciplined acquisition strategy, an opportunistic share repurchase.
Our AutoNation USA expansion provides an attractive growth opportunity and we remain on track to open five new AutoNation USA stores in 2021, an additional 10 in 2022 as Mike addressed earlier.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $302 million.
Year-to-date in 2021 through February 12, we repurchased an additional 1.3 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $95 million.
Today, as Mike mentioned, we also announced that our Board has increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion.
With the increased authorization, the company has approximately $1.1 billion available for additional share repurchase.
And as of February 12, there were approximately 82 million shares outstanding, excluding the dilutive impact of certain stock awards.
2020 was an unimaginable year but our associates came together and delivered record results.
We sold our 13 million vehicle in December, the only automotive retail in history to do so.
We have raised over $25 million in the fight against cancer.
We create the largest and most recognized automotive retail brand and we did it one sale, one service, one vehicle, at a time.
The acknowledgment and brand awareness continue on AutoNation was recognized for the third year in a row.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before turning the call over to Ron, I'd like to make a few comments about forward-statements.
Dan Malone, our CFO, will begin our call with a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and the year-end 2020, and I will then provide a few more comments on these results.
The key takeaways from our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results are: fourth quarter sales were down 3.8%, record full year sales were up 4% with the help of acquisitions, but down 11% without.
Fourth quarter net income and earnings per share were down 16% from the prior fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and down about 6% on an adjusted basis.
Full year net income and earnings per share were down 10% from prior year on a GAAP basis, but increased more than 2% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.
Full year adjusted EBITDA was up 11.6% from the prior year and essentially flat to the third quarter trailing 12-month result with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding by nearly 100 basis points over prior year.
Record full year operating cash flow of $184.3 million was up 108% over prior year, and fourth quarter operating cash flow exceeded an unusually strong operating cash flow performance in the prior year quarter.
Outstanding debt was reduced by $158.6 million in 2020, and our debt net of cash position improved by $166.5 million during the year.
Record backlog of $354.1 million was up 35.6% over the prior year-end.
Fourth quarter 2020 net sales of $288.6 million or 3.8% lower than the prior year quarter.
While we saw a strong rise in order rates and backlog, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact our manufacturing efficiencies and inbound supply chain during the quarter.
Also the timing of these new orders and the fact that strong customer demand hasn't been consistent across all of our business segments has limited the immediate top line impact.
Full year 2020 net sales of $1.16 billion were a Company record and 4% higher than the prior year with the contribution of the Morbark and Dutch Power acquisitions.
Without these acquisitions, organic sales were down 11% from prior year.
Net income for the fourth quarter was $8 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared to prior year fourth quarter net income of $9.6 million or $0.81 per diluted share.
Excluding the Morbark inventory step-up expense, severance cost related to a plant closure, one-time acquisition transaction cost and acquisition-related amortization expense, adjusted fourth quarter 2020 net income was $13 million or $1.10 per diluted share compared to $13.8 million or $1.18 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
Net income for full year 2020 was $56.6 million or $4.78 per diluted share compared to net income of $62.9 million or $5.33 per diluted share for the prior year.
Excluding the full year impact of the adjustments I just mentioned in the quarter comparison, adjusted full year net income was $70.3 million or $5.94 per diluted share compared to $68.4 million or $5.80 per diluted share in the prior year.
Industrial Division fourth quarter 2020 net sales of $202.7 million represented an 8.9% decrease from the prior year quarter due to the pandemic-related impact on customer demand and disruptions to our supply chain and operations.
While this division ended the year with higher backlog than the previous year-end, the surge in orders that created this favorable comparison is largely concentrated in forestry and tree care products.
Other business units, notably those serving the municipal government sector, finished the year with order backlog below pre-pandemic levels.
Agricultural Division fourth quarter 2020 sales were $85.9 million, up 10.5% from the prior year fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to see strong organic growth across this division.
The immediate top line benefit of the surge in customer demand was constrained by the negative impact of the pandemic on inbound supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies, as previously mentioned.
Full year 2020 ad...
...hallenging year.
Alamo Group's Industrial Division performed well in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the full year, even though for us, they probably had the most market challenges due to COVID.
The biggest end user of their products are governmental entities, most of which struggled with budgetary issues during the year and are still being impacted today.
Yet while organically, our sales were off, they still held up well due to the stable nature of demand for our types of products that continued to be used through the year for infrastructure maintenance.
And we're pleased bookings, which were very soft in the second quarter and gradually and steadily increased each quarter since then, have continued this trend as we moved into 2021.
As Dan pointed out, some of it's a little spotty.
Some units are doing better than other units.
But certainly in total, they're up.
And it's interesting like -- say like Morbark, one of our new units, they were probably hurt the most early on COVID, and yet, they have come back the most -- the strongest, as things have continued to build back up.
So, it had been a little spotty but in total, as I said, it continues to be good and strong.
Certainly, our Agricultural Division has held up even better and actually showed a small increase in sales for the year and margins did even better.
We were -- I think the ag sector in general was helped by increased subsidies to farmers during the year, and actually we started -- COVID [Phonetic] period started with fairly low levels of dealer inventories going into the year 2020 due to the weak agricultural industry of the last several years.
So as a result, at the end of the year, as I said, we have record backlogs.
Dealer inventories are still fairly on the low end, so there's still more upside potential there.
But we're also seeing improved commodity prices in the ag industry.
So, the outlook for further growth in this division is very positive as we move into 2021.
In fact, we believe the positive trends we are seeing in both of our divisions bode well for Alamo Group's outlook for 2021, though the pandemic and its repercussions, as well as all the impacts it has had on the global economy are still far from over.
For us specifically, ongoing COVID infections are spotty, but certainly are still causing challenges.
Supply chain issues are affecting us and many -- almost everybody in our industry.
Everything from truck chassis, tractors and all are out -- the lead times on them have nearly doubled for many of our key inputs.
Certainly, even the adverse weather conditions of the last several weeks, especially in Texas, not only were a couple of our plants closed for couple days, but we saw like one major supplier that -- they said they were closed four days, and so now they are two weeks later than their plan.
So, that's causing some issues.
And we're also seeing a few inflationary pressures too in this which -- I think with our reactions to that, that will -- most of that will flow through fairly quickly.
But in the short term, it can have some effect on our -- all of our operations.
So, all these issues together will certainly dampen our first quarter performance, but we actually feel quite good about the year 2021 in total.
There is positive momentum in our markets.
There is stable demand for our types of products, which continue to be used daily in maintenance and operations and are wearing out on a regular basis.
In addition, contributions from recent acquisitions, ongoing operational improvement initiatives, as I've said, such as the plant consolidation initiatives we've taken on, altogether make the outlook for the full year of 2021 very bright for Alamo Group.
And we certainly hope that the greater availability of the new COVID vaccines will start to take -- have a impact on the pandemic and will begin to abate and we can all return to a little bit more conditions.
But regardless, we actually feel quite good about the outlook for Alamo for 2021.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations.
Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continue to drive demand.
At the same time vacancies are at unprecedented lows.
Space in our markets is effectively sold out.
In the last 90 days supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need.
As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers.
During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet.
Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased.
Our last touch segment continued to gain momentum with new lease signings growing by 44%.
Ecommerce requirements continue to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing one quarter of new lease signings.
The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend.
Given the sharp ramp-up in demand, we are raising our 2021 US forecast for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%.
I want to point out that we revised our dataset here, this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets.
Strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy pre-leasing in the US, the Liberty pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continue to compete for space.
Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rent and value growth.
In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our US markets, far exceeding our expectations.
We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% for the US and 70% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points.
Our in-place-to-market rent spread jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias.
This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million or $1.25 per share.
Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases.
Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increased to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%, sorry about that.
We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade.
Switching gears to results for the quarter.
Core FFO was $1.04 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.01.
Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix.
Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially and we reached 98% leased at quarter end.
Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially.
We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front.
Margins on development stabilizations remained elevated, coming in at 47%.
Our development starts were $1.4 billion, consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets, with estimated value creation of more than $520 million.
Turning to strategic capital, our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date.
Equity cues for our open-ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter end, another all-time high.
Moving to guidance for 2021.
Our outlook has further improved and here are the key updates on our share basis.
We are tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%.
We're increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes by $12.5 million and now range between $480 million and $485 million.
We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance.
In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion.
Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet and more than $21 billion of future build-out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years.
We're also increasing the midpoint for acquisitions by $500 million.
The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban last touch opportunities.
We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint.
Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 to $4.13 per share.
Core FFO excluding promotes will range between $4.06 and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14%, while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points.
We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio below 60% range.
While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future.
Our 22% in-place-to-market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development, build out, and most importantly the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides, all pave the way for both significant and durable long-term growth.
As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won't be solved overnight.
Prologis plays a unique role in the industry and we're committed to helping find long-term solutions, that's why we're working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity.
In closing, I want to highlight two important upcoming Prologis events.
First, this Monday, we'll be hosting a webinar that we'll dive into our development and strategic capital businesses.
And second, on October 27, we're bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some the most pressing issues in logistics today including workforce, energy and transportation.
Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events.

Operating conditions are shaped by structural demand and unprecedented low vacancies, leading to a sense of urgency among customers. Despite sequential declines, lease signings remain above trend, with ecommerce representing a significant portion. The company raised its US net absorption forecast by 14% to a record 375 million square feet and projects a year-end vacancy rate of 4%. Global rent growth surpassed expectations, reaching 7.1% in the US and 70% globally. This has resulted in a 500 basis point jump in the in-place-to-market rent spread, representing over $925 million in organic NOI growth. Valuation increases have been substantial, with the logistics portfolio posting a 9.5% quarterly increase. The company anticipates demand tailwinds over the next decade due to network reconfigurations and expansions. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.04 per share, and cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%. Development margins remained elevated at 47%, and $1.4 billion in development starts are expected to create over $520 million in value. Prologis raised $500 million in strategic capital during the quarter and tightened its cash same-store NOI growth guidance to 5.75%-6%. The company increased its development starts, acquisition guidance, and net deployment uses. Core FFO per share is now expected to range from $4.11 to $4.13, with 14% year-over-year growth and deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. Prologis believes that disruptions in the supply chain will drive long-term growth and is committed to finding solutions to address issues such as space scarcity, transportation infrastructure, and labor shortages.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 The second quarter exceeded our expectations, both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond.
With our exceptional portfolio and team, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter.
Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remain the healthiest in our 38-year history.
In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet, both remained above average and were driven by new and development leasing.
Likewise, at the largest IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, and early indicator of strong future demand.
Our leasing mix is broad.
Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet.
For smaller spaces, activity is picking up.
We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in three years.
For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter.
While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many mortgage commerce players come to the table.
For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year.
Supply chains are racing, beginning to restart.
And as they do, it will create more demand going forward.
Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels as retailers replenish their supply chains.
While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retail sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels.
We see the current low level of inventories in our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%.
This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with sub-optimal levels of inventory.
Putting together recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet.
Looking forward, we foresee continued supply balanced by demand with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022.
With balanced demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving the record rent and value growth.
Our operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter end.
Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days.
When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exist in our markets and include a lack of buyable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement costs.
Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website.
Our supply watchlist remains quite small.
We reviewed Houston in the quarter, leaving just Spain and Poland.
Accelerating demand in the quarter combined with ultra-low vacancies translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets, exceeding our expectations.
As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast an all time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points.
Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially.
This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI or $0.90 per share.
Our assets have strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%.
On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees.
Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we created substantial value through our operational advantages.
As a result, we know the real estate is worth more in our hands.
Accordingly, we are now includin...
...agement fee income as the bone in the adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure.
Switching gears to results for the quarter, our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results.
Core FFO was $1.01 per share with net promote earnings effectively zero, rent change on rollover was 32%.
Occupancy at quarter end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially.
Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated by 5.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year.
We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed off $880 million of non-strategic assets across our portfolio.
In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of a $920 million owned and managed portfolio including all of the non-strategic IPT assets.
It's worth noting that to date we have sold $2 billion of non-strategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions by pricing more than 23% above underwriting.
Turning to strategic capital.
Our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter.
Equity cues from our open-ended vehicles [Indecipherable] $3.3 billion at quarter end, hitting another all-time high.
Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversified to more sector specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector.
In light of recent asset management transactions and public comps, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is legally understated.
For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion.
Moving to guidance for 2021.
Our outlook is further improved given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand.
Here are the key updates on an our share basis.
We're increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%.
We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average.
We are increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance.
This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values.
Faster development lease-up and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes.
We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance.
We're also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion.
Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume.
Our owned and managed land portfolios compose of land, options and covered land place supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years.
We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total.
This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year given the timing to redeploy incremental proceeds.
We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021.
Taking into assumption there is no account, we're increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share.
Core FFO excluding promotes will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%.
We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage, and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low-60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion.
In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising.
Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear.
We have a significant embedded in place to market rent spread, the development ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining the call today are Tom Ferguson, Chief Executive Officer; Philip Schlom, Chief Financial Officer; and David Nark, Senior Vice President, Marketing, Communications and IR.
Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in customer demand and response to products and services offered by the company, including demand by the power generation markets, electrical transmission and distribution markets, the industrial markets and the metal coatings markets; prices and raw material costs, including zinc and natural gas, which are used in the hot-dip galvanizing process; changes in the political stability and economic conditions of the various markets that AZZ serves, foreign and domestic; customer-requested delays of shipments; acquisition opportunities; currency exchange rates; adequate financing; and availability of experienced management and employees to implement the company's growth strategies.
In addition, AZZ's customers and its operations could be potentially adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
While we continue to be impacted by COVID-19, our markets are stabilizing and our businesses have adapted to the new normal way of operating, which encompasses a variety of challenges that we have had to overcome.
While we have had an uptick in COVID cases, all of our plants have remained open with normal production.
The collective efforts of our folks generated consolidated sales of $227 million for the third quarter, split almost equally between our Metal Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions segments.
We had sequential improvement in operating performance, and we have returned over $44 million of capital to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases through the third quarter of this year.
Also, we have made good progress on our Board-led strategic review that we announced earlier.
While sales were down 22% from Q3 of last year, our realignment activities and operational performance generated net income of $19.7 million, down about 10% from the same period of the prior year.
This resulted in earnings per share of $0.76 per diluted share, or $0.80 on an adjusted basis.
Our Metal Coatings business continues to execute strongly while navigating the economic uncertainty resulting from COVID.
Hot-dip galvanizing sales were down 8.8% from the same quarter last year, while Surface Technologies was down more due to the nature of their customer base being more impacted by COVID.
Within our Infrastructure Solutions segment, third quarter sales results improved sequentially, even with a muted fall refining turnaround season.
Segment results were below the same quarter of the prior year due to the protracted weak demand for refined oil products, as well as lower international sales, primarily from China.
As we previously communicated earlier this year due to shifting industry and customer dynamics and the protracted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to take aggressive steps to accelerate the strategic restructure of our portfolio of businesses with the goal of becoming predominantly a coatings business.
Our actions during the quarter included recording a loss on the sale of SMS of $1.9 million and initiating a comprehensive Board-led review of our businesses with the assistance of leading independent financial, legal and tax advisors.
As I mentioned, our review of the Infrastructure Solutions businesses and associated assets, and the exploration of other capital allocation opportunities to maximize shareholder value is ongoing and I am pleased with the progress the team has made during the quarter.
Finally, given the share repurchases currently and attractive use of our capital, we repurchased over 652,000 shares in the quarter, which brings our total for the year to over 850,000 shares.
While our Metal Coatings segment had lower sales in the third quarter of the prior year, they were able to generate higher operating income and improved operating margins to 24.8%.
Surf...
... excluding the impact of the $20.3 million of restructuring and impairment charges, operating margins were 9.8% or 80 basis points below prior year.
I'll now turn to discussion regarding our liquidity and capital allocation.
On a year-to-date basis, our net cash provided by operating activities of $59.4 million declined $12.7 million or 17.6% from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily the impact of lower year-to-date net income.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as Tom had noted, we repurchased 652,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.66.
On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 852,000 million [phonetic] shares at an average price of $36.31 per share.
Investments in capital equipment to support our business were $8.6 million for the third quarter and $27.9 million on a year-to-date basis, which are in line with our expectations of spending roughly $35 million for the year.
As of the end of our third quarter of fiscal '21, our existing debt of $182 million is down $20.9 million from the end of the year, as we continue to effectively manage our balance sheet.
I will close by sharing with you some key indicators that we continue to monitor.
For the Metal Coatings segment, fabrication activity will remain solid during the balance of our fourth quarter and we are off to a reasonably good start in December.
Within our galvanizing business, we are closely tracking steel fabrication and construction activity.
Zinc costs in our kettles are relatively stable, but we anticipate increases in zinc costs in fiscal 2022 as zinc prices on the LME have been rising for a while now.
The Acme Galvanizing team is being quickly integrated into our existing operating network, bringing our total hot-dip galvanizing locations to a market-leading 40 sites in North America, in spite of recently closing two Gulf Coast locations.
For Surface Technologies, we are primarily focused on growing sales with both existing and new customers and driving operational process improvements.
Within the Industrial platform of the Infrastructure Solutions segment, we continue to carefully monitor the COVID situation in the states with large refining capacities.
Currently, we still are experiencing travel restrictions in some countries.
For the Electrical platform of the Infrastructure Solutions segment, we are carefully tracking proposal activity and experienced solid bookings in December.
We will continue to focus on growing the backlog for many of our business units so that we enter fiscal year 2022 in good shape.
Finally, for corporate, we have strong cash management processes and have further focused our oversight on cash flow indicators and customer credit.
Currently, we have not experienced any slowdown in customer payments.
Post-COVID crisis, we remain committed to our growth strategy around Metal Coatings and achieving 21% to 23% operating margins, including an increased contribution from Surface Technologies.
We believe galvanizing would tend to run to the high end, if not above the 23%, while Surface Technologies is going to have to rebuild this margin profile as customer demand grows.
For Infrastructure Solutions, we will continue to focus on improving operating margins while we complete the comprehensive strategic evaluation of this segment.
We feel quite confident, in spite of COVID and other disruptions, about the actions we have already taken and the restructuring activities that are now under way.
We intend to focus on completing the Board-led review of our businesses and finish this fiscal year well positioned to enter fiscal 2022 with momentum.
Finally, we will remain active in the area of M&A, primarily in Metal Coatings, and we'll aggressively seek activities that support our strategic growth plan.
While pandemic-related deal travel was still somewhat restricted during the third quarter, we are seeing improved travel conditions and have an active portfolio of opportunities that we will continue to pursue.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 But before we begin, I would like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of widespread raw material and labor shortages at our suppliers and at our third-party manufacturers.
Now let's talk about the results.
Q3 was a solid quarter.
Reported sales growth was 5.7%, organic sales growth grew 3.7% and exceeded our 1.5% Q3 outlook.
The 3.7% organic growth rate in the quarter is impressive, considering the prior year Q3 2020 organic sales growth was 9.9%.
So that's growth on top of growth.
The adjusted earnings per share was $0.80, and that's $0.10 better than our outlook.
We grew consumption in 12 of the 16 categories in which we compete, and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year.
Regarding brand performance, five of our brands saw a double-digit consumption growth, and I'll name them for you: vitamins, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, Scent Boosters, BATISTE and ZICAM.
And although many of our brands experienced double-digit consumption growth, it's not all reflected in our 3.7% organic sales growth as shipments were constrained by supply issues.
In Q3, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.3%.
Our online sales increased by 2% year-over-year.
Now keep in mind, this is on top of 100% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q3 2020 versus 2019.
And we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of total sales.
Now as described in the release, Hurricane Ida's impact was substantial, which resulted in limited availability of raw materials and caused our fill levels to continue to be below normal.
Labor shortages at suppliers and third-party manufacturers have constrained their ability to produce.
Transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems.
Now the good news is that over the past 18 months, we have made our supply chain more resilient by qualifying dozens of new suppliers and co-packers, which provides, of course, both short-term and long-term benefits.
And in a few minutes, Rick will tell you about our plans to expand capacity in 2022, with a significant increase in capex next year to support our growth plans.
Now due to the lower than normal case fill rate, we pulled back on Q3 marketing compared to the prior year, and we expect the supply issues to begin to abate in the first half of 2022.
Our biggest issue is widespread inflation.
We're dealing with significant inflation of raw and packaging materials, labor, transportation and component costs which is compressing our gross margin.
These conditions are expected to continue well into 2022, and Rick will cover gross margin in his remarks in a few minutes.
On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories to perform in 2021.
Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent.
Just to name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter has remained elevated in 2021.
The condoms, dry shampoo and water flosser categories have recovered and are experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility.
Baking soda and oral analgesics have declined from COVID highs as expected.
So now I'm going to talk about each business.
First up is Consumer Domestic.
So the Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%, and this is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q3 2020.
Looking at market shares in Q3, six of our 13 power brands gained share, and our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues.
I will comment on a few of the brands right now.
Vitafusion gummy vitamins saw a huge consumption growth in Q3, up 24%.
Consumers have made health and wellness a priority.
It appears that the new consumers that came into the category are staying, because if we look at the last year, Vitafusion household penetration is up almost 10%.
Batiste dry s...
...s margin was impacted by 500 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor.
Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 40 basis points.
These costs were partially offset by a positive 250 basis point impact from price/volume mix and a positive 120 basis point impact from productivity.
Marketing was down $10 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover.
Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was healthy at 12.3%.
For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased to 180 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp.
Other expense all-in was $12.1 million, a slight decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates.
And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared to 17.3% in 2020, an increase of 310 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises.
We continue to expect the full year rate to be 23%.
And net of cash.
For the first nine months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 18% to $653 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital.
We continue to expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year.
As of September 30, cash on hand was $180 million.
Our full year capex plan is now $120 million, down from the original $180 million in the outlook due to project timing.
This capex moves out a year, and we now expect capex in 2022 to exceed $200 million.
Future is bright as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins.
On October 28, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program up to $1 billion.
As you read in the release, this is a sign of our confidence in the company's future performance and the expectations of our robust cash flow generation.
Our number one priority for capital allocation remains acquisitions, and given our low leverage ratios, we have confidence to do both.
Through October, we purchased approximately $130 million worth of shares.
And in Q4, we will likely get ahead of our 2022 planned purchases as well.
And now for the full year outlook.
We now expect the full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and organic sales growth to be approximately 4%.
Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments.
We expect our customer fill levels to improve throughout Q4.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be down 170 basis points, previously down to 75 basis points.
This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad-based inflation on raw costs and transportation costs.
That was exacerbated by Hurricane Ida.
In our prior outlook, we had discussed $125 million of higher cost versus our plan.
That number today is $170 million, and the majority of that increase in the last 90 days relate to transportation, labor, and other increases.
As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin.
The $45 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily noncommodity-related.
Commodity spot pricing today is elevated compared to spot pricing just three months ago.
And now for the full year.
We expect adjusted earnings per share to be 6%.
Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth lap almost 10% organic growth a year ago.
And while inflation is broad based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence over the long term.
For our Q4 outlook, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3%.
We expect organic sales growth of approximately 2% due to the supply chain constraints and our SPD business to return to a more normal growth rate.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.61 per share, up 15% from last year's adjusted EPS.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration.
Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.
For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 9.3%, reflecting growth versus 2019 for all our major businesses.
This strong result was driven by standout performances from Neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine and our U.S. shoulder and total ankle products.
Each of these posted very strong double-digit growth.
International organic growth outpaced the U.S. at 14.2% despite COVID challenges in some countries.
We posted double-digit growth in most regions, including excellent results in South Pacific, China, Canada, South Korea and many countries in Western Europe.
We were also pleased to see the continued rebound in elective procedures as both hips and knees saw quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement and both returned to growth.
Also, now that we have a fuller appreciation of Wright Medical, we are delighted to have it within the Stryker family.
With our first half organic growth of 7.1%, combined with continued recovery of electric procedures, a strong order book across our capital businesses and new product innovations, we have increased confidence in the full year outlook.
This is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to 9% to 10% compared to 2019.
Our sales performance carried through the rest of our results with strong margin performance and adjusted earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion of over 100% in the quarter.
Through the remainder of the year, we do expect a disciplined increase in spending to support our future growth expectations.
Our bullish sales outlook, combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration has resulted in a raised full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.25 to $9.40 a share.
I continue to be impressed with the resiliency of our people and culture, which positions us well for a successful 2021 and beyond.
My comments today will focus on the second quarter performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business, including an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical.
During the quarter, our combined worldwide Trauma and Extremities business, including Wright Medical had a strong performance, growing 7% compared to 2019.
The performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. Trauma and Upper Extremities businesses.
U.S. businesses were benefited by the recovery from COVID-related restrictions, which continues to outpace the rest of the world as well as the ongoing execution of the U.S. selling integration.
The Trauma business unit was positively impacted by the reopening of economies and the continued strong performance of key products, including T2 Alpha, and the mini-frag plating system.
Our U.S. upper extremities business, which remains number one in shoulder arthroplasty, grew strong double digits in the quarter behind continued strength within reverse ARPA plastic portfolio with Perform reverse and revision driving the growth.
The upper extremities performance in the quarter was enhanced by the continued adoption of our BLUEPRINT planning software with approximately 50% of total shoulder cases completed using BLUEPRINT.
As a result of the strong performance of our Trauma and Extremities business, which grew approximately 5% in the first half of the year, we are confident in the combined business to grow at least 6% for the full year when compared to 2019.
We are now about nine months into the integration of Wright Medical and we remain very pleased with the progress and efficiency at which the team is moving through the integration.
The U.S. integration is pacing ahead of our expectations and cross-selling has begun in a limited capacity.
We expect to continue to execute on our cross-selling priorities during the second ...
...ted by strong product growth in Sonopet IQ, bipolar forceps, max space, cryotherapy and nasal implants.
Additionally, our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of our products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic.
Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 28.8%.
This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia.
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter.
Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was a favorable approximately 15 basis points from second quarter 2019 compared to the second quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by business mix and acquisitions, primarily offset by price.
Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation.
Our adjusted SG&A was 33.4% of sales, which was slightly better than the second quarter of 2019.
The reflects our continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the impact of the Wright Medical acquisition.
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which is five basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2019.
This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum combined with the disciplined ramp-up in costs offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions.
Based on our positive momentum, we continue to reiterate our op margin guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019, excluding the impact of Wright Medical.
Related to other income and expense, as compared to the second quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense resulting from the additional debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition.
Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 17% and was impacted by our mix of U.S. non-U.S. income and some adverse discrete tax items included in our provision to return adjustments.
Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 15.2%.
For the full year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5% with some variability in the remaining quarters, including a slightly lower rate in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter.
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion.
During the quarter, we fully repaid the $400 million of term loan debt related to the borrowings incurred for the acquisition of Wright Medical.
Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.15 billion of debt.
Turning to cash flow.
Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion.
This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management.
And now I will provide a summary of our revised guidance.
Based on our performance in sales ramp in the second quarter as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%.
As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be at least 6% for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019.
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%.
Consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $0.10 in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range.
Based on our performance in the first six months and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.25 to $9.40.
And now we will open up the call up for Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.
Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q later today or tomorrow.
The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, highlighted by a 48% increase in earnings to $3.17 per diluted share.
Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 45% to $1.5 billion on a 19% increase in revenues and our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 380 basis points to 21.2%.
Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 38.5% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 32.4%.
These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint.
Even with the recent rise in mortgage rates, housing market conditions remain very robust and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to increase our market share.
There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market.
We are focused on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce construction cycle times to our historical norms.
After starting construction on 25,500 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from a year ago to 54,800 homes with only 1,000 unsold completed homes across the nation.
Our January home starts and net sales holders were in line with our targets and we are well positioned to achieve double-digit volume growth in 2022.
We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions.
We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize returns.
Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 48% to $3.17 per diluted share compared to $2.14 per share in the prior-year quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 44% to $1.1 billion compared to $792 million.
Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 17% to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed, up from $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed in the prior year.
Our average closing price for the quarter was $361,800, up 19% from the prior-year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%.
Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 5% to 21,522 homes, while the value increased 29% from the prior year to $8.3 billion.
A year ago, our first quarter net sales orders were up 56% due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sale and prior to the significant supply chain challenges we've experienced since.
Our average number of active selling communities decreased 3% from the prior-year quarter and was up 3% sequentially.
Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $383,600, up 22% from the prior-year quarter.
The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 15%, down from 18% in the prior-year quarter.
New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates.
Our local teams are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle so we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to start of home construction.
We plan to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner during the spring and we expect our number of net sales orders in o...
...being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic.
During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $115 million as we invested significant operating capital to increase our homes and inventory to meet the current strong demand.
At December 31, we had $4.1 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.
We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the scale and activity of our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.
Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 6.9%.
Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 25.1% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.2%.
At December 31, our stockholders' equity was $15.7 billion and book value per share was $44.25, up 29% from a year ago.
For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 32.4% compared to 24.4% a year ago.
During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $80.1 million and our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February.
We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $278.2 million during the quarter.
Our remaining share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $268 million.
We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year.
As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from homebuyers, but continuing supply chain challenges.
We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 19,000 and 20,000 homes.
We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 27.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 7.5%.
We anticipate the financial services pre-tax profit margin in the range of 30% to 35% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the second quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect to close between 90,000 and 92,000 homes, while we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of $34.5 billion to $35.5 billion.
We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24% and we also continue to expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021.
We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year after our investments in home building inventories to support double-digit growth.
We will then continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares.
In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands.
Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions.
We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases on a consistent basis.
Horton team for your focus and hard work.
We are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022.
We will now host questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 stepan.com under the Investors section of our website.
Although many parts of the world are slowly improving, the Delta Variant continues to spread, and vaccine rates in much of the developed world have stalled.
Global supply chain disruptions are impacting commerce and many of the products we all use every day have been impacted.
At Stepan, our team continues to navigate through the turbulent environment to help our customers serve the market.
Adjusted third quarter net income was $36.4 million flat with prior year.
The negative impact of the global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures was offset by one-time tax benefits.
Year-to-date adjusted net income was $121 million or $5.20 per diluted share.
Both adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were up 22% versus the first nine months of 2020.
Surfactants was also negatively impacted by lower consumer demand for cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products which have dropped since the pandemic peak in 2020.
In the third quarter, each of our Company's three global business segments was negatively affected by raw material price inflation and significant supply chain disruptions including raw material shortages and logistics constraints.
Surfactant operating income was down 16% largely due to higher North American supply chain cost, driven by inflation, higher planned maintenance costs and the $2.2 million insurance recovery related to the Millsdale plant in 2020.
Our Polymer operating income was down 12%, mostly due to the non-recurrence of the insurance recovery and the compensation received from the Chinese government in the third quarter of 2020.
Global Polymer sales volume rose 27% and was largely driven by the INVISTA acquisition.
Our Specialty Product business rose by 53%, and was mainly due to order timing differences within our food and flavor business.
Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock $0.335 per share payable on December 15, 2021.
With this 9.8% increase, Stepan has now increased and paid its dividend for 54 consecutive years.
The Board also authorized the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of its common stock, further demonstrating our commitment to deliver stockholder value through disciplined capital allocation.
Our strong balance sheet and cash generation will allow us to invest in our current business and pursue strategic opportunities while we return capital to our stockholders.
Luis will now share some details about our third quarter and year-to-date results.
Let's start with the Slide 4 to recap the quarter.
Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $36.4 million or $1.57 per diluted share, basically flat versus the third quarter of 2020.
Because adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure, we provide full reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures.
Specifically, adjustment to reported net income this quarter consists of adjustment for deferred compensation, environmental reserves increase, and minor restructuring expenses.
Adjusted net income for the quarter exclude deferred compensation income of $1.1 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to deferred compensation expense of $2.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the same period last year.
The deferred compensation numbers represent the net expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan as well as cash-settled stock appreciation rights for our employees.
Because these liabilities change with the movement in the stock price, we exclude these items from our operational discussion.
Slide 5 shows the total Company earnings bridge for the third quarter, compared to last year's third quarter, and breaks down the increase in adjusted net income.
Because this is net income, the figures noted here are on an after-tax basis.
We will cover each segment in more detail.
But to summarize, Surfactants and Polymers were down, while Specialty Product was up versus the prior year.
Corporate expenses and al...
...ct formulations.
Through a combination of process optimization and additional manufacturing equipment, Stepan will be prepared to supply customers ether sulfates that meet the new January 2023 regulatory requirements.
This project, along with our announcement today to invest $220 million to build under an EPC contract 75,000 metric tons per year Alkoxylation production facility at our Pasadena, Texas site are the primary drivers of our 2021 capital expenditure forecast of $200 million to $220 million.
We are excited about the capability and future growth that these investment projects will deliver to Stepan Company.
Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers continue to be a focus of our Surfactant growth strategy.
We added 300 new customers during the quarter and approximately 800 customers during the first nine months of the year.
We finished our consulting work in our Millsdale plant and are focusing now on executing the recommended changes.
We accelerated investments in both expense and capex to improve productivity and to increase capacity.
We expect this project and the investment level to continue through the remainder of the year, and we should see benefits including productivity enhancements, increased capacity in several high margin product lines and improved service levels to our customers next year.
Polymers had good performance during the first nine months of the year as market demand recovered after a challenging year in 2020 due to COVID restrictions.
The business has also benefited from the INVISTA acquisition which closed in January.
However, in the third quarter, we saw significant impact to our margins due to raw material availability and cost escalation while orders from customers remained restrained by their own raw material availability and other supply chain issues.
For perspective, we had suppliers declare force majeure on critical raw materials, while our customers experienced market shortages on MDI and flame retardants, which are used in their finished foam insulation formulations.
We are currently working to recover our margins in the fourth quarter.
The long-term prospects for our polyol business remain attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes should increase demand.
The integration of the business acquired from INVISTA is going well and expect this acquisition to deliver more than $20 million of EBITDA in 2021.
Given the strength of our balance sheet, we plan to continue to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities to fill gaps in our portfolio, and to add new platform chemistries aligned with our Company's growth strategy.
The Company delivered record first nine month earnings in 2021.
Looking forward, we believe our Surfactant volumes in North American consumer product end markets will continue to be challenged by raw material and transportation availability.
While we believe, industrial and institutional cleaning volume will grow versus prior year, we do not believe it will compensate for lower consumer consumption of cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products.
We believe that the demand for Surfactants in the agricultural and oilfield markets will exceed prior year demand.
We believe our Polymer business will deliver growth versus prior year due to the ongoing recovery from pandemic-related delays and our first quarter acquisition of INVISTA's aromatic polyester polyol business.
We continue to believe the long-term prospects for rigid polyols remain attractive.
We anticipate our Specialty Products business will improve slightly year-over-year.
Despite continued raw material sourcing issues, raw material price increases, higher planned maintenance expenses and supply chain challenges, we believe underlying market demand remains strong and we are optimistic about delivering full-year earnings growth this year.
Low inventories across the value chain should provide opportunities in 2022.
