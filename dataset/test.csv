WSO_q2_2021.txt,"Hope everyone is having a safe and good day.
This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO.
And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is our President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan.
Now as we normally do, before we start, we need to read our cautionary statement.
Now on to our report.
I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric.
Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income.
This was by far our most successful quarter ever.
Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter.
Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points.
Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million.
And operating margins, this is a big one, operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%.
Now these results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns.
Now we have two new companies in our family, TEC and Acme.
They performed very well, and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an important part of Watsco.
They have a rich and successful history and we will help them any way we can.
Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market.
Again, this is a $50 billion North American market.
And we hope to find more great companies to join us.
Greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities.
Also Watsco's industry-leading technologies continues to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share.
Here are a few important highlights to mention.
First, growth rates among active users of our technologies continues to outpace the growth rates of nonusers.
Customers using our technology are simply growing faster.
Next, attrition among customers using our technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers.
The technology enables us to create stickier customer relationships.
Also, more customers are using our digital selling platforms that are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort.
They help and modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners.
These tools have also benefited the sale of higher efficiency systems, which we think is an important contributor to the climate chain discussion.
As older systems are replaced, our technology can play an important role in helping consumers choose more energy-efficient solutions.
Our progress is very encouraging, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments.
Our focus remains in the long term.
I think you've heard me say that over and over again.
We are long-term players in the industry.
Please feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its impact.
Finally, but very important, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt.
We have plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow our company both organically and through acquisitions.
","Watsco reported a record-breaking second quarter, with earnings per share soaring 64% to $3.71, and sales surging 36% to $1.85 billion. Gross profits jumped 50%, and operating margins expanded a remarkable 220 basis points to 11.7%. The company's advanced technologies continue to drive growth, with active users experiencing higher growth rates and lower attrition compared to non-users. Watsco's acquisition of TEC and Acme has been a success, and the company is actively seeking further acquisitions in the fragmented $50 billion North American market. Despite its growth, Watsco maintains a strong financial position with minimal debt, ensuring ample capacity for continued expansion."
ITT_q2_2021.txt,"Today's call will cover ITT's financial results for the three months period ending July 3, announced yesterday evening.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations.
Actual results may vary materially, due to, among other items, the factors described in our 2020 Annual Report, on Form 10-K and other recent SEC filings.
These adjusted results exclude certain non-operating and non-recurring items, including but not limited to asbestos-related charges, restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
Before we begin, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter GAAP results.
Revenue increased 34% to $692 million.
Segment operating income increased 206% [Phonetic] to $114 million, which equates to segment operating margin of 16.5%.
Reported earnings per share decreased 15% to $0.45, driven primarily by a $28 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of InTelCo Management LLC, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, as well as prior-year income tax benefits, and increased corporate and environmental costs.
We are all focused on ensuring ITT delivers on its commitments hour after hour, while taking care of each other, our families, and our customers.
This has been a pivotal quarter for ITT.
On July 1, we divested a subsidiary that holds all of our legacy asbestos liabilities to a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
Importantly, ITT is indemnified from any further responsibility for all pending and future legacy asbestos claims.
This transaction follows the successful transfer of our U.S. pension liability in October 2020 and will allow us to focus more on growing the core business organically and through acquisitions.
We are now beginning the next chapter in ITT's history.
On the operational front, over the past few months, I've had the privilege of meeting our teams in person at our sites in Italy, California, the Netherlands, and the Northeast.
I continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making, by the opportunities that remain, and by the commitment and the passion I see from our workforce.
Before reviewing our results, let me talk a little bit about ITT's sustainability efforts.
In the coming weeks, we will be releasing our 2021 Sustainability Report Supplement, which will show our commitment to environmental, social, and governance initiatives.
It is clear that while we have made significant progress in 2020 despite the impact of the pandemic, there is still more that we can do.
Our employees' efforts during the pandemic to take care of each other and our customers have strengthened our resolve to continuously improve our ESG practices and this is what we will do.
Some of our accomplishments, which you can soon read about it in the supplement, include a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 25% reduction in workplace incidents.
Further, we maintained an A rating for our ESG profile, as measured by MSCI, a recognized leader in global ESG assessment.
Now, let's review our results for the second quarter, beginning with sales.
Friction continued to outperform global auto production growth.
In fact, the outperformance we drove this quarter was significantly above our historical average.
The auto businesses in MT grew organic revenue nearly 80% and MT's revenue exceeded pre-COVID levels from 2019 once again this quarter.
More importantly, we continue to win key awards in both conventional vehicles and our new electric vehicle platforms, which will fuel future outperformance.
This quarter we were awarded content on 10 new electric vehicle platforms, seven of which were in China and two on key strategic platforms in the growing North American market.
We also continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition.
In July, Friction's outer ceramic brake pads sold in the aftermarket were ranked the highest among five competitors according to ADAC, Europe's largest motoring association based in Germany.
This is a testament to the supplier excellence and innovation of the Friction team.
Let's get back to the quarter.
Building on the first quarter momentum, our connectors business in Connect and Control Technologies grew sales by 17% organically, after 8% organic in Q1.
We saw continued strength in the North American distribution channel; and sequentially, industrial connectors in Q2 grew 6% versus Q1, due to distribution strength worldwide.
We also drove 8% organic revenue growth in Industrial Process, driven by strong pump project deliveries, which were up 52% organically in the quarter due to strength in the chemical and oil and gas markets.
We achieved this by remaining focused on serving our customers and ensuring we commission their projects on time, despite significant supply chain disruptions.
Turning to orders, I'm energized by the growth our commercial teams generated this quarter across all three segments.
In total, we drove 47% organic orders growth across ITT with order levels surpassing 2019, positioning us well for the second half of the year and for 2022.
First, Motion Technologies grew orders by 76% organically, driven mainly by auto, and we also saw a strong performance in valve [Phonetic], which grew over 20% organically.
Second, in Industrial Process, orders were up 18% organically and up 7% sequentially, driven by continued recovery in our short-cycle business, where orders grew 24% across parts, valves and service.
Our pump project orders were relatively flat year-over-year.
However, we are increasingly confident that project activity in the funnel is strengthening and we expect to successfully leverage this momentum in the second half.
Finally, in CCT, orders were up 47% organically, driven largely by industrial connectors and aerospace components.
As we mentioned last quarter, we saw some positive signs in commercial aerospace, which we expect it will start to pick up in Q2, and we are seeing the momentum in orders today.
From a profitability perspective, despite increasing pressure from commodity costs and supply chain disruptions, we delivered nearly 400 basis points of adjusted segment margin expansion, with triple-digit margin expansion in each segment.
This was a result of the incredible growth in volumes, I mentioned earlier, and the team's ability to generate productivity, net of inflation, while successfully navigating challenging market conditions.
This was aided in part by the actions we took in 2020 to reduce our structural costs.
As a result of the revenue growth and margin expansion, ITT delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, growing 65% and surpassing our pre-COVID adjusted earnings per share levels in Q2 2019.
Given the strong first-half performance and our confidence in ITT's ability to outperform, we are again raising our outlook for 2021.
We now anticipate organic revenue growth will be 8% to 10% for the year, a 300 basis point increase on both the low- and high-end of our already increased guidance from the first quarter.
These will be driven by the strength in Friction, and short-cycle orders growth in both IP and CCT.
The increased sales volume and strong productivity expected in 2021 will generate adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 at the high end, which equates to 22% to 27% growth versus prior year.
This is an $0.08 improvement at the midpoint, after a $0.30 increase after the first quarter, and this puts ITT on pace to comfortably surpass 2018 adjusted earnings per share despite significant inflationary pressure.
From a top line perspective, Motion Technologies delivered a solid performance, driven by strong growth in the OE business and continued share gains despite the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.
Our Friction and Wolverine OE businesses grew over 60% organically.
As I always do, this quarter, I traveled to a number of our facilities, including our world-class friction plant in Barge, Italy.
Here, I saw the teams' engineering expertise on full display, which will enable us to continue winning an outsized share of global EV platforms.
Our continued investment in automation in all our plants and hour-by-hour management allows us to continuously meet customer demand, despite constantly changing production schedules; and we continue to invest in and develop new technologies to address the needs of a new and more environmentally friendly automotive braking system.
In CCT, we drove nearly 19% organic revenue growth in industrial connectors, mainly through distribution, continuing the momentum we saw in the first quarter.
Demand in commercial aerospace is increasing, exhibited by the nearly 70% growth in aerospace orders.
The book to bill in CCT was an impressive 1.18 for the quarter, which positions us well for the future.
Now, moving to operating margins.
Our focus on operational excellence produced 250 basis points of expansion in Q2 at the ITT level and 390 basis points at the segment level.
By segment, MT grew margin 660 basis points, Connect and Control 230 basis points with an incremental margin of 37%, and Industrial Process grew margin 100 basis points to nearly 15% once again.
The strong performance was a combination of higher sales volume, commercial actions and productivity, offset by raw material inflation and unfavorable mix, given the growth in pump projects and continued investments for growth, which are critical to sustain ITT's outperformance.
Regarding raw materials' inflation, the impact this quarter was approximately 240 basis points, which was higher than what we expected.
And while we are deploying pricing actions with our customers, based on current prices for material purchases for the remainder of 2021, we expect this phenomenon will have a significant impact in the second half.
Free cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the sale of our legacy asbestos liabilities.
Excluding this one-time non-recurring item, adjusted free cash flow was $131 million.
The decline compared to prior year was the result of higher operating income generation in the segments that was more than offset by strategic investments in working capital to support growing customer demand.
Wrapping up, our ITTans [Phonetic] around the world delivered another outstanding performance in Q2.
Organic growth was strong across all three segments and we converted to higher sales at good margins.
We generated over 400 basis points of productivity while investing for future growth and successfully navigated challenging market conditions; and our nearly 50% organic growth in orders position ITT for a strong second half.
Motion Technologies' Q2 organic revenue growth of 64% was primarily driven by strength in auto.
As you know, the second quarter of last year was down significantly, due to the pandemic.
However, Friction continued to outperform global auto production by a very wide margin.
And from an operating standpoint, our OE business performed very well, with 99%-plus on-time performance.
This was a key reason MT's revenue eclipsed pre-COVID levels in the second quarter of 2019 by 8%.
The strong orders growth in MT, this quarter, was a combination of both auto and valve, where we continue to gain share.
Segment margin expanded 660 basis points versus prior year to 18.8%, mainly due to higher volumes and productivity, offset by the impact of higher raw material costs for steel, tin, and copper.
As we indicated last year, MT's margins declined sequentially in the second quarter, given the increasing commodities pressure.
However, MT delivered almost 30% incremental margin, in spite of these headwinds.
Wolverine sales growth was over 60%, driven by OE shims in North America and Europe, and in sealings, while KONI grew by double digits organically.
Margins in Wolverine, KONI and Axtone were all double digits in the quarter.
For Industrial Process, revenue was up 8% organically.
This was driven partially by an easy prior-year comparison, stemming from steep declines in project shipments, which resulted in over 50% revenue growth this quarter.
We also saw minor short-cycle declines, driven by lower service sales and flat growth in baseline pumps, due to the materials' shortage.
As we have indicated, given the order trends we see across IP, we continue to expect the short-cycle businesses to accelerate in the second half.
From an end market perspective, growth was spread across general industrial, oil and gas, and chemical markets.
IP grew 18% organically and 7% sequentially, due to the short cycle; namely, parts, valves and service.
Our daily order rates continue to be strong into the third quarter.
Orders in all product categories, except baseline pumps, were above 2019 levels, and the month of June was our largest month of project orders since 2015.
We believe this positions us well for the remainder of 2021.
IP's margin expanded 100 basis points to 14.7%, with an incremental margin of 24%.
This was partially impacted by unfavorable mix, given the higher proportion of project versus short-cycle sales.
We expect the mix to improve from here as short cycle continues to recover.
Lastly, in Connect and Control Technologies, we continued to turn the corner with incremental margins of 37% this quarter.
This was the result of continued volume leverage and strong productivity, despite inflationary headwinds and continued declines in commercial aerospace, while OE production continues to improve our largest aerospace customers and managing through elevated inventory levels on key platforms which will delay a significant recovery in aero components demand until 2022.
Similar to the rest of ITT, orders growth was incredibly strong, driven by our connector business, with continued North American distribution strength and growth in aerospace OE and aftermarket.
The book to bill was largely above 1 and backlog was up 16% compared to year-end 2020, which again position us well heading into 2022.
Before we move on, just a few additional comments on earnings per share for the quarter.
As you can see on the Q2 adjusted earnings per share walk on Slide 11, the year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by prior-year benefits, related to environmental, temporary cost actions, and CARES Act credits.
Partially offsetting these items was a roughly $0.03 benefit from foreign currency, consistent with our outlook, and a roughly $0.01 benefit from a lower-than-planned effective tax rate of 21.5%.
On July 1, ITT divested 100% of its equity of a subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets to Delticus, a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
At closing, ITT contributed $398 million in cash and Delticus contributed $60 million in cash to InTelCo.
As a result of the transaction, ITT removed all asbestos obligations, related insurance assets, and associated deferred tax assets from our consolidated balance sheet as of the second quarter.
The benefits of this transaction include the indemnification for all legacy asbestos liabilities and stronger free cash flow generation in the absence of asbestos-related payments that we previously estimated at $20 million to $30 million per year on average over the next 10 years, prior to the divestiture.
Additionally, the transaction freeze up management time and resources to focus more on growing the core business and executing other more strategic initiatives, including ESG and M&A.
Coupled with our successful U.S. pension plans transfer executed in October 2020, we are well positioned to grow with a flexible balance sheet and without the risks and uncertainty of managing these legacy liabilities.
As we saw in Friction's results, global auto production is increasing, albeit constrained by the global semiconductor shortage which is causing inventory levels to remain low.
And while we expect demand will remain strong throughout 2021, the impact of higher raw material prices will weigh on margins and adjusted earnings per share during the second half.
The growth we're seeing in IP orders is mainly in short cycle.
On projects, however, we continue to expect the large project spend, particularly in oil and gas, will not fully recover until 2022.
In the meantime, we're seeing continued momentum in weekly run rates in our short-cycle businesses in Industrial Process and connectors, which we believe will drive organic revenue growth to a new range of 8% to 10% for the year.
Our assumption regarding commercial aerospace is that a substantial recovery will not occur until early 2022, given the level of inventory at our largest OE customers.
However, we see encouraging signs in orders, as production levels continue to increase.
Our outlook for adjusted segment margin remains at approximately 17.1% at the midpoint.
We expect a pronounced impact from raw material inflation, mainly in Motion Technologies.
However, our teams are driving commercial actions and additional productivity to minimize the impact.
We're planning for raw materials to remain at these elevated levels throughout 2021.
As you will see on Slide 7, our revised guidance assuming the incremental impact from this trend will be $0.09 at the high-end for the remainder of 2021.
Our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects an $0.08 improvement at the midpoint of our range, eclipsing 2019 levels and our previous high end.
The net impact of all other items is roughly $0.01 benefit to full-year adjusted EPS, including a slightly lower-than-planned effective tax rate.
Foreign currency and other items will be a minor benefit, compared to our previous guidance.
And we continue to expect a 1% reduction in the weighted average share count, given our share repurchases to date.
Additionally, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $5 million at the low- and high-ends of our previous range to reflect the higher operating income generated in the first half, offset by further working capital investments to support future growth, especially given the supply chain disruptions we are experiencing today.
In summary, we are again raising our outlook for 2021 across sales, earnings and free cash flow.
And with this raise, we now expect to eclipse 2019 levels in terms of adjusted segment margin and adjusted earnings per share.
As you can see, the majority of the improvement in adjusted earnings per share is operational in nature.
The higher volumes will likely be partially offset by incremental headwinds from rising raw material costs, which we have already discussed; the remaining changes to our outlook are rather immaterial.
From an end market perspective, the trends we saw in the second quarter have remained largely consistent throughout July.
Auto and the short cycle businesses in IP continue to perform well and CCT remains comfortably on path to recovery from both a sales and margin perspective.
On the other hand, our outlook reflects increased commodity pressure and we do not see any near-term improvements related to the supply chain.
Organic sales growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range, driven by growth across the portfolio and led by MP's strong performance.
IP and CCT should both improve to approximately high-single-digit organic growth, driven by short cycle.
Segment margin should be approximately flat sequentially to Q2 and above prior year, even with the significant raw material headwinds we anticipate primarily in MT. This negative impact on MT's margin will largely be offset by margin improvements in CCT, followed by Industrial Process.
Despite the margin challenges in Q3, we still expect all three businesses to be up over 100 basis points for the full year, which will eclipse ITT's segment margin for 2019.
The combined impact of higher sales and strong productivity will drive adjusted earnings-per-share growth in the low- to mid-teens.
With that, let me pass it back to Luca for closing remarks.
ITT continues to execute on its strategic priorities to position the company for long-term success.
The actions we took to eliminate our legacy asbestos liabilities will allow our teams to drive better growth in the core and up our game in capital deployment.
We are now even more laser-focused on growing ITT organically and through acquisitions while funding high-return growth investments, given our capital flexibility and strengthened cash flow profile.
We continue to outperform across all our businesses and we see encouraging signs in our orders growth, which will position us well for the remainder of 2021, 2022 and beyond, and simultaneously [Phonetic] continue to drive strong cash generation through increased income and effective working capital management.
The second half of 2021 will be challenging, given the supply chain disruptions, commodities pressure and emergence of COVID variant around the world.
However, I'm confident in ITT's ability to navigate these headwinds effectively, and drive growth and profitability, while leveraging our optimized cost structure and doing it all in a safe sustainable and efficient manner.
Crystal, please open the line for Q&A.
","ITT's recent earnings call highlighted strong organic growth across all segments, totaling 47%. Revenue increased 34% to $692 million, with segment operating income up 206% to $114 million, contributing to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.94. Despite divestiture losses and increased expenses, adjusted EPS grew 65%. The company attributed growth to outperforming global auto production in Friction and strong sales in Industrial Process and Connect and Control Technologies. ITT divested a subsidiary holding asbestos liabilities, eliminating future responsibility and generating stronger cash flow. Operational excellence drove margin expansion at the segment level, despite commodity inflation. While supply chain disruptions and raw material inflation pose challenges, ITT raised its outlook for 2021. Organic revenue growth is now projected at 8-10%, with adjusted earnings per share between $3.90 and $4.05, eclipsing pre-COVID levels and positioning the company for long-term success."
SEM_q4_2021.txt,"Their ability to adjust to the changing COVID variance throughout 2021 is a great testimony to our team's adaptability and their professionalism.
Our revenues grew nicely in all four of our business segments, with aggregate revenue growth for the quarter close to 7% and for the year, over 12%.
However, we also experienced substantial wage pressure in Q4 in terms of agency, nursing rates and utilization, primarily in our critical illness recovery hospitals.
Martin Jackson will cover these labor increases in more detail in his comments.
This information will provide a data point for each of our business segments prior to the pandemic compared to the current filing.
We will continue to include this information, as long as it provides meaningful insight to the impact of COVID-19 and the company's financial performance.
I also wanted to note that we recorded $8 million in other operating income in the fourth quarter, and $124 million for the full year 2021 related to Provider Relief Fund grant payments.
In 2020, we recorded $36 million in other operating income in the fourth quarter, and $90 million for the full year 2020 related to these payments.
The adjusted EBITDA results for our critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and outpatient rehabilitation segments do not include any recognition of these funds.
The Concentra segment does include $1 million in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year 2021 of adjusted EBITDA related to these funds.
Total company revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.56 billion, a 6.8% increase compared to the same quarter prior year.

As mentioned previously, adjusted EBITDA results for the full year included $124 million of Provider Relief Funds grant income compared to $90 million in the prior year.
Our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $24.6 million, compared to $75 million in the same quarter prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment was 4.3% in the fourth quarter, compared to 14% in the same quarter prior year.
The reduction in EBITDA was primarily driven by labor cost increases due to utilization of agency staffing.
For the full year, Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals segment adjusted EBITDA was $268 million, compared to $342.4 million in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment was 11.9% for the full year, compared to 16.5% in the prior year.
The reduction of EBITDA is primarily related to increased labor costs throughout the year.

For the full year, Concentra adjusted EBITDA was $389.6 million, compared to $252.9 million in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5% for the full year, compared to 16.8% in the prior year.
Earnings per fully diluted share was $0.37 in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.57 per share in the same quarter prior year.
For the full year, earnings per fully diluted share were $2.98 compared to $1.93 per share in the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per fully diluted share last year was $1.89, excluding non-operating gains and their related tax effects.
For the fourth quarter, our operating expenses, which include our cost of services and general and administrative expenses, were $1.44 billion, which represents 92.4% of our revenues.
For the same quarter prior year, operating expenses were $1.28 billion and represented 87.8% of our revenues.
The primary driver of increases in our operating expenses is due to increased labor costs, particularly in our Critical Illness Recovery hospitals.
We have seen nearly a doubling of agency nursing rates in Q4, and also an increase in nurse agency utilization in our critical illness recovery hospitals.
Our operators have done a good job of controlling other operating costs, as most have decreased on a per patient day and per visit basis.
As we have mentioned in previous earnings calls, our critical illness recovery hospital strategy is to continue to admit critically complex patients sent to us by our referral partners, even though our labor costs have increased substantially.
We have developed strong referral relations during this pandemic, and we believe continued acceptance of these referrals will provide for strong relationships over the long term.
For the full year, our operating expenses were $5.43 billion, compared to $4.85 billion in the prior year.
As a percent of revenue, operating expenses were 87.6% in both this year and the prior year.
As I mentioned in our Q4 operating expense section, the majority of increases in our expenses are the result of increased labor costs throughout the year.
Cost of services were $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter.
This compares to $1.25 billion in the same quarter prior year.
As a percent of revenue, cost of services were 89.9% for the fourth quarter, compared to 85.4% in the same quarter prior year.

Given the uncertainties due to significant increased labor costs resulting from higher-than-expected use of agency clinical staff, we are issuing our business outlook at this time for revenue only for 2022.
We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.4 billion for the full year of 2022.
We are also reaffirming our previously issued three-year compound annual growth rate target for revenue only, which we expect to be in the range of 4% to 6% for 2021 through 2023.
We expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million for this year.
We do plan to readdress our business outlook and target compound annual growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and earnings per common share when the labor climate stabilizes.
","Select Medical reported a 6.8% revenue increase in Q4 to $1.56 billion, with growth across all business segments. Notably, critical illness recovery hospitals saw a 7.3% revenue increase, while rehabilitation hospitals and outpatient rehab experienced increases of 10.5% and 7.8%, respectively. Concentra's revenue rose 3% in Q4. However, adjusted EBITDA declined in Q4, primarily due to increased labor costs, especially in critical illness recovery hospitals, where agency nursing rates nearly doubled. Despite these challenges, full-year revenue increased 12.2% to $6.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA grew 18.3% to $947.4 million, driven by provider relief funds. Select Medical expects revenue between $6.25 billion and $6.4 billion for 2022, reaffirming its revenue growth targets of 4% to 6% for 2021-2023."
ITW_q4_2021.txt,"During today's call, we will discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2022.
In Q4, the ITW team delivered another quarter of excellent operational execution and strong financial performance.
Six of our seven segments combined delivered 12% organic growth, while our Auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near-term limitations on auto production due to component supply shortages and, as a result, was down 16% in the quarter.
At the enterprise level, we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7%, and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income.
Throughout the entirety of 2021, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers while responding quickly and decisively to rapidly rising input costs and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio.
As a result, for the full year, we generated organic growth of 12%, with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from 6% to 18%.
And despite a seemingly constant barrage of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1%, with another 100-basis-point contribution from enterprise initiatives.
GAAP earnings per share was an all-time record at $8.51, an increase of 28% versus the prior year.
And in 2021, we also raised our dividend by 7%, returned $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and closed on a very high-quality acquisition in the MTS test and simulation business.
Most importantly, we delivered these results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on our path to ITW's full potential through the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy.
As you may recall, early in the pandemic, we made the decision to remain fully invested in our people and in our long-term strategy.
The people that we retained and the marketing, innovation, and capacity investments that we continue to fund as a result of that decision are fueling the results that ITW is delivering today and have the company very well positioned to continue to accelerate organic growth, add high-quality bolt-on acquisitions and sustain our best-in-class margins and returns in 2022 and beyond.
Their performance throughout 2021 provides another proof point that ITW is a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, the agility, and the resilience necessary to deliver top-tier performance in any environment.
The strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 5.9% year over year to $3.7 billion, with organic growth of 5.3%.
The MTS acquisition added 1.3% and foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 0.7%.
Sequentially, organic revenue accelerated by 6% from Q3 into Q4 on a sales per-day basis as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%.
By geography, North America grew 9% and international was up 1%.
Europe declined 2%, while Asia Pacific was up 7%, with China up 2%.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 included $0.02 of headwind from the MTS acquisition and related transaction costs.
Operating margin was 22.7%, 23.1% excluding MTS.
As expected, in the fourth quarter, we experienced price cost margin headwinds of 200 basis points, the same as in the third quarter.
Our businesses continue to respond appropriately and decisively to rising raw material costs.
And in the fourth quarter and the full year, we were positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
Overall, for Q4, excellent operational execution across the board and strong financial performance in what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment.
OK, let's go to Slide 4 for segment results, starting with Automotive OEM.
As expected, organic revenue was down 16%, with North America down 12%, Europe down 29%, and China down 3%.
Despite these near-term pressures on the top line, operating margin was resilient and remained solidly in the mid-teens.
While supply chain challenges continue to persist for the industry in the near term, we are confident that the inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major contributor to organic growth for ITW over an extended period of time as these issues ultimately get resolved.
Food Equipment led the way this quarter with the highest organic growth rate inside the company and 21%.
North America was up 22%, with equipment up 26% and service up 15%.
Institutional growth of 28% was particularly strong in education and restaurants were up around 50%.
International growth was strong and on par with North America at 20%, mostly driven by Europe, up 23%, with Asia Pacific, up 9%.
Both equipment and service grew 20%.
Turning to Slide 5 for Test and Measurement and Electronics.
Organic growth was 11% with Electronics up 4% and Test and Measurement up 17% driven by continued strong demand for semiconductors and capital equipment, as evidenced by our organic growth rate of 17% in our install business.
Scott said, in December, we closed on the MTS acquisition, which we're excited about as it's a great strategic fit for ITW and highly complementary to our Instron business.
We acquired Instron in 2006, and today it's a business growing consistently at 6% to 7% organically, with operating margins well above the company average.
We're confident that MTS has the potential to reach similar levels of performance over the next five to seven years through the application of the ITW business model.
Moving to Slide 6.
Welding delivered broad-based organic revenue growth of 15%, with 30% operating margin in Q4.
Equipment revenue grew 14% and consumables were up 16%.
Industrial revenue grew 18%, and the commercial business grew 8%.
North America was up 15%, and international growth was 14%, driven by 18% growth in oil and gas.
Polymers and Fluids organic growth was 3%, with 8% growth in Polymers, with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications.
Fluids was down 5% against a tough comp of plus 16% last year when demand for industrial hygiene products surged.
Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with continued strength in retail.
On to Slide 7.
Construction organic revenue was up 12% as North America grew 22%, with residential renovation up 23%, driven by continued strength in the home center channel.
Commercial construction, which is about 20% of our business, was up 21%.
Europe grew 2% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%.
Specialty organic growth was strong at 7%, with North America up 10% and international up 2%.
With that, let's go to Slide 8 for a summary of 2021.
Operationally, the teams around the world continue to execute with discipline in a challenging environment as they sustained world-class customer service levels, implemented timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs, and executed on our Win the Recovery initiatives to accelerate organic growth across the portfolio.
As a result, revenue grew 15% to $14.5 billion, with broad-based organic growth of 12%, 14% if you exclude Auto OEM, where growth was obviously very constrained due to component shortages at our customers.
Operating income increased 21% and operating margin was 24.1%.
The incremental margin was 32%, which is below our typical 35% to 40% range due to price cost.
Excluding the impact of price cost, incremental margin was 40%.
GAAP earnings per share increased 28% and after-tax ROIC improved by more than 300 basis points to 29.5%.
Free cash flow was $2.3 billion with a conversion rate of 84% of net income which is below our 100% plus long-term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company's 15% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers.
Moving to Slide 9 for our full year 2022 guidance.
So, we're headed into 2022 with strong momentum and the company is in a very good position to deliver another year of strong financial performance, with organic growth of 6% to 9% and 10% to 15% earnings growth.
Per our usual process, our organic growth guidance is established by projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality.
As you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in 2022 with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level.
Our total revenue growth projection of 7.5% to 10.5% includes a 3% contribution from MTS, partially offset by 1.5% of foreign currency headwind at today's exchange rates.
Specific to MTS, guidance includes full-year revenue of $400 million to $450 million, the expectation that margins are dilutive at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and, finally, consistent with what we've said before, EPS-neutral.
Operating margin, excluding MTS, is forecast to expand by about 100 basis points to 24.5% to 25.5% as enterprise initiatives contribute approximately 100 basis points.
We expect price cost headwind of about 50 basis points.
Incremental margin is expected to be about 30%, including MTS.
And our core incremental margin, excluding MTS, is in our typical 35% to 40% range.
We expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $8.90 to $9.30, which is up 10% to 15%, excluding one-time tax items from last year.
The tax rate for 2022 is expected to be 23% to 24% as compared to 19% in 2021.
We are forecasting solid free cash flow with a conversion rate of 90% to 100% of net income, with further working capital investments to support the company's growth, mitigate supply chain risk, and sustain service levels to our key customers as needed.
Our capital allocation plans for 2022 are consistent with our long-standing disciplined capital allocation framework.
1 remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our highly profitable core businesses.
Second, an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model.
Third, selective high-quality acquisitions, such as MTS, that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement potential from the application of our proprietary 80-20 front-to-back methodology and can generate acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital.
Lastly, we allocate surplus capital to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buy back $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2022.
In addition, we have reactivated our previously announced divestiture plans.
And in 2022, we will reinitiate divestiture processes for five businesses, with combined annual revenues of approximately $500 million.
While these businesses are performing quite well coming out of the pandemic, they operate in markets where growth expectations are not aligned with ITW's long-term organic growth goals.
When these divestitures are completed over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect approximately 50 basis points of lift to ITW's organic growth rate and operating margins.
Given the timing uncertainties associated with these divestiture transactions, 2022 guidance assumes we own them for the full year.
Finally, last slide is Slide 10 with the organic growth projections by segment.
You can see that based on current run rates, we are expecting some solid organic growth rates in every one of our seven segments, with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level.
For Automotive OEM, our guidance of 6% to 10% is based on a risk-adjusted forecast of automotive production in the mid-single digits, plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%.
","ITW reported notable financial results for Q4 and full-year 2021, driven by strong execution and the ""Win the Recovery"" strategy. Organic growth reached 12% for the year, with each segment contributing between 6% and 18%. Despite supply chain challenges, Automotive OEM remains a key driver for long-term growth. Food Equipment led Q4 with 21% organic growth, while Test and Measurement and Electronics saw 11% growth, supported by semiconductor demand. Other notable segments include Welding (15%) and Construction (12%). GAAP earnings per share for Q4 was $1.93, with full-year earnings reaching an all-time high at $8.51, an increase of 28%. ITW's strong momentum is expected to continue in 2022, with guidance projecting organic growth of 6% to 9% and earnings growth of 10% to 15%. The company also plans to return $1.5 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and remains committed to selective acquisitions and divestitures to enhance growth potential."
EW_q2_2021.txt,"Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2021 financial results.
These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations.
Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures.
Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results.
""We were encouraged by the clear signs of recovery during the second quarter.
Vaccine adoption in key regions have contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly, receiving treatment.
At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day.
We never stopped our aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients.
Last year, we noted that we're in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic.
There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter.
This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients are benefiting from our life changing technologies than ever before.
The comparisons of 2020 are challenging as last year marked an extraordinary time for structural heart patients, especially during the second quarter, when the COVID surge overwhelmed hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care.
Patients and their doctors around the world were forced to weigh the risk of COVID versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease.
Fortunately, we are now experiencing encouraging signs of increased patient confidence to visit their position.
Turning now to our recent results.
We are pleased to report better than expected second quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from a year ago period.
All four product groups delivered large increases in sales led by TAVR.
Total company sales increased sequentially versus Q1.
And importantly, sales grew 11% on a two year compounded annual basis, compared to the strong pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019.
While hospital heart teams have not been reporting significant backlogs, we believe that procedure rates in Q2 were lifted because patients who previously postponed their doctor visits returned and were treated.
We are raising our full year outlook for 2021.
We remain cautious about the mix trends of the recovery from the pandemic and additionally, we expect a more pronounced summer seasonality associated with the pent-up demand for vacations.
Yet, given the better than expected year-to-date performance and momentum exiting the quarter, we now expect total sales growth to be in the high teens versus our previous guidance of mid-teens.
In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a two year compounded annual basis.
We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards' growth in the second quarter.
Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continue to exercise price discipline.
We continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated.
In a recent article in the American Journal of Cardiology reported, it reported on the survival of severe AS patients since the introduction of TAVR in 2008.
The analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients obtained at the mass general and concluded that in the TAVR era overall survival of patients with severe AS has doubled.
The long-term potential, along with the rebound in procedures reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, up from more than $5 billion today.
And beyond 2024, bolstered by two pivotal trials currently being enrolled, we believe the impact of treating this deadly disease before symptoms and before the disease becomes severe has the potential to transform the lives of even more patients.
In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew sequentially over Q1 and over 50% on a year-over-year basis.
Our U.S. TAVR volumes were well above pre-COVID levels as our two year compounded annual growth rate was in the mid-teens.
We estimate that our share of procedures was stable.
We are encouraged that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as vaccinations increase and patients decided to seek treatment during the quarter.
Growth was broad based across both high and low volume centers.
Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis and we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable.
On a two year compounded annual basis, we estimate that sales grew in the low double-digits in the second quarter versus 2019.
And although we are encouraged by the strong results, vaccination progress outside the U.S. creates uncertainty for the remainder of the year.
Long-term goal, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.
TAVR procedure and Edwards' growth in Europe, also rebounded significantly on a year-over-year basis.
Edwards' growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based across all countries.
Patient flow recovered throughout the quarter, although it remains suboptimal in several countries and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease.
In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption, driven by SAPIEN 3 and broad growth across centers of all sizes.
We remained focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country, driven by the fact that aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated diseases among this large elderly population.
As previously announced, we received the approval earlier in the second quarter for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk and we continue to anticipate increased treatment rates in Japan when reimbursement is approved in Q3.
Now, turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights, last week at the TVT Conference, data on the Vancouver's TAVR Economic Study were presented which further demonstrated the favorable economic value of our SAPIEN 3 platform, a comparison of 1100 patients was conducted to assess the economic impact of next day discharge.
The SAPIEN 3 platform with a minimalist approach achieved better patient outcomes 30-days post-procedure and enhanced resource utilization, which resulted in meaningful cost improvements.
Also at TVT, results from the PARTNER 3 bicuspid registry showed similar outcomes to other TAVR patients, as well as significant improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life.
We remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence.
In summary, based on the strength that we saw in the second quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow around 20% in 2021 versus our previous expectation of 15% to 20% growth.
Turning to TMTT; we continue to be very pleased with our clinical outcomes as they remain a key driver to treating many patients in need and unlocking the significant long-term growth opportunity.
We continue to be committed to ensuring procedural success and employing a high touch clinical support model.
We are progressing in the enrollment of five pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio to support therapy for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
We have initiated use of the PASCAL precision platform and are currently enrolling CLASP and early physician feedback has been positive.
We remain on track for U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year.
We advanced our clinical experience with transcatheter replacement as we continued enrollment with our TRISCEND 2 pivotal trial for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement.
We also continue to treat patients with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND Study for EVOQUE Eos.
In mitral, an analysis of EuroPCR of over 2,100 commercially treated patients provided further evidence of the efficacy, safety, and ease of use of the PASCAL platform.
In addition, two year results from the CLASP study of PASCAL highlighted strong and sustained MR reduction, as well as high survival rates for both FMR and DMR patients.
And in tricuspid, 30-day outcomes for our TRISCEND study for the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system demonstrated favorable technical feasibility and safety, along with significant improvements is tricuspid regurgitation and quality of life for patients.
Similarly, outcomes for PASCAL tricuspid valve repair resulted in significant TR reduction, low complication rates, and sustained functional and quality of life improvements at six months.
Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of our PASCAL platform, as we activated more centers across Europe.
We now expect 2021 TMTT sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million.
We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025 and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease.
In Surgical Structural Heart, record second quarter global sales of $237 million was up 42% on an underlying basis versus a year ago period.
Revenue growth was lifted by increased adoption of our premium RESILIA technologies around the world and rebounding surgical aortic treatment rates in the U.S.
We were encouraged by steady improvement in global surgical procedure volumes, as we progress through the quarter.
We experienced strong year-over-year adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit, as well as our new MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve, which was launched in Japan in the second quarter.
We believe the adoption of RESILIA tissue valves will be further bolstered by the four year mitral data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, as well as the growing body of RESILIA clinical evidence, which demonstrates excellent durability of this tissue technology even in the high pressure mitral position.
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Surgical Structure Heart guidance, we now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous expectation of high-single-digit growth.
We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structure Heart market will grow in the mid-single-digits through 2026.
In Critical Care, second quarter global sales were $215 million, up 27% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period.
Growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales in the U.S. as hospital capital spending continues to show signs of recovery.
Demand for products used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and demand for the ClearSight non-invasive finger cuff used in elective procedures accelerated following its recovery to pre-COVID levels in the first quarter.
And Smart Recovery received FDA clearance for the software algorithm that powers our Hypotension Prediction Index, HPI on HemoSphere and the Acumen IQ cuff.
The non-invasive Acumen IQ cuff provides clinicians with an important new tool to reduce hypotension in a broader range of patients including those that do not require an arterial line.
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Critical Care guidance to low-double-digits versus our previous expectation of high-single-digit growth.
We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.
I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines.
While we are expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we are optimistic about favorable business conditions for Edwards.
Total sales grew 49% year-over-year, as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter.
Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales in last year's second quarter due to COVID.
Our underlying two year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving.
The much stronger than expected sales performance lifted by unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom-line resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64.
Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021.
For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.
Now, regarding second half margins, we are intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned new product introductions in multiple regions.
In addition, we expect growth in research and development expenses as our clinical trial activities increase.
The combination of these actions contributes to our more moderated guidance for margins in the second half.
We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27.
While public health conditions remain uncertain, we are projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56.
Now, I will cover additional details of our results.
For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9%, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial cost responding to COVID.
This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.
We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales, compared to $275 million in the prior year.
This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs including performance-based compensation, increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year, and the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro.
We are planning to see a ramp up in the expenses noted above in the second half as COVID-related restrictions subside to support continued growth.
We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%.
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 24% to $225 million, or 16.4% of sales.
This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations including increased clinical trial activity.
We are pointing ramp up expenses in the second half as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range.
During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which benefited earnings per share by $0.14.
This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier.
This reduction reflects accounting adjustments associated with reduced expectations of making future milestone payments for previous acquisitions.
This accounting impact does not impact our 2021 guidance.
Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%.
This rate included a larger than expected 590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation.
We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021 excluding special items to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million, compared to the prior year.
At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales, compared to 2020.
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year.
Relative to our April guidance, FX rates positively impacted our second quarter earnings per share by a penny.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $526 million, less capital spending of $69 million.
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities.
We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and investments as of June 30.
Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million.
In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of $85.
In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program.
We now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 to 635 million guidance range.
And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.
So, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2021.
To serve the many patients suffering from Structural Heart Disease, we never stopped investing in our people, our innovative technologies and our new growth capacity.
As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity.
Our foundation of leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline positions us well for continued success.
This event will include updates on our latest technologies, the use on longer term market potential, as well as our outlook for 2022.
Please look for more information on our website next month.
With that, we are ready to take questions now, Diego.
In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one, plus one follow-up.
If you have any additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call.
","Edwards Lifesciences reported strong second-quarter earnings, with sales growing 49% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, driven by increased patient confidence and medical procedure rates.

VSH_q2_2021.txt,"As usual, we'll start today's call with the CFO, who will review Vishay's second quarter 2021 financial results.
Dr. Gerald Paul will then give an overview of our business and discuss operational performance as well as segment results in more detail.
We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they provide useful information about the operating performance of our businesses and should be considered by investors in conjunction with GAAP measures that we also provide.
I will focus on some highlights and key metrics.
Vishay reported revenues for Q2 of $819 million, a quarterly record.
Our earnings per share was $0.64 for the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $0.61 for the quarter.
The only reconciling items between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share are tax related.
There were no reconciling items impacting gross or operating margins.
Revenues in the quarter were $819 million, up by 7.1% from previous quarter and up by 40.8% compared to prior year.
Gross margin was 28%.
Operating margin was 15.3% There were no reconciling items to arrive at adjusted operating margin.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.61.
EBITDA was $163 million or 19.9%.
There were no reconciling items to arrive at adjusted EBITDA.
Reconciling versus prior quarter, operating income quarter two 2021 compared to operating income for prior quarter based on $54 million higher sales or $55 million higher excluding exchange rate impacts, operating income increased by $28 million to $125 million in Q2 2021 from $97 million in Q1 2021.
The main elements were; average selling prices had a positive impact of $8 million, representing 1.0 ASP increase.
The volume increased with a positive impact of $22 million, equivalent to a 6.1% increase in volume.
Variable costs remained flat in total.
Cost reductions and volume related efficiencies offset increases in materials, services and metal prices.
Fixed costs remained flat in total, in line with our guidance.
Reconciling versus prior year, operating income quarter two 2021 compared to adjusted operating income in quarter two 2020 based on $237 million higher sales or $215 million excluding exchange rate impacts, adjusted operating income increased by $84 million to $125 million in Q2 2021 from $42 million in Q2 2020.
The main elements were: average selling prices had a negative impact of $2 million, representing a 0.3% ASP decline; volume increased with a positive impact of $101 million, representing a 36.4% increase.
Variable costs decreased with a positive impact of $6 million, primarily due to volume-related increased manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction efforts, which more than offset higher metal prices, annual wage increases and higher tariffs.
Fixed costs increased with a negative impact of $19 million, primarily due to annual wage increases and higher incentive compensation partially offset by our restructuring programs.
Inventory impacts had a positive impact of $5 million, exchange rates had a negative impact of $6 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $104 million, in line with expectations.
For quarter three 2021, our expectations are approximately $104 million of SG&A expenses.
For the full year, our expectations are approximately $420 million at the exchange rates of quarter two.
The debt shown on the face of the balance sheet at quarter end is comprised of the convertible notes due 2025 net of debt issuance costs.
There were no amounts outstanding on a revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter.
However, we did use the revolver from time to time during Q2 to meet short-term financing needs and expect to continue to do so in the future.
No principal payments are due until 2025 and the revolving credit facility expires in June 2024.
We had total liquidity of $1.6 billion at quarter end.
Cash and short-term investments comprised $856 million and there were no amounts outstanding on our $750 million credit facility.
Total shares outstanding at quarter end were 145 million.
The expected share count for earnings per share purposes for the third quarter 2021 is approximately 145.5 million.
Our convertible debt repurchase activity over the past three years, together with the adoption of the new convertible debt standard, significantly reduces the variability of our earnings per share share count.
Our US GAAP tax rate year-to-date was approximately 19%, which mathematically yields a rate of 20% for Q2.
We recorded benefits of $3.9 million for the quarter and $8.3 million year-to-date due to changes in tax regulations.
Our normalized effective tax rate, which excludes the unusual tax items, was approximately 24% for the quarter and 23% for the year-to-date periods.
We expect our normalized effective tax rate for the full year 2021 to be between 22% and 24%.
Our consolidated effective tax rate is based on an assumed level and mix of income among our various taxing jurisdictions as shift in income could result in significantly different results.
Also, a significant change in US tax laws or regulations could result in significantly different results.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $117 million.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $32 million.
Free cash for the quarter was $85 million.
For the trailing 12 months, cash from operations was $365 million.
Capital expenditures were $135 million, split approximately for expansion $86 million, for cost reduction $9 million, for maintenance of business $40 million.
Free cash generation for the trailing 12-month period was $230 million.
The trailing 12-month period includes $30 million in cash taxes paid for both the 2020 and 2021 installment of the US Tax Reform Transition Tax.
The 2020 installment was paid in Q3 2020, whereas the 2021 installment was paid in Q2.
Vishay has consistently generated in excess of $100 million in cash flows from operations in each of the past 26 years and greater than $200 million for the past 19 years.
Backlog at the end of Q2 was $2.050 billion or 7.5 months of sales.
Inventories increased quarter-over-quarter by $31 million, excluding the exchange rate impacts.
Days of inventory outstanding were 76 days.
Days of sales outstanding for the quarter are 43 days.
Days payables outstanding for the quarter were 33 days, resulting in a cash conversion cycle of 86 days.
Also in the second quarter, the steep upturn of our business visible since October of last year continued.
We keep ramping up critical manufacturing capacities, increasing revenues and profits further.
Quite excellent plant efficiencies, the impact of price increases and our traditional discipline in fixed cost support the financial results.
Vishay in the second quarter achieved a gross margin of 28% of sales and operating margin of 15.3% of sales, earnings per share of $1.64 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61.
We, in the second quarter, generated $85 million of free cash and we do expect another solid year of cash generation.
The economic environment for the electronics business continues to be exceptional with sales and backlogs at a historical high.
Virtually all markets are currently in excellent shape and supply chains continue to be rather depleted.
Despite all efforts to expand manufacturing capacities quickly, lead times for many product lines have stretched out rapidly and massively.
Price pressure presently is very low and selected price increases are being implemented, partially required to offset increased costs for metals and transportation.
Commenting on the regions.
We see continued strong performance in Asia and in the Americas.
Europe is somewhat lagging due to temporary supply problems in the automotive sector caused by a lack of ICs.
The Industrial segment drives demand in all the regions.
Distribution in all hemispheres continues to be extremely hungry for product.
Talking about distribution, global distribution continues to get overwhelmed with orders.
We see a record high since at least 15 years.
POS in the second quarter was 5% over prior quarter and a remarkable 45% over prior year.
After massive increases in the first quarter, POS increased further in all regions; by 3% in the Americas, by 6% in Asia and by 5% in Europe.
Global distribution inventory has stabilized on very low partially critically low levels.
Inventory turns of global distribution increased to quite extreme 4.4 from 4.3 in prior quarter; in the Americas, 2.1 after 1.9 in Q1 and 1.4 in prior year; in Asia, 7.4 turns after 6.7 in Q1 and 4.1 in prior year; 4.6 turns in Europe after 4.4 in Q1 and 3.0 in prior year.
Talking about the various industry segments we serve.
Automotive continues strong globally with OEMs continuing to struggle for replenishing vehicle inventory.
The increase of electronic content clearly accelerates.
There are some temporary supply programs leading to some artificial slowdown of the industry.
Still expect previously forecasted growth of 10% versus prior year in terms of vehicles.
We see an exceptional growth of the industrial sectors, which indicates an ongoing broad global upturn.
Factory automation and accelerated residential development, governmental investments in power generation and transmission systems as well as alternative energy systems are driving the demand.
Markets for computer and peripherals equipment are holding up well.
5G base station equipment continues to show promising growth in telecom.
Military spending continues reasonably strong commercial aerospace showing first signs of recovery.
The medical sector stabilized on a high level and consumer market sectors continued to show growth, driven by high rates of home construction, traditional television and gaming.
Coming to the business development for Vishay.
Due to high orders and backlogs and based on the continued increase of manufacturing capacities, Q2 sales excluding exchange rate impacts came in at a record and above the midpoint of our guidance.
We achieved sales of $819 million versus $765 million in prior quarter and $582 million in prior year.
Excluding exchange rate effects, sales in Q2 were up by $55 million or by 7% versus prior quarter and up by $215 million or 36% versus prior year.
Book-to-bill in the second quarter remained on a very high level of 1.38 after 1.67 in prior quarter, 1.41 for distribution after 1.89 in quarter one, 1.34 for OEMs after 1.41, 1.41 for semiconductors after 1.86 in Q1, 1.35 for passives after 1.50 in quarter one, 1.33 for the Americas after 1.42 in the first quarter, 1.29 for Asia after 1.86 in Q1, 1.54 for Europe after 1.62 in Q1.
Backlog in the second quarter climbed to another record high of 7.5 months after 6.8 months in Q1, 8.4 months in semis after 7.7 months in quarter one and 6.7 months in passives after 5.9 months last quarter.
There's practically no price decline, in fact there are some increases quarter-over-quarter.
Vis-a-vis prior quarter, we saw a price increase of 1% and versus prior year a slight loss of 0.3%.
In semis, these numbers were an increase of 1.5% versus prior quarter and a slight decrease of 0.7% versus prior year.
For passives, price increases plus 0.4% versus prior quarter and plus 0.1% versus prior year.
Some highlights of operations.
SG&A costs in the second quarter came in at $104 million according to expectations when excluding exchange rate effects.
Manufacturing fixed costs in the second quarter came in at $141 million and according to expectation without ex tax rate effects.
Total employment at the end of the second quarter was 22,500, 2% up from prior quarter at 22,060.
Excluding exchange rate impacts, inventories in the quarter increased by $31 million, $11 million in raw materials and $20 million in way-in-process and finished goods.
Inventory turns in the second quarter remained at a very high level of 4.8.
Capital spending in Q2 was $32 million versus $25 million in prior year, $20 million for expansion, $2 million for cost reduction and $10 million for the maintenance of business.
In view of the extremely high market demand, we are accelerating mid-term expansion programs noticeably.
We now expect for the year '21 capex of approximately $250 million.
We generated in the second quarter cash from operations of $365 million on a trailing 12-month basis.
We generated in the second quarter free cash of $230 million, again on a trailing 12-month basis.
Despite increased capex, we also for the current year expect a solid generation of free cash, quite in line with our tradition.
Let me come to our product lines and I start as always with resistors.
With resistors, we enjoy a very strong position in the auto, industrial, military and medical market segments.
We offer virtually all resistor technologies and are globally known as a reliable and high quality supplier of the broadest product range.
Vishay's traditional and historically growing business has recovered completely from the pandemic running at record levels now.
Sales in the quarter were $195 million, up by $8 million or 4% versus prior quarter and up by $47 million or 32% versus prior year, all excluding exchange rate impacts.
Book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter continued strong at 1.39 after 1.50 in prior quarter.
Backlog increased further to 6.6 months from 5.6 months in prior quarter.
Due to higher volume and quite excellent efficiencies in the plants, gross margin in the second quarter increased further to 30% of sales from 29% in prior quarter.
Inventory turns in the quarter remained at a very high level of 5.1.
Selling prices are increasing plus 0.5% versus prior quarter and plus 0.6% versus prior year.
We are in process to raise critical manufacturing capacities for resistor chips and for power wirebond substantially, opening also a new production site in China.
And we do expect a very successful year for resistors.
This business consists of power inductors and magnetics.
Since years, this is our fastest growing business we have in passives and represents one of the greater success stories of Vishay.
Exploiting the growing need for inductors in general, Vishay developed a platform of robust and efficient power inductors and leads the market technically.
With magnetics, we are very well positioned in specialty businesses, demonstrating their steady growth.
Sales of inductors in the second quarter were $86 million, up by $2 million or 3% versus prior quarter and up by $19 million or 29% versus prior year, all excluding exchange rate effects.
Book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter increased to 1.21 after 1.13 in prior quarter, backlog grew to 5.1 months from 4.5 in Q1.
Gross margin reached a quite excellent level of 34% of sales after 33% in the first quarter.
Inventory turns normalized to a level of 4.7, down from 5.1 in the first quarter.
We see a reduced price pressure.
We see price increases of 0.8% versus prior quarter and a decline of 2.2% versus prior year.
We are accelerating our next steps of capacity expansion for power inductors in order to get ahead of the demand curve.
Our business with capacitors is based on a broad range of technologies with a strong position in American and European market niches.
We enjoy increasing opportunities in the fields of power transmission and of electro cars namely in Asia, especially in China.
Sales in the second quarter were $120 million, 13% above prior quarter and 36% above prior year without exchange rate effects.
Book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter remained at a high level of 1.37 after 1.73 in prior quarter.
Backlog increased to a record level of 7.7 months from 7.4 months in Q1.
Gross margin in the quarter improved further to 24% of sales coming from 23% in Q1.
Inventory turns in the quarter remained at 3.9.
Selling prices are increasing, plus 0.2% versus prior quarter, plus 1% versus prior year.
We also expect a good year for capacitors driven by large governmental projects in China by a solid mill business and a very friendly business environment in general.
Vishay's business with opto products consists of infrared emitters, receivers, sensors and couplers.
The business in 2020 experienced a significant recovery from disappointing results in prior years.
Also in opto, we see a strong acceleration of demand.
Sales in the quarter were $76 million, 3% below prior quarter, but 47% above prior year without exchange rate impacts.
Book-to-bill in the second quarter remained at a very high level of 1.69 after 1.66 in the first quarter.
Backlog continued to grow to an extreme high of 9.3 months after 7 months in Q1, partially due to COVID-related restrictions of manufacturing capacities in Malaysia.
This is the only place we incurred such restrictions.
Gross margin in the second quarter remained at an excellent level of 32% of sales after 33% in the first quarter.
I think we can say that opto is back to its historical profitability level.
We see more normal inventory turns of 5.8 in the quarter after 6.4 in Q1.
Also in the case of opto, selling prices are going up, plus 1.7% in prior quarter and plus 1.5% versus prior year.
And we are in process to modernize and expand the Heilbronn fab in Germany.
Diodes for Vishay represents a broad commodity business where we are the largest supplier worldwide.
Vishay offers virtually all technologies as well as the most complete product portfolio.
The business has a very strong position in the automotive and industrial market segments and keeps growing steadily and profitably since years.
The business has started to exceed pre-pandemic levels.
Sales in the quarter were $175 million, up by $18 million or by 11% versus prior quarter and up by $47 million or 36% versus prior year without exchange rate effects.
There is a continued strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.45 in the quarter after 1.85 in the first quarter.
Backlog climbed to an extreme high of 8.9 months from 7.9 months in prior quarter.
Gross margin continued to improve to now 24% of sales as compared to 22% in Q1.
Inventory turns were at 4.7 after 4.8 in prior quarter.
Also for diode, selling prices are increasing by 1.7% versus prior quarter and by 0.2% versus prior year.
We decided for a substantial expansion of our in-house fab capacity in Taipei introducing at the same time the 8-inch technology relevant also of course for cost reduction.
As expected, diodes with a return to normal volumes has reached the pre-pandemic profitability levels.
Vishay is one of the market leaders in MOSFET transistors.
With MOSFETs, we enjoy a strong and growing market position in particular in automotive, which in view of an increasing use of MOSFETs in automotive will provide a successful future.
Demand has reached extreme levels and increases further.
Sales in the quarter were $168 million, a record level, 10% above prior quarter and 39% above prior year excluding exchange rate effects.
Book-to-bill ratio for MOSFETs in the quarter was 1.26 after 1.97 in the first quarter.
Backlog remained at an extreme level of 7.9 months as compared to 7.8 in Q1.
Due to a combination of higher volume, better prices and even better efficiencies, gross margin in the quarter increased noticeably to 28% of sales, up from 24% in prior quarter.
Inventory turns in the quarter increased further to 5.0 from 4.7 in Q1.
We see decreasing price pressure.
We have indeed increases of prices reasonably prior quarter of 1.2% and minus 2.5% versus prior year, much lower than normal.
MOSFETs remain key for Vishay's growth going forward.
Our industry and also Vishay continues to operate in a quite excellent economic environment.
There is an unstoppable global trend toward electronification that makes our future promising.
We are exploiting the present high demand to the best we can.
But beyond this, we expect a mid-term acceleration of the electronification worldwide.
We are preparing ourselves in terms of available machine capacities and will provide the capital required.
While enjoying higher growth, we will definitely keep our feet on the ground in terms of fixed costs, as we always did so in the past.
But we do plan to increase further our technical presence in the markets and we will increase critical R&D resources.
We will do our utmost to remain the same fair and service oriented supplier close to our customers we are known for.
The results for the third quarter look promising.
We guide to a sales range between $810 million and $850 million at a gross margin of 28.3%, plus/minus 15 basis points.
We'll now open the call to questions.
Ashley, please take the first question.
","Vishay reported a record quarterly revenue of $819 million in Q2 2021, a 7.1% increase quarter-over-quarter and a significant 40.8% surge compared to the same period last year. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.61 for the quarter. Operating margin was 15.3%, with gross margin remaining steady at 28%. Variable costs were flat, while manufacturing cost reductions and volume-related efficiencies offset increased material and metal prices. Vishay experienced strong demand in all regions and across all end markets, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.38 and a record backlog of 7.5 months. The company is optimistic about Q3, guiding sales to a range of $810 million to $850 million, with a gross margin of 28.3%. Vishay is investing heavily in capacity expansion to meet the increasing demand and expects to generate solid free cash flow for the current year."
FE_q4_2020.txt,"We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Participants in today's call include our President and acting Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Executive Director and independent Board member, Chris Pappas.
We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.
Before I get into our results, I wanted to kick off the call with a few words on a critical area of focus for FirstEnergy.
Taking appropriate actions to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity, we are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic in second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders.
This focus is absolutely essential for our success as an organization.
Our commitment starts at the top and extends throughout the organization.
We are working to ensure that every leader is actively engaged in setting the proper tone and creating an environment where not only our words, but our actions align with our core values and behaviors.
We're building a world-class compliance function to underpin this effort, including bringing on Hyun Park as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer in January.
Hyun is the right person to step into this role at this time, and he will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift.
We will also be appointing a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who will manage a dedicated team of compliance professionals and enhance our efforts to improve our compliance function by shifting from a decentralized to a more centralized model.
In addition, we'll be designating compliance ambassadors throughout the company to act as boots on the ground, ensuring the entire organization understands the critical importance of compliance and what it means for each individual.
We are also making significant changes in our approach to political and legislative engagement and advocacy.
Our activity in this space will be much more limited than it has been in the past, with closer alignment to our strategic goals and with additional oversight and significantly more robust disclosure.
With this additional transparency, my goal is to make it crystal clear exactly what efforts we support.
These efforts, together with enhanced policies and procedures, will help to bring additional clarity around appropriate behaviors at FirstEnergy.
And through enhanced communications, training, and most importantly, our actions, we are dedicated to reemphasizing that every employee at every level has the responsibility to consistently act in accordance with our core values and behaviors and to speak up if they see inappropriate behavior anywhere in the organization.
At the same time, we're taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and brand and focus on the future.
This includes the decisions recently made with respect to Ohio that I'll talk about shortly.
And while we don't control the time line related to the DOJ and SEC, we will continue to cooperate fully with these government investigations and remain focused on the matters that we can control.
But be assured that both management and the Board will be relentless and take the steps needed to position our company for long-term success.
Now turning to earnings.
Today, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share.
On Tuesday, we announced several proactive steps we're taking to resolve a range of regulatory proceedings affecting our Ohio utilities.
These include our previously announced agreement with the Ohio Attorney General, along with the decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues.
This resulted in a charge of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter.
Absent this charge, our 2020 operating earnings would have been $2.54 per share.
Well above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range and reflective of our strong performance last year.
While this was a difficult decision, we are confident it was the right decision.
We believe resolving these matters in a comprehensive manner is a critical step to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and integrity in every aspect of our business, while taking steps toward removing uncertainty relating to our current Ohio regulatory matters.
And in the interest of providing additional transparency, today's investor materials will include more information about regulatory ROEs in each of the states we serve.
We remain excited about the significant investment opportunities that will continue to drive solid earnings and growth in the years ahead.
When we have further clarity in Ohio, and with the ongoing government investigations, we intend to resume providing a long-term growth rate that should be consistent with traditional utility growth rates and similar to what we have provided in the past.
For now, we are focusing on this year and we have introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
Because we have a lot of ground to cover today, including: our solid operational performance last year, even in the face of the pandemic; our strategy for 2021 and beyond, including our commitment to building shareholder value; and the work we're doing to position the company for the future.
Our fundamental performance continues to be excellent.
We continued making demonstrable progress on our strategic goals, and we had an exceptional year from a safety perspective.
Even with about half of our employees working from home and the others adopting new health and safety protocols, the FirstEnergy team has remained laser focused on providing safe and reliable service to our six million customers.
I am deeply proud of the team's resilience and commitment, especially in light of the turbulence that marked the year.
Our results in 2020 reflect our commitment to strong operations as well as the stability provided by our diverse footprint and our wires-focused platform.
Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission systems as we continued our reliability in grid mod program to benefit customers.
We believe our robust long-term organic growth opportunities are well aligned with the focus on electrification and the critical role the grid plays in supporting the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.
These opportunities and our goals that support them are included in our strategic plan, published last month and available on our website.
I hope you have taken some time to review it.
This updated plan addresses our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability and identifies old goals for key areas of our business.
These goals are aligned with our core values and behaviors, our regulatory strategy and our commitments to our customers, communities and investors as well as environmental stewardship.
Among these objectives outlined in the plan is our pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
This ambitious goal reflects our transformation to a regulated electric utility and our responsibility to help create a sustainable energy future.
The strategic plan also addresses our continued commitment to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace.
We've had a D&I-focused KPI for three years now and we are taking even more aggressive steps to make progress in this area.
We're excited to pursue a 30% increase in our number of racially and ethnically underrepresented employees by 2025, both overall and at the supervisor and above level.
We believe this will help accelerate our transformation into an innovative, diverse and sustainable company and drive an important shift in our corporate culture.
We recently completed our fourth companywide survey of all employees.
Overall, I'm proud to say we scored relatively well on many fronts, but we certainly have more work to do.
One area identified for improvement is listening and valuing the opinions of our employees.
We want employees to feel empowered to voice their opinion on important issues and my team, with guidance and support from the Board of Directors, is addressing this head-on.
We view this work as central to strengthening our compliance program and a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability.
I'd like to explain my approach to driving this change, and perhaps we could use the company's safety culture as an analogy.
Several years ago, we had concerns that our safety culture was trending in the wrong direction.
Management led a significant effort with our employees to put in place new programs and training.
And to consistently demonstrate that safety is and will always be an unwavering core value.
These efforts ultimately instituted a cultural shift in how we all understood the critical importance of safety.
We want that very same cultural shift to occur as it relates to compliance and ethics.
As we look ahead, I feel confident in our path forward.
We have a strong foundation.
Our fundamentals are solid, and our strategies are proven.
And we are building on that with a relentless focus on making FirstEnergy a better company as we work to rebuild trust, work to achieve financial results and deliver for our customers and investors.
We recognize that changes won't happen overnight.
They happen over time, just like the evolution in our safety culture I spoke about earlier.
I'm confident we will emerge a stronger, better FirstEnergy.
First, I'd like to reiterate the Board's strong support of Steve and recognize the hard work he and the rest of the team are doing.
We commend their willingness to learn from the past and their absolute commitment to take this company forward on a new path, all while executing the company's strategy and keeping operations and financial results on solid footing.
The Board and management team are focused on a critical objective: to move forward from the past actions of certain former executives; and to take the steps necessary to improve the tone at the top, culture of ethics and integrity and the way we do business.
Steve talked about a lot of the important work that is being driven by the new management team.
Likewise, the Board is committed to strengthening every part of FirstEnergy's culture and taking the necessary steps to reestablish credibility.
Together, we have made much progress on the issues that confronted the company several months ago.
And at the same time, we recognize there is more work to do.
I'd like to recap some of the steps that the Board has been actively engaged in to drive improvements in our culture of compliance.
First, the Board promptly put in place an independent committee with external counsel to oversee the internal investigation and to monitor the status of the various regulatory and legal matters facing the company.
The independent committee, which currently is made up of the entire board, meets frequently and regularly.
The Board acted as swiftly in the removal of five executives, named Steve Strah as acting CEO, established an Executive Director role and expanded the role of the Board's share, all to assist management and the Board with the dynamics we faced in the first months of the investigation.
The Board unequivocally endorsed the principle of full cooperation with both the DOJ and the SEC on the matters related to the investigation.
And through our own internal investigation, led by independent counsel, has supported intensive analysis.
The Board established a compliance oversight subcommittee of the Audit Committee with independent counsel and leading compliance advisors to analyze and improve the compliance policy and culture at FirstEnergy.
Steve mentioned some initial output from this work earlier.
In addition, the Board established a number of working groups to oversee and support various work streams, including communications, recruiting and financial flexibility.
And to that point, management has initiated a project called FirstEnergy Forward, a transformational effort to change the way the company does business.
The objective of this project is to transform the company for the future, but it will also provide near-term financial flexibility.
Jon will discuss this later on the call.
We know there is particular interest in the status of the internal investigation.
Hopefully, my earlier comments give you a sense of the intensity and the magnitude of the work that has occurred within the company and with the benefit of extensive external independent support.
Our internal investigation continues to be thorough and robust.
And includes assistance from external law firms who are supported by several other consultants.
The ongoing investigation has not resulted in any new material items not previously disclosed.
In the course of the internal investigation, we did identify certain transactions, which, in some instances, extended back 10 years or more, including vendor services that were either improperly classified, misallocated to certain of utility or transmission companies or lacked proper supporting documentation.
These transactions result in amounts collected from customers that were immaterial to FirstEnergy, and our utility and transmission companies will be working with the appropriate regulatory agencies to address these amounts.
Our internal investigation will also continue to address any due developments in connection with the ongoing DOJ and SEC investigations.
More importantly, we are increasing our focus on another critical aspect of our work, moving FirstEnergy forward.
The fresh perspective of Hyun Park and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer will be invaluable to creating an environment where the entire team is committed to embracing the right behaviors and embedding a strong culture of compliance.
He will also join the executive team on a transitional basis as Executive Director and act in advisory capacity to support efforts to achieve the company's priorities: restore its reputation and strengthen its overall governance and compliance functions.
John is a 40-year industry executive with extensive energy experience in navigating complex challenges and driving strong corporate governance.
Bringing John into this full-time role means that I will step back from the Executive Director position I've held since October and return to my regular duties as an independent Board member by April 1.
And importantly, we will continue to fully support the management team as it transitions FirstEnergy to the future as a more resilient company.
Despite the challenges the company has faced, FirstEnergy's operating fundamentals are strong, and we have a great platform of assets.
Together, we have put in place a robust plan to move forward and to position FirstEnergy as an industry leader.
One, we know it can be and one that will deliver excellent value to its customers and shareholders.
We look forward to working together alongside with management in this effort.
Today, I will review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters.
Our operating results include the charge at our Ohio utilities that Steve mentioned earlier.
Absent this charge, our results reflect continued rate base growth related to our transmission and distribution investment programs, a favorable mix of customer usage reflecting the impact of our residential customers staying at home and higher expenses mostly associated with the pandemic.
Additional fourth quarter data is available in the supporting materials on our website.
As Steve mentioned, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share, which compared to 2019 GAAP results of $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.55 per share.
In our distribution business, in addition to the $0.15 charge at our Ohio utilities, results for 2020 as compared to 2019 reflect the absence of Rider DMR in Ohio, which was in place for the first half of 2019 and higher operating costs.
These were partially offset by higher revenues from increased residential usage as well as earnings from our distribution enhancement programs.
Although total weather-adjusted sales decreased 2% in 2020, normal usage from our residential customers increased 5% for the year, which from an earnings perspective more than offset the 6% decrease in commercial and industrial loan.
While this shift has moderated as the pandemic wears on, we have seen higher weather-adjusted residential usage relative to our latest forecast in the 2% to 4% range with flat to slightly higher C&I usage.
In our transmission business, approximately $550 million in rate base growth drove stronger results, which were partially offset by higher financing costs, the impact of transmission rate true-ups and the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2019.
And finally, at our corporate segment, full year 2020 results primarily reflect higher corporate expenses, higher interest costs and a lower consolidated tax rate.
Today, we are providing 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and first quarter operating earnings guidance in the range of $0.62 to $0.72 per share.
Our expectations for the year include capital investments of up to $3 billion, with 100% of the $1.2 billion in transmission investment and approximately 40% of the $1.7 billion in distribution investment being recovered in a formula rate.
Our transmission plan includes continued expansion of our Energizing the Future program.
In December, FERC accepted our proposed tariff revisions for the transmission assets of West Penn Power, Mon Power, and Potomac Edison as well as the new Keystone Appalachian Transmission Company known as KATCo, pending the outcome of the settlement and hearing process.
Other key drivers for 2021 include the impact from the base distribution case at JCP&L, continued investment in our distribution enhancement programs and lower operating costs.
We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher interest expense, which includes close to $0.04 per share associated with the step-up on $4 billion of holding company bonds, and $0.05 per share associated with our revolver borrowings that I'll address in a moment.
Additionally, our load forecast has a more typical usage profile for our residential customers and a slower recovery to pre pandemic levels for our C&I customers.
Equity remains a part of our overall financing plan, and we are affirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023, and we will flex these plans as needed.
We remain committed to maintaining adequate liquidity for our distribution and transmission subsidiaries.
At year-end, our liquidity was approximately $3 billion, with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of undrawn capacity under our credit facilities.
We currently have $2.2 billion of short-term borrowings, of which approximately $2.1 billion was incurred in November as a proactive measure to increase our cash position to preserve financial flexibility.
And we have committed to our bank group that as we work through our financing plan, we expect to reduce short-term borrowings with the timing and amount dependent on a number of factors.
Our current maturities of long-term debt remain manageable with only $74 million maturing in 2021.
We remain in close contact with the rating agencies who are intensely focused on governance and the actions we are taking to strengthen our compliance environment and controls.
Improving our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, while committed -- committing to return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintaining the strong credit ratings at our utilities are key priorities.
We are targeting future FFO to debt metrics in the 12% to 13% range at the consolidated level as we work to address some of the uncertainties that Chris and Steve mentioned.
We know how important the dividend continues to be for our investors in accordance with our target payout ratio of 55% to 65%.
The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 in December, payable March 1.
And as we mentioned on our third quarter call, our intent is to hold the 2021 dividend flat to the 2020 level of $1.56 per share, subject to ongoing Board review and approval.
The Board will obviously need to consider the entire landscape of the investigation process before each quarterly dividend is declared.
Finally, Chris mentioned that we've kicked off a project, FE Forward, that I see transforming FirstEnergy into a more efficient and effective industry leader, delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns.
In partnership with McKenzie, employees across FirstEnergy are challenging organizational traditions, conventional wisdom and cultural norms.
At the same time, we are focused on modernizing our management practices, processes and digital and technology platforms to deliver a superior customer experience and a much more nimble organization for the future.
While we view this as a transformational effort, we expect to naturally deliver efficiencies that will help us address whatever comes our way in the future, while meeting all of our regulatory commitments.
Beyond these benefits, we expect that this transformation will provide us the ability to reinvest in our business, our customers and our employees to become a better technology-enabled leader in the industry, committed to innovation, investments in emerging technologies and to support a smarter and cleaner electric grid.
While this project is not the only step in our journey, it's a critical one.
The eight-week information gathering phase of the project included intense and robust employee engagement to better understand how we work and how we can do it better through the use of more modern technology, digital and mobility tools and the use of data and analytics.
As we enter into the next phase of this effort, we will again engage employees throughout the company to review and assess each opportunity and build out the plans to transform FirstEnergy.
Over the next few months, we will build out specific actions for the future, which we look forward to sharing.
We received a letter dated February 16, 2021, from Icahn Capital, informing the company that Carl Icahn is making a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and has an intention to acquire voting securities of FirstEnergy an amount exceeding $184 million, but less than $920 million, depending on various factors, including market conditions.
We do not know whether Carl Icahn and his affiliates have acquired shares of FirstEnergy common stock and/or derivatives, and we do not know his intentions with respect to our company.
The letter represents our only contact with Icahn Capital and we don't have any additional information to share.
","FirstEnergy reported strong operational performance in 2020, with GAAP earnings per share of $1.99 and operating earnings per share of $2.39, despite facing challenges and regulatory proceedings. The company resolved various Ohio matters with a charge of $0.15 per share, resulting in operating earnings of $2.54 per share if omitted. FirstEnergy has introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, aligning with traditional utility growth rates. Management has implemented significant efforts to enhance compliance, including appointing a new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park, and establishing a dedicated Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. FirstEnergy is committed to transparency and accountability, focusing on investing in its distribution and transmission systems, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and fostering diversity and inclusion. The company acknowledges the importance of addressing historical actions and rebuilding trust by prioritizing ethical behavior and compliance. FirstEnergy believes that ongoing efforts will strengthen their compliance program and culture of integrity, positioning them for long-term success."
CLX_q4_2021.txt,"We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well.
Before we get started, I want to let you know that we're making some changes to how we present our results.
Today, Linda will start by providing some overall key takeaways for the year.
Next, I'll follow up with some highlights from each of our segments.
Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '22.
And finally, Linda will return to offer her perspective, and we'll close with Q&A.
Now a few reminders before we go into results.
These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes.
In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Fiscal '21 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results.
Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all four reportable segments.
This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal '20.
On a two-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth.
With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail.
Fiscal year '21 adjusted earnings per share decreased 2% to $7.25.
Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I would like to reinforce what matters most: long-term profitable growth.
With a business that's significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders.
When I look at fiscal '21, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products as well as the resilience of our category as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio.
As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position among global consumers, with strong household penetration, supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users.
The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE Strategy to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities.
The industry environment remains dynamic, with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty.
In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share.
The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future.
We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient and more profitable company.
This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly.
We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE Strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value.
For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products had a pronounced impact on sales growth as we moved through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year.
The magnitude of this quarter's gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs.
I'll discuss shortly the actions we're taking to address these headwinds.
Now let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE Strategy.
First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I'm pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target.
Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to know 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year.
Our higher investment in personalization has led to significantly improved ROI.
It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence in continued investments in our brands.
Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal '21, and new products were a bigger contributor to our top line, which we expect to continue in fiscal '22.
Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last two years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales.
Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals.
For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on science-based targets for our operations and Scope three emissions to the Science Based Targets initiative in June.
And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the wellbeing of our teammates and our values-based inclusive culture.
I'm particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history, with a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average.
I'm also pleased that in fiscal '21, we continued to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies.
Now let me turn to fiscal '22.
We expect inflationary pressure to persist, along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal '21.
While this is reflected in our fiscal '22 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales targets.
Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3.
And we're holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser focus on rebuilding margin.
We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses.
This represents about 50% of our portfolio.
We're also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll communicate at the right time.
Based on the constructive conversations we're having with our retail partners and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans.
In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program.
We expect sequential gross margin improvements as we progress through fiscal '22, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4.
In terms of market share, as we've discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but have made notable progress.
With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June, we achieved our highest case fill rate since the start of the pandemic.
I'm pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data, ending July 17, we saw market share gains in seven out of nine businesses.
Certainly, we recognize there's more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad Trash, and we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time.
Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities rooted in our IGNITE Strategy to deliver our long-term growth aspirations.
While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there's been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer-term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms.
The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities.
Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chau Banks, who has extensive experience in business-driven digital transformation, to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic.
With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next five years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP.
This will enhance our supply chain to better position Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand-building efforts.
Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective.
We'll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data-driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways.
Innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October.
Tony has more than 20 years of brand-building experience with leading consumer companies.
Ensuring we have stickier innovation delivering multiyear value, we're driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and Scentiva, which continue to grow.
In addition, we're extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams.
We're continuing to support our brands, especially margin-accretive innovation, with disciplined high-ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty.
We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand.
We are still in the early stages of a multiyear journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer-term.
And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impacts and long-term value creation as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision-making every day.
Now turning to our segment results.
In Health and Wellness, Q4 sales decreased 17% for the quarter, while full year sales were up 8%, with growth across all businesses.
On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 22%.
In Cleaning, sales were down by double digits compared to double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the deceleration of demand across various cleaning and disinfecting products.
On a full year basis, Cleaning sales grew behind a strong front half performance.
While demand fell faster than anticipated, it remains higher than it was pre-pandemic, with strong repeat rates among new buyers.
Importantly, our supply and product assortment are almost fully restored, which is reflected in our market share improvement, especially in wipes and sprays.
As consumer demand migrated to more preferred forms and value packs, we also saw a negative impact to price mix, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters.
Going forward, we'll be focused on strengthening our merchandising activities, especially for the back-to-school period.
Sales in Professional Products were down by double digits versus year ago period, when we experienced double-digit growth.
For the full year, Professional Products sales were up by double digits, fueled by an exceptional front half performance.
Demand started moderating in Q3 and continued into Q4 as customers worked through high inventory levels, especially of Clorox T 360 electrostatic sprayers.
In the short term, we expect results will continue to be volatile as we lap periods with unprecedented demand.
Longer-term, this business continues to be a strategic growth area for the company.
As part of our initiative to expand into new channels, we continue to add to our roster of out-of-home partnerships, including Live Nation, the world's leading live events company.
Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business increased by double digits this quarter after lapping a double-digit decrease caused by a supply disruption related to COVID-19.
For the full year, sales were up as well.
Sales growth for the quarter was driven by a strong performance in the food, drug and mass channel and e-commerce.
Turning to the Household segment.
Q4 sales were down 8%.
Full year sales grew 10%, with growth across all three businesses.
On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8% and full year sales grew 12%.
Glad sales decreased by double digits in Q4, lapping strong double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, which was impacted by initial stockpiling.
For the full year, sales were up.
Our efforts going forward are focused on managing base with the strong inflationary headwinds we're facing.
And as Linda mentioned, we still have more work to do in this business to restore market share.
Grilling sales decreased by double digits in Q4 as demand started moderating after four consecutive quarters of strong double-digit growth.
For the full year, sales grew by double digits, fueled by very strong consumption overall.
Our focus on expanding distribution of our latest innovation, Kingsford Pellets, continued with a nationwide launch, building on the product's initial success, while we're also introducing signature flavors made with 100% real spices that will be available in select retailers before Labor Day as we gear up for the 2022 grilling season.
This innovation is intended to help our business continue building consumption among multicultural millennials and other heavy grillers.
Cat Litter sales grew by double digits in Q4 driven by continued strong consumption.
For the full year, Litter sales also grew.
The result reflected strength in e-commerce, with Fresh Step becoming the number one brand online for the first time and positive overall category trends, boosted by record pet adoptions during the pandemic.
In our Lifestyle segment, sales were down 3% and full year sales grew 6%.
On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 13% and full year sales grew 16%.
Brita sales were down as demand continued to moderate from an extended period of elevated consumption.
Full year sales grew on top of double-digit growth in the prior year.
Despite the deceleration in Q4, business fundamentals are strong, especially now that our supply is mostly restored.
We're excited about the strong merchandising program we've put in place this year, including the largest back-to-college event ever for the brand.
The Food business was down, primarily due to lower shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings, with consumption moderating as consumer mobility improved.
Full year sales were up by double digits, on top of double-digit growth in the prior year.
The consumer fundamentals for this business are strong, with the brand growing market share and household penetration.
Burt's Bees sales increased by double digits this quarter as overall category consumption begin to recover.
Full year sales were down as category consumption was negatively impacted by store closures, mask mandates and stay-at-home measures.
We expect this business to continue to recover as people begin returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns and consumer mobility keeps improving.
We'll build on that momentum with our new ""Lips To Love"" campaign, supported by a strong innovation pipeline.
Lastly, turning to International.
Q4 sales grew 5%, reflecting the combined impact of the Saudi JV acquisition and benefit of price increases, partially offset by lower shipments due to the moderating demand after a period of elevated consumption.
Extended lockdowns in Canada also contributed to the decrease in shipments.
The results are on top of 12% growth in the year ago period, when we saw elevated consumption across our portfolio during the early stages of the pandemic.
Importantly, we continue to expand our global Disinfecting Wipes business, building on the dedicated international supply chain that was developed in five months and are making progress launching our Clorox Expert Disinfecting Wipes in existing countries as well as new markets.
For the full year, sales increased 14%, reflecting very strong growth for the majority of the year before moderating in Q4.
On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 17% and full year sales grew 19%.
As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year '21, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year '20.
While this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook, we feel good about delivering another strong sales year.
Of course, we continue to manage through an extremely challenging cost environment, which impacted our fiscal year margins and earnings.
Importantly, we delivered another year of strong cash flow, which came in at $1.3 billion compared to a record $1.5 billion for fiscal year '20.
I'm pleased our strong cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program, representing an increase of about 90% in cash returned to shareholders versus fiscal year '20.
Before I review our Q4 results, I wanted to highlight a $28 million noncash charge we booked in Q4 related to a third-party supplier for our Professional Products business.
As we have shared previously, during the height of the pandemic, we worked with a number of third-party suppliers to support us in addressing unprecedented demand in the consumer and professional spaces.
We are reducing our reliance on one of these suppliers, and as a result, we took a charge in the fourth quarter.
Important to note, this noncash charge is included in our reported earnings per share and excluded from our Q4 adjusted earnings per share as it represents a nonrecurring item.
Turning to our fourth quarter results.
Fourth quarter sales decreased 9% in comparison to a 22% increase in the year ago quarter, delivering a two-year stack of 13% sales growth.
Our sales results reflect an 8% decline in organic volume and two points of unfavorable price mix, primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as supply improvements resulted in a broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs.
On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales declined 10%.
Fourth quarter sales were lower than expected, primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as demand for cleaning and disinfecting products moderated more rapidly than we had previously anticipated.
While the cleaning and disinfecting category continues to moderate, we're pleased to see improving share as we've increased our ability to supply.
Gross margin for the quarter decreased 970 basis points to 37.1% compared to 46.8% in the year ago quarter.
Gross margin results were lower than anticipated, largely driven by higher input costs and lower sales.
The year-over-year change in Q4 gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales, resulting in lower manufacturing fixed cost absorption as well as significant cost headwinds, driving about 290 basis points of higher commodity costs, 180 basis points of increased transportation costs as well as 130 basis points of unfavorable mix.
Our fourth quarter gross margin also includes about 70 basis points of negative impact from the noncash charge I just mentioned.
These margin headwinds were partially offset by about 90 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of benefit from our pricing actions in our International division.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.4% compared to 14.1% in the year ago quarter.
Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 12%, with U.S. spending at about 14% of sales.
Strong investments in Q4 supported our back half innovation program and reflected our continued focus on building loyalty among new consumers.
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 0%, primarily driven by a tax benefit from the exiting of a small foreign subsidiary, which was mostly offset by the charge we took to pre-tax book income associated with this decision as well as favorable return to provision adjustments.
On a full year basis, our effective tax rate was 20%.
Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $0.95 versus $2.41 in the year ago quarter, a decline of 61%.
Before I review the details of our outlook, let me provide perspective on the strategic investment Linda discussed.
We are planning to invest about $500 million over the next five years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including the replacement of our ERP.
In fiscal year '22, we plan to invest about $90 million in operating and capital expenditures, with about $55 million impacting our P&L and the remainder reflected in our balance sheet.
Beginning in Q1 and going forward, our adjusted earnings per share will exclude the portion of the $500 million investment that flows through our P&L to provide better insights into our underlying operating performance of our business.
Now turning to our fiscal year '22 outlook.
We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year, in addition to the unfavorable mix and higher trade spending as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment.
We assume these factors will be partially offset by the pricing actions we're taking broadly across our portfolio.
Organic sales are expected to be down 2% to 6% as well.
We expect front half sales to decline high single to low double digits as we lap 27% growth in the front half of fiscal year '21, during the height of the pandemic.
Additionally, we expect Q1 sales to decline low double digits.
As we move to the back half of the year, we expect to return to the lower end of our long-term sales growth target.
Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, which could impact our outlook.
We anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points due to our assumption for significant ongoing headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs, which represent nearly $300 million in year-over-year cost increases.
We expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front half of the year, particularly in Q1, as we expect key commodity cost increases to reduce gross margin by about 500 basis points, driving our assumption for Q1 gross margin to decline 1,100 to 1,300 basis points.
For perspective, in Q1, we are lapping a modern gross margin record of 48%, reflecting over 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage on 27% sales growth in the year ago quarter.
This is based on our assumption that cost inflation will begin to moderate, and it will see the benefits from mitigating actions flow more fully through our P&L.
We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of sales, which includes about one point of impact related to our investment to enhance our digital capabilities.
Additionally, we anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest behind our brands and build market share.
We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%.
The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year.
Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted earnings per share to be between $5.40 to $5.70.
As we start fiscal year '22, I would like to emphasize our priority to address elevated cost pressures from both commodities and transportation throughout the fiscal year.
We are focused on executing the pricing actions we discussed today.
We have implemented our announced price increase on our Bags and Wraps and are taking pricing on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses.
This represents about 50% of our portfolio.
We are also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll announce at a later date.
While it's still early, we are confident in our ability to price given the strength of our brand and the constructive conversations we're having with retailers.
Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy, we're addressing short-term headwinds head-on, with an eye on the long-term health of our business.
We will continue to invest in our brands, including meaningful innovation to drive differentiation, which will help us continue to drive superior consumer value.
We are leaning into our cost savings program and productivity initiatives to help address ongoing cost pressures.
And we're accelerating investments in our digital transformation to drive increased capabilities, lower costs across our supply chain and improve innovation efforts and our brand engagement activities.
And finally, as Linda mentioned, our business is significantly larger than before the pandemic, and we're well positioned for the future.
Our global portfolio of trusted brands is more relevant than ever, and we're positioning ourselves to make the most of the changing consumer trends we see.
We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.
We're focused on strong execution in the face of dynamic conditions, including addressing significant cost headwinds and improving market share.
In addition, we have clarity on the strategic imperatives and executional mandate to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient and more profitable company.
And as we accelerate and execute our IGNITE Strategy, we're confident that it will drive improved performance.
","Clorox concluded fiscal 2021 with a 9% sales growth despite challenges like rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products. While sales declined by 9% in Q4, year-over-year sales still grew by 13%. The company delivered a 61% decline in adjusted earnings per share due to lower sales and higher costs, leading to a decrease in gross margin of 970 basis points. Despite headwinds, the company remains committed to its IGNITE strategy, which includes fuel growth, personalization, innovation, digital transformation, and ESG initiatives. In fiscal 2022, Clorox anticipates a sales decline of 2% to 6%, with ongoing demand moderation, higher trade spending, and unfavorable mix expected to be offset by pricing actions. Gross margin is projected to decline by 300 to 400 basis points, while selling and administrative expenses are expected to increase to 15% of sales. Adjusted earnings per share is forecasted to range between $5.40 and $5.70."

On our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Sheehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Jim Snee will provide a review of the Company's current and future operating conditions, commentary regarding each segment's performance for the quarter and a perspective on the balance of fiscal 2021.
Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results and commentary regarding the Company's current and future financial condition.
As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.
It will also be posted on our website and archived for one year.
Before we get started, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement.
It can be accessed on our website.
Once again this quarter, I want to recognize the heroic work of our production team members.
This team deserves much of the credit for our record sales results this quarter as they continued working to produce safe high-quality food for millions of consumers and customers.
Our number one priority has been to keep our team members safe and our cross-functional COVID-19 leadership team is ensuring we are on the leading edge of the country's vaccination efforts.
To date, we have fully vaccinated over 51% of our domestic workforce, which is well ahead of the country's vaccination rate.
We are encouraged by the rapid decline in cases in our communities.
From a top-line perspective, our balanced business model has again proven to be a winning formula as our team delivered record sales for the second quarter and first half.
In total, sales for the quarter increased 8% compared to last year, and the sales increased over 5% for the first half of the year.
A key driver of our sales performance is the rebound in our foodservice business.
As expected our foodservice team experienced a strong recovery and took numerous actions to properly position our organization to capitalize on the industry recovery.
For the quarter, foodservice sales increased 28%.
This reflects an increase of 1% over 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
This is a significant accomplishment, especially knowing where the industry was just a few short months ago.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our foodservice teams have been doing their part to support the industry.
Within days of the crisis, we worked closely with our distributor and operator partners to assist their businesses in many different ways; whether it was a rebate program to offset food costs, extending payment leniency, helping adjust to the new takeout delivery and pickup environment or simply being available to personally check in with the restaurant tour to see how they're doing.
Our confidence in the industry recovery never wavered.
We know these actions benefited our distributor and operator partners and are playing a part in our outperformance of the broader industry trends.
During this difficult labor environment, our experienced and tenured direct sales force is helping operators meet their accelerating demand with products that simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item.
Products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoke barbecue, Fontanini authentic Italian meat, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly Guacamole and Jennie-O Turkey are uniquely positioned to meet this need.
The brightest spot in our foodservice portfolio has been our pizza toppings business.
Prior to the pandemic, we capitalized on the continued growth in this category, especially for premium products and invested heavily in capacity to meet future demand.
We've also been investing in plant-based offerings and are seeing growth from our plant-based pepperoni and crumbles products.
We are excited to leverage our expertise in the pizza toppings category to drive growth in plant-based toppings.
With our new capacity expansion effort and with additional pepperoni capacity set to open at the beginning of fiscal 2022, we are set up nicely to meet the consistent growth we have seen in this space.
With the foodservice industry recovery well under way, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our valued partners, invest in our direct sales team and support the industry's return to growth with innovative, convenience and flavorful product solutions.
In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Total retail sales this quarter were flat to last year as we lapped the months when consumers were stocking their pantries in anticipation of the pandemic.
Sales finished up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
And we continued to see strength from our leading brands such as SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Black Label, Herdez and Wholly.
As a reminder, we experienced an immediate and sustained demand surge for our shelf-stable products in the Grocery Products segment at the onset of the pandemic.
The second wave of demand that impacted our perishable and refrigerated items happened weeks later in the third fiscal quarter.
Sales in the deli channel increased 4% this quarter and are up 9% over pre-pandemic levels.
Hormel Gatherings party trays delivered strong growth as consumers started to spend more time with family and friends, and consequently, are purchasing more products to entertain their guests.
The Columbus brand remains a cornerstone for our deli business, and it is now benefiting from the opening of our new plant in Omaha, which is providing much needed capacity.
Columbus is a leader in charcuterie, and we now have the capacity to continue expanding distribution.
Across the retail and deli space, our consumer takeaway metrics continue to be positive according to IRI.
Many of our brands have made large gains in household penetration, overall buy rates are improving and we are seeing an expansion in cross purchasing across our brands.
E-commerce sales grew double-digits in the last 12 weeks, according to IRI, and we are gaining share in important categories.
We will continue to increase our investment in this important channel.
Throughout the quarter, our supply chain continued to improve as we were able to increase production levels through a combination of gaining efficiencies, increasing capacities and leveraging our strategic supply chain partners.
Another area we have made great strides is in our distribution network.
Over the last year, we have opened a new Grocery Products distribution center, and, in recent weeks, have opened a Refrigerated distribution center serving the West Coast.
These strategic investments will reduce overall freight miles and costs, improve our customer service levels, support growth for our value-added businesses and reduce greenhouse emissions.
From a bottom-line perspective, operating income showed a slight decline.
We saw raw material and feed prices rapidly increase throughout the quarter.
We have taken pricing actions in many categories, but did not see the full benefit of these actions during the quarter.
As we have previously discussed, in volatile market conditions, pricing will lag the markets, which will shift profits to subsequent quarters.
Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year.
A higher tax rate negatively impacted earnings by $0.01 per share compared to last year.
Turning to the segments.
Refrigerated Foods volume increased 3% and sales increased 17%, with growth coming from almost every division.
Value added sales increased 18%, driven by a significant recovery in the foodservice businesses.
As anticipated, we saw a rapid increase in foodservice demand as the quarter progressed.
Almost all categories within the foodservice grew sales, led by our pizza toppings portfolio and brands such as Fontanini and Bacon 1.
In fact, pepperoni, pizza toppings, Bacon 1 and Fontanini authentic Italian meats all showed growth compared to the second quarter of 2019.
We also experienced a recovery in the premium breakfast portfolio, with growth from our Old Smokehouse brand.
Additionally, we saw excellent growth from our premium prepared proteins, which include brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Cafe H and Sadler's.
These items are key to our pre-strategy, items that are pre-marinated, pre-cooked, pre-sliced and fully prepared.
As the industry recovery accelerates into the summer and labor remains the predominant challenge for most operators, our line of products offer convenient, safe, versatile and flavorful solutions.
Our retail and deli teams delivered a strong quarter on the top line, with growth coming from products such as Black Label bacon, Hormel Gatherings, Applegate, Lloyd's Barbeque, Hormel Pepperoni and Columbus prepared foods items.
Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher foodservice sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability and decreased operational expenses due to abating COVID-19 cost pressures.
International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with sales increasing 17% and segment profit increasing 6%.
The performance of the team in China remains impressive.
Foodservice volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings, and bacon items.
Retail demand for the SPAM and SKIPPY brands has also been outstanding.
The Company's innovative offerings including beef jerky, SKIPPY snacking items and two new SPAM varieties are providing additional avenues for growth, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our China business.
Branded exports also grew with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher foodservice sales and improved margins on the fresh pork items.
In addition, our partners in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continued to experience elevated demand for shelf-stable products.
Grocery Products results were strong given the difficult comparison to last year due to the extremely high levels of demand experienced at the onset of the pandemic.
Even though volume declined 14%, sales declined 8% and segment profit declined 23%, we are encouraged by the segment's performance as we have seen sustained consumer demand for many of our brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Sales for center store brands such as SPAM, Hormel Chili, Compleats and Mary Kitchen hash were all over 20% higher compared to our second quarter of 2019.
We will continue to support our leading brands including SKIPPY, SPAM, Compleats, Herdez, Wholly, Justin's and Hormel Chili, and we're resuming promotional activity as inventory levels normalize.
Our MegaMex joint venture performed well, as equity and earnings increased 26%.
Both Herdez and Wholly brands grew as consumers looked for authentic and convenient Mexican products to enhance their at-home eating occasions.
The Herdez brand continues to outperform the salsa category.
This brand has grown households by 3 million since the start of the pandemic and has introduced industry leading innovation to the marketplace in recent years.
Following the highly successful performance of Herdez's Guacamole Salsa, we continue to expand distribution and grow share with two new product lines: Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Herdez Salsa Cremosas.
Recently, Herdez also entered the hot sauce market with the introduction of Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce, another versatile offering that can enhance any meal.
The Wholly brand had a strong quarter as well, as it continues to target consumers looking for convenient solutions to enjoy avocado offerings.
Our recent innovations, including Wholly Smashed and Wholly Diced Avocado products solve for that consumer need.
And as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter.
Jennie-O volume decreased 3% and sales increased 2%, a recovery in the foodservice business and higher whole bird sales drove the sales increase.
Foodservice volumes were up double digits compared to last year.
Demand for Jennie-O retail products such as Lean Ground Turkey remained above pre-pandemic levels.
Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 54% due to the impact from higher feed costs.
Grain prices continued to increase significantly during the quarter, while pricing action had yet to be fully reflected in the marketplace.
Jim Sheehan will provide further commentary on the actions we have taken to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs.
Looking to the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year sales guidance range to $10.2 billion to $10.8 billion, and reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82 per share.
As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of the Planters snacks nuts business.
Our diversified and balanced business model gives us confidence we can perform well in many different economic scenarios and market conditions.
We have a very positive outlook on the foodservice business as we head into the second half of the year.
We are well positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor partners and operators, and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery.
Additionally, we are increasingly confident that K-12 schools and colleges and universities will open and operate in a more traditional manner this fall.
This should benefit both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store.
We continue to see elevated demand in the retail, deli and international channels.
We expect to further benefit from pricing actions, increased capacities on key product lines and continued improvements in our supply chain.
This year, we have seen rapid increases in key input costs across our businesses, and we expect to operate in a high-cost environment for the remainder of the year.
Our experienced management team has a proven ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile and inflationary market conditions.
And once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to partner with our customers to mutually grow our businesses.
As a reminder, our operations were heavily impacted by plant shutdowns, supply shortages and lower production throughput caused by the effects of the pandemic in the back half of fiscal 2020.
This ultimately led to lower levels of inventory, which negatively affected the third and fourth quarters.
Through the strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our operations and based on our record first half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized operations in the back half of fiscal 2021.
I am confident in our ability to continue growing and I'm looking forward to closing the acquisition of Planters next month.
Record sales for the second quarter were $2.6 billion, an increase of 8%.
First half sales increased 5% to $5.1 billion, also a record.
Pre-tax earnings increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42 per share, flat to last year.
Second quarter results reflected approximately $0.01 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and $0.01 in higher tax expense.
SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.5% of sales, down slightly to last year.
Advertising spend for the quarter was $31 million.
Operating margins for the quarter were 11.1% compared to 12.1% last year.
Higher raw material and feed costs negatively impacted margins, as pricing lagged input cost increases.
We have taken numerous pricing actions across the portfolio to protect profitability.
The actions will take place early in the third quarter with additional pricing actions likely.
COVID-related expenses were $6 million.
The impact of COVID expenses continued to decline.
Net unallocated expenses decreased due to higher investment income.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 20.6% last year.
Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we estimate the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%.
We built inventory during the quarter in preparation for higher demand and to support continued growth for the remainder of the year.
Our strategic action to build inventory was the primary driver of lower operating cash flow during the quarter.
We paid our 371st consecutive quarterly dividend, effective May 17th, at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year.
Share repurchases were minimal during the quarter.
Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter.
The Company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million.
During the second quarter, we saw dramatic increases in pork and hog prices.
USDA composite cutout prices since January have increased more than $30, with all primals contributing to the increase.
Key inputs such as bellies and trim increased 57% and 76%, respectively, during the quarter.
Pork exports also set an all-time record in March due to African swine fever outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Europe.
We anticipate strength in pork markets due to continued export demand and a foodservice recovery domestically.
The USDA is now projecting pork production for the year to be slightly lower than 2020.
Industry operating efficiencies are expected to improve as COVID pressures abate; however, labor availability, tighter hog supplies and reductions in the sow herd [Phonetic] support higher markets.
Our balanced approach to hog import procurement mitigated cost volatility during the quarter.
In high-cost and volatile environment, the strength of our leading brands and balanced approach to procurement continues to be a competitive advantage.
The guidance range assumes elevated and volatile market conditions for the balance of the year, with some moderation heading into the fall.
We expect hog price in the USDA composite cutout to remain well above year-ago levels due to strong domestic and export demand, along with tighter hog supplies.
We anticipate prices to peak during the summer and gradually decline in the fall, consistent with the seasonal increase in harvest.
Deli prices are projected to remain higher than last year in historical averages.
We anticipate markets to stabilize near the current levels, but volatility due to lower cold storage levels and strong demand in the foodservice channel could cause inflationary pressure.
Pork trim prices are expected to moderate from the current levels, but labor shortages across the industry remains a key risk to trim prices as limited boning capacity directly impacts trim supply and pricing.
Due to the higher beef harvest levels in the summer months, beef prices are anticipated to be lower in the back half of 2020.
In response to global supply and demand imbalances in corn and soybean meal, we have taken strategic hedges to fully cover grain costs for the remainder of the year.
The positions also provide a benefit if markets decline.
These hedges, coupled with the previously announced pricing actions, are expected to protect Jennie-O's profitability.
Turkey poult placements and egg sets have declined.
Inventory levels are lower compared to last year.
The tightening of supply has led to higher whole turkey and thigh meat markets.
We have also recently seen an increase in breast meat prices.
A recovery in the foodservice industry remains the key driver for higher prices for this important market.
We anticipate inflationary pressure on freight in the back half of the year.
The tactical action to optimize our distribution network with two new DCs combined with improvements in load efficiencies will help mitigate a portion of the increase.
We have obtained the required regulatory approvals for the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business.
The scheduled close date is in June.
","Hormel Foods posted record sales for the second quarter, driven by a 28% recovery in its foodservice business. Despite higher raw material costs, the company reaffirmed its full-year earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82. Within its segments, Refrigerated Foods saw strong growth, particularly in pizza toppings and value-added products, while International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth. Retail and deli also performed well, with key brands like SPAM and Applegate showing growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. Jennie-O Turkey Store faced challenges due to higher feed costs, but a recovery in foodservice demand and increased whole bird sales contributed to a 2% sales increase. To mitigate input cost pressures, Hormel Foods has taken pricing actions and secured grain cost hedges for the remainder of the year. The company expects elevated and volatile market conditions in the balance of the year, but remains confident in its ability to navigate these challenges and continue growing."
KFY_q2_2022.txt,"I'm pleased to report that Korn Ferry once again achieved all-time financial performance highs.
Revenue was up 47% and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.38 and $1.53, respectively.
And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%.
I think our performance over recent quarters has reached a new level of scale and it speaks to the resili6ency and agility of our colleagues, as well as our operational excellence, amid a time of enormous transition and secular change.
And this aligns with our businesses.
Today, wherever and whenever strategy meets talent, Korn Ferry is at that cross section, enabling agility in a world that will undoubtedly be in transition for the next several years.
Our strategy in the New Year will be to continue to innovate, replicate, and scale, allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world.
Elements of our strategy will include driving a top-down go-to-market strategy, through our Marquee and Regional Accounts, which represent about 36% of our portfolio and that not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
For example, in the quarter, about 30% of our revenue was driven by cross referrals within our firm, demonstrating the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.
Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market.
It's one of the reasons we acquired the Lucas Group during the quarter, a move that adds breadth and depth to Korn Ferry's search portfolio.
Looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we will continue to innovate, marrying Korn Ferry's capabilities with tomorrow's opportunities.
From ESG to DE&I to M&A services and we're also going to further push the monetization of our IP and move more of our digital business to a subscription offering.
We're going to also scale our learning development outsourcing or LDO capabilities, leveraging our Korn Ferry Advance platform, in which we now have completed 50,000 development and coaching sessions.
And lastly, we're going to deploy a balanced capital allocation strategy, including a disciplined approach to M&A.
Looking ahead, I truly feel we have the strategy, the people, the diversity of solutions and expertise to help our clients drive performance in this new world and our results clearly reflect this reality.
We look forward to keeping up the momentum in the New Year ahead.
And with that, I am joined by Bob Rozek and Gregg Kvochak.
Let me start with a few comments before I jump into the second quarter results.
So, I've always felt that the best way to measure success is through performance and if you look at our performance coming out of the COVID recession, it's really been and continued to be exceptional and that's reflected in our Q2 results.
There's no doubt that the world we live in has changed for good.
Today, more than ever, our clients are facing unprecedented organizational and human capital challenges as workforces are transformed and digitized, as corporations are called upon to have greater environmental, social and governance responsibilities, as organization strive to have work environments that are inclusive and free from bias, so even as companies are challenged to grow in a post-COVID environment.
These are real secular changes, creating real and challenging business issues for companies across the globe and it's a fact that no business issue has ever been solved without the involvement of people and that's really where Korn Ferry comes in.
I mean that's our sweet spot, right.
Our core and integrated solutions line up perfectly with the secular changes that companies across the globe are wrestling with today, whether it's finding the right talent in a dislocated labor market to accelerating the top line growth or to even keeping employees engaged, motivated, appropriately rewarded and retained in this new and evolving work and social environment.
As these forces continue to shape the workplace, our clients, in growing numbers, continue to recognize the role that our people and our solutions play in helping them solve their most pressing business issues through their most precious asset, their people.
I would also say that this is not our 15 minutes of fame.
I mean these secular changes that we're all feeling are real and they are here to stay.
In my view, I think, I really believe that we're in the first inning of a long ball game.
Now just as market demand has been strong, our execution has been stronger, driving our fee revenue, earnings and profitability to new all-time highs.
Now I'm going to turn to Q2 results.
So as Gary mentioned, fee revenue in the second quarter grew $204 million or 47% year-over-year and $54 million or 9% sequentially, reaching an all-time high of $639 million.
Fee revenue growth in the quarter for our consolidated Executive Search business was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially while our RPO and Professional Search business was up 76% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.
Growth for our Consulting and Digital businesses was also very strong.
Consulting grew 30% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, while Digital was up 18% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.
Turning to earnings and profitability, they also grew to new highs in the quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDA grew $69 million year-over-year and $13.5 million or 11% sequentially to $135 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, both are new quarterly highs.
Our earnings and profitability continue to benefit from both higher consultant and execution staff productivity and lower G&A spend.
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also advanced to a new high in the quarter, improving to a $1.53, which was up $0.99 compared to adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and actually up $0.16 or 12% sequentially.
When you compare our business today through the first six months to the same period in fiscal year '20 and that's the pre-pandemic period just two years ago, both our scale and our profitability are up dramatically.
Our firm's fee revenue for the fiscal year '22 Q2 year-to-date period is up 25% with double-digit growth in every line of business.
Our adjusted EBITDA over the same comparison period is up 67%, that's nearly 3 times greater than fee revenue growth and our adjusted EBITDA margin is up 530 basis points to nearly 21%.
Our earnings power has never been higher.
As I look at new business, that also accelerated in the quarter, reaching new highs for each of our lines of business.
On a consolidated basis, new business awards, excluding RPO, were up 40% year-over-year and up approximately 8% sequentially.
RPO new business was also extremely strong with a record $136 million of total contract awards.
This consolidated record level of new business across the -- all of our business lines in the second quarter really provides us with a very solid backlog, entering the fiscal third quarter.
Our investable cash position also remained strong.
At October 31, the end of the second quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $997 million.
Now, when you exclude amounts reserved for deferred compensation arrangements and accrued bonuses, our global investable cash balance at the end of the second quarter was approximately $591 million and that's up about $133 million or 29% year-over-year.
It should be noted that this investable cash position includes approximately $90 million that was used to acquire the Lucas Group on November 1.
We continue to take our balanced approach to allocation of capital.
In addition to the Lucas Group and investing in the hiring of additional fee earners and execution staff, year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $14 million of our stock and have paid cash dividends of approximately $14 million as well.
With that -- excuse me.
I'm going to start with KF Digital.
Global fee revenue for KF Digital was $88.6 million in the second quarter, which was up 18% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially.
The subscription and licensing component of KF Digital fee revenue grew to $26 million in the second quarter, which was up 16% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially.
Additionally, global new business for KF Digital in the second quarter grew 29% year-over-year to a new high of $114 million with $44 million or 39% related to subscription and license services.
Earnings and profitability also continued to grow for KF Digital in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $28.6 million and a 32.2% adjusted EBITDA margin.
Now turning to Consulting.
In the second quarter, Consulting generated $164.9 million of fee revenue, which was up approximately $38 million or 30% year-over-year and $16 million or 11% sequentially.
Fee revenue growth continued to be broad-based across all solution areas and strongest regionally in North America, which was up over 43% year-over-year.
Consulting new business also reached a record high in the second quarter, growing approximately 17% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.
Regionally, new business growth was also broad-based in the second quarter with continued strength in North America and improving trends in EMEA and APAC.
Adjusted EBITDA for Consulting in the second quarter improved to $30.1 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.2%.
Growth for RPO and Professional Search continued to improve in the second quarter.
Globally, fee revenues grew $150.4 million, which was up 76% year-over-year and up approximately $11 million or 8% sequentially.
Both RPO and Professional Search continued to take advantage of post-recession dislocation in the labor market for skilled professionals.
RPO fee revenue grew approximately 69% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, while Professional Search fee revenue was up approximately 88% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.
Sequentially, both the number of new search assignments and the average fee per assignment were up double digits for Professional Search.
New business wins for both RPO and Professional Search were also extremely strong in the second quarter, reaching new all-time highs.
Professional Search new business was up 13% sequentially and RPO was awarded a record $136 million of new contracts, consisting of $28 million of renewals and extensions and $108 million of new logo work.
Adjusted EBITDA for RPO and Professional Search continued to scale with revenue improving to $36.3 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%.
Finally, in the second quarter, global fee revenue for Executive Search reached another new all-time high of $235 million, which was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially.
Growth was also broad-based and led by North America, which grew 74% year-over-year and over 14% sequentially.
Fee revenue in our international regions remained steady in the second quarter.
EMEA and APAC were up approximately 34% and 36%, respectively, measured year-over-year, and essentially flat sequentially.
We continue to invest in expanding our team of consultants in the second quarter.
The total number of dedicated Executive Search consultants worldwide at the end of the second quarter was 570, up 58% year-over-year and up 5%, sequentially.
Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the second quarter improved to a record $1.66 million and the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the second quarter was up 37% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to a new all-time high of 1,830.
In the second quarter, global Executive Search adjusted EBITDA grew to approximately $66 million, which was up $38 million year-over-year and up $4.5 million or 7% sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 28.1%.
As I mentioned earlier, new business in the second quarter grew to a new all-time high and it actually accelerated each consecutive month in the quarter and that positions us with a very strong backlog entering our third fiscal quarter.
In fact, as we ended the quarter, October and September were our first and second highest new business months ever.
While our third quarter is usually our most seasonal quarter as both our clients and colleagues take time off during the year and holiday seasons.
However, November was also an excellent month for new business, actually eclipsing September as the second highest month ever, and that was up 37% year-over-year.
Now if monthly trends in each of our lines of business are consistent with our historical patterns and the market conditions remain strong, we would expect December to be seasonally slower than November with demand accelerating and peaking at a quarter high in January.
Additionally, we will continue to make investments in consultants and execution staff to fuel future growth, and we expect employee productivity to remain strong and G&A spend to remain at current levels in the third quarter, keeping both earnings and profitability strong.
Now assuming no new major pandemic-related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets, and foreign exchange rates, and including fee from the Lucas Group, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to range from $640 million to $660 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from $1.42 to $1.58 while our GAAP diluted earnings per share should range from $1.38 to $1.56.
As we look ahead to the New Year, we see a great opportunity to continue to build on our strong financial performance.
Based on the strength or I should say the continuing strength of our new business trends, it is evident to us that our portfolio of solutions will have a continuing relevance as companies address the secular changes I previously discussed.
We will continue to execute at a high level and there is little doubt that we are well positioned to take more than our fair share of the growing market.
Korn Ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies; colleagues, clients, candidates and shareholders for years to come.
With that, we would be glad to answer any questions you may have.
","Korn Ferry reported strong financial performance, with fee revenue climbing 47% to $639 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share reaching $1.53. Adjusted EBITDA margin also reached a high of 21.1%. The robust performance is attributed to a combination of factors, including operational excellence, strategic innovation, and a focus on meeting evolving client needs in a rapidly changing business landscape. Korn Ferry will continue to invest in its people and solutions, including expanding consulting and digital offerings, to drive growth and exceed client expectations. Despite seasonality in the third quarter, new business remains strong, providing a solid backlog and supporting the company's expectations for fee revenue between $640 million and $660 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is projected to range from $1.42 to $1.58, while GAAP diluted earnings per share is forecast between $1.38 and $1.56. Korn Ferry remains confident in its strategy and ability to leverage secular changes to capture market share and create long-term value for its stakeholders."

Before turning the call to Carlos, I would like to mention that we will be participating in the fireside chat at the Goldman Sachs Annual Global Retailing Conference on Friday, September 10 at 03:20 PM Eastern.
We hope to see you there.
We are very proud of our team and our accomplishments.
We just closed a great quarter and we plan to review what drove our performance in detail.
But most importantly, I want to share with you where we are today and how we see the future, both short and long-term.
Let me start with our results.
For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings from operations of $89 million.
This compares to adjusted operating earnings of $48 million for the LLY period exceeding our pre-pandemic performance by 85%.
This was well ahead of our expectations.
We reported revenues of $629 million, 58% over last year and 8% below the LLY period.
The entire decline to LLY was due to a timing shift of European wholesale shipments into Q3 and permanent store closures, which are accretive to operating profit.
This is in spite of being significantly less promotional during the period in all of our direct-to-consumer businesses.
For the quarter, we delivered that 14% adjusted operating margin.
We expanded our operating margin by over 700 basis points from 7% in the LLY period.
The star of this quarter was the North America Retail segment that reported an operating profit of $38 million versus $6 Million in the LLY period and almost 540% increase.
Our Wholesale and Licensing businesses also outperformed, and Europe and Asia delivered roughly flat operating performance to the LLY period.
Paul and I continue to be thrilled with our team's performance all over the world, adjusting and reacting seamlessly to the fluidity of the current environment.
We are happy to see demand recovering and stores reopened across the globe.
We still see the pandemic's impact on customer traffic and on the supply chain globally.
The labor market has also been impacted as companies are challenged to rehire workers leading to labor shortages and higher wages.
At Guess, we remain laser focused on what we can control.
As a global brand, we have adapted quickly to the changing levels of demand and restrictions across our markets.
We are sizing our inventory buys accordingly, adjusting prices to the perceived value of our products, strategically managing promotional activity and increasing labor rates to attract and retain top talent.
We continue to keep cost very tight by eliminating redundancies and increasing efficiencies.
We have been relentless in mitigating supply chain disruptions.
We are strategically partnering with our vendors to accelerate deliveries when feasible, changing countries of origin when appropriate to increase speed to market and investing in faster transportation modes when it makes sense.
Our strategy is working and our results reflect this.
I am proud to share with you that we published our latest sustainability report this summer, focused on our three pillars to operate with integrity, empower our people and protect the environment.
Some highlights include reaching gender pay parity, increasing our eco-smart Guess penetration to 20% and receiving approval in our ambitious science-based targets for greenhouse gas reductions.
We are confident in our actions here.
In fact, we successfully passed a reasonable assurance review by a big firm making Guess the first in fashion to subject our ESG data to such a high level operator.
We have increased our environmental quality score with the Independent shareholder services to a 1 out of 10, the highest rating possible, as a result of this work.
Let me now spend a few minutes talking about what's going on in the different regions and channels of our business.
In North America, traffic has improved sequentially each quarter, but remains well below historical levels and we continue to see higher conversion rates and higher average spend.
We are in the midst of back-to-school and we have solid demand for denim, activewear and knits.
In addition, we have seen sequential sales growth for our dresses category, which was positive to LLY for the first time since that pandemic began.
Both our Guess and Marciano brands are experiencing increases in sales of dressing, apparel and accessories as the customer is returning to social life.
We have also been successful with our handbags and wear-now products and our men's business has been particularly strong.
In Europe, we had a stronger start to the second quarter, which leveled off as the delta variant spread in many countries there.
Activewear continue to outperform in this region, both for women and men and we saw substantial pop in denim in Q2 as well as improved demand for dresses and outerwear.
We are encouraged by the progress that most countries in Europe have made with vaccination levels and we remain optimistic about the recovery of this region in the second half of the year.
In Asia, our customer traffic is the most challenged due to the virus and the trends remain relatively consistent in Q2 versus Q1.
The product categories that have performed better in this environment includes sweaters, denim and outerwear.
While we have made good progress in several areas of the operation, our challenges with topline performance remain.
We are reassessing our team and we are making leadership changes to reorganize the business today.
Our e-commerce business grew 11% in North America and Europe for the quarter versus last year.
Growth here was more moderate than prior quarters as we were a lot less promotional.
I'm pleased that we continue to significantly improve profitability in this channel.
In the back half of the year, we will be strategically investing more in marketing to support further growth in this business.
Our European wholesale business is performing well.
We are currently shipping our fall-winter season, which had orders up high-single digits.
As I mentioned, some of the products are delayed coming in.
So, they will ship in Q3 versus Q2.
The spring-summer season campaign is underway and we estimate that the order book will be higher than LLY with strong growth, particularly in our kids and footwear collections.
We're also very pleased with our Americas Wholesale business, which grew 19% in sales and 54% in operating profit versus LLY.
Denim had a great quarter and delivered strong performance at Macy's.
We're also having success in apparel for both men and women and accessories, particularly handbags.
Our global licensing business also recorded significant revenue growth of 18% versus the LLY period.
We have a big business here, primarily driven by handbags, eyewear, footwear and fragrances.
Regarding our strategic plan, I want to spend a few minutes updating you on our progress with our brand elevation and customer centricity initiatives.
I will start with our brand innovation strategy, which touches almost every aspect of our business.
Paul has been driving this very ambitious initiative with our product and creative teams.
His strong leadership and the work that the teams put into this to transform our model have been extraordinary and many major milestones have already been conquered.
We are focused on higher quality and sustainability across the board.
In addition, the new assortments have been priced based on the products perceived value.
Our visual merchandising on the images and photography in all the new marketing campaigns, catalogs and websites have been optimized to showcase our brand more effectively.
And our product development, marketing, visual merchandising and buying are integrated more closely than ever before.
We [Indecipherable] deep in these key styles to increase full price selling and maximize sales.
The last important step for elevating the brand is to improve the customer experience across the Guess ecosystem, including our stores, our websites, wholesale distribution and through our licensees.
We are mobilizing our field and business units to address this and we plan to upgrade our technology and tools to deliver superior service to our customers.
Some examples of these upgrades in store technology include enhanced WiFi networks, extended payment methods and mobile check outs.
These projects should be complete by the end of next year.
Regarding customer centricity, let me start with our customer base.
As you know, we resonate across three distinct customer groups: heritage, Millennials and Generation Z and we develop our product assortment to support the unique lifestyle needs of these customers.
With Gen Z, specifically, we have a separate strategy including differentiated product development, marketing and customer engagement.
This is our brand partnerships group led by Nicolai Marciano.
Product collaborations and events drive this business.
We had great success here pre-pandemic with key collaborations such as J Balvin.
But as you can imagine, the pandemic impacted our ability to execute this event-driven marketing campaign.
Now, we are able to restart these collaborations.
In fact, this past weekend, we had a successful event with Babylon and influential skate and streetwear label on our campus in LA where we hosted over 6,000 people over three days.
Regarding our digital business, we continue to make progress in optimizing our user online experience via the e-commerce platform that we implemented last year.
For example, in Europe, we are seeing improved conversion rates, especially from mobile, which represents over 80% of our traffic.
Our average web session duration increased over 20%, bounce rate decreased 10% and loading time versus our previous platform is 70% faster.
And during the quarter, we implemented some upgrades to the platform resulting in an increase in our add to basket sessions of over 30%.
We continue to work on implementing omnichannel capabilities in Europe as well as upgrade North America's current capabilities.
We plan to complete this project by mid-year next year.
The last pillar of our customer centricity strategy is related to customer data capture, segmentation and analytics.
We have built out a high-performance platform, but we're still operating on an extremely limited capacity to process and utilize our customer data.
We're now working on a platform, which includes powerful tools to fuel data collection, consumer insight analysis, personalized marketing and client telling.
We can use these tools to maximize sales from our existing customer base, as well as efficiently target new customers.
This implementation is underway and will be completed by next year.
This will be a game changer, allowing us to use our data to unlock a ton of value.
Now, let me talk about our outlook.
When I came back in early 2019, we identified several opportunities for value creation.
At that time, the most significant of these were in margin expansion.
We laid out a plan to increase operating margin by about 450 basis points to 10% in five years.
We used the pandemic as an accelerator to transform our business and not only are we expecting to reach our 10% target this year, but we are now increasing our operating margin target to 12% by fiscal year 2024, when we plan to deliver $2.8 billion in revenue.
I'm excited to share with you that this would yield a return on invested capital of over 30%.
I'm confident in this outlook and this is why.
We see clear opportunities for revenue growth from category expansions in areas like denim, Marciano, handbags, dresses and outerwear to new store development to digital sales growth.
Our margin expansion has come from concrete changes to our business model, including IMU improvements, store portfolio optimization and cost reductions.
And while we are currently operating in what might be on abnormally low promotional period industry wide, this company will never go back to the levels of promotional activity that it had pre-pandemic.
Our balance sheet is in a very good position, which allows us to fund our business needs, as well as return value to shareholders.
We announced today that our Board has authorized a share repurchase program of $200 million.
In closing, when I was invited to come back to Guess, I came back with high expectations, I knew that the company had an amazing global brand with tremendous potential and I felt that I could contribute to realize that potential.
But like Steve Jobs said I couldn't connect the dots looking forward and I had to trust my gut.
When I look back at what happened in the last two and a half years, I couldn't be more proud of what we have accomplished in the face of a pandemic of my partnership with Paul and of the transformation of our business into a company with an elevated global brand and a strong business model.
This is a company that is poised to gain significant market share, a company ready to deliver high return on invested capital fueled by high margins and a capital-light model.
A company with an amazing team ready to take the business to the next level of growth and profitability.
Today, I am thrilled to connect the dots looking backward and I couldn't be happier I trusted my gut to come back to my home.
With that, let me pass it to Katie to review our financials in more detail.
I want to start with something you can't see in the numbers.
Of course, I'm thrilled that we almost doubled operating profit from pre-pandemic levels this quarter, even in the midst of a challenging environment.
But first I want to mention how proud I am to be part of this team at Guess.
It's a team that works hard and works smart to execute our strategy and achieve our goals.
Now, let me take you through the details on the quarter.
Second quarter revenues were $629 million, up 58% to last year in U.S. dollars and 51% in constant currency.
We were down 8% compared to LOI.
This was slightly short of our expectations, as a result of timing in our European wholesale business worth about 4% to LLY, where delays in product receipts moved some shipments a few weeks into the third quarter.
Overall, the 8% revenue decline to LLY was driven by the impact of permanent store closures worth roughly 5% of revenue and the shift in wholesale shipments in Europe.
I want to note that our promotions were well below pre-pandemic levels across all of our direct-to-consumer businesses, which is impacting our sales level versus LLY, significantly driving our profit.
Let me get into a bit more detail on sales performance by segment.
In Americas Retail, revenues were down 6% versus LLY, better than our expectations.
This decline was entirely driven by permanent store closures, which were worth about 8% of the sales to LLY.
Store comps in the U.S. and Canada were up 5% in constant currency.
Same-store sales were solid positive in the U.S., but the recovery in Canada is moving a bit more slowly.
Although traffic is still materially negative, from Q1 to Q2, we saw improved trends there.
Our conversion remains high and AUR increased substantially in Q2 with strategic price increases and more full price selling.
The gap between the performance of our tourist-centric stores and non-tourist-centric stores is still wide, but narrowed significantly in Q2 versus Q1.
This suggests that at least domestic travel is picking up, the total travel still remain significantly below historical levels.
In fact, our non-tourist stores in the U.S. and Canada had positive double-digit same-store sales growth this quarter.
The profitability that we have brought in the segment is super exciting and worth noting.
Operating margin in Q2 was 20% versus only 3% two years ago and operating profit is 6 times what it was in LLY even on lower sales.
This is an incredible base of which to grow in North America.
In Europe, revenues were down 5% versus LLY.
Our retail business continues to be pressured by pandemic-related traffic declines.
Store comps for Europe were down 20% in constant currency, impacted by negative traffic; however, this was partially offset by solid conversion rates and significant AUR increases.
Absent the shift in shipment timing, that we mentioned earlier, our European wholesale business continues to show healthy trends with an order book above pre-pandemic levels.
In Asia, revenue was down 43% to LLY, almost half of this decline was driven by permanent store closures.
Our store comps were down 30% in constant currency, with negative sales comps in South Korea and China, more moderate than other areas in the region like Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, Macau, where they're struggling more with the pandemic.
Our Americas Wholesale sales were up 19% to LLY.
We are happy with our momentum in this business.
Operating margin expanded almost 600 basis points to LLY here, resulting in a lift of over 50% for operating profit in this segment.
Licensing revenues also outperformed and were up 18% to LLY in Q2 to provide strong performance in our perfume and footwear.
And as you know, this is an extremely high margin business, which delivered a 92% operating margin this quarter.
Total company gross margin for the quarter was 46.8%, almost 800 basis points higher than two years ago.
Our product margin increased 370 basis points this quarter versus LLY, primarily as a result of lower promotions and higher IMU.
Occupancy rate decreased 420 basis points.
This quarter we booked over $7 million in rent credits for fully negotiated rent release deals, mostly in Europe.
The remainder of the decrease is attributable to lower rent and permanently closed stores.
Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was $206 million, compared to $218 million two years ago, a decrease of $12 million or 6%.
We continue to benefit from changes to our expense structure and a decrease in expenses related to permanent store closures versus LLY.
In addition, there was a one-time benefit of about $4 million from government subsidies, namely in Europe, which was partially offset by higher variable expenses related to the growth of our e-commerce business.
Adjusted operating profit for the second quarter was $89 million versus $48 million in Q2 two years ago.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen.
I will take you through some details comparing now to last year, not LLY.
We ended the second quarter with $459 million in cash a $131 million higher than last year's balance at the end of Q2.
Inventories were $430 million, up 3% in U.S. dollars and 1% in constant currency versus last year.
Inventory management has been a key capability for us and we continue to act swiftly and strategically here.
We feel good about our inventory position and believe we have the right assortment to satisfy customer demand.
Year-to-date capital expenditures were $22 million, up from $10 million in the prior year, but significantly below pre-pandemic levels.
We generated $18 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year.
Our ability to generate cash gives us the runway to invest in our business, as well as return value to shareholders.
We announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $200 million share repurchase program.
This new program includes the $48 million remaining under the Company's previously authorized repurchase program and we will use it opportunistically.
So, now let's talk about our go-forward expectations.
The current environment is still uncertain.
So, we will not provide formal guidance, but I will walk you through how we're thinking about both for short and longer term future.
Again, I'm going to anchor our commentary to LLY.
We are maintaining our revenue expectations for the full year at down mid-single digits.
We expect the third quarter to be slightly negative to flat with help from shifted wholesale shipments from Q2.
In terms of profit, adjusted operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be about 250 basis points better than LLY.
Gross margin is expected to expand by around 600 basis points to LLY, driven primarily by lower occupancy costs, lower promotions and improved IMU.
We anticipate that the adjusted SG&A rate will be at 350 basis points as cost savings are offset by business mix and reinvestments in business expansion initiatives including marketing.
And with the rest of the industry, we are seeing some cost pressures, particularly in freight and labor, which are built into these numbers.
For the full fiscal year 2022, we are raising our expectations for operating margin and profit.
We now expect operating margins to reach approximately 10% for the year versus adjusted operating margin of 5.6% in LLY.
This represents margin expansion of roughly 450 basis points to our pre-pandemic business despite a lower revenue base and we are confident in our ability to sustain these profitability levels, as well as deliver top line growth.
As a result, we are raising our operating margin target and our long-term plan to reach 12% by fiscal year 2024 with revenues in that year expected to hit $2.8 billion dollars, consistent with our previous call.
This implies an operating income of $335 million in fiscal year 2024, $185 million more than adjusted operating profit in fiscal year 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be around $3.50 per share, versus a $1.45 in fiscal year 2020.
This would be a record level of adjusted earnings per share for the Company.
Our team is motivated and I'm proud to say that we are running this company for the future, not just for now.
","Guess Inc. reported strong second-quarter results, exceeding pre-pandemic performance with an 85% increase in adjusted operating earnings to $89 million. The North America Retail segment drove this success, reporting a 540% increase in operating profit. The company also announced a new $200 million share repurchase program and raised its long-term operating margin goal to 12% by fiscal 2024, along with an adjusted earnings per share target of $3.50. Despite ongoing challenges from the pandemic, Guess remains optimistic about the future, citing strong demand and store reopenings. The company is focused on key initiatives, including brand elevation through improved product quality and customer experience across all channels. They are also investing in omnichannel capabilities and data analytics to enhance customer engagement and maximize sales potential."
FE_q3_2020.txt,"We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Participants in today's call include our Executive Director, Chris Pappas; Acting Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor.
We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.
For those of you who do not know Chris, he has been an Independent Member of the FirstEnergy Board since 2011 and he retired in 2019 as President and Chief Executive Officer of Trinseo SA.
I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's call.
I'm going to start out by discussing the leadership transition the company announced last week, my role with the company and the Board's governance efforts.
First, I will note that the DOJ investigation prompted a number of shareholder and customer lawsuits, and we are also responding to a subpoena we received from the SEC on September 2nd, related to the investigation in the FirstEnergy by the SEC division of enforcement.
We are cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC.
During the course of our internal review related to the ongoing government investigation regarding House Bill 6, the Independent Review Committee of the Board determined that three executives violated certain FirstEnergy Policies and its Code of Conduct.
When we determine that employee conduct is inconsistent with our policy and values, no matter how senior the individual, we have a duty to take action, and that is what we have done here.
As a result, FirstEnergy announced on Thursday that CEO Chuck Jones, along with Dennis Chack, Senior Vice President of Product Development, Marketing and Branding; and Mike Dowling, Senior Vice President of External Affairs, were all terminated effective immediately.
Concurrently, Steve Strah, who many of you know from his roles as FirstEnergy's President and previously CFO, was appointed acting CEO.
Steve has the experience, credibility and the support of the Board in this role.
Steve is a highly respected executive with deep knowledge of FirstEnergy's business and significant operational experience.
He became President in May 2020 as part of the company's ordinary course succession planning process.
In his various leadership roles at the company, including his recent tenure as CFO and President, Steve has supported the execution of FirstEnergy's long-term customer-focused growth strategy and demonstrated his commitment to delivering value to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities and shareholders.
I look forward to working closely with him in my new role as Executive Director.
In this role, I remain an Independent Member of the Board and will also work closely with Don Misheff, our non-Executive Chairman, to assist management team's execution of strategic initiatives, to engage with the company's external stakeholders, including the investment community as appropriate, and to support the development of enhanced controls and governance policies and procedures.
The Board is already conducting a full review of its governance and oversight processes to look for areas of improvement going forward.
This is a serious matter for our Board and for FirstEnergy Management.
In order to address this in a timely and effective way, the Board has formed a new subcommittee of our Audit Committee, to quickly assess and implement potential changes as appropriate in the company's compliance program.
This effort will be led by independent Board member, Leslie Turner.
Leslie retired as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of The Hershey Company.
She joined our Board in 2018 and is a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees.
This new subcommittee will work with management, internal audit and also engage outside expertise for help and best practices.
As I previously mentioned, we have and will continue to cooperate with the DOJ and SEC investigations.
We have also reached out to company's key stakeholders, including the ratings agencies, banks, regulators, legislators and union leadership.
We believe the actions the Board has taken, represent an additional step toward addressing these matters and enable's FirstEnergy's management to continue to focus on running the business day to day.
FirstEnergy embarked on a strategy several years ago to become a fully regulated company and grow through the substantial opportunities available in both the distribution and transmission businesses.
That strategy will continue.
It is working and the foundational drivers are intact.
The FirstEnergy organization at large has been delivering excellent results over the last few years and that continues with the strong performance year-to-date and the company's expectations for the full year.
As we look ahead, the Board has full confidence in Steve and the rest of the team's ability to ensure a seamless transition and to continue to execute the company's strategy.
While I would have preferred to have assumed my new role under different circumstances, I agree with Chris that the actions taken by our Board of Directors last week, were absolutely necessary and are an additional step toward addressing this matter.
The management team is committed to working with the Board to assess and implement potential changes, as appropriate, with the company's compliance program.
We take this as a serious and important matter and we will begin to address this immediately.
In my 36 years with the company, we have faced challenges and changes, and we have always emerged stronger and even more dedicated to our mission.
Our management team remains focused on keeping each other safe, providing reliable service to our customers and executing our growth initiatives.
I am confident that we will continue to carry out this plan, finish the year strong and enter 2021 with momentum.
I look forward to working with our team to achieve this.
With that, let me transition to a brief update on our operations and recent regulatory activity, then Jon will review our results and other financial matters.
While the pandemic continues to impact our work protocols, our customers' lives, and the economy, I am extremely proud of the hard work and resiliencies our employees have demonstrated throughout this crisis.
We remain on pace to complete more than $3 billion in customer-focused investments across our system this year and our business model and rate structure continue to provide stability.
Those results primarily reflect the successful implementation of our regulated growth strategies and favorable weather, together with a continuation of the pandemic-driven load trends we noted on our second quarter call.
As Jon will discuss in more detail, the earnings impact of higher weather-adjusted sales from residential customers more than offset the lower usage in our commercial and industrial sectors.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date and the expectations for the next couple of months, we are affirming our guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and currently expect to be near the top end of that range.
If decoupling is part of a House Bill 6 repeal, we would be closer to the $2.50 per share midpoint.
We have updated our funds from operations and free cash flow forecast for 2020, to reflect the impacts of higher storm costs of approximately $145 million and higher costs associated with the pandemic, including uncollectibles of approximately $120 million, most of which are deferred for future recovery.
Although the events of this past week and the government investigations create additional uncertainty, we are affirming our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021 and 5% to 7% extending through 2023, along with our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023.
With that said, we are mindful that the current situation may present additional challenges to meet this objective.
Jon will address some tactics we are taking to address uncertainty created by the investigation.
Now, let's turn to regulatory matters.
In New Jersey, JCP&L filed an AMI implementation plan with the Board of Public Utilities in late August.
If approved, we would begin installing 1.15 million smart meters and related infrastructure across our New Jersey service territory, over a three-year period beginning in 2023.
Also, at JCP&L, last week, we were very pleased that the BPU approved our settlement in the distribution base rate case, as well as the sale of JCP&L's interest in the Yards Creek pumped storage hydro generation facility.
The settlement provides recovery for increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our JCP&L customers, along with the recovery of storm costs incurred over the past few years.
It includes a $94 million annual increase in distribution revenues, based on an ROE of 9.6%.
The settlement also includes an agreement to delay the implementation of the rate increase until November 1st, 2021, to assist our customers during the pandemic.
Prior to then, the rate increase will be offset through amortization of regulatory liabilities totaling approximately $86 million, beginning January 1st.
The parties also agreed that the net gains from the sale of JCP&L's interest in Yards Creek, estimated at $110 million, will be used to reduce the regulatory asset for previously deferred storm costs.
We expect to close the Yards Creek transaction within the next few months.
This includes transmission assets in the West Penn Power territory in Pennsylvania, the Mon Power territory in West Virginia and the Potomac Edison territory in West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia.
We are requesting an effective date of January 1, 2021.
In addition, we created a new stand-alone transmission company, Keystone Appalachian Transmission Company or KATCo, to accommodate the new construction in this footprint.
In closing, while I find it disappointing that we have arrived at this point, I have great confidence not only in the management team but in the full support of the Board of Directors; and together, we're committed to lead this company out of it.
I'd like to reiterate that our regulated growth strategy is strong.
It is working and it is moving forward, and I am committed to working with management and the Board to address changes to our compliance program.
As always, all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the Strategic and Financial Highlights document on our website.
While we traditionally file the 10-Q in connection with our call, we don't expect to file it this week, as we continue our review and closing procedures to ensure we provide appropriate disclosure.
Also, as we noted in Friday's 8-K, the violations of certain company Policy and Code of Conduct by the terminated executives, has caused us to reevaluate our controls framework and that could lead to identifying one or more material weaknesses.
However, based on our review of these issues, we do not expect any impact to prior period financial results.
As Steve noted, operating earnings were a $0.01 above the top end of our earnings guidance range, largely reflecting the ongoing success of our regulated growth strategy, as well as benefits from weather.
In the distribution business, revenues increased compared to the third quarter of 2019, as a result of higher weather-adjusted residential usage and incremental rider revenue driven by our capital investment programs in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the third quarter of 2019, on both in actual and weather-adjusted basis.
Cooling degree days were approximately 21% above normal and relatively flat to the third quarter of 2019.
Total residential sales increased 5.3% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to the same period last year, as many people continued to work-from-home and spend more time at home due to the pandemic.
In the commercial customer class, sales decreased 5.5% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2019.
And in our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 6.3% compared to the same period last year.
Consistent with the trends we've seen for the past 12 months, the only sector showing growth in our footprint was shale gas.
As we discussed last quarter, the increased residential volumes more than offset the decrease in commercial industrial load from a revenue perspective.
In our transmission business, earnings were flat compared to the third quarter of 2019, as the earnings growth associated with our energizing the future transmission initiative were offset by higher net financing costs and the absence of a tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2019.
And in our corporate segment, our results primarily reflect higher tax benefits compared to the third quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter, we will make our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment.
Based on the asset returns through September 30th and a discount rate ranging from 2.7% to 3%, we estimate that adjustment to be between an after-tax loss of $330 million to a gain of $40 million.
As a reminder, this is a non-cash item.
Year-to-date, our return on assets is 9.2% versus our assumption of 7.5% and our funded status remains at 77%.
As Chris mentioned, we proactively reached out to the three rating agencies last week to discuss within the leadership transition and our path forward.
While we believe the fundamentals of our business remain strong, we understand there are certain management and governance factors that the agencies consider in the risk assessment, which ultimately impact the credit ratings.
The rating agencies have taken numerous actions and we have provided all the details in the Investor Factbook.
FE Corp remains at investment grade with both Fitch and Moody's.
At S&P, while we are not investment grade at FE Corp or FirstEnergy Transmission, all other subsidiaries remain investment grade at their issue-level ratings.
We will continue to maintain our open dialog with each of the agencies and remain in close contact with them as we chart our path forward.
Finally, I'll take a few minutes to review other financial considerations and tactical changes we are making to address the uncertainty created by the investigations.
First, from a liquidity perspective, I'll remind you that we continue to have access to $3.5 billion of credit facilities committed through December 2022.
In addition, we expect our holding company debt to remain around 35% of total adjusted debt and we have no plans to increase debt at the FirstEnergy HoldCo.
To further refine expectations for 2021, I want to make a few comments about the dividend and reaffirm our dividend policy.
Two years ago, at EEI, we announced a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of our operating earnings.
In alignment with that policy, our Board raised a quarterly payout by $0.02 per share for dividends paid in 2019 and then by $0.01 per share for those paid in 2020.
Given our current yield of approximately 5%, we expect to hold our quarterly dividend at $0.39 per share or $1.56 per share on an annualized basis for next year.
This would represent a 59% payout ratio to our CAGR midpoint for 2021.
The Board will continue to review the dividend on a quarterly basis.
From a tactical perspective, our 2021 base O&M is flat to 2020 levels, and we assume begin developing plans for reductions to operating expenses, if necessary.
With respect to our overall capital programs, for 2021, our capex programs will be at the $3 billion level and we will consider reductions if necessary.
Equity continues to be a part of our overall financing plan.
As Steve said, we are reaffirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually, in 2022 and 2023, and we will take the necessary actions financially to weather this uncertainty and put the company in the best position possible.
We believe these steps are prudent to provide flexibility as we face uncertainty in the near term.
I know you have many questions.
We are not going to provide more information at this time.
The Board and management view this as a serious and important matter, and our newly appointed subcommittee of the Audit Committee, led by Leslie Turner, as well as management and Internal Audit, will address this immediately.
FirstEnergy strategy is working and delivering results as shown in our third quarter 2020 results and our outlook going forward, but matters related to the investigation will add uncertainties to the future financial results of the company.
The tactical financial changes that Jon described earlier, are prudent to provide flexibility as we face uncertainty in the near term.
And now, we'll open to questions-and-answers.
","FirstEnergy reported a strong third quarter with favorable weather driving earnings above guidance, and reaffirmed its earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2020. The company's distribution revenues increased due to higher residential usage and capital investment rider revenue, offsetting declines in commercial and industrial load. However, recent leadership changes following a DOJ investigation and board review may introduce uncertainty to future financial results. In response, FirstEnergy is taking tactical financial measures such as holding its dividend at current levels, targeting flat operating expenses in 2021, and reassessing capital programs. Despite the investigation, the company remains committed to its regulated growth strategy and its long-term CAGR of 5% to 7% through 2023."
NNN_q1_2021.txt,"Given our strong start to the year, we're pleased to announce an increase in our guidance for 2021 core FFO by approximately 6% from a range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
Kevin will have more details on this increase in his remarks.
Turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial results.
Our portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform exceedingly well.
Occupancy was 98.3% at the end of the quarter, which remains above our long-term average of 98% and while our occupancy rate ticked down 20 basis points from December 31, we're seeing impressive activity in our leasing department including interest by a number of strong national tenants in some of our vacancies.
We also announced collection of 97% of rents due for the first quarter as well as collection of 98% of rents due for the month of April.
Our impressive collection results continue to compare very favorably to other retail real estate companies, including those with a significantly higher percentage of investment-grade tenants.
The majority of the remaining uncollected rent in the first quarter was simply deferred rent that we expect to collect when the tenant's repayment obligation kicks in later this year.
Notably, we only forgave 0.1% of our first quarter rents.
Recently, our two largest bankruptcies were resolved in favorable fashion.
Chuck E. Cheese's affirmed all 53 of our leases, in exchange for a 25% temporary base rent reduction that will expire at the end of this year and Ruby Tuesday's affirmed 26 of our 34 leases, accounting for over 80% of our annual rent from Ruby Tuesday, again in exchange for a comparable temporary base rent reduction.
These impressive post-pandemic occupancy, leasing and rent collection outcomes have once again validated our consistent long-term strategy of acquiring well-located parcels, lease to strong regional and national operators at reasonable rents, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet.
Although we continue to be prudent in our underwriting, we acquired 29 new properties in the quarter for just under $106 million, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with an average lease duration of 17.5 years.
Almost all of our acquisitions were from relationship tenants with which we do repeat programmatic business.
In an unsettled post-pandemic environment, where cap rates remain at all-time lows, we will continue to be very thoughtful in our underwriting and primarily pursue sale-leaseback transactions with our relationship tenants.
We also reported that during the first quarter, we sold 11 properties, raising $17.6 million of proceeds to be reinvested into new acquisitions and our balance sheet remains rock solid.
During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured 30-year interest-only bonds at a rate of 3.5%.
Kudos to Kevin and his team for once again raising well-priced capital when it's available.
A portion of those bond proceeds were used to redeem our 2023 debt maturities.
So we ended the first quarter with $311 million of cash in the bank, a 0 balance on our $900 million line of credit, no material debt maturities until 2024 and an average debt duration of over 13 years.
Thus, we're well-positioned to fund all of our 2021 acquisition guidance with the available capital on hand.
That's up $0.06 from the preceding fourth quarter $0.63 and down $0.01 from the prior year's $0.70 per share.
Results for the first quarter included two nonrecurring type items totaling $5 million.
First, we collected $2.2 million of receivables from cash basis tenants that relate to prior quarters.
And second, we received $2.8 million of lease termination fee income, which is more than typical.
For context, full year 2020 was $2 million of lease termination fee income.
So these two items, totaling approximately $5 million, added just under $0.03 per share to our results.
Today, we also reported that AFFO per share was $0.76 per share for the first quarter, which is $0.07 per share higher than the preceding fourth quarter $0.69.
We did footnote this amount included $9.4 million of deferred rent repayment and our accrued rental income adjustment in the first quarter AFFO number.
Rent collections continue to drift higher.
As Jay mentioned, we reported today rent collections of approximately 97% for the first quarter, 98% for April rent collection.
Most notable collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent approximately $50 million or 7% of our annual base rent, improved to approximately 80% for the first quarter.
Previously, we projected these cash basis tenants would pay at their historical payment rate of about 50% of rent.
So improving to 80% added about $4 million of revenues in the first quarter versus our prior guidance.
As Jay mentioned today, we increased our 2021 core FFO per share guidance from the range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
This incorporates the better-than-expected rent collections and the results from Q1.
The driver for the increase in full year guidance is the $5 million of first quarter nonrecurring items I previously mentioned and the assumed higher rent collection rates more in line with current collection rates.
So while we previously assumed 50% rent collections from the $50 million of cash basis tenant annual base rent, we are now assuming 80% rent collection.
So that incremental 30% amounts to $15 million for the full year and for the remainder of our tenants, we previously assumed 2% potential rent loss, and we now assume 1% rent of potential rent loss, which equates to approximately $6 million of improvement for the year.
So compared to prior guidance, current guidance incorporates approximately a total of $21 million in improved rent collection, plus $5 million of onetime items in Q1 or a total of $26 million, and that all equates to about $0.15 per share.
As Jay noted, we ended the fourth quarter with $311 million of cash on hand.
Nothing outstanding on our $900 million bank line.
We did execute a $450 million 30-year debt offering, with a 3.5% coupon on March 1, and used a large portion of those proceeds to pay off our $350 million of 3.3% notes due in 2023.
While time will tell, given where we are in the 40-year declining interest rate cycle, it felt like it was a good time to continue to push out debt maturities at these rates.
Our weighted average debt maturity is now 13.3 years, with a 3.7% weighted average fixed income interest rate.
Our next debt maturity is $350 million, with a 3.9% coupon in mid-2024.
So on very good liquidity and leverage position, I have no need to raise any additional capital to meet our 2021 acquisition guidance.
Net debt to gross book assets was 34.7% at quarter end.
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.0 times at March 31.
Interest coverage was 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage 4.1 times for the first quarter of 2021.
Only five of our 3,161 properties are encumbered by mortgages totaling about $11 million.
So 2021 is off to a good start as the economy and retailers seem to be catching wind in their sales from the several trillion-dollar stimulus injected by the government, which feels like it will continue into 2022.
Our focus remains on the long term as we continue to endeavor to give NNN the best opportunity to succeed in the coming years.
And Melinda, with that, we will open it up to any questions.
","National retail properties company saw a strong first quarter, reporting a 98.3% occupancy rate, high rent collection rates (97% for Q1 and 98% for April), and an increase in full-year 2021 core FFO guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share. The company's portfolio consists of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties with an average lease duration of 17.5 years. Despite two nonrecurring items totaling $5 million, AFFO per share was $0.76 for the quarter. With a strong balance sheet and no debt maturities until 2024, the company plans to primarily pursue sale-leaseback transactions with relationship tenants in the current low cap rate environment."
TRV_q3_2021.txt,"All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.
Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents; Greg Toczydlowskias of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.
They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.
Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures.
We're pleased to report strong top and bottom-line results for the quarter and the first nine months of the year, including very strong underlying underwriting profitability and healthy top line growth.
Core income year-to-date of $2.2 billion is about $800 million higher year-over-year, generating core return on equity of 11.6%.
Core income for the quarter was $655 million or $2.60 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 10.1% despite a high level of catastrophe losses.
Our cat losses were well below our market share and well above the prior-year quarter and the tenure average for the quarter.
Underlying underwriting income of $632 million pre-tax was 6% higher than in the prior-year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.
We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses.
The underlying combined ratio improved by almost 4 points in Business Insurance and more than 5 points in Bond & Specialty Insurance.
As you'll hear in a few minutes from Michael, underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by auto frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels and elevated severity in both auto and property due to higher costs for labor, materials.
Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of having a diversified group of businesses.
Turning to investments, our high quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $645 million after-tax, reflecting reliable performance in our fixed income portfolio and very strong returns in our non-fixed income portfolio.
These results together with our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% over the past year after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.
During the quarter, we returned $821 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $601 million of share repurchases.
Turning to the top line, net-written premiums grew 7% to a record $8.3 billion.
Each of our three segments again contributed meaningfully to the top line growth.
In Business Insurance, net-written premiums grew by 5% with renewal premium change of 9.9%, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year, a near all-time high.
Renewal premium change was driven by continued strong renewal rate change and higher exposure growth.
Importantly, at the same time, retention was also higher.
Our ability to continue to drive price change at historical highs while increasing retention reflects excellent marketplace execution and the stability of the pricing environment.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net-written premiums increased by 19%, driven by record renewal premium change of 13.6% in our Management Liability business and continued strong retention.
We're also pleased to report strong production in our Surety business.
In our Commercial businesses, written pricing continues to outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in.
Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity and the low interest rate environment, we expect the pricing environment to remain strong.
In Personal Insurance, net-written premiums increased by 7%.
Policies in force in both auto and homeowners were at record levels, driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business.
Before I wrap up on results, I'd like to spend a minute discussing how our leading data and analytics and risk expertise contributed to our relatively favorable loss experience with Hurricane Ida.
As I shared in our first quarter earnings call, our share of the industry's property cat losses over the past five years have been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share, and while there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, it was no accident that we again outperformed in Hurricane Ida.
Our medium underwriting expertise supported by cutting edge data analytics are key to an effective assessment of risk and reward.
For us third-party models are starting point for our more advanced proprietary cat modeling.
At the portfolio level, the insights from our models warned us away from the coast where Ida made landfall, given the impediments to achieving an appropriate risk-adjusted return.
In the other states among Ida's path, we effectively managed risk selection, pricing and other terms and conditions, sophisticated data and analytics at the fingertips of our frontline underwriters.
These include robust flood risk scoring, location intelligence down to the parcel level, Hill dashboards and output from our risk control engineers.
Within Personal Insurance, we continue to see the benefits from our highly segmented Quantum Home 2.0 product, which has now rolled out in more than 40 states.
In the Northeast, extreme rainfall from Ida resulted in significant claim activity for the industry, including from water and drainage back up, which is a coverage we provide in our QH 2.0 product.
The model underneath the product leverages data and analytics to underwrite a price tag coverage on a very granular basis.
In addition to underwriting, data and analytics are increasingly informing our claims handling strategies.
For example, our AI-assisted claim damage detection model was a key part of our Ida claim response.
This model uses AI and high-resolution aerial imagery to detect the extent of damage to individual properties as soon as a day after an event.
Within two days of impact, we were collecting and analyzing aerial imagery of customer properties along Ida's path as it moved across 20 states.
This enabled us to remotely identify which of our customers properties had sustained exterior damage and effectively organize our claim response.
In some cases, we can use this technology to adjust and pay total losses before the customer has even been able to return to their home.
We also utilized other virtual capabilities in our Ida response, such as image share and live video capture, on a majority of claims with interior damage.
These leading edge capabilities, enhanced the claim experience for our customers by cutting significant time out of the claim process, expediting an accurate loss assessment and in many cases, eliminating the need for physical inspection.
Again, with Ida, we successfully closed 90% of all homeowners plans within 30 days.
All of this also results in a more efficient outcome for our shareholders.
As strategic as the data and analytics are, maybe even more important is the culture that brings it all together.
Our collaborative approach to developing a holistic, 360-degree view of risk, incorporating underwriting, claims, actuarial risk-control, legal and regulatory inputs is an important differentiating factor in effectively managing risk and reward.
That culture is decades in the making and very hard to replicate.
As I shared last quarter, Jeff is a 22-year veteran at Travelers most recently as a member of Tom Kunkel leadership team and head of our Management Liability business.
Jeff succeeded Tom, following his retirement last month.
We're fortunate to have Jeff in the role and you will hear from him in a few minutes.
To sum it up, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date.
Our significant and hard to replicate competitive advantages position us very well and continued to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.
Core income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior-year quarter.
For the quarter, core return on equity was 10.1% and on a year-to-date basis, core ROE was 11.6%.
The decline in core income was driven by prior-year reserve development and catastrophe losses.
Recall that last year's PYD benefited by approximately $400 million of subrogation recoveries from PG&E.
Those unfavorable year-over-year comparisons were partially offset by increased investment income and a higher level of underlying underwriting income.
Underlying underwriting income increased 6% to $632 million pre-tax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all three segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.
Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance.
Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty results both reflected the benefit of our pricing efforts, as earned price continues to exceed loss trend.
We expected a higher underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic.
As Alan mentioned, the underlying combined ratio in PI was further impacted by higher severity in both the auto and homeowners products.
Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment results in a few minutes.
On a consolidated basis, the underlying loss ratio for the quarter improved slightly to 62% compared with last year's 62.2%.
The expense ratio of 29.4% was in line with the prior-year quarter and in line with our expectations.
We've improved the expense ratio by more than 2 points from where we were five years ago.
Having added roughly $7 billion to our annual net-written premiums over that period, while maintaining a focus on productivity and efficiency, all while adding significantly to the level of strategic investment we're making to ensure our future success.
Before turning to catastrophe losses, I wanted to point out that within our underlying combined ratio, non-cat weather was higher than we would have assumed for the quarter, although lower than the unusually high levels we experienced in last year's third quarter.
Our third quarter cat losses were $501 million pre-tax compared to $397 million a year ago.
Remember that in last year's third quarter, we had a full recovery under the property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty.
In this year's third quarter, we recognized a partial recovery of $95 million from the treaty, $83 million benefiting the cat line with $43 million in Business Insurance and $39 million in Personal Insurance and $12 million benefiting our underlying results with $3 million in Business Insurance and $9 million in Personal Insurance.
That leaves us with $255 million of potential recovery in the fourth quarter, depending on the level of qualifying losses we actually experienced.
In terms of the level of cat losses relative to our assumptions, third quarter cats were elevated compared to what we would have assumed for a typical third quarter.
Although our losses from Hurricane Ida are well below our relative market share, the sheer size of Ida on top of the other cat losses in the quarter resulted in overall cat losses that were higher than our assumption.
Turning to prior-year reserve development.
In Personal Insurance, $30 million of pre-tax net favorable PYD resulted from better-than-expected experience from recent years in the property line.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $22 million of pre-tax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in the surety product line for recent accident years.
In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD was $108 million pre-tax.
Our annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $225 million as the level of claim activity did not decline as much as we had assumed in our previous estimate.
Excluding asbestos charge, Business Insurance had net favorable prior-year reserve development of $117 million, driven primarily by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years.
Net investment income improved to $645 million after-tax this quarter.
Our non-fixed income portfolio delivered another strong results contributing $224 million after-tax.
Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior-year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect NII from the fixed income portfolio, including earnings from short-term securities of between $425 million and $435 million after-tax.
For 2022, we expect that figure to be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter.
Turning to capital management.
Operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.5 billion was an all-time record.
All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion.
The market value of the bonds in our fixed income portfolio declined as U.S. treasury yields increased and credit spreads widened during the quarter, and accordingly our after-tax net unrealized investment gain decreased from $3.2 billion as of June 30 to $2.7 billion at September 30.
Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $104.77 at quarter-end, up 5% since year-end and up 10% since September 30 last year.
We returned $821 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter with $220 million of dividends and $601 million in share repurchases.
Overall a very good quarter performance with healthy top line growth, strong and improved underlying margins in our commercial businesses, excellent cash flows and a terrifically strong balance sheet.
Business Insurance had another great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace.
Segment income was $558 million for the quarter, up more than 50% from the prior-year quarter.
The improved year-over-year result was driven by higher underlying underwriting income, prior-year reserve development and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
We're once again particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, which improved by 3.8 points from the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to three things.
First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing that continued to exceed loss cost trends; the other nearly 2 points resulted from a combination of a favorable impact associated with the pandemic and a lower level of property losses.
Turning to the top line, net-written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal rate and exposure levels as well as high retention.
As for domestic production, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.9%, while retention increased to an exceptional 85%.
The 9.9% renewal premium change was up more than 2 points from the third quarter of last year with strong renewal rate change of 6.3% and continued improvement in our customers' exposure growth.
In addition to our granular price execution, we've also focused on careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits and exclusions which can also contribute to an increase in the price per unit of risk.
New business was down from the prior-year quarter as we continue to be thoughtful about balancing risk and reward for new business in the marketplace.
As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was a strong 9.7%, while retention improved from recent periods to 82%.
Underneath RPC renewal rate change was 4.1%, up well over a point from the third quarter of 2020.
We're also encouraged with the improving exposure which was up about 3 points as the economy continues to reopen.
New business was up a bit from the prior-year, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 39 states.
In middle-market, renewal premium change of 9.5% and retention of 88% were both historically high.
Renewal rate change of 6.2% remained strong.
As always, we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting.
To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter.
We're pleased with our execution in further improving the underlying margins in the BOP and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.
I'm very pleased to be here.
We've built an industry-leading surety and management liability franchise and we look forward to continuing to perform, innovate and transform to profitably grow these businesses into the future.
Turning to the results, Bond & Specialty delivered excellent returns and growth in the quarter.
Segment income was $174 million, up about 50% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by the impact of higher net earned premium, a significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and favorable prior-year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 83.4% improved by 5.5 points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower pandemic-related loss activity, earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and a lower expense ratio.
Turning to the top line, net-written premiums grew an exceptional 19% in the quarter with strong contributions from all our businesses.
In domestic management liability, renewal premium change was a record 13.6%, driven by record renewal rate change.
Retention remained strong at 86% consistent with recent quarters, but down a few points year-over-year as we continue to non-renew cyber policies for accounts that don't meet our updated minimum requirements for cyber hygiene.
Notably, research indicates that implementing affordable cyber risk mitigation controls such as multi-factor authentication should prevent the vast majority of rents [indecipherable] tax.
Domestic surety also posted strong growth relative to the pandemic-impacted prior-year quarter.
In addition, our international business has again posted excellent growth including strong management liability retention and rate.
So both top and bottom-line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, demonstrating our thoughtful approach and strong execution across our businesses.
In Personal Insurance, bottom-line results were impacted by weather, our return to pre-pandemic claim frequency in auto and higher loss severity impacting both auto and home results.
Segment income declined by $394 million than the prior-year quarter.
$262 million of that decline is attributable to lower favorable prior-year reserve development as the prior-year quarter benefited from the PG&E settlement Dan referenced.
The remaining unfavorable variance was primarily driven by lower underlying underwriting results.
Our underlying combined ratio increased by 6.5 points to 95.2%.
We were pleased to see our top line momentum continue in the quarter, with net-written premiums up 7%.
Automobile underwriting results reflected higher loss levels for the quarter.
The combined ratio was 100% and included 3.4 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida.
The underlying combined ratio was 97%, up approximately 15 points from the prior-year quarter which reflected unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic.
The underlying combined ratio increased mainly due to claim frequency effectively returning to pre-pandemic levels in line with the trend we referenced in our prior quarter call.
To a lesser degree higher loss severity impacted the combined ratio as well as the vehicle replacement and repair costs remained at elevated levels.
We believe these profitability challenges are environmental and in response we are executing on our plans to file rate increases in about 40 states over the next three quarters.
As we indicated last quarter, it will take time for future rate actions to earn into results but we do expect to have higher rates in market in several states by year-end.
In Homeowners and other, the third quarter combined ratio increased by 16 points from the prior-year quarter to 109.3%, driven by a 24 point reduction in net favorable prior-year reserve development primarily related to the PG&E recovery from last year.
The combined ratio included 17.6 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida.
Homeowner's catastrophe losses were 4.7 points below a very active prior-year quarter.
The underlying combined ratio was 93.3%, an improvement of 3.5 points over the prior-year quarter, which experienced a very high level of loss activities.
That said, the underlying combined ratio was above our expectations, reflecting elevated non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity, both of which included higher severity related to a combination of labor and materials price increases.
Again, we believe these trends are environmental and we continue to seek price increases in response.
Before I shift to discussing production, I'll remind you that looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results by line of business, with the fourth quarter auto losses typically higher and fourth quarter homeowners losses typically lower than their annual average levels.
Turning to production, we were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home.
Automobile policies in force grew 5% to a record level, driven by strong retention at 85% and continued growth in new business which increased by 8%.
Renewal premium change was essentially flat reflecting the continued impact of the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic.
Domestic homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with policies in force up 7% also to a record level, driven by retention of 85% and new business growth of 5%.
Renewal premium change increased to 8.8%.
In the quarter, we continued to deliver solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want.
A couple of highlights from the quarter include: our new digital self-inspection process for property customers which improves their onboarding experience and provides valuable information to our underwriters; and IntelliDrive, our proprietary Auto Telematics offering which now had distracted driving as a rating variable in 40 U.S. markets in Ontario, Canada providing valuable feedback to drivers and continuing to advance our sophisticated pricing segmentation in automobile.
We will continue to invest in new capabilities like these for our customers and distribution partners.
Despite a challenging third quarter on the bottom line, we remain pleased with our overall performance and we are well-positioned to profitably grow our business over time.
","Travelers Companies Inc. reported strong financial results for Q3 2021, with core income of $655 million and core return on equity of 10.1%. Underlying underwriting income increased by 6% to $632 million, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a strong combined ratio of 91.4%. The company's diversified business segments contributed to top-line growth, with net-written premiums totaling $8.3 billion, a 7% increase. Core income year-to-date reached $2.2 billion, generating a core return on equity of 11.6%. Despite elevated catastrophe losses, the company outperformed market share and achieved lower losses than the industry average. Travelers emphasizes the benefits of its data and analytics capabilities, which contribute to risk assessment and claim handling efficiency. Strong cash flows, strategic investments, and share repurchases resulted in a 10% increase in adjusted book value per share over the past year. The company remains optimistic about the pricing environment and expects to continue driving profitable growth."
LAZ_q2_2021.txt,"I am Alexandra Deignan, the company's Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Sustainability.
Today's discussion also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the company's performance.
Hosting our call today are Kenneth Jacobs, Lazard's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Evan Russo, Chief Financial Officer.
Evan will start the discussion with an overview of our financial results, then Ken will provide his perspective on the outlook for our business.
After that, we'll open the call to questions.
Today, we reported record operating revenue for the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by strong results across the firm.
Second quarter revenue was a record $821 million, up 51% from a year ago, and first half revenue was a record $1.5 billion, up 33% from a year ago.
Revenue for the last 12 months was a record $2.9 billion.
This high performance underscores the strength of our franchise and the breadth and depth of our business.
In financial advisory, record second quarter revenue of $471 million increased 61% from last year's period, reflecting broad based activity across sectors, market cap and regions.
M&A completions in the second quarter increased substantially in the Americas, Europe and Asia as did private equity transactions.
Our advisory revenue reflects a growing percentage of financial sponsor activity.
Our Global Private Capital Advisory franchise also had a strong quarter serving financial sponsors with new fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions.
Our second quarter restructuring revenue was down from last year's elevated level, and we expect lower levels of restructuring to continue in the second half of the year, given the strong liquidity across markets.
Our sovereign and capital markets businesses continue to be active, advising governments and corporations on financing strategy and capital raising.
Overall, our advisory business is experiencing unprecedented activity levels.
Assuming current macroeconomic conditions, as we said last quarter, we expect that our Financial Advisory revenue in the second half of 2021 will be higher than the first half.
Asset Management operating revenue reached an all time high for the quarter and first half of the year with second quarter revenue of $343 million, up 40% from a year ago.
This reflected management fees on a larger base of assets under management, as well as strong incentive fees, primarily from European equity strategies.
Average AUM for the second quarter reached a record high of $276 billion, 32% higher than a year ago and 6% higher on a sequential basis.
As of June 30th, we reported AUM at a quarter end record level of $277 billion, 29% higher than last year's period and 5% higher on a sequential basis.
The increase was primarily driven by market appreciation and positive foreign exchange movement with $0.8 billion of net outflows.
The quarter's net outflows were limited to our equity platform, particularly in emerging markets.
These were partly offset by net inflows in our fixed income and alternatives platforms.
Gross inflows continue to be healthy across our platforms.
As of July 23rd, AUM increased to approximately $278 billion driven primarily by market appreciation of $2.5 billion, partly offset by negative foreign exchange movement of $1.3 billion and net outflows of approximately $1 billion.
We continue to see demand for global and international equities as well as our quantitative and fixed income strategies.
We are investing for growth across the firm.
In Asset Management, we continue to invest in people, technology and our distribution effort, as well as the development of new and existing funds and the scaling up of our platforms.
In the second quarter, we launched an investment grade convertible bond fund, our fifth long only strategy in the convertible space, an area where we are gaining significant traction.
In addition, this week we announced the senior hire to build and launch an investment strategy focused on sustainable private infrastructure.
We continue to see substantial opportunities to recruit talented investment teams adding strategies that are complementary to our existing platforms.
In financial advisory, we are driving growth with an elevated pace of strategic recruiting.
Year to date, we have made more than a dozen senior hires, including several high level senior advisors to increase the firm's breadth of revenue sources and connectivity.
Now turning to expenses, even as we invest for growth, we are maintaining our cost discipline.
Our adjusted non-compensation ratio for the second quarter was 14.5%, compared to 18.3% in last year's second quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were 19% higher than the same period last year, reflecting increased business activity over the last year's depressed levels.
We continue to accrue compensation expense at a 59.5% adjusted compensation ratio in the second quarter.
Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25.2%.
For the first half of the year, it was 26.7%.
We continue to expect this year's annual effective tax rate to be in the mid 20% range.
Lazard continues to generate strong cash flow, which supports return of capital to shareholders.
In the second quarter, we returned $161 million, which included $111 million in share repurchases.
We expect to continue our share repurchase program utilizing our cash flow from operations.
Our total outstanding share repurchase authorization is now approximately $339 million.
Ken will now provide perspective on our outlook.
The global macroeconomic environment continues to strengthen and market conditions remain excellent for both our businesses.
Even if the course of the pandemic remains uncertain, business conditions in most of the developed world are normalizing.
Economic recovery continues to be underpinned by unprecedented support from central banks and fiscal policy.
As CEOs, Boards and investors look past the short-term uncertainties, they are increasingly confident in the longer-term outlook.
The forces driving global strategic activity remain in place.
Technology driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for M&A across industries.
The global push to lower carbon emissions is an emerging catalyst.
The pandemic is driving structural changes in the real economy.
Shareholder activism continues to evolve globally and there is an abundance of private capital being put to work alongside strategic capital and specs.
Our advisory business is in high demand in this environment.
We are serving clients with the most sophisticated capabilities and deep insights into local markets, reinforced by expertise from global sector and specialty teams.
In Asset Management, we entered the second half of the year with a record level of assets under management.
Low interest rates continue to drive demand for risk assets including equities and corporate and emerging market debt as well as alternative investments.
Institutional investors continue to seek sources of differentiated alpha.
Our Asset Management business is especially well positioned in this environment with a diverse array of innovative strategies and solutions for a sophisticated client base.
We see significant opportunities for productive growth across our businesses, and we continue to invest in people, capabilities, technology infrastructure to enhance our competitive edge.
We remain focused on serving our clients well, while managing the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long-term.
Lazard's people are returning to the office and meeting clients in person with greater regularity, which is boosting spirits across the firm.
Even as we hope for a continued lifting of quarantines and travel restrictions, we have proven our ability to serve clients in both fully remote and hybrid environments.
They are serving our clients with outstanding financial advice and solutions and they continue to be remarkably productive.
They are improving day in and day out that Lazard's greatest asset is our people.
Now, let's open the call to questions.
","Lazard achieved record second-quarter revenue of $821 million, reflecting a 51% increase from the previous year's period. This performance was driven by robust growth in Financial Advisory, where revenue surged 61% to $471 million. M&A completions and private equity transactions increased substantially in various regions, contributing to this record performance. Asset Management revenue reached an all-time high of $343 million, with average AUM standing at $276 billion, 32% higher than the same quarter last year. The firm continues to invest in growth, recruiting senior personnel and developing new investment strategies, particularly in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) infrastructure. Lazard maintains cost discipline, with the adjusted non-compensation ratio at 14.5%. The firm generated strong cash flow, returning $161 million to shareholders through share repurchases. The economic environment remains favorable, supporting demand for advisory services. The firm is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities across its businesses and remains committed to serving clients, managing for profitable growth, and enhancing shareholder value over the long term."
HZO_q1_2021.txt,"These risks include, but are not limited to, the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions and the level of consumer spending, the company's ability to capitalize on opportunity, or grow its market share and numerous other factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We have worked hard over the years to build the most experienced, industry-leading team, and I am very proud of their results.
Today, I would like to start by reviewing a few of our first quarter highlights.
Then, I will touch on how we are strategically approaching the important peak selling season, as well as discussing the meaningful opportunities in front of us to create growth and long-term shareholder value.
And finally, Mike will review the financial results in greater detail and provide some color on the balance of the year.
Let me start by reviewing the first quarter.
Our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our team, customers and community as we serve our customers boating needs.
We are pleased that our first quarter results greatly exceeded the very impressive results last year.
A year ago, we had very strong growth in the December quarter and set a record for revenue and earnings.
The MarineMax team significantly outperformed those results and raised the bar yet again.
We further strengthened our financial position during the quarter, while completing the very strategic acquisition of SkipperBud's, the largest acquisition for the company to date.
As we indicated on our last earnings call in October, we finished fiscal 2020 with the highest revenue and earnings in the company's history.
That momentum and industry demand has continued as shown by our results.
Our record results continue to demonstrate our team's ability to evaluate customers' needs, act quickly and implement the right changes in how we operate our business.
For the quarter we are particularly pleased with our continued solid performance in same-store sales, which increased over 20% which is on top of 24% same-store sales growth a year ago.
Importantly, our new unit growth was even stronger at 35%.
Furthermore in the quarter, we had meaningful growth across essentially all brand, categories and geographic region.
The marine industry continues to experience a significant acceleration in new customers.
This new foundational layer of customers to the boating lifestyle is comprised of the combination of new first-time buyers and people that decided to get back into boating, which should help support future growth as they migrate to larger or different types of products in the coming years.
Our team remains energized by the shift, and given our scale, we should continue to significantly benefit from this resurgence.
During the quarter we also leveraged our investments in technology, driving leads in marketing analytics, which is converting into sales.
We continue to make investments in world-class customer engagement tools that improve our teams' efficiency and effectiveness and help us to take share and lead the industry.
In the quarter, we added SkipperBud's and its affiliate Silver Seas Yacht to our family.
The acquisition added 20 locations, including 11 marina and storage operations.
We have successfully integrated the business and believe many opportunities exists to share best practices, brands and resources to drive even greater growth in the years to come.
From a profitability perspective, one of the best elements of the quarter was strong gross margin.
We benefited from increases in product margins, growth in our storage and service businesses, our asset light Fraser and Northrop & Johnson global charter businesses and our finance and insurance businesses.
Expanding our margins has been a long-term strategic focus and recent acquisitions have contributed to that strategy.
The combination of gross margin expansion and focused expense management resulted in considerable leverage and a record $1.04 of earnings per share for the quarter.
But, even more impressive is that we believe there is incremental growth ahead.
So now let me touch on how we are approaching the important peak selling season.
We are well positioned and prepared to serve our customers.
COVID had changed all aspects of customer expectations, including the historically important Boat Show.
Our team has adapted with greater digital capabilities and refocused marketing spend that leverages our stores and our online experience, generating exceptional results.
Beyond leaner industry inventory, we continue to invest in training and tools to ensure our team is able to pivot to continue to meet the needs of our customers digitally.
Our deep manufacturing relationships and nationwide shared inventory give us a competitive edge.
With the largest selling season ahead, we expect to build on a strong start to our fiscal year and deliver exceptional customer experiences.
Our strategy to create long-term shareholder value is focused on driving top line growth, operating leverage, disciplined capital management and building on our strong culture.
We continue to effectively execute on our multifaceted growth strategy, supported by our global market presence, premium brands, exceptional customer service and ongoing investments in technology.
Our focus on driving margins and improving costs continue to unlock significant leverage in our model.
Our performance illustrates the power of our business model, specifically our scale, premium locations, and cash flow generating capability.
MarineMax is a well-disciplined operator with a strong foundation from which to grow.
With that update, I will ask Mike to provide more detailed comments on the quarter.
For the quarter, revenue grew 35% to over $411 million due largely to same-store sales growth of 20%.
This exceptional growth was driven by even greater comparable new unit growth that exceeded 35%%.
While our AUP declined in the quarter from seasonally very strong sales of smaller product, the demand for larger product is also robust.
A big takeaway from our results this quarter is our ability to post very strong comps on top of already strong comps.
Our gross profit dollars increased over $43 million, while our gross margin rose 370 basis points to 30%.
Our record gross margin was due to a handful of factors.
Among these are improving margins on new and used boat sales, impressive service and storage performance of SkipperBud's, which has a long track record of performance in these categories, growth in our higher margin finance and insurance businesses, and growth in our brokerage business including our global Superyacht Services Organizations of Northrop & Johnson and Fraser Yachts.
We would note that the superyacht charter business has remained adversely impacted by travel bans around the globe.
Our higher margin businesses has been a focus of ours for some time, including our acquisition strategy, which is helping to drive these results.
Regarding SG&A, the majority of the increase was due to the increase in sales and the related commissions combined with the two mergers we have recently completed, SkipperBud's and Northrop & Johnson.
Interest expense dropped in the quarter due to lower interest rates and a sizable reduction in short-term borrowings given the cash we have generated.
Our operating leverage in the quarter was over 17% which drove very strong earnings growth setting another quarterly record with pre-tax earnings of almost $31 million.
Our record December quarter saw both net income and earnings per share more than double with earnings per share hitting $1.04, more than twice the level of last year's previous record.
Moving on to our balance sheet, we continue to build cash with about $121 million at quarter end versus $36 million a year ago.
Even after paying cash for both Northrop & Johnson in July and SkipperBud's, October 1.
As discussed last quarter, given the attractive interest rate environment, we explored and did secure mortgages on a portion of our sizable real estate portfolio.
Besides some slight rate arbitrage it further positions us to capitalize on opportunities as they develop.
Our inventory at quarter end was down 23% to $379 million.
However, excluding Skippers, our inventory is down closer to 36%.
I illustrate this point to show how well our team has pivoted to selling in a lean inventory environment as proven by the very strong unit-driven same-store sales growth this quarter.
Looking at our liabilities, despite added borrowings for Skipper's inventory, short-term borrowings decreased $171 million due largely to a reduction in inventories and increase in cash generation with the contribution from the roughly $53 million of mortgages that are outstanding.
Customer deposits, while not the best predictor of near-term sales because they can be lumpy, due to the size of deposits and whether a trade is involved or not, nearly tripled in size due to the timing of large yacht orders and more robust sales along with the contribution from Skipper's for future sales.
Our current ratio stands at 1.74 and our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is 1.42, both of these are very impressive balance sheet metrics.
Our tangible net worth was $339 million or about $14.92 per share.
Our balance sheet has always been a formidable strategic advantage, and today more than ever, it continues to protect us in uncertain times, while providing the capital for expansion as opportunities arise.
Turning to guidance, the December quarter exceeded expectations and the industry trends remained strong.
The industry estimates for 2021 retail units are beginning to rise from the low-single digits to the mid-single digits.
Since we usually outperform the industry and grow our AUP on an annual basis, we now expect our annual same-store sales growth to be in the high single digits.
This is up from the mid-to-high single digits we guided to earlier in the year.
Given the strength in earnings in December, our guidance also assumes modest operating leverage improvement above our previous guidance.
This expectations assumes we reached the low end of our historical targeted leverage of 12% to 17% given we have the bulk of the year still in front of us along with continued uncertainty.
Accordingly, we are raising our earnings per share guidance to the range of $4 to $4.20 for 2021 from our earlier guidance of $3.70 to $3.90.
Our guidance excludes the impact from any potential acquisitions that we may complete.
As we progress through the year, we will provide updates as needed to our guidance.
Looking at the remainder of 2021, remember that our March quarter is the easiest comparison with our toughest comparisons in the more meaningful summer quarters of June and September.
Our guidance uses the share count of about 22.8 million shares and an effective tax rate of 26%.
Our tax rate for the December quarter was meaningfully better than this, due primarily to equity compensation deductions which are hard to predict and are not typically forecasted when we give guidance.
Turning to current trends, January will close with positive same-store sales and our backlog is meaningfully higher than last year.
As we have said, industry trends remain strong and we are generally outperforming these elevated levels.
We continue to feel good as we enter the important summer selling season that's early in the year and a lot of work remains.
MarineMax continues to benefit and capitalize on the surge in demand and the desire of consumers to find a safe recreational activity.
Our team's performance to start the fiscal year has shown continued excellent execution, even on top of very impressive same-store sales a year ago.
We are creating exceptional customer experiences through our team's services, products and technology.
Most exciting is that we see significant opportunity in our brand expansion and also our higher margin businesses.
With about 30 locations globally, we believe our superyacht services business have considerable upside including their charter business, which should contribute in a much larger manner.
We remain committed to the long-term financial strength of the company by driving cash flow growth.
Importantly, our acquisitions are integrated and contributing immediately to our business.
Looking forward, we are focused on building our strong team culture, we are focused on executing on our growth strategy and we are focused on creating long-term shareholder value.
","MarineMax experienced significant growth in the first quarter, exceeding the record-breaking results of the previous year. Revenue increased by 35% to over $411 million, with same-store sales growth of 20% and new unit growth of 35%. The company noted strong demand across all categories, including an influx of new customers to the boating lifestyle. Gross margin expanded by 370 basis points to 30%, driven by improved margins on new and used boat sales, and growth in higher margin businesses such as finance and insurance. Earnings per share reached a record $1.04. MarineMax's acquisition of SkipperBud's has contributed to these strong results, providing opportunities for sharing best practices and resources. Looking ahead to the peak selling season, the company is well-positioned with its deep manufacturing relationships and nationwide shared inventory. MarineMax expects to build on its strong start and deliver exceptional customer experiences. They have also increased their fiscal year earnings per share guidance to $4.00 to $4.20, reflecting the continued strength in industry trends and the company's strong execution."
FSS_q2_2021.txt,"I'm Ian Hudson, the company's Chief Financial Officer.
Also with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
These documents are available on our website.
In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.
I'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our second quarter results before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide her perspective on our performance, market conditions and thoughts on the rest of the year.
In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter with operating results exceeding our expectations despite dramatic increases in commodity costs and ongoing supply chain disruption, including factors linked to the global shortage in semiconductors.
As a reminder, in the prior year quarter, we also took several cost saving actions in response to the uncertainty created by the pandemic, which reduced our costs in Q2 last year by approximately $14 million.
While most of these savings were either temporary cost reductions or volume related, some were more permanent actions.
In Q2 this year, the return of many of these costs represented a year-over-year expense headwind of approximately $5 million.
Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $335 million, up $65 million or 24% compared to last year.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $38.5 million, up $7.2 million or 23% compared to last year.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $51.9 million, up $6.5 million or 14% compared to last year.
That translates to a margin of 15.5% in Q2 this year compared to 16.8% last year.
Net income for the quarter was $29.7 million, up from $21.4 million last year.
That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.48 per share, up 37% from $0.35 per share last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50 per share, an improvement of 19% compared to $0.42 per share last year.
Order intake for the quarter was again outstanding with orders of $361 million representing an increase of $159 million or 79% compared to Q2 last year.
Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter set a new company record at $437 million.
That represents an increase of $104 million or 31% compared to Q2 last year and an increase of $133 million or 44% from the end of last year.
In terms of our group results, ESG's net sales for the quarter were $281 million, up $67 million or 31% compared to last year.
ESG's operating income for the quarter was $38.5 million, up $9.9 million or 35% compared to last year.
ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $50.6 million, up $9.7 million or 24% compared to last year.
That translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 18% at the high end of our current target range but down a 110 basis points compared to last year.
ESG reported total orders of $300 million in Q2 this year, an improvement of $142 million or 90% compared to last year.
SSG's net sales for the quarter was $53 million compared to $56 million in Q2 last year, which included a large fleet sale of public safety equipment to a customer in Europe.
SSG's operating income for the quarter was $7.8 million compared to $10.4 million last year.
SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $8.7 million compared to $11.7 million last year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.3% compared to a record margin of 20.9% in Q2 last year, which included favorable sales mix and lower operating expenses.
SSG's orders for the quarter were $61 million, up $17 million or 39% compared to last year, with most of the improvement resulting from higher demand for public safety equipment in both domestic and international markets.
Corporate operating expenses for the quarter were $7.8 million compared to $7.7 million last year.
Turning now to the consolidated income statement, where the increase in sales contributed to an $11.3 million improvement in gross profit.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.4% compared to 26% last year.
As a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were down a 100 basis points from Q2 last year.
Other items affecting the quarterly results include a $1.3 million reduction in restructuring charges, a $2.3 million decrease in other expense and a $700,000 reduction in interest expense.
Tax expense for the quarter increased by $1.9 million, largely due to the increase in pre-tax income levels, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity.
Including the effects of these higher tax benefits, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.2% compared with 22.2% last year.
At this time, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.
On an overall GAAP basis, we therefore earned $0.48 per share in Q2 this year compared with $0.35 per share in Q2 last year.
To facilitate earnings comparisons, we typically adjust our GAAP earnings per share for unusual items recorded in the current or prior year quarters.
In the current year quarter, we made adjustments to GAAP earnings per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses, pension-related charges, coronavirus-related expenses and purchase accounting expense effects.
On this basis, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.50 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year.
Looking now at cash flow, where we generated $13 million of cash from operations during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date operating cash generation to $39 million.
During the quarter, we elected to accelerate the timing of certain tax payments to preserve tax planning flexibility in the event of a possible increase in U.S. corporate tax rate.
With this approach, we expect to see lower tax payments in the third and fourth quarters, while at the same time, creating the potential for future tax savings.
In addition, in Q2 last year, our cash flow benefited from certain deferrals that were permitted under the CARES Act.
We have also increased investments in our rental fleet, given the improving utilization levels we are experiencing.
For the rest of the year, we are expecting strong cash flow generation, and we continue to target cash conversion of approximately 100% on a net income basis.
We ended the quarter with $169 million of net debt and availability under our credit facility of $268 million.
Our current net debt leverage remains low.
With our financial positioning rate remaining strong, we have significant flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions, invest in organic growth initiatives and return cash to stockholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
On that note, we paid dividends of $5.5 million during the quarter, reflecting a dividend of $0.09 per share, and we recently announced a similar dividend for the third quarter.
I'd like to start my comments with a quick update on a subject that we've been talking about for a long time, an infrastructure bill.
The reports from late yesterday were encouraging.
It finally appears that infrastructure legislation is likely.
Some components reported to be part of the deal, which includes a total of $550 billion in new federal investment in U.S. infrastructure include: $110 billion for roads; $73 billion for power infrastructure; $65 billion to expand broadband access; $55 billion for water infrastructure; $46 billion for environmental resiliency; and $11 billion for transportation safety.
We are optimistic that an infrastructure package in these areas would provide funding that would support the use of the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners and street sweepers.
Turning now to our performance in the quarter.
Our teams again delivered impressive results with meaningful growth in both the top and bottom line, while achieving adjusted EBITDA margin toward the high end of our target range despite widespread supply chain disruptions and an unprecedented commodity cost environment.
Top line growth was largely across the board, with particular strength in the sales of dump truck bodies and trailers, which were up around $15 million from Q2 last year.
Over the last several years, we have successfully diversified our revenue streams and end market exposures through a combination of organic growth initiatives in M&A, and that helped us to partially mitigate the impact of these factors during the second quarter.
Another area of notable strength during the second quarter was in our aftermarkets business.
While the second quarter is typically a seasonally strong period for aftermarkets, we originally had some concerns entering the quarter that rental activity in Canada would be adversely impacted by various shutdown measures taken in response to the pandemic.
Rental activity and demand for used equipment was higher-than-expected with rental utilization in Canada exceeding our targets and returning to pre pandemic levels.
Rental utilization in the U.S. is also improving.
For example, rental utilization of our Jetstream water blasting equipment exceeded the levels we saw in 2019.
The improved utilization followed a strong spring shutdown cleaning season, which has historically been a leading indicator of industrial end market recovery.
In June, with a combination of high rental utilization and strong used equipment sales, our JJE rental business reported the highest monthly revenue in its history.
Those favorable trends have continued into July as well.
Overall, our aftermarket revenues in Q2 this year were up $26 million or 46% year-over-year growing to represent a higher share of ESG revenues for the quarter at around 30%.
That shift in mix helped to partially mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs and production-related inefficiencies associated with supply chain disruption, helping ESG to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin at the high end of the current range.
As we mentioned on our last call, following the suspension of chassis production at one of our suppliers, we made the decision to temporarily shut down production at our facility in Streator, Illinois for a two-week period around the 4th of July holiday.
The team worked tirelessly to mitigate the impact of this short-term disruption by effectively managing production schedules to meet record customer demand.
With the expansion of our Streator facility now complete, our production in May approached a record levels we experienced in 2019, helping us to deliver more units than anticipated ahead of the shutdown despite the inefficiencies associated with supply chain constraints.
Like many companies, we are also experienced increased freight charges as we expedited the supply of certain components and higher commodity costs.
As they have done in the past, our procurement teams took several proactive measures, including securing availability of certain steel and locking in pricing based on forecasted needs.
We also work diligently to mitigate the impacts by implementing several price increases and surcharges.
Despite these actions and with demand being significantly higher than we had expected, we experienced unfavorable price cost year-over-year headwind of approximately $3 million during the quarter, mostly within our dump truck and trailer business.
In Q2, we also realized the benefits from strategic investments we had made in prior quarters in building additional stock units and procuring additional chassis so that we had greater flexibility to meet customers' needs.
These investments have enabled us to deliver on customer expectations, in some cases, supplying chassis when they were unable to procure the chassis, which resulted in a higher concentration of low-margin chassis that we supplied as opposed to customer-supplied chassis.
Although this unfavorable impact on margins this quarter, we are playing the long game by prioritizing customer deliveries and satisfaction.
We continue to believe that in these challenging times, the strong will get stronger, and we've seen this happen.
While the current widespread macroeconomic factors could have some impact on our margins in the near term, we are taking this opportunity to try to leverage our competitive advantage to gain market share.
Demand for our product offerings continues to be strong as demonstrated by our outstanding second quarter order intake of $361 million.
Our teams are energized as we enter the second half of the year with a record backlog, reflecting strength across our end markets and continued confidence in a post pandemic recovery.
This sentiment has been widely shared by our customers and dealer partners and seems to be further solidified by recent economic stimulants.
As a reminder, the American Rescue Plan, COVID relief package passed earlier this year included $1.9 trillion of economic stimulus with approximately $350 billion earmarked for state, local and territorial governments for a variety of purposes, including the maintenance of essential infrastructure, such as sewer systems and streets.
In May, the first $175 billion tranche started to be distributed by the treasury department with a second tranche expected in 2022.
Recent market planning sessions with our dealer channel highlighted early indications that the first tranche was starting to be allocated to essential service purchases.
As a provider of equipment used for these essential services like sewer cleaning and Street sweeping, we stand to benefit from additional aid that may be provided to state and local sources for these purposes.
On the municipal side, demand for sewer cleaners and street sweepers remains high.
Within our SSG public safety businesses, we are seeing benefits from new product introductions and our ability to meet customer demand.
We believe we are in a stronger position than many of our competitors and are gaining share.
We've also seen a notable uptick in our industrial end markets with improved orders for our Guzzler and Jetstream products.
Orders within our dump body and trailer business in Q2 this year were more than double last year's orders with growth across all end markets resulting in a record backlog.
This is another area where we believe we are gaining share that will position us well for the future.
While our backlog is at a record high, there are a few headwinds that we are -- we, like many other industrial companies will continue to monitor closely during the second half of the year.
The first factor that many of you will be aware of is the continued impact of the global semiconductor shortage, which is causing significant disruption regarding chassis delivery.
This situation changes weekly.
Because we do not rely on any one single chassis manufacturer and with the proactive actions we took, we have so far been able to pivot to alternative suppliers to minimize the financial impact.
However, the situation remains fluid and ongoing chassis delivery delays are almost universal due to component shortages.
Beyond chassis, we are experiencing other supply chain tightness ranging from reduced availability of paint epoxy within our road marking business to cylinders that are used in certain trucks.
So far this year, we've been able to successfully navigate through the difficulty, but it remains a challenging situation.
The second factor relates to the current commodity cost environment.
We currently expect the price cost impact in Q3 to be in the same neighborhood as we saw this quarter.
But with the pricing actions we have taken, we are expecting to see improvement beginning in the fourth quarter with more price realization expected as our backlog turns.
On a more positive note, we continue to have relatively good access to labor at many of our facilities, which has recently been an issue for many companies.
Our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives is positioning us well in the communities in which we operate and is a differentiating factor in our ability to attract labor at many of our facilities.
We are still getting multiple quality applicants for open positions at our largest facility, and certain of our TBEI locations are starting to see traction from its recently introduced School of Weld program.
Overall, our access to labor remains good.
Further, our companywide efforts to raise awareness about vaccines assist eligible employees and gaining access to vaccines and encourage participation levels are paying off with a companywide vaccination rate of approximately 50%.
Domestically, about 2/3 of our businesses have achieved vaccination rates that are higher than the relevant state average.
We have also had notable improvements in Canada during the second quarter with greater vaccine accessibility.
COVID related disruptions have diminished as vaccination [Technical Issues].
And most importantly, 100% of our employees that have been affected by COVID has since recovered.
I now want to take a few minutes to provide an update on some of our strategic growth initiatives.
On the organic front, I've already touched on the success of our aftermarket initiative.
We also remain bullish about safe digging prospects and with noted industrial end market recoveries and infrastructure spend optimism throughout the channels, we are confident safe digging trends will continue to improve.
Our TRUVAC safe digging product line portfolio includes a complete range of truck-mounted safe digging equipment, which can be used in a broad range of applications, included expanded application in utility markets.
As an example, one of the nation's largest utility companies recently announced plans to bury 10,000 miles of its power lines to reduce the risk of California wildfires.
Use of safe digging technologies significantly minimizes chances of damaging underground infrastructure during the digging process and provides significant environmental benefits by minimizing damage to tree roots.
We've included a picture of our safe digging equipment in action while preserving trees at the same time in the accompanying slides.
The technology has also been utilized in recent bridge resurfacing infrastructure projects with the vacuum capabilities providing added efficiencies in the cleanup of related debris.
TRUVAC product demonstrations for the quarter were up 4% from last year, and our education efforts are also having a positive impact on sewer cleaner demand with the inclusion of the optional safe digging package turning our sewer cleaners into a multipurpose vehicle.
On the new product development front, our R&D efforts continue to drive organic growth.
As an example, approximately 75% of our air sweeper orders in June were associated with recent product introductions.
In Q2, our SSG team launched the new low-cost ultra-low profile Reliant light bar as part of the group's strategic initiative to gain market share through the expansion of Lights & Sirens product offerings in the value tier.
The Reliant provides customers with an ultra-low profile light bar that is competitively priced while providing advanced programming features and excellent optical performance that enhances the warning effectiveness and appearance of the emergency vehicle.
Our sales team is currently showing the Reliant to customers that are supplying distribution with sample bars for customer demonstrations.
Initial feedback from the market has been excellent, and we've received orders and are currently shipping the new product to customers in the U.S. and Mexico.
We have several product launches in the pipeline with street sweeper electrification remaining a key area of focus.
We are actively working on our next vehicle in our electrification new product development road map.
We've also recently identified an additional battery partner and are continuing to receive positive feedback from customer demonstration.
As we have said before, M&A will continue to contribute meaningfully to our future growth.
We are pleased with the progress we are making at integrating OSW, and the teams are energized by the opportunities identified during the 80/20 improvement training sessions we recently have.
Our current M&A pipeline continues to be very active.
As Ian noted in his comments, our financial position and liquidity are strong enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions, and there are several M&A opportunities that our teams are currently reviewing.
Although we may experience some temporary challenges in the near term, we have positioned federal signal in a manner in which we will fully participate in the economic recovery by increasing capacity within our facilities, investing in new product development and gaining market share.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year.
Demand for our products continues to be high with our second quarter order intake, up 79% compared to the prior year, resulting in a backlog entering the second half of the year, which is at a record level.
The strength of our second quarter earnings, our record backlog and improving aftermarket demand in North America gives us increased confidence in the year.
Assuming no significant delays in our receipt of chassis from our supplier, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a new range of $1.78 to $1.9 from the prior range of $1.73 to $1.85.
We are also encouraged by the long-term opportunities that infrastructure legislation would create for almost all of our businesses.
With our recent capacity expansions, we would be well positioned to meet the associated increase in demand for our products.
","Federal Signal Corporation delivered an exceptional Q2 with strong financial performance and a record backlog. Consolidated sales surged 24% to $335 million, exceeding estimates. Adjusted earnings per share rose 19% to $0.50. Despite supply chain disruptions and higher commodity costs, ESG's adjusted EBITDA margin remained at 18%. SSG's performance was solid, with orders growing 39%. The company is optimistic about infrastructure legislation, which would support demand for its products in various end markets. Order intake was impressive, rising 79% to $361 million, resulting in a record backlog of $437 million. Federal Signal increased its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $1.78-$1.90 due to strong demand and improved aftermarket performance in North America. The company is actively pursuing strategic acquisitions, and its strong financial position provides flexibility for further growth."
HII_q1_2021.txt,"Actual results may differ.
Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures.
I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe.
Sales of $2.3 billion for the quarter were slightly higher than 2020.
Diluted earnings per share was $3.68 for the quarter and pension adjusted earnings per share was $3.56, up from $2.43 in 2020.
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of approximately $49 billion, of which approximately $25 billion is funded.
Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks.
Shifting to activities in Washington.
We were pleased that the recently released summary of the fiscal year 2022 President's budget request affirm that maintaining U.S. naval power is critical to reassuring allies and signaling U.S. resolved to potential adversaries.
Of note, the budget summary cited continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet, investment in remotely operated and autonomous systems and funding for the next-generation attack submarine program.
And we look forward to understanding budget details for these and other national security priorities when that information becomes available as well as funding levels requested for the Department of Energy and the Department of Homeland Security.
We also look forward to working closely with the Congress as the FY '22 President's budget request is considered during the current legislative cycle.
Regarding portfolio shaping actions during the quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of our oil and gas business and also completed the contribution of the San Diego Shipyard to Titan Acquisition Holdings in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in this leading provider of ship repair and fleet sustainment services.
Completion of these transactions sharpens the focus of our Technical Solutions business into areas where we believe our unique capabilities and close customer relationships will drive strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion.
And as I prepare to close, I'm very pleased with the operating rhythm the team is achieving, which led to the third consecutive quarter of solid program execution and financial results.
And I am very confident that our strength, agility and positive momentum resulting from enduring the impacts of COVID-19 will serve as key catalyst to help us leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and employees.
After serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and with more than 40 years of service, Brian Cuccias retired on April 1.
Brian's career at Ingalls has been remarkable, and HII has truly benefited from his leadership.
Effective April 1, Kari Wilkinson succeeded Brian as the new President of Ingalls and will report to Chris.
Kari has proven herself to be a strategic and visionary leader that is focused on operational excellence, and I am extremely confident that Ingalls is in very capable hands.
Operationally, we had a solid quarter, making consistent progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs.
With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter.
At Ingalls, the team was awarded a life-cycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million.
The scope of work includes engineering change management, supply chain management, training for new shipboard systems and the execution of post-delivery availabilities.
Regarding program status, LHA eight Bougainville achieved a 25% complete milestone during the quarter, and the team remains focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of their planned production milestones.
On the DDG program, the team remains focused on preparations for launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas and sea trials for DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr., both planned for the second half of this year.
And on the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale remains on track to complete sea trials later this year.
And LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., remains on schedule for launch early next year.
The team at Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33, along with LHA nine under contract.
This bundle acquisition approach is the most affordable method to buy these ships.
And when complete, affords predictable savings for the Navy.
At Newport News, the team was awarded a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, and also received a contract modification for construction of the 10th Virginia-class Block V submarine.
These key awards are additional building blocks for a record backlog, which now stands at nearly $49 billion.
Shifting to program status, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 81% complete.
The team is finalizing plans to support the single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key initial test milestones.
CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 87% complete and continues to make progress with the crew recently beginning to move back aboard the ship.
This is another key milestone is supported redelivery to the Navy planned for next year.
On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana continues test program activities in preparation for delivery to the Navy planned for later this year.
In addition, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off milestone as planned in the second half of this year.
At Technical Solutions, the team booked several key awards during the quarter.
This included a $175 million fleet to statement recompete and a position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, ISR and cybersecurity IDIQ contract.
Additionally, production of the first Orca XLUUV modules is now under way at our unmanned systems center of excellence.
Approximately 75% of all structural components have been fabricated, and assembly has commenced with final unit delivery to Boeing plan later this year.
And finally, our Nuclear and Environmental Services business continues to perform very well with strong performance across our Department of Energy contracts at Los Alamos, Nevada and Savannah River.
Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results.
This was primarily due to growth at Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline of Technical Solutions due to divestitures associated with the portfolio-shaping actions we have taken.
Segment operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased $35 million from the first quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin, 8.4%, increased 149 basis points.
The improvement was driven by higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance to Technical Solutions.
Operating income for the quarter of $147 million decreased by $68 million from the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 6.5% decreased 35 basis points.
These decreases were primarily driven by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by the stronger segment operating results compared to the prior year.
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15% compared to approximately 20% in the first quarter of 2020.
The decline in tax rate was primarily due to the divestiture of our oil and gas business as well as the recognition of R&D tax credits for the current year and prior periods.
Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations was $43 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $16 million.
This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan were $72 million in the quarter, of which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.
During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million.
As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of approximately $50 million.
Moving on to pension.
With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the five-year pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most appropriate view.
Due to the limited nature of our projected contributions and the impact of lower cash sensitivity with safe harbor implementation, the passage of the legislation does not have a meaningful impact on our outlook.
We plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call, consistent with our prior cadence.
Ingalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20 million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program.
Ingalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier.
Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to $66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction as well as fleet support services.
Newport News operating income of $93 million and margin 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk retirement on VCS Block IV boats.
Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February one of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compares to a loss in the first quarter of 2020.
This was driven primarily by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business.
Turning to Slide nine.
We continue to expect we will finish the year with strict building operating margin in the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted toward the end of the year.
In addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our annual guidance range.
We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.
","HII reported first-quarter earnings per share of $3.68, up significantly from $2.43 in 2020. Diluted earnings per share, excluding pension, were $3.56. Sales recorded $2.3 billion for the quarter, slightly higher than the previous year. New contract awards totaled $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of approximately $49 billion. Key awards include a $214 million LPD program contract for Ingalls, a $3 billion CVN 74 refueling and complex overhaul contract, and a $175 million fleet to statement recompete for Technical Solutions. Segment operating income increased to $191 million, driven by higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance in Technical Solutions. Net earnings reached $148 million, and cash from operations was $43 million. HII reiterated its 2021 guidance, targeting a shipbuilding operating margin in the 7% to 8% range and an effective tax rate of approximately 18%."
NWN_q1_2021.txt,"They are based on management's [Technical Issues].
We expect to file our 10-Q later today.
As mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call.
News media may also contact me.
We look forward to see many of you at the American Gas Association Financial Forum in a few weeks.
Please also contact me if you have any questions about the event or meeting with our management team.
Well, our year is off to a great start.
Our financial results are solid, and we continue to make progress on all key objectives.
We reported net income of $1.94 per share in the first quarter that compares to net income from continuing operations of $1.58 per share for the same period last year.
New rates in Oregon drove results of the Gas Utility along with continued healthy customer growth and improved results from our interstate storage business.
I'm pleased with how all of our systems operated over the winter and specifically during the widespread cold snap in February.
Our extensive resource planning and the value of our gas storage assets were proven once again.
Our team successfully managed gas supplies to mitigate the impact of the event on customers and additionally through a third-party, we were able to optimize our gas supply portfolio, capturing asset management revenues, which aid results but also offset higher gas cost for our customers.
While many areas of the country will experience significantly elevated bills, our customers are going to fare quite well.
Our commitment to safety and reliability served Northwest Natural Water customers well in February also.
Our water utilities operating in the Pacific Northwest served customers through the February event without disruption.
In Texas, power outages resulted in freezing and bursting pipes on roughly half of our systems, but we were able to restore water service within 24 to 48 hours to all customers.
Now a few notes on the economy.
The COVID vaccine has been rolled out in all states that we operate, economic reports for our region continued to show good recovery and growth in several important areas.
Oregon's unemployment rate was 6.1% in February, which is comparable to the national rate.
Single-family housing activity remained strong.
In the Portland metro region, home sales were up 7.4% from 2020 with price growth of about 12% on average.
And new single-family permits issued were up 5.7% in Oregon over the last 12 months compared to the prior period.
We continue to see good customer growth.
New construction plus conversions translated into connecting over 11,000 meters during the 12 months ended March 31, which equates to a growth rate of 1.4%.
Our water and wastewater utilities also continue to grow.
Strong residential housing construction primarily in Idaho, Texas and Washington translated into a strong 3% growth rate.
We also closed on tuck-in acquisitions this past year, leading to an overall customer growth rate of almost 6% -- actually 5.8% to be exact.
Frank, over to you.
I will begin today by discussing the highlights of first quarter 2021 results and conclude with guidance for the year.
I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%.
As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating months.
For the quarter, we reported net income of $59.5 million or $1.94 per share compared to net $48.3 million or $1.58 per share of net income from continuing operations for the same period in 2020.
The Gas Utility posted an increase of $0.19 per share and our other activities contributed an additional $0.17 per share compared to last year.
Higher earnings at the Gas Utility were primarily related to new rates set in Oregon in November of 2020, offset in part by higher depreciation and general tax expense.
Utility margin in the Gas Distribution segment increased $13.6 million as a result of the new rates and customer growth, which were partly offset by the $1.8 million greater loss from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as we purchased higher gas -- priced gas during the February cold weather event than was forecasted for the year.
Utility O&M increased $2.1 million in the quarter, reflecting higher compensation and non-payroll expenses.
Depreciation expense and general taxes increased $3.3 million.
In addition to the impact of the higher pre-tax income, tax expense increased $1.7 million due to the net effect of the Oregon Corporate Activity Tax and the ongoing amortization of tax benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
This impact is largely a timing matter, which will correct over the course of the year with no significant expected effect on net income.
Net income from our other businesses increased $5.3 million due to $4.6 million of higher asset management revenues from the weather event as David mentioned.
In addition, other businesses benefited from higher earnings at the water and wastewater utilities, from assets we acquired in Washington and Texas last year, as well as lower expenses at our holding company.
Cash provided by operating activities was $137 million or an increase of $32 million compared to last year.
We reinvested $64 million into the business, most of which was Gas Utility capital expenditures.
Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.
From an earnings perspective, the ongoing effects of COVID are largely limited to commercial customer disconnects and slightly lower usage from non-decoupled customers, as well as late fee revenues that will be recognized at a future date when we begin recovery.
And as David noted, commercial customer accounts remained steady during the first quarter, even as we began normal collection practices.
Furthermore, we have a good -- had a good response to past due notices with a substantial reduction in delinquent balances.
We will continue to closely monitor usage levels and commercial customer losses and be disciplined in cost management.
We are pleased to note that 97% of our commercial and industrial customers are current with their bills.
The company reaffirmed 2021 earnings guidance today for net income in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
The guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations.
While our business model allows us to adapt to unforeseen challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and the most recent weather event, while also delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders, our decisions are guided by our long-standing core values and those values inform our environmental, social and governance goals and actions.
So today, I'll walk you through just a few of our priorities and progress.
It's our greatest responsibility to our customers, our employees and the communities we serve.
In the 1980s, Northwest Natural proactively created a pipeline replacement program with our public utility commissions.
And by 2015, we had replaced all of our cast iron and bare steel pipe.
We are one of the first local distribution companies to completely remove those legacy pipelines and, today, as a result, operate one of the most modern and tightest systems in the nation, but we remain vigilant.
For example, we performed safety inspections on our transmission system at nearly three times the rate required by federal and state regulations.
Our long-standing core value of environmental stewardship is also a driving force behind the choices we make every day in our operations in planning for the future.
We believe climate change requires rapid innovation and collective action, which is why we're committed to reimagining the role of our system and the fuel we deliver.
In 2016, we established a 30% carbon savings goal to be achieved by 2035 starting from a 2015 baseline.
This goal is for our own operations and importantly, the use.
It also includes the use of natural gas by our customers and I want to underscore, this is a very unique and aggressive voluntary goal as compared to others.
It has been a catalyst for us to lead beyond our walls by building public policy coalitions that support innovation and new thinking.
One example of that is the groundbreaking Oregon Senate Bill 98, which allows us to procure renewable natural gas, including hydrogen, for our customers here in Oregon.
This law goes further than any other current law in the U.S. by outlining goals for adding as much as 30% renewables on the system by 2050.
I'm proud to report that we made good progress on our carbon savings goal and results through 2020 show we are on track to meet or exceed that original target.
Energy efficiency contributed nearly half of the savings achieved, with our voluntary carbon offset program also providing significant savings.
And finally our producer emissions screening tool allows us to prioritize purchases from lower and medium producers and also contributed to the goal.
The benefits we're reaping today are from programs and efforts that we began many years ago.
It's a good reminder that having a vision and a commitment to pursue it is critical to realizing significant change, which is why we're not stopping there.
We believe we can leverage renewables in our existing modern system along with other innovations to further decarbonize our system.
Our vision forward is to be carbon-neutral energy provider by 2050.
We know the current tools for driving to carbon neutrality, but this year, we are modeling multiple scenarios to better understand the different pathways.
While we expect this analysis to evolve over time, having a start to specific roadmaps and options will allow us to begin advocating for additional policy support and putting programs and people in place for long-term success.
We know our customers and communities value finding the right environmental solutions along -- among many other priorities, which is why we monitor customer satisfaction carefully to inform our work.
And I'm pleased to report this is an area our employees continue to excel.
Last year, Northwest Natural scored second in the West for large utilities in the J.D. Power Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study and were named a Customer Champion by Escalent after placing second in the nation among electric and gas utilities in their most recent study.
And finally, just a few weeks ago, Northwest Natural was also named an Environmental Champion among 140 of the largest utilities in a national study by Cogent.
I am so proud of customers' recognition of our dedication and leadership in this area and extremely proud of our employees.
Now a few items on our water utilities.
As part of our focus to build a healthy, growing water business, we regularly invest in infrastructure improvements, such as pipe replacements, new wells and execute on multi-year plans for larger upgrades.
In 2020, we worked to upgrade technology across our water platform, making it possible to proactively detect and fix issues that caused service interruptions.
To build a culture of safety, we began implementing consistent safety standards and trainings across all locations.
All of this preparation came into play with good results.
In 2020, our water systems experienced no COVID-related service interruptions.
And as I mentioned, our employees in Texas were able to quickly get systems back up and running during the February 2021 winter event.
We're also staying focused on supporting our water utilities with a comprehensive analysis and assistance during rate cases.
In 2020, we filed three rate cases and have already concluded one of those in Idaho.
At the same time, we continue acquiring water utilities and expanding our water family.
I continue to remain very excited about the investment potential and the growth opportunities in this business.
And with that, Nick, I think we're ready to open it up for anybody that has any questions.
","Northwest Natural's Q1 financial performance was solid, with net income per share increasing from $1.58 to $1.94. Key drivers include new rates in Oregon, customer growth, and improved interstate storage business results. The Gas Utility saw higher earnings, partially offset by increased depreciation and expenses. Other businesses benefited from higher asset management revenues and growth in water and wastewater utilities. Cash provided by operating activities increased, and the company maintains a strong balance sheet. Northwest Natural reaffirmed its 2021 earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, expecting continued customer growth and average weather conditions. The company remains committed to environmental stewardship, with a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, and has made progress towards its 30% carbon savings target. Northwest Natural has also been recognized for its high customer satisfaction ratings and water utility investments, including proactive infrastructure improvements and safety enhancements."
AVD_q4_2020.txt,"With that said, let's have our usual cautionary reminder.
Such factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures, and various other risks that are detailed in the Company's SEC reports and filings.
2020 was a year that was fraught with changing demands and conditions, and our people weathered the storm admirably.
We met our critical objective of keeping the workplace safe and healthy for our employees with virtually no work-related transmission.
This, in turn, enabled us to operate continuously, and to serve our customers reliably in all regions.
By comparison, the Top 5 public companies in our sector were on average, flat on both the top and bottom line.
While David will be giving you more detail on this and other aspects of our financial performance, I would like to cover a few highlights.
Over the course of 2020, we committed to improving our balance sheet and I'm pleased to report that we succeeded in doing so.
We generated a nine-fold increase in cash from operations versus the prior year due, in part, from inventory and factory management, controlled operating expenses, and record high customer early pay participation.
This, in turn, enabled us to pay down debt and improve borrowing capacity.
We are able to make these improvements while, at the same time, concluding two key strategic acquisitions; AgNova, for market access in Australia, and Agrinos, a green solutions company.
Further, we defined an environmental, social and governance platform, which includes extremely promising products and technology solutions.
Now, I would like to turn to David for his comments on our financial performance, with the focus on matters of particular interest to our investors.
I will then give you my thoughts on our growth platforms, and a particular focus on green solutions and precision application.
I will then close with my 2021 outlook, and then take questions from our listeners.
With regard to our public filing, we plan to file our Form 10-K for 2020 within the next few days.
As we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries, in which we operate.
As a result, throughout 2020, our customers and suppliers, and our employees and operations have all continued more or less without disruption during the pandemic.
Having said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways including, first, at the start of the year, we experienced a significant devaluation in a few key currencies, specifically, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, and the Australian dollar.
That negative currency effect has started to somewhat reverse as we reached the end of 2020.
Second, the pandemic prevented us from many of our normal infield activities, including face-to-face meetings with distributors, retailers or growers, or activities such as product development and defense.
On the other hand, as you will see in our financial statements, the same restrictions and foreign exchange rate movements have caused us to spend less on operating expenses, including travel.
With regard to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company's net sales increased by 8% to $141 million, as compared to sales of $131 million, this time last year.
Within that overall improvement, our US sales were up 4% to $85 million, and our international sales increased by 15% to $56 million.
International sales accounted for 39% of total sales, as compared to 37% of total sales, this time last year.
The main factor -- factors driving our sales performance are as follows.
In our US crop market, sales increased by approximately 19% as a result of strong sales of products sold into the Midwest row crop market such as, our SmartBox, Counter, and Aztec brands, as growers reacted to increased blood pressure and on to increased commodity pricing for soybeans and corn.
Sales for our domestic non-crop market declined about 45% as a result of lower sales of our deep Dibrom products into vector control districts, primarily as customers worked to address slightly elevated channel inventory levels.
Finally, our international sales grew by 15%.
Approximately half of the improvement is associated with new sales related to the two businesses acquired at the start of the quarter.
The balance of the increase relates to strong sales of our bromacil herbicide, which has a much improved supply position this year and Counter sold into Mexico.
With regard to the underlying market performance of our products, during the quarter, our US crop business recorded increased absolute gross profit, but gross margin percentage declined slightly.
The decline in gross margin percentage was driven primarily by the lower manufacturing activity, which is typical for the Company's fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter non-crop gross margin declined from 42% in Q4 of 2019 to 35% in 2020, driven primarily by the reduced market demand for Dibrom already discussed, and by the lower factory activity rate.
International margins improve with the addition of businesses acquired in the fourth quarter, and strong sales of bromacil, reflecting improved material supply.
Overall, gross margin performance for the final quarter of 2020 was in line with the prior year at 36%.
Operating expenses for the quarter increased by 11% as compared to the same period of the prior year.
This includes the addition of the activities of the two newly acquired businesses, which together accounted for approximately 40% of the increase.
Other increases include, additional marketing expenses, legal expenses, higher cash incentive compensation accruals linked to business performance, and some expense associated with the change in the fair value contingent liabilities associated with an acquisition.
This relates to a business that we purchased out of bankruptcy.
When the opportunity presented itself, we moved quickly and got a great deal.
We engaged outside valuation experts to assist management in the assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired.
The gain we recorded is the difference between the purchase price consideration paid and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Also during the three-month period, we recorded lower interest expense, primarily as a result of lower federal base rates on our loans.
Finally, our effective tax rate was low in the quarter.
There are couple of reasons for this.
First, the bargain purchase, just discussed, is a non-taxable transaction.
And second, we were able to release some reserves associated with uncertain tax positions related to acquisitions we made in both 2017 and 2019.
As a result of these various factors, net income for the three-month period was more than twice the level reported in the same period of 2019.
With regard to the full-year performance, the overall business revenues reduced by about 2% in 2019, as compared to 2019 -- in 2020, as compared to 2019.
We consider that performance to be reasonably aligned with the prior year in a period that has been marked by widespread closure of many businesses during the prolonged period the pandemic.
Within that revenue decline, our US crop business increased by 1% to $223 million in 2020, our US non-crop business sales declined by 21%, to end at $49 million, and our international business remained approximately flat with new business revenue offsetting the effect of foreign exchange rates.
Our 2020 manufacturing performance ended the year very close to our average long-term performance.
As you can see from the chart, net factory costs for the year amounted to approximately 2.8% of sales.
This compares to 2.6% for 2019, and our target of 2.5%.
This says, that despite all the pandemic-related challenges, we were able to maintain our manufacturing activity at relatively normal levels.
For the full year 2020, despite some movements by category, gross margin percentage was in line with 2019, at 38%.
For the full year of 2020, our operating expenses increased by 2%, to end at $154 million, or 33% of sales as compared to $151 million, or 32% of sales last year.
In 2020, we had several dynamics affecting our operating expenses.
These include, pandemic-related reductions in travel activities, the impact of lower FX rates affecting translation to US dollars of operating costs recorded in other currencies, and finally the addition of new businesses acquired in the final quarter of the year.
Our interest expense is down primarily because of federal reserve base rates.
Our tax expense is down primarily because of the bargain purchase gain, which is non-taxable, and the release of reserves in certain tax positions related to prior acquisitions.
In summary, for the full year 2020, when looking at our income statement performance, we have operated close to normal.
Margins have remained very steady, indicating that prices have held up, raw material costs and factory performance has been well managed throughout this year of disruption.
Our operating costs have increased slightly, but do include additional businesses for both the quarter and the year.
We made a good deal to inquire -- to acquire an exciting biologicals business for a bargain price out of [Phonetic] bankruptcy.
And at the bottom line, we've seen a very strong finish to 2020 and reported net income, up 12% compared to 2019.
From my perspective, the operating and financial focus for the Company remains as follows.
We continue to follow a disciplined approach to planning our factory activity, balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels.
As you can see on this slide, we've had a very strong year with respect to cash in 2020.
We generated slightly less from operations when compared to prior year, but have been focused full year on working capital, and this slide shows that has gone very well.
Including working capital, we generated $89 million from operations, which is about nine times what we have achieved on a -- in average for the prior two years.
The cash generated was used principally to two purposes.
First, we invested a total of $36 million, acquiring two businesses, making a strategic equity investment, continuing to develop our manufacturing capability, and advancing our SIMPAS delivery systems.
Secondly, we paid down debt by $43 million.
At the end of December 2020, our inventories were at $164 million.
This includes about $14 million of inventory related to acquisitions completed since late December 2019.
And adjusted or underlying inventory of $152 million is slightly better than the $154 million we indicated during the last call.
With regard to accounts receivable, as I noted earlier, our customers have continued to operate without significant disruption.
They are placing orders for our products, making payments when expected.
Participation in our annual standard early pay program was strong, indicating that our customers -- that the customers we deal with had a good year.
The end result for 2020 resulted in consolidated accounts receivable of $119 million in 2020, as compared to $136 million, this time last year, notwithstanding the higher sales in the fourth quarter.
Consequently, we can report that despite the pandemic, we have not seen any material change in the assessment of our credit risk exposure at the end of 2020 in comparison to the prior year.
With regard to liquidity, as you can see from this chart, we have been constantly working down debt from a high in the first quarter, which is a normal rhythm for the Company, to a low at the end of the year.
At the same time, after a challenging first quarter, which was impacted by the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, our quarterly financials have steadily improved.
There are three factors in the calculation of availability.
The first is our financial performance, which is broadly in line.
The second is the multiplayer under the terms of the credit facility, which is slightly higher this year than last, and accounts for about $15 million increase in availability.
And the third is the level of debt, which accounts for $43 million increase in availability.
Taking all that together, availability at December 31, 2020 is $85 million, as compared to $27 million for the same time last year.
In summary then, in 2020 from a balance sheet cash perspective, we have continued to be acquisitive for the long-term benefit of the Company.
We have carefully managed inventory and accounts receivable and, thereby, working capital, cash and debt.
At the end of the year, we believe we have improved our balance sheet and liquidity, and are well positioned to look at 2021 with a sense of optimism.
With that, I will hand back to Eric.
As you may recall from our earnings call in November last year, I began to turn our attention to our strategic direction and long-term prospects.
In the course of my comments, I described our three platforms for growth, namely, our core business, our green solutions platform, and our precision application technology, led by SIMPAS and Ultimus.
I also gave you a view into how much we think these platforms will grow over the next three years to five years.
Today, I would like to revisit these platforms with a particular focus on how our green solutions and precision application technology, both provide unique and compelling environmental -- what I'll call, ESG, environmental, social and governance solutions, and position us to grow our business at a faster rate than through conventional AgChem offerings.
Let's start with a quick update on our core business.
As I mentioned earlier, in Q4 we closed on the acquisition of AgNova, an Australian-based company, headquartered in Melbourne that sources, develops and distributes specialty crop protection and protection solutions for the agriculture, horticulture and non-crop markets.
The addition of AgNova, improves our market access in the region, including with respect to SIMPAS, Agrinos, and green plant solutions, and gives us greater critical mass in an important territory.
Furthermore, AgNova offers product lines that we can readily market in other regions.
Now let's turn to the other two platforms.
In doing so, it is first necessary to lay the proper groundwork.
I mentioned earlier, we have defined our ESG position.
Public companies, far and wide, are increasingly being called upon by investors such as, BlackRock happens to be our largest shareholders, institutional shareholder services like ISS, and regulators such as the SEC to report upon their commitment to ESG.
We at American Vanguard, have a great story to tell with regard to ESG.
As I take you through our green solutions and precision application technology platforms, you will see this more clearly.
At the close of 2020, we published our statement under the tab ESG on our website.
As we stated on that page, we are committed to the principal of sustainable agriculture, which to us means that all people should have the right to a stable, affordable food supply both now and into the future while, at the same time, maintaining and preferably improving soil health.
As an essential part of that commitment, we seek to promote three equitable considerations, climate, environment and food.
As per our Climate Change Commitment, also on our website, we are committed to making enterprisewide progressive and measurable efforts toward helping to address the trend of global warming.
With respect to environmental quality, we seek to leave the planet in a better state than we founded.
And as a key supplier of crop inputs, we are essentially involved in food equity.
In order to advance these three agendas, a crop input company such as, ourself, would focus on products or application technology that promote carbon sequestration, improve plant and soil health, have an environmentally friendly profile, and improve yield.
As an example, you can see from this slide, courtesy of our greenhouse business, biostimulants can advance all of these considerations.
They reduce carbon dioxide, thus improving air quality, and the climate; improve the yield per acre, making food more affordable; improve food quality, helping growers to succeed; conserve water, advancing environmental equity; and improve the soil's microbial community.
We have many such ESG-friendly products within our green solution platform.
For example, OHP provide several biosolutions to domestic nursery and ornamental customers.
AmGreen and Central America offers a range of tailored biologicals to customers like, Chiquita.
And we continue to see consumer acceptance of our low-impact insecticides from Envance Technologies that are safe for children and pets.
These -- this technology forms the basis of our innovation partnership with Procter & Gamble, specifically, under the Zevo brand of consumer insect control products.
After having achieved success in 2020 with Home Depot and Target, Zevo's 10-store test and Tampa's Walmart stores has exceeded expectations, and will enable the P&G team to aggressively sell to full chain distribution for calendar 2021.
Let me share with you a short video posted on P&G Venture Capital website -- Venture Capital -- Ventures website that positions Zevo.
For any of you who have not tried any of the core Zevo products, I encourage you to go out and purchase them, and give them a try.
In addition to Zevo for household use, we offer Guardian mosquito repellent, and are expanding these solutions into animal health and professional pest control.
At the same time, we are pursuing two novel development platforms.
Under our Maryland [Phonetic] research platform, we are using our patented screening process to discover and create novel insecticide compounds.
This is true R&D effort.
Over the past several months, we have screened over 130,000 active ingredients in our lab, and have identified a manageable number of promising candidates for further development and possible commercialization.
Similarly, under our Envance Technologies' Dragon Fire research platform, we are developing patented bioherbicide products and applications to help us address a global $18 billion market for non-selective herbicides.
These products will feature high efficacy and will give users eco-friendly solutions for weed control.
Between the Maryland research platform and Dragon Fire's bioherbicides, and that technology continues to ring the bell for environmentally responsible solutions.
Now, let's spend a few minutes on Agrinos.
First, let me note that I was very pleased with the fact that we were able to acquire this business at such a reasonable cost, as its parent of foreign holding company in Norway was in liquidation.
From its three operations in US, Mexico and India, Agrinos produces a line of high-yield technology, soil-applied solutions that it markets into eight regions across the globe.
These products promote carbon sequestration, nitrogen fixation and soil health.
Its invigorate line as an [Indecipherable] approved consortium of 22 bacteria that have been developed to promote multiple benefits including, soil -- include improvement of the soil microbial community on many global crops and soil conditions, facilitating nitrogen absorption and nutrient uptake, while supporting root biomass and plant health.
Its uplift products, which are derived from biologically extracted chitin have similar effects.
And their B Sure nutrient solution provides time-released nitrogen, which in turn improve soil health and help to reduce the need for nitrogen laden fertilizers.
With nearly 150 pending and issued patents in multiple countries, Agrinos is proving to be an excellent fit for American Vanguard.
We gained an established product line, considerable IP, and a specialized fermentation and manufacturing infrastructure.
In fact, our initial interest in Agrinos came last year, when we were seeking distribution rights for putting their solutions through SIMPAS.
The opportunity for Agrinos to be part of American Vanguard organization is so much the better.
After having owned the business for only five months, we have already realized a high percentage of the synergies that we had forecasted.
With our global reach, we can now give these products the market access they deserve.
Let's now turn our attention to SIMPAS.
For some time now, we have been reporting on the exciting development and commercialization of our SIMPAS precision application system.
Let me now elaborate on SIMPAS as an ESG technology.
Put simply, SIMPAS is the ideal tool for advancing both climate and environmental equity, and for that reason food equity as well.
With respect to climate, SIMPAS is designed to be far more efficient than single-product application systems.
It can apply multiple inputs at varying rates, only what is needed, precisely where it is needed, in one pass.
In addition, because it applies inputs only where they're called for, as per the agronomic prescription, SIMPAS enables the grower to use potentially far less full rate at his or her field with significantly less water.
Consequently, the growers' environmental footprint is much smaller and the potential for run-off is that much more reduced.
But there is more to the story.
In addition to efficiency and lowering of the environmental input footprint, SIMPAS is designed to apply not only chemical inputs, but also biologicals, the very types of products that we have described as promoting carbon sequestration, nitrogen uptake and soil health.
Even as I speak, we are testing multiple green technology solutions for use in SIMPAS SmartCartridges.
In short, we are supplying not only the product solutions, but also the application technology with which to advance climate and environmental equity.
And the icing on the cake is that with our Ultimus platform, we can trace all inputs from factory to field, and measure how much of each input is used in each area of each field.
This platform also permits the return of empty and partially used SmartCartridges.
So on top of environmentally responsible products and application technology, we offer unrivaled measuring and tracking capability for multiple inputs.
With this functionality, Ultimus is the ideal technology for measuring inputs in order to obtain carbon credits.
While many carbon banks are being formed and multiple sets of rules are being discussed, they all require a means to measure what the grower is adding to the field.
To our knowledge, no technology does this better than Ultimus.
Nor is this just conjecture on our part, in this slide we show the results of an actual SIMPAS 2020 beta system application, in which we demonstrated that we could apply Counter 20G precisely as per agronomists prescription, and its important that we could measure that application after the fact.
This will be a fundamental importance in the carbon credit market.
The picture on the left illustrates the prescription written for a field in North Carolina.
The picture on the right depicts the actual application.
And when we shared this with our SIMPAS growers, they were all very impressed.
Now for an update on SIMPAS systems.
But, we are targeting more systems for this planting season, and we expect or hope that we will get into that 100,000 acre target, which is the target that we set for ourselves.
Now, let me share our latest SIMPAS video that illustrates key advantages.
With that, let me now turn in to our 2021 outlook.
We see an ag industry that is generally optimistic for 2021.
Reopening of schools and businesses following 2020 lockdown, and a potential for less volatile international trade disruptions, promises to refresh ag sector demand.
The increase in crop commodity prices for corns, soybeans, corn and other crops has improved the prospect for grower profitability and, with that, a more normal purchasing pattern versus the very conservative procurement behavior that we witnessed during the 2020 pandemic.
We estimate a low double-digit year-over-year revenue increase for American Vanguard.
We expect profit margins to remain steady with recent history.
And operating expenses will increase somewhat due, in part, to newly acquired businesses, and the SIMPAS launch.
We expect interest expense will be similar to 2020 levels, and our overall tax rate should be in the mid-20% range.
Consequently, we are targeting a significant percentage increase in net income and earnings per share in 2021.
Finally, we are targeting a debt to EBITDA ratio in the 2 times to 2.5 times range.
And note, that at the end of 2020, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times.
With that, we'll take any questions you may have.
","American Vanguard Corporation experienced a strong fourth quarter in 2020, with net sales increasing by 8% to $141 million from $131 million the previous year. The company's US crop sales increased by 19% due to strong demand for products sold into the Midwest row crop market. International sales also grew by 15%, partially attributed to new sales from recently acquired businesses. Overall gross margin remained steady at 36%. Despite pandemic-related challenges, the company managed to maintain manufacturing activity at relatively normal levels, with factory costs amounting to approximately 2.8% of sales. Operating expenses increased slightly due to the addition of new businesses and increased spending on marketing and legal expenses. Despite these increases, the company reported a significant increase in net income for the three-month period, more than twice the level reported in the same period of 2019. For the full year 2020, American Vanguard's business revenues remained relatively stable compared to 2019. The company generated $89 million from operations, which is approximately nine times the average of the prior two years. This cash was used to invest in two businesses, make a strategic equity investment, and pay down debt. The company's balance sheet and liquidity have improved, with an increase in availability at December 31, 2020 to $85 million. American Vanguard is optimistic about 2021, expecting a low double-digit year-over-year revenue increase and a significant percentage increase in net income."

And we hope that you find information and perspective helpful.
We hope you and your families are safe and healthy.
As the world continues to be challenged by the global pandemic, we at Stepan remain committed to doing our part by supporting customers that supply essential, cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products to the market.
We are extremely grateful to our employees for their passion and commitment to get the job done for our customers throughout what was a challenging year.
Overall, COVID opportunities in the consumer product segment of our business outweigh the negative impacts elsewhere and the Company delivered record fourth quarter and full year earnings.
Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $33.1 million or $1.42 per diluted share, up 29% from $25.7 million or $1.10 per diluted share last year.
Adjusted net income for the full year was a record $132 million, up 11% from last year.
For the quarter, surfactant operating income was up significantly on volume growth, which was mostly attributable to continued strong demand for cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products.
Mexican operations delivered strong volume growth versus the prior year quarter.
Our Polymer business was up significantly during the quarter due to the Millsdale insurance recovery.
Our rigid polyol volumes are gradually improving, we had a good fourth quarter and finished strong with double-digit growth, driven by increased demand and customer inventory Brexit-build in Europe.
Our Specialty Product business results were up slightly in the fourth quarter.
Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock of $0.305 per share payable on March 15, 2021.
Stepan has paid higher dividends for 53 consecutive years.
As recently announced, Stepan acquired INVISTA's aromatic polyester polyol business and associated assets.
The acquired business has global sales of approximately $100 million per year.
We are excited to add INVISTA's polyester polyol business and believe that INVISTA's available spare capacity combined with debottlenecking opportunities in both plants will allow Stepan to support future market growth in a capital efficient way.
At this point, I'd like Luis to walk through a few more details about our fourth quarter results.
Let's start with the Slide 5 to recap the quarter.
Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $33.1 million or $1.42 per diluted share, a 29% increase versus $25.7 million or $1.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Specifically, adjustment to reported net income this quarter consist of adjustments for deferred compensation and cash-settled SARs and some minor restructuring expenses.
Adjusted net income for the quarter exclude deferred compensation expense of $2.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to deferred compensation expense of $1.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the same period last year.
Deferred compensation numbers represent the net expense related to the company's deferred compensation plan as well as cash-settled stocks appreciation rights for our employees.
Because these liabilities change with the movement in the stock price, we exclude these items from our operational discussion.
Slide 6 shows the total company earnings bridge for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter and breaks down the increase in adjusted net income.
Because this is net income, the figures noted here are on an after-tax basis.
We will cover each segment in more detail.
But to summarize, Surfactants and Polymers were up significantly, while Specialty Product was slightly up versus the prior year.
Corporate expenses and all others were higher during the quarter due to higher acquisition-related expenses and incentive-based compensation.
The company's full year effective tax rate was 25% in 2020 compared to 18% in 2019.
This year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to non-recurring tax savings in 2019 and a one-time tax cost in Q4 2020 due to a cash repatriation project as part of the INVISTA acquisition.
Less favorable geographical mix of income in 2020 versus 2019 also impacted effective tax rate.
We expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 27%.
Slide 7 focus on Surfactant segment results for the quarter.
Surfactant net sales were $358 million, a 16% increase versus the prior year.
Sales volume increased 8%, mostly due to higher demand for products sold into the consumer product end markets, driven by increased amount for cleaning, disinfection and personal wash product due to COVID-19.
Higher sales volume to our Tier 2, Tier 3 customers also contributed to this increase.
This growth was partially offset by lower demand in agricultural and oilfield markets.
Selling prices were up 11% and the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by 3%.
The higher selling prices primarily reflect improved product and customer mix.
Surfactant -- Surfactants operating income increased $9.4 million or 28% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong sales volume growth and a $3 million insurance recovery related to the first quarter Millsdale power outage.
North America results increased primarily due to strong demand in the consumer product end market and a better product and customer mix.
Brazil had a record quarter driven by strong volume growth.
Lower Mexico results were due to a high base period with insurance payment in December 2019, although Mexico volume was up 31%.
Europe results increased slightly due to higher consumer product demand.
Now turning to Polymers on Slide 8.
Net sales were $116.7 million in the quarter, in line with the prior year.
Sales volume increased 7%, primarily due to double-digit growth in global rigid volumes, lower PA demand partially offset the above growth.
Selling prices declined 8% and foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by 1%.
The Polymer operating increased $11.4 million or 100% versus the prior year, the $10 million insurance recovery and the positive impact of volume growth.
All regions did well during the quarter.
North America polyol results increased due to higher volumes and margins, reflecting a gradual improvement in market conditions.
Europe results increased due to double-digit volume growth in both rigid and specialty polyol, while Asia and Latin America results increased slightly versus prior year.
Specialty Product net sales were $19.6 million for the quarter, a 6% increase versus the prior year.
Sales volume was down 1% between quarters and operating income improved 2%.
Turning to Slide 9.
Despite significant challenge during the year, including the global pandemic and the first quarter 2020 planned power outage at our Millsdale facility, the company delivered record full year results.
Adjusted net income was a record $132 million or $5.68 per diluted share versus $119.4 million or $5.12 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 11%.
The Surfactant segment delivered record operating income of $169 million, up 38% versus prior year.
This earnings growth was driven by a 6% increase in global volume due to higher demand for cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products as a result of COVID-19 and a significantly better product and customer mix.
The Polymer segment delivered $68 million of operating income, almost flat versus prior year despite the negative impact of COVID-19.
Global Polymer sales volume was down 5% as a result of lower demand within the PA business.
Global rigid polyols volumes were slightly down for the year due to construction project delays and cancellations due to COVID-19.
Specialty Product operating income was $14 million, down slightly from the prior year when we grew significantly versus 2018 actuals.
Slide 10 shows the total company earnings bridge for the full year 2020 compared to last year and breaks down the increase in adjusted net income.
The figures noted here are on an after-tax basis.
Surfactant was up significantly, while Polymer and Specialty Products were down slightly versus the prior year.
Moving on to Slide 11.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
We had negative net debt at year-end as our cash balance of $350 million exceeded total debt of $199 million.
The company had full year capital expenditure of $126 million and we are returning $41 million to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
This strong balance sheet allow us to execute the INVISTA acquisition in January 2021.
Beginning on Slide 13, Quinn will now update you on our 2021 strategic priorities.
As we wrap up a challenging but rewarding 2020, we continue to believe that Stepan's business remains better positioned to perform than most as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter and full year 2020.
We continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees as we deliver products that contribute to the fight against COVID-19.
Our EPA approved biocidal formulations to kill the specific novel virus that causes COVID-19 and allow our customers to provide the public with additional tools to protect their families and fight the pandemic.
We believe Surfactant volume and consumer product end markets should remain strong as a result of changing consumer habits and increased use of disinfection, cleaning and personal wash products.
We are increasing capacity in certain product lines, including biocides and amphoterics to ensure we can meet our customers' higher requirements.
We are increasing North American capability and capacity to make low 1,4-dioxane surfactants.
As explained in our previous calls, recent regulations passed in New York will require reduced levels of 1,4-dioxane in a number of consumer products by January 1, 2023.
1,4-dioxane is a minor by-product generated in the manufacture of ether sulfate surfactants which are key ingredients in consumer products.
Through a combination of process optimization and additional manufacturing equipment, Stepan will be prepared to supply customers ether sulfates that meet the new regulatory requirements.
This project is the driver of our increased capex forecast for 2021 of $150 million to $170 million.
We are working with our customers to ensure these projects deliver our financial return targets.
Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers continue to be the center of our strategy.
We grew Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume by 28% in the fourth quarter and added 405 new customers.
Our diversification strategy into functional products continues to be a priority for Stepan.
During the fourth quarter, despite a slight volume decrease, our agricultural business grew in terms of profitability due to a favorable product mix.
We have introduced many new products to the agricultural market and will continue to invest in new capacity and capabilities to support growth in the agricultural market.
Oilfield volume was down due to overall challenges in the industry.
We remain optimistic about future opportunities in this business as oil prices have recovered through the $60 per barrel levels.
Polymers had a challenging year given the availability of labor on construction projects and the need for social distancing.
However, the long-term prospects for our polyol business remain attractive as energy conservation efforts and a more stringent building codes should increase demand.
The Illinois Rock -- River lock closure was completed on schedule during the quarter, which ended the premium logistic cost associated with the business.
We remain fully committed to delivering productivity gains across Stepan.
We delayed our project at Millsdale to allow the team to focus on COVID-19-related market opportunities.
Work on the project will continue this year and we expect to see benefits in 2020 and beyond.
M&A represents an important tool as a means to delivering meaningful EBITDA growth and margin improvement.
We are excited about the company's recent acquisition of INVISTA's aromatic polyester polyol business.
This is our largest acquisition to-date and will allow us to continue our journey to create a more specialized higher margin chemical company.
The transaction included two manufacturing sites, intellectual property, customer relationships, inventory and working capital.
The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.
We are putting our cash to work.
The acquired business has global sales of approximately $100 million.
The acquisition cost was $165 million plus working capital and is expected to be slightly accretive to Stepan's earnings per share and EBITDA margins in 2021.
The company expects the multiple on a post-synergy basis to be between 6.5 and 7.5 times.
We expect to deliver full year run rate synergies within two years.
This acquisition will allow us to support market growth for the next decade in a capitally efficient way through available spare capacity as well as debottlenecking opportunities in both plants.
The two additional locations also significantly enhanced business continuity for our customers.
The previously referenced multiples exclude the benefit of extra capacity acquired.
The company also announced the acquisition of a fermentation plant in Lake Providence, Louisiana.
Fermentation is a new platform technology for Stepan.
As we look to commercialize the next generation of surfactants, biosurfactants produced via fermentation are attractive due to their favorable biodegradability, low toxicity and in some cases unique antimicrobial properties.
This goes hand in hand with our previous NatSurFact rhamnolipid acquisition in 2020.
This technology provides an important new option as customers across markets seek to achieve greater sustainability advantages within their products.
The acquired plant will require additional investment to make our targeted products, but the site will provide world scale capabilities to support incorporation of new biosurfactants in agricultural and consumer products.
Given the strength of our balance sheet, we will continue to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities to fill gaps in our portfolio and to add new platform chemistries.
Finally, 2020 was a difficult but rewarding year as our team responded to challenges and delivered on opportunities, particularly in our Surfactants business.
We believe the long-term prospects for rigid polyols remains attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes should increase demand.
We believe our acquisition of INVISTA's aromatic polyester polyol business and two manufacturing sites position us better to meet long-term demand growth.
We anticipate our Specialty Product business results will improve slightly year-over-year.
In conclusion, we remain optimistic that we will continue to deliver value to you, our shareholders in the new year.
Tina, please review the instructions for the question portion of today's call.
","Despite the global pandemic, Stepan Company delivered record full year earnings, driven by strong demand for cleaning, disinfection, and personal wash products in the consumer segment. Fourth quarter adjusted net income rose 29% year-over-year to $33.1 million, with diluted earnings per share increasing to $1.42. Surfactant segment operating income surged 28%, while Polymer segment also saw growth, largely due to an insurance recovery. Specialty Product operating income remained steady. For the full year, adjusted net income reached $132 million, an 11% increase from 2019. Stepan's strong balance sheet enabled the acquisition of INVISTA's aromatic polyester polyol business, expected to slightly boost earnings and EBITDA margins. Additionally, the company acquired a fermentation plant to develop new biosurfactants with enhanced sustainability features. Stepan remains optimistic about its future prospects, focusing on meeting increased demand in consumer products, expanding capacity, and pursuing strategic acquisitions."
AAN_q4_2020.txt,"For those of you that have not, it is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.
Actual results in the future may be materially different than those discussed here.
This could be due to a variety of factors including, among other things, uncertainties associated with the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related impact on the economy and supply chain.
The company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful insight into the company's operational performance and cash flows, and provides these measures to investors to help facilitate comparisons of operating results with prior periods and to assist them in understanding the company's ongoing operational performance.
For the month of December, 2020, our results represent the consolidated statements of the company and its subsidiaries, and is based on the financial position and results of operations as a stand-alone company.
For all periods prior to December 1st 2020, combined financial statements include all revenue and cost directly attributable to the company and an allocation of expenses from our former parent related to certain corporate functions and actions.
First, let me take a moment to recognize all of our talented team members for their determination and commitment in 2020, which enabled Aaron's to accelerate our key strategic priorities in a very challenging year.
Our fantastic team members at our stores, distribution and service centers, Woodhaven manufacturing and store support center worked tirelessly to provide products and services to our customers, while accelerating our digital and real estate transformation.
We overcame the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers and safeguarding our team members.
At the same time, we delivered annual revenues that exceeded our expectations for the year and an adjusted EBITDA that was higher than we've generated in several years.
In addition, during the year, our team has worked diligently to establish Aaron's as a new stand-alone publicly traded company.
The spin-off transaction closed on November 30th 2020.
And following the spin, we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flow profile to execute on our go-forward strategy.
While some uncertainty remains regarding how the Corona virus may impact the economy or consumer behavior, I'm more energized and optimistic about our future than ever.
Our business has never been more nimble, and we continue to make investments in technology, decisioning, e-commerce and store operations that are yielding higher productivity and lease portfolio performance.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, same-store revenues rose 3.4% as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong customer payment activity, improving lease portfolio size and higher retail sales.
The fourth quarter was the sixth out of the last eight quarters with positive same-store comps, with 2020 representing the first annual positive same-store revenue growth since 2013.
Additionally, we ended 2020 with a larger and healthier lease portfolio than we had at the beginning of the year.
The larger portfolio size is a result of better collections, fewer product returns and lower write-offs, which was enabled by improvements in operational execution, the roll-out of centralized decisioning technology and enhancements to our customer payments platform.
We achieved this larger portfolio despite revenue written into the portfolio that was flat in the fourth quarter.
Recall that our implementation of decisioning technology in the second quarter of 2020 effectively reduced new lease originations and therefore, revenue written by 6% to 8%.
Moving to our e-commerce channel.
Revenues grew 39% in the quarter and represented approximately 13% of total lease revenues compared to 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter, e-commerce traffic was up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Despite the significant increase in traffic at aarons.com, e-commerce recurring revenue written into the portfolio declined 1.2% as compared to last year's fourth quarter, due to both decisioning optimization and lower conversion of traffic.
Conversion is not what we would expect it to be due to the inventory shortages resulting from the global supply chain disruption.
However, our inventory position continues to modestly improve in the first quarter of 2021, which should lead to higher conversion rates.
I'm encouraged by the progress of our e-commerce initiatives, including our evolving analytics and digital capabilities.
Improvements in online customer acquisition, conversion and decisioning are leading to margin growth and continued positive momentum in this important channel.
In 2020, we also accelerated our strategy to consolidate, remodel and reposition our store footprint with our new GenNext store concept, which includes enhanced shared rooms, digital technologies, expanded product assortment and improved brand imaging.
As of the end of the year, we had 47 GenNext stores opened and have more than 60 additional stores in the 2021 pipeline.
Our GenNext stores are performing well, delivering new lease volumes that are higher than the corporate averages and in line with our expectations.
While the new stores still represent a small portion of our overall store count, we believe over time the execution of our GenNext store strategy will provide meaningful lift to our overall performance.
Overall, I'm pleased with our full year of 2020 and fourth quarter results.
And I'm encouraged about the future and our new chapter as a financially strong stand-alone public company.
As we look to 2021, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives of simplifying and digitizing the customer experience, aligning our store footprint to our customer opportunity and promoting the Aaron's value proposition of low payments, high approval rates and best-in-class service.
For the full year 2020, consolidated revenues were $1.735 billion, a decline of 2.8% compared to the full year 2019.
This decline is primarily the result of a reduction of 253 company-operated stores in 2019 and 2020 partially offset by a 1.8% increase in same-store revenues for the year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2020 was $208.9 million, an increase of $43.6 million or 26.4% compared to the full year of 2019.
As a percentage of revenues, adjusted EBITDA was 12% compared to 9.3%, an increase of 270 basis points over the prior year.
This increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to an improvement in customer payment activity, fewer lease merchandise returns and efficiencies in store operations, including pandemic-related staffing reductions in the second and third quarters of 2020.
Write-offs were 4.2% of lease revenues in 2020, a 200 basis point improvement over 2019.
Annual non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.02 in 2020, an increase of 43.8% compared to $2.10 for prior year 2019.
Turning to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Revenues were $430 million, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the same quarter last year, despite the closure, consolidation and acquisition of a net 75 company-owned locations throughout the year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $53.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to $51.2 million for the same period of 2019, an increase of $2.5 million or 4.8%.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.5% of revenues compared to 11.8% in the same period a year ago, an increase of 70 basis points.
The improvement in Q4 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the reduction in inventory write-offs, partially offset by comping over the impact of one-time benefits realized in the fourth quarter of the prior year period.
These one-time items in 2019, related primarily to gains from real estate sale and leaseback transactions and other miscellaneous items.
Excluding these one-time items from 2019, adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 would have improved approximately 250 basis points.
Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter increased 11.3% to $0.79 versus $0.71 in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the continuing strength of customer payment activity and reduced lease merchandise write-offs.
Operating expenses were down $1.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to an $11.7 million reduction in write-offs, offset primarily by an increase in advertising spend and the previously mentioned benefit of real estate transactions that took place in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company's store labor expense increased compared to the second and third quarters, during which labor expenses were lower due to pandemic-related store closures and furloughs.
Write-offs in the fourth quarter were 4.3%, down 300 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter, due primarily to the implementation of our new decisioning technology, improved operations and the benefit of government stimulus.
Cash generated from operating activities was $355.8 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020.
Cash from operating activities grew $169.8 million year-over-year, primarily due to improved lease portfolio performance, lower inventory purchases and one-time tax benefits resulting from the CARES Act, partially offset by other changes in working capital.
At the end of the year, the company had a cash balance of $76.1 million and less than $1 million of debt.
In addition, concurrent with completing the spin-off transaction of November 30th, the company entered into a $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at the end of 2020, giving the company more than $300 million of liquidity as of year-end.
Before I review our outlook for 2021, I want to remind you all that in November, prior to completing the spin-off transaction, the legacy combined company accelerated the payment of its regular quarterly cash dividend, which would normally have been paid in January 2021.
Turning to our 2021 outlook.
We currently expect total revenues in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million, representing an increase in the midpoint of our outlook as compared to the preliminary outlook we provided in November.
As it relates to the seasonality of our financial results, we expect that both revenues and earnings will be somewhat higher in the first six months of 2021 compared to the second six months of 2021.
Free cash flows, which we define as operating cash flows of less capital expenditures, are expected to be $80 million to $90 million.
Capital expenditures are also expected to be between $80 million and $90 million for the year.
This outlook assumes a few key items we want to highlight.
First, no significant deterioration in the current retail environment or in the state of the U.S. economy as compared to its current condition.
Second, a gradual improvement in global supply chain conditions.
And finally, no incremental government stimulus or supplemental unemployment benefits.
To summarize, 2020 was a successful year for Aaron's, despite the many challenges our team members and customers faced.
To echo Douglas's earlier comments, I am encouraged by the opportunity ahead of us.
The unique nature of Aaron's recurring revenue business model combined with our strong balance sheet, cash flows and operating leverage enables us to perform well during this period of uncertainty.
","Aaron's reported a successful 2020 despite challenges, with a 2.8% decline in revenues to $1.735 billion due to store closures and a 26.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $208.9 million. The fourth quarter saw a 1% revenue decline to $430 million but a 4.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $53.7 million, driven by reduced inventory write-offs and improved customer payment activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 70 basis points to 12.5%, primarily due to lower write-offs. The company ended the year with a healthy lease portfolio, a cash balance of $76.1 million, and over $300 million in liquidity. Aaron's projects 2021 revenues of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $155 million to $170 million, assuming gradual supply chain improvements and no significant economic deterioration. The company's strong balance sheet, cash flows, and operating leverage will enable it to perform well during this period of uncertainty."
NNN_q4_2020.txt,"Before discussing the details of this past year, I want to once again offer my sincere gratitude to all the associates at National Retail Properties for their hard work, perseverance, flexibility, collegiality, professionalism and dedication in 2020.
I could not be prouder of how this talented team worked tirelessly to create shareholder value and support each other during this past crazy year.
As I've said before, perhaps the best word to describe National Retail Properties is consistent: consistent investment focus on single-tenant retail properties; consistency of people and culture; consistently raising the dividend for 31 consecutive years; consistent conservative balance sheet philosophy that maintains flexibility and dry powder; consistent long-term tenant relationships.
And although our long-term track record of consistent per-share growth was disrupted in 2020 due to the pandemic, we remain committed to our multiyear business plan.
Highlights for National Retail Properties in 2020 include: increasing the common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year, a feat matched by only two other REITs and by less than 1% of all U.S. public companies; raising $700 million of well-priced debt capital early in the year, which put us in a strong liquidity position as the pandemic began to spread and enabled us to end 2020 with $267 million of cash in the bank and nothing drawn on our $900 million line of credit; reaching collaborative rent deferral agreements during the early stages of the pandemic with a number of our relationship tenants, which solidified our relationships and set us up for future acquisition business; collecting 95.7% of our rents due for the fourth quarter and 89.7% of our annual base rent for the year 2020; supporting our associates and our community with programs and activities to advance associate well-being, employee engagement and community involvement; and lastly, enhancing our executive leadership team with the appointment of Steve Horn, a 17-year veteran with the company, as our Chief Operating Officer.
Let me now turn to some details about our fourth quarter and 2020.
As highlighted above, our rent collections continued to trend positive during the quarter, resulting in collections of 95.7% of fourth quarter rents.
For the year 2020, we collected just under 90% of rents due for the year.
And for the month of January 2021, we have collected approximately 95% of the rents due for the month.
These collection numbers compare very favorably with other retail real estate companies and are similar to the reported rent collections by companies with a significantly higher percentage of investment-grade retail tenants.
I'd also like to highlight that we forgave zero rent in the fourth quarter and only forgave less than 0.5% of our annual rents for the entire year.
Consistent with our long-term practice and multiyear business model, we do not anticipate reporting monthly rent collections in 2021.
Notwithstanding the impact of the pandemic, our broadly diversified portfolio of 3,143 single-tenant retail properties ended the year with an occupancy rate of 98.5%, which continues to exceed our long-term average of 98%.
Our high lease renewal rate also continued in 2020.
Approximately 80% of our expiring leases were renewed by the current tenants at approximately 100% of the expiring rent without material investment of lease incentive or tenant improvement dollars and with an average lease renewal term of over six years.
In our opinion, this impressive statistic validates the high demand for our well-located real estate sites.
A reminder that our tenants are typically large, well-capitalized, regional and national operators with the scale, financial wherewithal and management expertise to weather significant disruptions in the business environment.
Additionally, the majority of our properties are located in suburban markets, largely in the southern half of the United States, which have been somewhat less impacted by the pandemic than urban city centers.
We're pleased to see that many of our tenants' businesses are bouncing back more quickly than we had initially anticipated.
And as our relationship tenants return to growth mode in the fourth quarter, we ramped up our acquisition activities as well.
During the fourth quarter, we invested $102 million in 42 new single-tenant retail properties at an initial cash yield of 6.2% and at an average lease duration of 20 years.
For the year 2020, we invested a total of $180 million in 63 new properties at a weighted average initial cash yield of just under 6.5% and with an average lease duration of over 18 years.
An important strategic advantage of our business model is the long lease durations we achieve through our focus on sale leasebacks with our relationship tenants.
We also had an active fourth quarter of dispositions, selling 13 properties for $12 million.
And for the year 2020, we sold 38 properties, raising over $54 million of capital to be redeployed into our business.
Our balance sheet remains strong.
We ended the year with $267 million of cash in the bank and zero balance drawn on our $900 million line of credit.
Kevin will provide more details on the $120 million of equity capital we raised in 2020 via our ATM.
As we enter 2021, we're well positioned to take advantage of the right opportunities when they present themselves and/or weather further choppiness in the economy if that may occur.
Consistent with our long-term focus and culture, we approached guidance with a conservative mindset.
Although our portfolio continues to perform well and our relationship tenants are returning to growth mode, the pandemic is not yet behind us, and there may be additional turmoil in the economy ahead.
Kevin will review the details of our guidance in his remarks.
Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, you should expect us to continue to adhere to the core strategic drivers of National Retail Properties' long-term success, including: first, a consistent focus on single-tenant net leased retail properties.
The real estate attributes of single-tenant retail properties are far superior to the attributes of other property types, and the universe of opportunities to acquire these properties remains vast.
Second, a broadly diversified portfolio of single-tenant retail properties that generates a stable, growing cash flow from long-term leases.
As noted above, our tenants are primarily large regional and national operators in lines of trade that provide customer services and e-commerce-resistant consumer necessities.
Third, a fortress-like balance sheet that provides us with the capability to withstand economic turbulence and positions us to be able to continue our long history of consecutive annual dividend increases.
Fourth, a relationship-oriented acquisition model that results in high-quality investments.
Our proprietary tenant relationships allow us to obtain higher investment yields, superior lease documents, longer lease duration and better quality real estate.
Fifth, an active asset management that focuses on maximizing the value of each individual property.
Our deep real estate expertise enables us to get the most out of our portfolio and to recycle capital through thoughtful, disciplined dispositions.
And last, but not least, a commitment to ESG, including a deep commitment to our team of great people in a supportive culture, which is the true backbone of our success.
Almost 3/4 of our associates have been with the company for at least five years, and approximately half have been with us for 10 years or more.
The executive leadership team averages almost two decades of tenure at the company.
That level of commitment to culture and institutional knowledge is invaluable.
We believe that as we continue to execute on these strategic drivers in the post-pandemic world, we will consistently deliver core FFO per share growth and outperform REIT averages on a multiyear basis.
That's up $0.01 from the preceding third quarter's $0.62.
And AFFO per share was $0.69 per share for the fourth quarter, which is $0.07 per share higher than the preceding third quarter's $0.62.
Additionally, we recognized $2.5 million of deferred rent repayment that was repaid in the fourth quarter and was included in calculating AFFO.
As Jay noted, occupancy was 98.5% at quarter end, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter.
G&A expense for the fourth quarter was 5.7% of revenues and -- for the fourth quarter and then 5.8% for the full year 2020, which is fairly flat with 2019's G&A levels.
Rent collections, as Jay noted, continue to improve throughout the fourth quarter.
Today, we reported rent collections of approximately 95.7% for the fourth quarter and 95% for the month of January 2021.
So we have seen steady incremental improvement on the rent collections front over the past eight months.
To be clear, these rent collection percentages are for the regular original rent owed for those respective periods, meaning that it does not include collections of previously deferred rent.
In the fourth quarter, we also collected, as I mentioned, $2.5 million of rent that was previously deferred, which represented approximately 100% of the deferred rent repayment that was due in the fourth quarter of 2020.
As we've previously noted as well, the majority of deferred rent is due in 2021, and the very early indications suggest good collection results for those deferred rents.
We have included on page 22 of today's supplemental, which is on our website, some disclosure on the amounts and timing of the anticipated repayment of deferred rent over the next couple of years.
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $50 million or about 7.4% of our annual base rent being recognized on a cash basis as a result of our estimation that it was not probable these tenants were going to pay substantially all of their remaining lease payments.
So this classification required us to write off all outstanding receivable balances for these tenants, which in the fourth quarter was $2 million of rent receivables and $5 million of accrued rent balances totaling $7 million or approximately $0.04 per share for the fourth quarter.
So without this noncash write-off, FFO results would have been notably better.
However, please note that despite this GAAP accounting write-off, we will be pursuing these receivables and ongoing rent payment with the usual vigor.
Rent receivables from cash-basis tenants totaled approximately $10 million as of December 31.
Again, these receivables are not reflected on our balance sheet.
Now over to receivables that are on our balance sheet.
First, rent receivables of $4.3 million were -- was fairly flat with September 30 levels and now very much in line with our pre-pandemic rent receivable levels of $3 million to $4 million.
These rent receivables include a general reserve of 16% or $835,000 at December 31.
Secondly, accrued rental income receivables decreased slightly to $54 million and had a general reserve of 11% or $6.9 million at December 31.
In the fourth quarter, we collected $2.5 million of previously deferred rent, which would -- reduces the accrued rental income receivable.
This collection of previously deferred rent is excluded from GAAP earnings, FFO and core FFO results.
We did note that -- what AFFO would have been if we had excluded the pandemic-related accrued rent, both via deferral and the subsequent repayment.
We have currently less than 1% of our annual base rent coming from tenants in bankruptcy, and that primarily consists of Ruby Tuesday today.
I will note, Chuck E. Cheese exited bankruptcy during the fourth quarter.
And while we agreed to a 25% rent reduction for 15 months ending December 2021, none of our 53 leases were rejected in bankruptcy.
As Jay noted, today, we initiated 2021 core FFO per share guidance of $2.55 to $2.62 per share.
While our rent collections materially improved throughout 2020, compared to many previous years, we have assumed there would be some continued uncertainty in this variable going forward into 2021.
$50 million of our $675 million of total annual base rent as of 12/31/2020.
We've assumed these cash-basis tenants pay 50% of the rent due in 2021 in our guidance, and that's relatively consistent with what they've been paying in recent months.
Additionally, on top of this, we have assumed 2% rent loss from the remainder of our annual base rent, which equates to about $12 million or $13 million in rent.
This rent loss or vacancy estimate is not made with any particular tenant concerns and on its face feels like a conservative assumption, meaning the actual rent loss could be better than guidance.
But given this is our first issuance of guidance in this pandemic, it seemed prudent to be more conservative than not.
And those of us -- those of you who have known us for the past 25 years are probably not too surprised by that approach.
We ended the fourth quarter with $267 million of cash on hand and no amounts outstanding on our $900 million bank credit facility.
We did not draw down our bank line as many companies did in 2020.
We raised $60 million of equity in the fourth quarter at just over $40 per share.
Our next debt maturity is in April 2023.
It's $350 million with a 3.3% coupon.
So we're in a very good liquidity position.
Our weighted average debt maturity is now 10.2 years with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%.
So the balance sheet and our leverage profile remains very strong.
A couple of numbers.
Net debt to gross book assets was 34.4%.
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.0 times.
Interest coverage was 4.5 times and fixed charge 4.0 times for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Only five of our 3,000-plus properties are encumbered by mortgages totaling only $11.4 million.
So 2021 seems the beginning of where 2020 left off with sustained rent collection levels and incremental improvement in tenant health, which allows us to continue to shift to a more offensive posture.
As our focus remains on the long term, we will continue to endeavor to give NNN the best opportunity to succeed in the coming years.
And Matthew, with that, we will open it up to any questions.
","2020 marked the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases for National Retail Properties (NNP), a rare feat among U.S. public companies. Despite the pandemic's impact, NNP maintained a high occupancy rate of 98.5%, collected 95.7% of rents due in Q4, and has been actively acquiring new properties with a focus on long-term leases. NNP's balance sheet remains strong, with $267 million in cash and zero debt drawn on its $900 million line of credit. For 2021, NNP projects core FFO per share of $2.55 to $2.62, reflecting continued rent collection improvements and a conservative outlook amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The company plans to continue its long-term strategy, emphasizing single-tenant retail properties, a diversified portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and relationship-oriented acquisitions. NNP's consistent focus on these drivers has positioned it to outperform REIT averages on a multiyear basis."
BAH_q3_2022.txt,"I'm Laura Adams, chief accounting officer and interim head of investor relations.
And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our president and chief executive officer; and Lloyd Howell, executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer.
During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors.
We are now on Slide 4.
Today, Lloyd and I will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi-year investment thesis.
We will also describe the underlying dynamics of our business and the progress we are making on our VoLT strategy.
To set the context, let's go back to our October Investor Day, where we outlined our VoLT strategy and associated financial goals.
As a reminder, VoLT stands for velocity, leadership, and technology.
It is a strategic program Booz Allen has launched to capitalize on our first mover advantage in helping the federal government transform core missions through the use of new technologies.
Over the next few years, we look to grow faster by building scaled positions in critical areas such as national cyber and digital battlespace.
We are in the early stages of this journey, but are already making strides and seeing strong progress.
As part of VoLT, we have set new multi-year financial goals that deliver both strong profit growth and continued investment in our business.
Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025.
That's approximately a 50% increase.
We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions.
Our expectations for fiscal year 2022 were consistent with these goals.
Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30.
We also said this fiscal year growth pattern would look different from recent years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half.
Our revenue growth in the third quarter was lighter than we expected.
And while we forecast strong fourth quarter revenue growth, we're lowering our full fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook to account for a slower pace.
Lloyd will take you through the quarter results and our updated guidance in greater depth.
There were several factors that contributed to the revenue dynamics for the quarter.
On the positive side, we continue to win the right kind of work and hire the right people, as reflected in our backlog growth and headcount increases over the last 12 months.
Conversely, the translation of those positives into revenue growth was slower than historical standards, driven by a number of factors, including a protracted continuing resolution; a higher dollar value of awards under protest; delayed awards and slower ramp-up on sold contracts; lower staff productivity due in large part to the omicron variant surging during the quarter; and lower-than-anticipated billable expenses.
These dynamics impacted our entire portfolio and some pockets of our defense business were especially hard hit due in part to the number of large awards delayed and a greater proportion of billable expenses in their revenue base.
Looking ahead, we see some of these challenging dynamics continuing into the coming months.
As a result, we are taking a three-pronged approach to proactively manage through this environment.
First, we are addressing those business areas where we see the greatest funding uncertainty.
Second, we are continuing to control costs in order to deliver on our commitments to both grow adjusted EBITDA and invest in our business.
And third, we are doubling down on areas of significant growth opportunity shifting resources across the portfolio by leveraging our unique operating model and single P&L.
In short, we continue to lean into growth while managing tightly in the face of greater market volatility.
Before turning the call over to Lloyd, let me return to the longer-term outlook and the progress we have made in our business so far.
As we look ahead, we remain on track to deliver strong growth in adjusted EBITDA through fiscal year 2025, supported by continued revenue growth, stable adjusted EBITDA margins, and strategic deployment of capital.
Our confidence in the future is predicated in our belief that we have the right strategy and the proven ability to execute in both good times and challenging ones.
And several accomplishments from the last few months underscore these points.
First, we continue to win the right kind of work at the center of national priorities where innovation can help the government transform the way the mission is executed.
Our clients from the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Air Force are looking to Booz Allen for expertise in areas such as DevSecOps, AI, and the commercialization of new technologies to advance their missions.
Second, we are making key investments that differentiate our service to clients.
For example, last December, as part of our ramp-up on national cyber, we announced the opening of our carrier-grade 5G lab in Central Maryland.
The lab offers a state-of-the-art testing environment for secure, cyber-resilient 5G solutions.
Similarly, as we advance our work on digital battlespace, we are significantly expanding our footprint in Honolulu.
This investment deploys into the INDOPACOM region some of our most advanced capabilities to expand our support of several high-priority client missions.
Third, we are successfully using acquisitions as strategic accelerators.
Liberty and Tracepoint continue to deliver the strategic and financial value we expected.
Integration is going well, and we are extremely pleased with the upside these acquisitions create.
And in addition, we continue to build our acquisition pipeline.
And fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to strengthen our team and ensure we have the focus and resiliency to support our clients as they too manage through a volatile environment.
I am extremely proud of our workforce for achieving complete compliance with our COVID vaccination requirement.
Our purpose and values are at the core of everything we do, so we believe that prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees is the right thing to do for our institution, our clients, and our communities.
Furthermore, a fully vaccinated workforce allows us to better serve our clients, supports safer in-person collaboration, and is critical to entering a post-pandemic phase.
Together, always together, the people of Booz Allen are forging ahead with relentless focus on our clients' missions and our growth strategy.
This is what delivers the consistent results that create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I'll give the floor to Lloyd for more details on the third quarter, the fiscal year and our investment thesis.
Lloyd, over to you.
As we near the end of fiscal year 2022, a year marked by many twists and turns, we have continued to build on our underlying fundamentals, which have supported our expectations for second half performance outpacing first half.
And while top line growth and cash did not deliver at the levels we anticipated, we are delivering the bottom line results we need to invest in our business and our people to achieve our long-term growth initiatives.
With three quarters now completed and greater visibility into the fourth quarter, we are seeing some transitory changes at the macro level that are impacting overall market performance.
Expanding on what Horacio said, just as we believe that we were turning the corner on the pandemic's impacts and reverting to more predictable business patterns, we were hit by omicron, which led to another spike in PTO, resulting in staff utilization rates not normalizing as we had anticipated.
This, coupled with an overhang effect from the continuing resolution, has impacted our ability to convert strong demand into top line growth.
We factored some of this uncertainty into our 2022 fiscal year guidance, but we did not fully anticipate the impact of the second wave on utilization, nor did we foresee the delays in translating wins into revenue generation.
I will get into more detail shortly when I give updated guidance.
At the top line, revenue increased 6.6% year over year to $2 billion, which includes approximately $117 million from inorganic contributions.
Revenue, excluding billable expenses, grew 6.2% year over year to $1.4 billion.
Revenue growth was slower this quarter for the following three reasons: first, funding delays resulting in slower ramp on new work and existing work; second, lower staff utilization resulting from an uptick in PTO taken over the holiday period, due in part to a rise in COVID cases and the inclusion of the New Year's Eve holiday in this quarter's results.
And third, billable expenses continued to be pressured by slower travel patterns and the timing of material purchases getting pushed to the right.
Taken together, these factors are largely timing issues that we believe will dissipate as we return to more normal business rhythms.
Now let me walk through the market level performance.
Revenue declined by 2.2% year over year and has been trending down quarter over quarter.
Since defense is roughly 50% of our business portfolio and largely comprised of cost reimbursable work, the macro factors and subsequent top line impacts I noted were especially impactful in this market.
More specifically, to expand on what Horacio said, our Army account was hit the hardest by some of these dynamics, where our performance was impacted by budgetary challenges, slowness, and ramp-ups, and some losses.
Going forward, our defense leadership is doubling down on addressing these issues by growing headcount, managing utilization, and aggressively deploying talent to capture the highest value opportunities, including hyper growth initiatives such as our digital battlespace platform.
In civil, revenue grew by 25.3% year over year, of which 5.1% was organic, marking our second consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth.
Our results reflect solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in health, where we see strong alignment with the administration's priorities, which are yielding important wins.
Additionally, Liberty continues to strengthen our unique market position as we prepare to leverage integrated capabilities in the areas of cloud, DevSecOps, and API development to pursue additional market share across our broader portfolio.
In Intelligence, we recorded our second consecutive quarter of growth at 0.8% year over year.
This continued improvement in performance reflects our ability to hire ahead of growing demand and capitalize on our mission expertise and advanced technological offerings to secure key recompetes and new work opportunities.
This positions us for multiyear growth in key areas, including digital modernization, artificial intelligence and high-end data analytics.
Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 26.7% compared to the prior-year period.
commercial cyber business and contributions from Tracepoint, where we are seeing strong cross-selling momentum and early synergies.
We are now on Slide 6.
Net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $797 million, up 29% over the prior-year period, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.39 times and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.28 times.
Total backlog grew approximately 19.2% year over year to $27.8 billion.
Funded backlog grew 11.7% to $4 billion.
Unfunded backlog grew 57.7% to $9.4 billion.
And price options grew 4.4% to $14.3 billion.
These results underscore continued demand and strong alignment to our clients' core missions in the areas of artificial intelligence, cyber and digital modernization, to name a few and further, our position as a trusted partner and market leader.
Looking ahead, as we continue to pursue larger and more technically complex bids, we anticipate that ongoing protests will become part of the normal business cycle, which we are increasingly factoring into our operating plan.
As of December 31, we had approximately 29,500 employees, an increase of approximately 1,900 year over year or 6.8%.
The labor market for tech and tech-adjacent talent remains highly competitive, but we are pleased that we continue to successfully execute on our hiring and retention strategies, a reflection of our appeal as an employer of choice.
This resulted in a third consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit headcount growth, consistent with our expectations.
Moving to the bottom line.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $222 million, up 8% from the prior-year period.
Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 10.9% compared to 10.8% in the prior-year period.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by three factors: first, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions; second, prudent cost management; and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $2 million negative impact on the prior-year period under the CARES Act, a tailwind that will taper off after this quarter.
Third quarter net income decreased 10.8% year over year to $129 million.
Adjusted net income was $137 million, down 5.5% year over year.
Diluted earnings per share decreased 7.8% to $0.95 from $1.03 the prior-year period.
And adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $1.02 from $1.04.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by a higher effective tax rate following the release of an income tax reserve of $10.2 million in the prior-year period related to the Aquilent acquisition, as well as higher interest expense partially offset by a lower share count due to our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP metrics exclude certain acquisition costs and the noncash gain of $7.1 million from the spin-off of SnapAttack during the quarter.
Cash from operations was $21 million in the third quarter, down from $233 million in the prior year comparable period.
Operating cash performance is volatile quarter-to-quarter, and the decline in this period was more pronounced due to some of the factors impacting top line growth, coupled with higher disbursements.
As we have done before, we are focused on our working cash management and cash collection efforts to continue improving our operating cash performance and reinforce our strong balance sheet.
Year to date, we have generated $481 million in operating cash flow and $430 million in free cash flow for a free cash flow conversion rate nearing 100% and supporting our strong balance sheet positioning and capital deployment priorities.
During the quarter, we deployed approximately $139 million, inclusive of $50 million in quarterly dividends and $83 million in share repurchases.
Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has increased our quarterly dividend by $0.06 to $0.43 per share, payable on March 2 to stockholders of record on February 11.
This marks our ninth consecutive fiscal year of increasing our quarterly dividend, a testament to our fundamental strength and promise to continue growing our dividend, even in a more challenging operating environment.
With one quarter left in this fiscal year, we remain committed to a patient, disciplined capital allocation strategy, leveraging our strong balance sheet position to deploy capital in an accretive manner, creating near- and long-term shareholder value.
As we have said in October, our capital deployment priorities remain focused on strategic M&A to enhance growth while sustaining a healthy dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares.
Let me now walk you through how the puts and takes from the quarter translate into updates to our full year fiscal 2022 guidance.
Please move to Slide 8.
Despite lighter revenue and operating cash challenges this quarter, we are proud of our team's efforts to manage the business, controlling what we can in spite of another wave of macro environmental challenges.
These efforts have enabled margin expansion with solid ADEPS performance throughout this fiscal year as we reinforce the strength of our fundamentals and balance sheet in preparation to execute on our investment thesis.
In the fourth quarter, we were laser-focused on executing against our operational priorities.
We will continue to aggressively hire ahead of demand, capitalizing on our strong portfolio of new work opportunities to sustain long-term organic growth.
We will efficiently manage the business by investing in our people and technology to lead the next wave of innovation.
And lastly, continue to build our M&A pipeline and acquire businesses that meet our disciplined criteria to serve as strategic accelerators.
Our revised guidance reflects these efforts in addition to the third quarter performance and trends I just outlined.
Let me run through the numbers.
For the full fiscal year, revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 5.7% to 7.2%.
At the midpoint, our revised guidance range reflects $100 million to $220 million of revenues tied to the uncertainties we outlined earlier.
They break down as follows: $30 million to $80 million tied to funding delays and resulting slowness in deploying staff on sold and funded work; $20 million to $40 million tied to an incremental step down in staff utilization due largely to the continuing pandemic and PTO usage; and $50 million to $100 million from lower pandemic-related travel and the timing of material purchase getting pushed to the right.
As a reminder, the inclusion of the New Year's Eve holiday and minor timing differences in the costing of labor related to the implementation of our next-gen financial management system will become tailwinds in the fourth quarter, adding roughly 175 basis points to the top line.
On the bottom line, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year to be approximately 11%.
This increase reflects our considerable control over our cost structure and margin levers even in times of uncertainty.
We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be between $4.10 and $4.30.
We now expect operating cash to be between $700 million and $750 million.
The incremental step-down follows our expectations for lower top line growth and accounts for the $56 million of onetime payments in connection with the Liberty acquisition, which we had anticipated being able to make up through a combination of working capital management and operating performance.
As I mentioned, we will remain laser-focused on optimizing our working capital to return to the strong level of cash conversion we have historically delivered to position us ahead of future growth initiatives.
And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million to $100 million.
As we move toward our investment thesis, I remain confident in our team's ability to manage through these times of uncertainty as we have proven our ability to do over the years.
We will continue to execute on our near-term growth objectives and remain confident in the long-term trajectory of the business, upholding our role as the industry leader in meeting the high standards our shareholders have come to expect.
With that, over to you, Laura.
Operator, please open the lines.
","In Q3, Booz Allen Hamilton faced revenue growth challenges due to COVID-19 impacts, funding delays, and lower staff availability. However, despite a 6.6% revenue increase to $2 billion, the growth was slower than anticipated. Nevertheless, the company delivered strong bottom line results, maintaining its commitment to invest in its workforce and business growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose 8% to $222 million, driven by contract performance, cost management, and a return to billing for fee within Intel. Despite cash flow challenges, Booz Allen's balance sheet remains strong, and the company announced a quarterly dividend increase to $0.43 per share. Looking forward, the company updated its fiscal year 2022 guidance, with expected revenue growth of 5.7% to 7.2% and reaffirmed adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance within a range of $4.10 to $4.30. The company remains confident in its long-term investment thesis, aiming to increase adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025."
FDP_q3_2020.txt,"As Lindsay mentioned, I'm Christine Cannella, vice president, investor relations with Fresh Del Monte Produce.
Joining me in today's discussion, Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, chairman and chief executive officer; and Eduardo Bezerra, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
You may also visit the company's website at freshdelmonte.com for a copy of today's release as well as to register for future distribution.
2020 is shaping up to be one of the most challenging periods ever for our industry and Fresh Del Monte Produce.
The difficulties we experienced in the third quarter of 2020 were driven by the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued to hinder our performance with decreased demand as a result of mandatory government shutdowns, including schools, restaurants, food service and business closures being our biggest headwind.
These challenges continued to hamper our ability to achieve our financial targets for the third quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were $990 million compared with $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019.
We reported adjusted gross profit of $69 million compared with $76 million in the third quarter of 2019, with gross profit margin improvements in our fresh and value-added products segments.
Due to the early actions we took by adjusting our business in response to these challenges, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 in the third quarter of 2019.
I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed our move to our new Gonzales, California facility.
Today, our three Mann Packing facilities and Fresno fresh-cut facility are now operating under one roof, which we anticipate will enable us to improve gross profit in our fresh and value-added products segment by approximately $10 million on an annual basis; a benefit which we expect to achieve over the next 12 months.
We also made progress with the optimization plan we announced in the second quarter of 2020, reducing underutilized facilities and land assets.
We believe this will allow us to shift assets that better serve the long-term growth of the company.
We identified assets across all of our regions that we plan to sell over the next 12 to 18 months for the total anticipated cash proceeds of approximately $100 million.
Since we last spoke, we added two new containerized vessels to our new fleet, the Del Monte Rose and the Del Monte Harvester, replacing vessels we have previously chartered.
This important sustainability initiative reduces our carbon footprint and brings us closer to our 2025 commitment to reduce emissions by 10%.
Also during the quarter, we continued our efforts to diversify our product line and the channels we market our products in with the launch of our newest product, the pink glow Del Monte pineapple.
The variety is produced on our farms in Costa Rica.
In October, we published an update to our 2018-2019 corporate social responsibility report that includes progress toward our 2025 commitments.
I encourage you to visit the Sustainability section of our website to learn more about our progress, including our recently announced partnership between our Del Monte Kenya operations and the United Nations Foundation to promote the health and empowerment of women employees and community members, along with the announcement from PR Daily that we were named to receive the best Green and Environmental Stewardship Award, which we were honored to accept.
Today, I'm confident that the decisions made in 2020 will be a driving force behind our future performance.
In the third quarter, we demonstrated the value of our business model and generated improved cash flow and continue to reduce our debt in order to better position us to weather this pandemic and emerge stronger.
Despite the COVID-19 disruptions during the third-quarter 2020, we achieved net income per diluted share of $0.37 versus net income per diluted share of $0.38 in the third quarter of 2019.
Excluding, among other things, the effect of other product-related charges, which resulted in a $2.3 million gross profit impact related to inventory write-offs, we delivered adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.35 compared with adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.38 in the third quarter of 2019.
However, I would like to point out that if you apply the adjusted gross profit margin of 7% to the $73 million of net sales impacted by COVID-19, we estimate that we would have delivered an additional $5.8 million in adjusted gross profit.
Additionally, despite the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic, we generated $63 million in cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter.
We reduced our long-term debt by $76 million since the end of 2019, and we reduced our long-term debt by $24 million compared with the end of the second quarter of 2020.
As Mohammad mentioned, we announced a $100 million asset sale program to be completed over the next 12 to 18 months to strengthen our cash flow position, reduce our debt and continue to reinvest in key areas of growth in our business.
Our focus on our value-added business is also progressing well.
Measures we have taken over the past year demonstrates the significance of our goals to increase sales revenue, enhance margins and maintain our track record of improved cash flow generation.
We believe we are on-track to realize most of our cost savings actions planned for 2021.
With that, I will now get into the results for the third quarter of 2020.
Net sales were $990 million compared with $1.1 billion in third quarter of 2019, with unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacting net sales by $2 million.
Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $69 million compared to $76 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $25 million, in line with the prior-year period, and adjusted net income was $16 million compared with $18 million in the third quarter of 2019.
In regards to our business segment performance in the third quarter of 2020, in our fresh and value-added product segment, net sales decreased $52 million to $601 million compared with $653 million in the prior-year period.
The decrease was primarily due to lower net sales in our fresh-cut vegetable, avocado, fresh-cut fruit, vegetable and prepared product lines, partially offset by an increase in sales of our pineapple and nontropical product line.
As compared with our third quarter of 2019 performance for the segment, the COVID-19 pandemic affected our net sales of fresh and value-added products by an estimated $56 million during the quarter, driven by reduced demand in our foodservice channel and shifting demand at retail due to the pandemic.
Also, the continuing effect of the November 2019 Mann Pack voluntary product recall affected our net sales in the third quarter of 2020.
Gross profit increased to $54 million compared with $53 million in the third quarter of 2019, and other product-related charges represented $2 million for the segment, primarily related to inventory write-offs of pineapples due to volatile supply and demand condition, as well as additional cleaning and social distancing protocols associated with the pandemic.
In our pineapple product line, net sales were $116 million compared with $102 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher sales volume in all of our region, mainly as a result of lower production in the prior-year period due to adverse weather conditions in our growing regions.
Overall, volume increased 15%, unit pricing decreased 1% and unit cost decreased 1% compared with the prior-year period.
In our fresh-cut fruit product line, net sales were $130 million compared with $145 million in the third quarter of 2019.
The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales volume in North America as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a shortage of certain raw materials.
Overall, volume decreased 11%, unit price increased 1% and unit cost increased 3% compared with the prior-year period.
In our fresh-cut vegetable product lines, net sales were $96 million compared with $122 million in the third quarter of 2019.
The decrease in net sales were primarily due to the effect of the COVD-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant reduction of most of our global foodservice business during the quarter, mainly in our Mann Packing subsidiary.
Volume decreased 27%, unit pricing increased 7%, and unit cost increased 15% compared with the prior-year period.
In our avocado product line, net sales were $77 million compared with $98 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower selling price as a result of normalized industry supply in the market when compared with the prior-year period.
Volume increased 13%, pricing decreased 31%, and unit cost decreased 37% compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to the improved capacity utilization at our new packing facility in Mexico, which opened in December 2019.
In our vegetable product line, net sales were $42 million compared with $46 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the COVID-19.
Volume decreased 13%, unit pricing increased 5% and unit cost increased 26% compared with the prior-year period.
In our nontropical product line, which includes our grape, berry, apple, citrus, pear, peach, plum, nectarine, cherry and kiwi product line, net sales were $38 million compared with $32 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher sales volume in Europe as a result of increased demand, along with higher sales volume in the Middle East in developing markets.
Also contributing to the increase in net sales was higher selling prices in the Middle East.
Volume increased 13%, unit price increased 4%, and unit cost increased 7%.
In our prepared food product line, which includes the company's prepared traditional products and meals and snacks product line, the decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales in the company's meals and snacks product line, principally due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the continued impact of the 2019 product recall and product rationalization efforts in our Mann Packing operations in North America.
The decrease was partially offset by higher per unit selling prices of pineapple concentrate due to lower industry supply and increased per unit selling prices of canned pineapple products due to increased customer demand.
In our banana segment, net sales decreased $24 million to $362 million compared with $386 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower net sales in North America, Europe and the Middle East as a result of decreased sales volume and lower demand due to COVID-19.
The decrease was partially offset by higher net sales in Asia.
The COVID-19 pandemic affected banana net sales by an estimated $17 million during the quarter versus our third quarter of 2019 performance for this segment.
Overall, volume decreased 4%, worldwide pricing decreased 3% over the prior-year period.
Total worldwide banana unit cost decreased 1% and gross profit decreased to $11 million compared to [Audio Gap] in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower selling prices in North America as a result of increased demand, partially offset by lower cost, mainly lower ocean freight cost.
Other products related charges represented $400,000 for the segment incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Now moving to selected financial data.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7 million to $44 million compared with $51 million in the third quarter of 2019.
The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and marketing expenses in the Middle East and cost savings initiatives in North America.
The foreign currency impact at the gross profit level for the third quarter was unfavorable by $3 million compared with an unfavorable effect of $2 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Interest expense, net for the third quarter, was $5 million compared with $6 million in the third quarter of 2019 due to lower average loan balances and lower interest rates.
The provision for income tax was $5 million during the quarter compared with income tax expense of $3 million in the prior-year period.
The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased earnings in certain higher taxable jurisdictions.
For the first 9 months of 2020, our net cash provided by operating activities was $174 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $130 million in the same period of 2019.
The increase was primarily attributable to lower payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower levels of inventory due to our optimization efforts on working capital.
The increase was partially offset by lower net income and higher levels of prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Total debt decreased from $587 million at the end of 2019 to $511 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020.
As it relates to capital spending, we invested $57 million in capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $23 million in the third quarter of 2019.
For the first nine months of 2020, we invested $93 million compared with $94 million in the same period in 2018.
Our investments in the third quarter of 2020 included the delivery of 2 new container vessels, the Del Monte Gold and Del Monte Rose.
We also completed the consolidation of four different facilities into our Mann Packing operations into our new Gonzales, California facility during the quarter.
This is an increase of $0.05 per share from our quarterly cash dividend paid on September 4, 2020.
This concludes our financial review.
","Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Fresh Del Monte Produce demonstrated resilience with a $0.35 adjusted earnings per share in Q3 2020, matching the previous year's performance. Net sales decreased to $990 million due to reduced demand, particularly in the foodservice channel. The company's fresh and value-added products segment experienced a decline, primarily attributed to the pandemic and the voluntary product recall in 2019. In contrast, the pineapple product line saw growth. Additionally, Fresh Del Monte Produce completed the consolidation of its Mann Packing facilities, anticipating an annual gross profit improvement of approximately $10 million. The company continued to reduce debt, which currently stands at $511 million, and announced a $100 million asset sale program to further strengthen its cash position and invest in key areas. The launch of the new pink glow Del Monte pineapple and the partnership with the United Nations Foundation to promote women's empowerment demonstrate the company's focus on sustainability and social responsibility."
DNB_q2_2021.txt,"On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher.
Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.
The second quarter was another quarter of solid progress as revenues grew 24.4% and EBITDA grew 12.6%.
Organic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, fueled by low double-digit growth in international and low single-digit growth in North America.
The sequential improvement in organic growth was driven by new logo wins, increased cross-sell, continued strong retention, and the lessening of previously communicated headwinds.
We also saw strong sales in the building pipeline for our new solutions, both domestically and internationally, as businesses look to leverage more of our solutions to support their post-pandemic operating models.
We expect to see a continued ramp in the third and fourth quarters as we execute against our near-term growth strategy and have continued to strengthen the business for the long term with new talent, data assets, partnerships, and solutions that continue to bolster our offerings and provide our clients differentiated insights that help them grow revenues, lower operating costs, and improve the risk and compliance profile.
Before we jump to our normal business and operations update, I wanted to touch on a few announcements we made in the quarter.
As Dun & Bradstreet's chief product officer, Ginny comes to us from TransUnion and has over 20 years of experience driving innovation and leading product organizations.
She manages the overall product strategy for our global portfolio and is focused on driving rapid innovation and developing solutions at scale that enable our clients' success.
Mike is our chief technology officer and brings more than 25 years of experience and deep technological insight to Dun & Bradstreet.
Mike joined us from Fiserv and brings with him a proven track record of modernizing and scaling existing platforms for companies such as AOL, Microsoft, and First Data.
We also established a new location in Jacksonville, Florida, which will serve as our global headquarters.
We look to leverage this strategic location to help us to continue to innovate and grow, as well as benefit from substantial state and local financial incentives that made this move an easy one.
And finally, before I move on to the business update, I wanted to share a very special milestone here at Dun & Bradstreet.
On July 20, we celebrated our 180th year anniversary, which is a testament to the long-standing value D&B has and continues to provide to businesses throughout the world.
Now, let's move on to our business update.
On our first-quarter call, we discussed our key priorities for 2021, which are to continue to grow our share of wallet with our strategic customers; to approach and monetize the SMB space in new and innovative ways; to launch new products domestically to localize new and existing products globally; and lastly, to integrate the Bisnode acquisition.
Throughout the second quarter, our team has made great strides toward executing on these priorities.
We're pleased with the ongoing success we're having with our strategic clients, which included renewal rates at near 100% and the addition of some exciting new logos.
In North America, we signed a multiyear deal with Ceridian, a global human capital management software company for Analytics Studio and various sales and marketing products, including the new Rev.
Up ABX and digital targeting solutions.
Ceridian was looking to support their growth strategies and, in particular, the ability to connect and activate the offline view of customers and prospects through digital insights.
They're also focused on strategic global expansion and leveraging our world-based file to better understand addressable markets by region to support growth in target markets.
Leveraging the investments we've made in nontraditional data and our sales and marketing solutions, we signed additional business with one of the largest online retailers who will be using our data and analytics to support their efforts in growing a new business line that needed help targeting specific retailers in high foot traffic areas such as airports and sports stadiums.
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu also entered into a multiyear agreement with us to assist with their client engagement, customer relationship management, and overall master data program.
Their global data management team was tasked with creating a global master data warehouse that could be used across all markets and will be the central hub for global applications, as well as local markets.
The team selected our D&B Direct+ API to be the central point for company information, hierarchies, and connections, including our full Family Tree.
Along with the master data use case, they're also using our insights to inform their investment to drive a more diverse workforce pipeline and, in particular, underrepresented minorities to the public accounting profession.
We will deliver a microsite with downloadable learning modules and coupled with a multichannel marketing campaign.
We're proud to support Deloitte in ensuring the success of this fantastic program.
We also signed a deal with Vintro, an online networking platform, who will be using our comprehensive B2B data, as well as our insights and AI-driven platforms to enable their clients to accelerate global opportunity and innovation.
In addition to the direct sale, we're also partnering with Vintro on a new platform to enhance the supply chain ecosystem through enhanced access to SMBs.
Turning to our international segment.
We're making strong progress on the Global 500 account program we rolled out in the first quarter, demonstrated by several wins in the second quarter.
One of these was a significant expansion of our long-standing relationship with Barclays through a multiyear enterprisewide agreement supporting their global master client data and insight strategy.
Barclays will be using D&B's comprehensive global data cloud for a multitude of use cases.
Globally consistent and identifiable by the DUNS number, our data will enable a broader and deeper view of every customer and prospect from intent data to financial and regulatory information.
Barclays was looking for an end-to-end global solution, and we stood alone in our ability to deliver such an outcome.
In D&B Europe, our newly acquired Bisnode region, we signed several deals with Global 500 companies as our strategy to become the provider of choice in Central Europe has begun to bear fruit.
Bayer, a life science company with more than 150-year history and core competencies in the areas of healthcare and agriculture, signed a three-year global contract for D&B data by multiple delivery platforms.
This deal will support Bayer in organizing and managing their third-party records across various software platforms.
Deutsche Bank signed a new contract to use our local German database to support their sales efforts.
After various data and usability comparisons, they chose D&B over their previous provider, a large international competitor.
We continue to build and grow relationships with Global 500 companies.
At the end of the second quarter, nearly three-quarters of the Global 500 companies are clients of ours, a significant increase from year-end 2019 that was closer to two-thirds.
While we continue to deepen relationships with our strategic clients, we're also seeing positive trends in the small and midsized markets.
As it relates to our second priority, addressing the SMB market in new and innovative ways, we started with the build-out of our D&B product and data marketplaces.
The D&B product marketplace was created to provide a curated set of our solutions, as well as partner solutions designed for small business.
It now has 20 partners, the newest of which are Brex and LendingTree along with other major brands such as Microsoft, Comcast Business, AT&T Business, Mastercard, and Symantec.
The D&B Data Marketplace where users can now buy a broader range of prematched, independent data sets from alternative data providers, now includes data sets such as commercial real estate, job postings, shipping, healthcare, and U.S. agricultural data.
We currently have 36 partner data sets as of the end of the second quarter, up from 22 at the end of the first quarter.
Now turning to our e-commerce strategy.
We continue to see more and more attention in our digital assets.
In the second quarter, we saw dnb.com site visits continue to grow with over 46 million visits in Q2, an 84% increase over prior Q2.
While the vast majority of customers are coming for CreditSignal and monitoring services, we're also beginning to see increased demand for our sales and marketing solutions.
Overall, we hit more than $2 million in e-commerce sales in Q2, up 73% from prior-year quarter, and are forecasting sales to double again by the end of the third quarter.
This, combined with our D&B Marketplaces, are expected to drive nearly $10 million in incremental annual recurring revenues by year-end, and we look forward to updating you in the coming quarters on our progress.
Our third priority is launching new products and use cases.
Last quarter, we announced D&B Rev.
Up ABX, a solution that simplifies and automates marketing and sales workflows for our clients.
Since its launch, we closed six deals with ACV of nearly $2 million and with a strong and growing pipeline as awareness spreads and further enhancements are added to the platform.
We're excited to now take the Rev.
Up capabilities to the SMB marketplace with the launch of D&B Rev.
Up Now brings enterprise digital marketing technology, once only available to large-size businesses, to SMBs so that they can find and engage their best customers without having the cost and complexity of an in-house analytics department.
We're also bolstering our sales and marketing solutions through our alliance with Zeta Global.
We are bringing together trusted consumer and private business data into a single, highly secured data cloud that contains profiles on over 220 million individuals in the United States.
The Data Cloud combines Zeta's business-to-consumer data, including individuals' intent, behavioral, transactional, and location-based signals with Dun & Bradstreet's business-to-business data, including employer data such as companies, titles, and emails, to power a new market sector we refer to as business-to-person or B2P, which will enable businesses to unlock the buying power of decision-makers through this uniquely combined data set offering, a true 360-degree view of an individual and the ability to reach them through both business and consumer-based activation channels.
And last but not least, I'm excited to announce the launch of D&B ESG Intelligence, which delivers a standardized score and analytics built from the Dun & Bradstreet Data Cloud and established sustainability standards.
Our ESG rankings cover 12 ESG themes and 32 topic-specific categories to help our clients best understand specific risks and opportunities.
We believe this is another great example of how we can leverage the power of our Data Cloud and the DUNS number to create consistent and comprehensive rankings for businesses of all sizes throughout the globe.
This deep coverage and breakdown of specific ESG topic rankings helps compliance and procurement teams track and report on specific ESG factors that increase growth and reduce risk.
Similar to how PAYDEX established the de facto commercial credit score, we see the opportunity to set a standardized commercial ESG score that will help underwriters procurement organizations, investors, and many other areas quickly analyze and action new customers, vendors, suppliers, investments, and partners in an accurate and efficient manner.
In our international segment, we continue to focus on rolling out localized solutions across our owned and partner markets.
In the second quarter, we delivered 14 product launches across Europe, Greater China, and the Worldwide Network partner markets.
including important new solutions, D&B Finance Analytics, D&B Risk Analytics, and Data Blocks.
We also expanded distribution of D&B Onboard and Direct+ across the slew of worldwide network partners.
In D&B Europe, we continue to see good traction from existing D&B products, like D&B Credit, Direct+ and D&B Onboard, while also introducing new products, including D&B Finance Analytics and Risk Analytics in the Nordic markets, Optimizer in the Nordics and Southeast Europe, and Data Blocks in Central Europe.
These solutions will enable us to execute our strategy of migrating customers off legacy offerings onto modern digital platforms, as well as attract new customers.
These solutions, along with the many we have discussed over the past few quarters, are allowing us to create a significant amount of new product revenue.
For North America and international combined, the New Product Vitality Index, or the percentage of revenues from new products, was 6% in Q2.
For context, we began measuring this stat in Q1 of 2019, and it's up already from 0.2% in Q2 of 2019.
We will continue to drive more and more new solutions into our markets around the world and look forward to updating you on our progress through the coming quarters.
I'm pleased to report that integration is going as planned with top-line performance in line and synergy realization coming in slightly ahead of expectations.
We've executed more than $25 million in annualized savings from actions taken through Q2.
Savings are being driven by the consolidation of functions across our global team, as well as executing a broad real estate strategy, including vacating, reducing the footprint of 14 office locations.
On the Bisnode operations side, we implemented a new global data framework across D&B Europe markets to ensure consistent monitoring and enhancement of database breadth and quality.
We have already made key data improvements, including the failure scores in Nordic markets in Germany, growing the database of nonregistered companies in Central Europe, and increasing financial statement data in Switzerland.
These initiatives are intended to improve retention, to enhance customer satisfaction, as well as demand for data from our global customers.
Overall, I'm pleased with our continued transformation, and I'm excited about the progress we continue to make, laying the foundation for accelerated sustainable growth throughout the remainder of 2021 and into 2022.
Today, I will discuss our second-quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
On a GAAP basis, second-quarter revenues were $521 million, an increase of 24% or 23% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter.
This includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $2 million.
Net loss for the second quarter on a GAAP basis was $52 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.12, compared to a net loss of $208 million for the prior-year quarter.
The improvement was primarily driven by higher prior-year expenses related to the retirement of debt as part of the initial public offering, lower interest expense, improvements in operating income driven by lower equity-based compensation related to stock options granted in the prior-year quarter, and the net impact of Bisnode acquisition.
This was partially offset by higher tax provision recognized in the current year, largely driven by changes in the state apportionment and the enactment of the U.K. tax rate increase.
Turning to Slide 2, I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the second quarter.
Second-quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $521 million, an increase of 24.4% or 23.2% on a constant-currency basis.
This year-over-year increase included 19.9 percentage points from the Bisnode acquisition and 0.5 point from the impact of lower deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments.
Revenues on an organic constant-currency basis were up 2.8%, driven by double-digit growth in our international segment, as well as single-digit growth in North America.
Second-quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $198 million, an increase of $22 million or 13%.
Excluding the net impact of the Bisnode acquisition, EBITDA increased slightly due to revenue growth partially offset by increased data and data-processing costs, higher commissions, and higher public company costs.
Second-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.1%.
Excluding the net impact of Bisnode, EBITDA margin was 40.8%.
Second-quarter adjusted net income was $108 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25, an increase from $81 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning now to Slide 3, I will now discuss the results for our two segments, North America and international.
In North America, revenues for the second quarter were $357 million, an increase of approximately 1% from the prior year.
Excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange and the negative impact of the Bisnode acquisition, North America organic revenue increased $3.2 million or 1%.
In finance and risk, we continue to see strength in our risk solutions and solid growth in our finance solutions attributable to new business and higher customer spend.
The growth in these solutions was partially offset by $1 million of revenue elimination from the Bisnode transaction.
For sales and marketing, revenue was $158 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 2%.
While data sales had another solid quarter, the overall growth in sales and marketing was offset by $4 million from the Data.com legacy partnership wind-down.
North America second-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $167 million, a decrease of $3 million or 2% primarily due to higher data processing costs and higher commissions, partially offset by revenue growth and ongoing cost management.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 46.9%.
Turning now to Slide 4.
In our international segment, second-quarter revenues increased 147% to $164 million or 137% on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by the net impact from the acquisition of Bisnode and strong growth in both finance and risk and sales and marketing solutions.
Excluding the net impact of Bisnode, international revenues increased approximately 13%.
Finance and risk revenues were $104 million, an increase of 92% or an increase of 85% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to the Bisnode acquisition.
Excluding the net impact of Bisnode, revenue grew 10% with growth across all markets, including higher revenue from Worldwide Network alliances due to higher cross-border data fees and royalties and higher revenues from our U.K. market attributable to growth in our finance solutions.
Sales and marketing revenues were $60 million, an increase of 383% or an increase of 366% on a constant-currency basis, primarily attributable to the Bisnode acquisition.
Excluding the impact of Bisnode, revenue grew 22% due to higher revenues from API offerings across our U.K. and Greater China markets and increased revenues from our Worldwide Network partners product royalties.
Second-quarter international adjusted EBITDA of $43 million increased $23 million or 113% versus second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the net impact of the Bisnode acquisition, as well as revenue growth across our international businesses, partially offset by higher data costs.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26% or 28.9% excluding Bisnode.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll now walk through our capital structure.
At the end of June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $178 million, which, when combined with the full capacity of our $850 million revolving line of credit due 2025, represents total liquidity of approximately $1 billion.
As of June 30, 2021, total debt principal was $3,667 million, and our leverage ratio was 4.7 on a gross basis and 4.4 on a net basis.
The credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.6.
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll now walk through our outlook for full-year 2021.
Adjusted revenues are expected to remain in the range of $2,145 million to $2,175 million, an increase of approximately 23.25% compared to full-year 2020 adjusted revenues of $1,739 million.
Revenues on an organic constant-currency basis, and excluding the net impact of lower deferred revenues, are expected to increase between 3% to 4.5%.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $855 million, an increase of 18% to 20%.
And adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of the range of $1.02 to $1.06.
Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows.
We expect interest expense to be $200 million to $210 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $90 million excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 430 million; and finally, for capex, we are increasing our guidance from approximately $160 million to approximately $237 million to account for the $77 million purchase of our new global headquarters building in Jacksonville.
Overall, we continue to see the year shaping up, as previously discussed, with organic revenue growth continuing to accelerate throughout the year, with Q3 expected to be a bit below the midpoint of our range and Q4 to be at the high end of the range.
And finally, as previously discussed, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter to be below the low end of the guidance growth range with a similar growth rate as Q2 due to timing of certain expenses related to data acquisition and sales and marketing initiatives.
We expect the fourth quarter to be above the high end of the guidance growth range.
Overall, we are pleased with our performance through the first half of 2021 and look forward to continuing the strong momentum we are building in both our North America and international segments.
Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A?
","Dun & Bradstreet reported strong second-quarter results, with adjusted revenues growing 24.4% to $521 million. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, driven by international growth and low single-digit growth in North America. International revenues surged 147% due to the Bisnode acquisition and organic growth across markets. Earnings per share came in at $0.25 on an adjusted basis, and the company has raised its capital expenditure guidance due to the purchase of its new headquarters. Dun & Bradstreet has witnessed strong sales for its new solutions, a rise in the New Product Vitality Index to 6%, and increased demand for its sales and marketing solutions due to its digital asset focus. The company remains optimistic about its prospects, expecting organic revenue growth to continue accelerating and adjusted EBITDA to increase by 18% to 20% for the full year."
BHE_q3_2020.txt,"For today's call, Jeff will begin by covering a summary of our third quarter.
Roop will then discuss our detailed third quarter results, including a cash and balance sheet summary and fourth quarter guidance.
Jeff will wrap up with an outlook by market sector, an update on our strategic initiatives and a discussion on our midterm financial model before we conclude the call with Q&A.
We hope you are all staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times.
In Q3, we delivered revenue of $526 million, which was up 7% sequentially from Q2, supported by strong demand in our defense, semi-cap and telco sectors and improved manufacturing productivity.
With improving operational efficiency, non-GAAP gross margins rebounded 170 basis points to 8.7% for the quarter.
Improved profits and focused expense management resulted in non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share, which includes $1.3 million or $0.04 per share of COVID-related costs.
We believe COVID costs are a part of the new operating normal.
And while we believe they will decline to some degree from current levels, they will likely not completely go away.
After a challenging couple of quarters, I'm pleased to report that our manufacturing and engineering services operations have essentially returned to pre-COVID productivity levels, which has supported our improved results for Q3.
This has not been without an incredible amount of work from our COVID task force and our entire employee population to maintain stringent protocols to ensure we keep our workplace safe and healthy, which remains a top priority.
Our cash conversion cycle for the quarter improved to 81 days from 84 days in Q2.
As I've mentioned previously, our go-to-market team continues to deliver exciting opportunities aligned to our complex and focused services and solutions that utilize the full breadth of the One Benchmark capabilities.
And we had another strong quarter of bookings in Q3, where we awarded business that should represent over $200 million of future engineering and manufacturing revenue.
In the medical sector, we were awarded a new program for a lab-free rapid COVID-19 testing device from DnaNudge that has begun production in our Netherlands facility.
We are excited to partner with DnaNudge to provide DFX support and high reliability manufacturing for what has turned out to be a very swift product ramp.
We also had design and manufacturing process wins with two other companies for a pulmonary treatment device and an optical diagnostic product for renal applications.
In the defense vertical, we were awarded new programs for secure communication radio modules that incorporate our design solutions and manufacturing services for electronics that will be deployed in military aircraft.
In industrials, we were awarded the full system box build for a LiDAR application, and we were awarded manufacturing for a new generation of oscilloscopes.
In computing, we were awarded a new prototype for a hyperscale computing customer and a new outsourcing award from an existing customer supporting network control and monitoring electronics.
Our new business pipeline continues to be strong across our targeted sectors and subsectors, and we remain very encouraged about the prospect for continued wins, where the outsourcing environment for both engineering and manufacturing projects remains favorable.
I hope everyone and their families continue to stay safe and healthy.
Total Benchmark revenue was $526 million in Q3, a 7% increase on a sequential basis.
Medical revenues for the third quarter were flat sequentially as expected from moderating demand for products involved in COVID-19 therapies, such as ventilators, x-rays and ultrasound devices.
New product demand is shifting more toward diagnostic devices, such as DnaNudge's diagnostic box, which we were awarded in Q3.
Semi-cap revenues were up 14% in the third quarter and up 45% year-over-year from continued strong demand across our semi-cap customers.
A&D revenues for the third quarter increased 18% sequentially due to strong defense demand in surveillance, connectivity, encryption and digital subsystems and from new program wins.
Conversely, commercial aerospace demand, which was 30% of 2019 revenues, remain muted and declined on certain platforms during the quarter.
Industrial revenues for the third quarter were flat sequentially from continued softness for products in the oil and gas industry, which was approximately 20% of our 2019 revenue.
In addition, demand remains muted for customers that support commercial building infrastructure and transportation markets.
Overall, the higher value markets represented 81% of our third quarter revenue.
In the traditional markets, computing revenues were flat sequentially from stable demand in high-performance computing and data center storage products.
Telco was up 16% from Q2 with improved demand in commercial satellite and network infrastructure products.
Our traditional markets represented 19% of third quarter revenues.
Our top 10 customers represented 42% of sales in the third quarter.
Our GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $0.16.
Our GAAP results included restructuring and other onetime costs totaling $7.2 million.
$6.3 million of these costs are related to the impairment of assets and severance and other items related to the decision to exit a certain line of business in our A&D sector related to turbine machining.
The remaining $900,000 of restructuring and other onetime costs are due to various restructuring activities around our sites.
$1.6 million insurance recovery related to our Q4 2019 ransomware event.
To date, we have recovered $6.6 million.
Turning to slide eight.
For Q3, our non-GAAP gross margin was 8.7%, a 170 basis point sequential increase.
During the quarter, gross margin was positively impacted by higher revenues, which enabled improved leverage across our cost structure, increased productivity across our sites and lower sequential COVID-19-related costs.
We estimate that we incurred approximately $1.3 million or approximately $0.04 per share of COVID costs in the quarter versus $3.4 million in Q2.
Our SG&A was $29.7 million, an increase of $1.2 million sequentially and a decrease of $1.2 million year-over-year.
We expect that our SG&A costs will be relatively flat sequentially between Q3 and Q4.
Operating margin was 3%, an increase from 1.2% in Q2 due to the higher revenue and increased gross margin.
In Q3, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6%, which was lower than expected as a result of the insurance recovery reported in Q3 and the distribution of profits around the globe.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 for the quarter.
Non-GAAP ROIC was 5.8%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share improved sequentially based on our improved operational performance, lower net interest expense and lower tax rate.
Our cash balance was $335 million at September 30, with $161 million available in the U.S.
We continue to have a strong capital structure, and our liquidity position provides flexibility to manage our business to support our future strategy.
We generated $6 million in cash flow from operations and used $6 million for capital expenditures.
Our accounts receivable balance was $306 million, an increase of $4 million from the prior quarter.
Contract assets were $161 million at September 30 and $154 million at June 30.
Payables were down $22 million quarter-over-quarter.
Inventory at September 30 was $353 million, down $11 million sequentially.
Turning to slide 10 to review our cash conversion cycle.
Our cash conversion cycle days were 81.
Accounts receivable days improved three days.
Inventory days improved six days, and customer deposits improved by one day to help support an overall sequential improvement of three days.
Turning to slide 11 for our capital allocation update.
In Q3, we continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $5.8 million.
We expect to continue the recurring quarterly cash dividend.
There were no share repurchases in Q3.
We will consider restarting share repurchases opportunistically in Q4.
Turning to slide 12 for a review of our fourth quarter 2020 guidance.
We expect revenue to range from $500 million to $540 million.
We expect that our gross margins will be 9% to 9.1% for Q4, and SG&A will range between $29 million to $30 million.
This range contemplates the SG&A cost reductions that Jeff will review further in his following comments, the continued reduced travel offset by the reestablishment of certain employee salaries that have been temporarily reduced.
Implied in our guidance is a 3.3% to 3.5% operating margin range for modeling purposes.
The guidance provided does exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and estimated restructuring and other costs.
We expect to incur restructuring and other nonrecurring costs in Q4 of approximately $2.8 to $3.2 million.
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.36 or a midpoint of $0.34.
We estimate that we will generate approximately $45 million to $50 million cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2020.
capex for the year will be approximately $32 million to $38 million as we prioritize investments to support our new customers and expand our production capacity for future growth.
Other expenses net is expected to be $2.7 million, which is primarily interest expense related to our outstanding debt.
We expect that for Q4, our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be between 18% to 20% because of the distribution of income around our global network.
The expected weighted average shares for Q4 are 36.5 million.
This guidance takes into consideration all known constraints for the quarter and assumes no further significant interruptions to our supply base, operations or customers.
Guidance also assumes no material changes to end market conditions due to COVID-19.
Following Roop's comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide additional color on our view of demand by sector, shown on slide 14.
Overall, for the fourth quarter, we expect increased revenues from stronger demand and new programs in defense, industrials and telco to offset anticipated declines in medical as we pivot manufacturing from COVID-19-related therapeutic equipment to diagnostic, trauma and elective surgical devices.
The resulting Q4 revenue should be in line with Q3 levels.
We do not expect a seasonal uptrend in Q4 this year as customers are more cautious on increasing their demand signals given the economic and geopolitical environment.
Now turning to the medical sector.
During the first half of this year, we saw demand reductions in our core medical products in the cardiac, renal and orthopedic markets associated with trauma and elective surgeries as many of our existing customers and new customers reallocated their manufacturing and sales capacity in the fight against COVID.
As reported, one of the existing key cardiac customers, ZOLL Medical, enlisted Benchmark to support a rapid ramp of manufacturing capability to support ventilator production.
In the fourth quarter, we see declining demand for COVID-19 therapy devices, but the corresponding demand recovery for our non-COVID products isn't expected to start until first half of next year.
This anticipated recovery, along with new medical programs, gives us confidence that next year will be another growth year for the medical sector.
In semi-cap, after a stronger-than-expected increase in Q3, demand remained stable for semiconductor capital equipment in Q4.
We remain well positioned in this sector with our advanced precision machining and electronics manufacturing and further demand outlook.
This sector is expected to remain strong as the semiconductor capital equipment index is predicting another growth year in 2021.
Moving to the A&D sector outlook.
Our aerospace and defense sector is comprised of approximately 70% defense-related products and 30% commercial aerospace offerings based on 2019 revenue levels.
Defense demand across the portfolio remained strong in Q4 as we support many funded programs across the United States Armed Forces.
We are anticipating that our commercial aircraft programs, which have declined significantly in first half '20, have a limited demand recovery in Q4 and in fiscal year 2021.
As Roop mentioned earlier, we have not seen an uptick in orders in industrials for oil and gas and the building and transportation infrastructure markets, where many large projects continue to be delayed.
Despite soft demand, we do expect an overall increase in industrials in Q4 for new programs and an increased number of global engineering services projects.
Overall, we see stable demand across our computing and telco customer base.
High-performance computing projects are in flight as expected in the second half but are being offset to some degree with the persistent weakness in higher-value enterprise applications as the remote work trend continues.
In telco, network infrastructure product demand across a number of our customers remain strong from the continued need for greater bandwidth for data services.
After a nice rebound in Q3, demand from our commercial satellite customers remained stable in Q4.
As Roop shared in our guidance, with this revenue and sector mix forecast, we remain on track to achieve at least 9% gross margins in Q4.
We continue to make steady progress on our key strategic initiatives that we laid out for 2020.
My staff and I review progress regularly, and we share updates with our extended teams to ensure all of Benchmark is focused on a common set of goals.
First, customer focus is a top priority at Benchmark.
We are working as an organization using customer feedback to find ways to optimize our engagement model and make it easier to do business with our organization.
This attention, coupled with operational performance, are the cornerstones for customer satisfaction, which I'm happy to report remains at a high level.
With many of our growth and strategic accounts, we are building deliberate long-term technology road maps and business relationships to help inform how we can invest in and be more valuable to our customers in the future.
This customer-centric approach is an important foundation in growing our business.
In our sector strategies, we have a keen focus on selecting the vertical submarkets most aligned to our value proposition.
Our objective within these markets is to expand and scale with strategic customers by selecting the full breadth of services and capabilities.
This includes focused investment in technology innovations that differentiate Benchmark against other competitors and even against prospective customers' internal manufacturing to increase our win rates.
This thesis is playing out well across each of our higher-value sectors.
In fact, over the last year, we have seen improvements in engineering services tied to EMS deals and vice versa.
Next, we continue to drive enterprise efficiencies.
We are continuing work on our global footprint optimization, where we are winding down manufacturing in some locations and ramping up new production in other locations.
The goal is to gain efficiencies with fewer rooftops by selecting locations with operational synergies and align with customer preference.
To this end, in the third quarter, we made the decision to exit a line of business in our A&D sector related to turbine machining.
This is the right decision when we look at strategic alignment of the impacted facility and the prolonged downturn in commercial aerospace demand driven by the pandemic.
These decisions are never easy, but we're focused on our long-term strategy.
In addition, we have a rigorous focus on controlling our costs and expense management through improved processes, G&A centralization activities and intense focus on project and investment prioritization.
We are reshaping our SG&A landscape.
For next year, we are targeting SG&A at or below $130 million even with the end to temporary salary cuts and corporate furloughs, higher travel expenses and higher variable compensation.
The hard work we have invested in our HR, IT, finance and other shared services to enable centralization are yielding lower costs next year.
Unfortunately, this does require restructuring activities, which, as Roop has mentioned, will occur this quarter.
Finally, I want to close with our initiative on engaging talent and shifting our culture.
As I've said, Benchmark has a great cultural foundation that starts with a committed workforce who wants to deliver for our customers.
Our investments in this initiative will include focus on better self-service tools, increased empowerment and critical skills development to ensure the talent the organization needs in future leaders can be found within our own diverse team.
This includes the ongoing commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at all levels in the company, which we are enhancing as part of our ongoing ESG focus.
For technology companies like Benchmark, competitiveness requires innovation, fresh ideas and creative thinking, all areas fueled by diversity.
The attentive work on these strategic priorities formed the foundation for setting our midterm target model through the year 2022.
The company had a great start at pivoting the higher-value markets before my arrival, and we are now at our target mix between traditional and higher-value splits.
The right markets and customer selection remains key to our strategy.
Setting COVID and the resulting macroeconomic uncertainty aside, we believe that we can grow revenue at a 5% compound annual growth rate over the next two years by growing our current accounts and ramping new programs with our targeted new customers.
While we're overcoming some pretty significant revenue decline headwinds in our aerospace and oil and gas markets and other demand softness in our installed base due to the pandemic recession, our growth expectations speak to the strength in our recent bookings and outsourcing wins.
As the economy picks up later in 2021 and through 2022, we expect our growth can accelerate further with this new win momentum and recovery in our customer installed base.
With our current mix of business, the success of ongoing operational excellence initiatives and our current global footprint, we are targeting gross margins in the range of 9.3% to 9.7%.
On the SG&A expense line, I'm committed to effective overhead management and have taken the necessary actions to drive an efficient organization that is rightsized to support our customers and employees effectively.
As the company expands and needs greater investments and capabilities, we will keep expenses aligned to our future revenue growth.
The resulting non-GAAP operating margin target range will be between 3.4% to 3.8%.
With this model, we feel comfortable that we can grow earnings faster than revenue.
As operating margins improve, we see resulting improvement in ROIC.
I am confident and remain excited about our team's ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in our diverse end markets, where our deal pipeline in win rate is increasing, and we remain focused on executing our ongoing initiatives to increase incremental value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
","Benchmark Electronics reported Q3 revenue of $526 million, a 7% sequential increase driven by strong demand in defense, semi-cap, and telco sectors. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.32, despite COVID-related costs of $0.04 per share, reflecting improved operational efficiency. Gross margins rebounded 170 basis points to 8.7% due to higher revenues, increased productivity, and reduced COVID costs. The company anticipates Q4 revenue between $500-$540 million, with gross margins reaching 9-9.1%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.32-$0.36. Benchmark expects revenue to remain steady in Q4 despite declining medical demand due to the pivot away from COVID-19 therapy devices. However, the company projects strong demand in defense, industrials, and telco sectors, indicating a diverse and growing customer base. Benchmark continues to advance its strategic initiatives, including focusing on customer relationships, selecting the right submarkets, improving operational efficiency, and engaging and developing talent, to drive future growth and value creation."
SCI_q4_2020.txt,"This is Debbie Young, director of investor relations for SCI.
With that out of the way, let me pass it on now to our chairman and CEO, Tom Ryan.
We hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy.
Then I'll offer some commentary on our 2021 outlook, with the understanding that there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could change guidance significantly.
However, before I begin, I would like to say a few words about this past year.
2020 has certainly been one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember.
As I reflect back on the last 10 months, I can say with certainty that our results are a testament to our team's incredible hard work and to the resilience of our underlying business.
I'm extremely proud of our entire SCI team for going above and beyond the call of duty in 2020.
In this difficult period, we stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, helping our client families gain closure and healing through the process of grieving, remembrance and celebration.
The health, safety, and well-being of our SCI family was a top priority.
And not only were we able to avoid any layoffs, mandatory furloughs or reductions in pay as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we were able to recognize the incredible efforts of our frontline associates with hero bonuses and provide special bonuses for every associate that does not participate in our annual incentive plan.
In 2020, our services were needed more than ever, and I am proud that we were able to perform significantly increased number of services without any disruptions to our business, which highlights the power of our scale.
One thing that became clear throughout 2020 is that our fundamental business has not changed.
We did not see a wholesale shift in the consumer preferences, and our cremation remains stable.
Although we were greatly restricted in our ability to have large gatherings in 2020, we heard loud and clear from our consumers that they still have a desire to memorialize and to celebrate the lives of their loved ones.
Virtual arrangements, live streaming of services, outdoor services, drive-through visitations, radio transmitted graveside services, and many more unique memorialization and celebration of life ideas are now a normal part of what we do.
The success and acceleration of these enhanced service offerings have highlighted the importance of innovation in our industry.
We will continue to invest in technologies that enhance how we interact with consumers digitally, providing a better customer experience -- contact to the arrangement conference and beyond while also enhancing efficiencies in our operations.
As the year unfolded, actions we took in response to in-person meetings limitations yielded noncustomer-facing efficiencies.
We more effectively utilize our labor force using the virtual training, our customer relationship management system and other technology tools instead of incurring travel-related costs.
We also drove down our lead cost per sale by accelerating the growth of digital leads and making significant improvements to our direct mill program to drive record growth.
All of the many learnings from this year will make us a better company going forward.
As a result, we're positioned to enter the post pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company.
Now let's shift and provide you with some color about the core.
experienced in late November and December.
Just to give you a little color on the cadence of the quarter, our same-store funeral volumes were up 7% in October, then grew to 13% in November and an unprecedented 31% in December, which is the highest monthly growth rate we experienced all year.
And as a result of this surge late in the quarter, we finished the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 compared to $0.60 in the prior year, well above the range we provided to you in October.
Both funeral and cemetery segments had margin improvement of over 600 basis points, driven by double-digit top line percentage growth applied against a more efficient cost structure.
We also benefited from a lower share count and a lower tax rate.
Let's now take a look at funeral operations in the quarter.
Total comparable funeral revenues grew approximately $49 million or 10% during the quarter.
Both core and nonfuneral home channels performed very well and were slightly offset by lower general agency revenues caused by a decline in insurance funded preneed funeral sales production.
Core revenues grew $53 million, driven by a 17% increase in the number of cases, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in the funeral sales average.
The predominant reason for the increase in services performed was due to the direct impact of COVID-19, and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in non-COVID related deaths such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, drug overdose and suicide, perhaps a consequence of a lack of access to healthcare during 2020.
Words cannot convey the level of our appreciation and respect I have for our frontline team.
The tremendous care you provided record numbers of our client families during such a stressful time can only be described as heroic.
The decline in the funeral sales average of 3.4% was due to the local jurisdictions reimposing restrictions on gatherings, given the surge in deaths of November and December.
This resulted in a decline in a number of cases with the service.
The cremation mix shift was a moderate 120 basis points and had a minimal impact on the quarter-over-quarter funeral average decline.
Preneed funeral sales production for the quarter was down 1.6% versus the prior year, which is just a significant improvement of our results posted in earlier quarters this year.
While we saw record growth in production from our digital and direct mail leads, we continued to be hampered by a decline in preplanning seminars due to local restrictions and consumer reluctance on in-person gatherings in restaurants.
From a profit perspective, funeral gross profit increase of $45 million, and the gross profit percentage increased 640 basis points to 27.5%, realizing a 92% incremental margin on our revenue growth.
Growth in our high incremental margin core business more than offset slight declines in our lower-margin revenue streams.
We also continue to benefit by the efficient management of labor hours with fewer and smaller services as well as the reductions in noncustomer-facing costs and certain marketing and promotional expenses.
Now shifting to cemetery.
Comparable cemetery revenue increased $64 million or 18% in the fourth quarter.
Atneed cemetery revenue accounted for $25 million of the growth, driven by more burials performed due to some effects of COVID-19.
Recognized preneed revenues accounted for $35 million of growth, mainly due to higher preneed cemetery sales production during the quarter.
Preneed cemetery sales production grew $40 million or 16% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased lead sources associated with the higher atneed services and burials performed.
The preponderance of the growth, $25 million or about 60%, was from a 12% increase in velocity with a number of contracts sold.
The remaining growth of about $15 million was primarily due to large sales activity.
We continue to see this more productive and efficient sales force with better utilization of our customer relationship management system and improved conversion rates from our direct mail and digital lead campaigns.
Consumer reception to having a preplanning discussion remains very high.
I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous efforts of our sales team.
For the full year 2020, they wrote more than $1 billion in cemetery preneed sales production.
This is our new company record, so hats off to the entire sales organization.
Cemetery gross profits in the quarter grew by approximately $49 million, and the gross profit percentage increased 680 basis points to 39%.
Growth in revenues and strategic cost reductions combined to drive margins beyond normalized incremental levels.
For the full year 2020, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, a 53% increase over 2019 in a one-of-a-kind year.
Obviously, the speed and efficacy of the vaccine rollout could have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, hospitalizations and, ultimately, on the number of deaths.
This, combined with the willingness of the consumer to transact on a preneed basis may have a material effect on our 2021 results.
There is no doubt that in 2020, we serviced deaths that were pulled forward from a future year.
While we know that the timing of the pull forward is impossible to accurately predict, we have developed models are based on data from the IHME and the CBC, which incorporate historical trends and current COVID-related deaths by age group as well as by comorbidity factors in determining what future years are impacted by accelerated deaths and by how much.
Based on all these assumptions, we also believe adjusted earnings per share in 2021 will likely range between $2.50 and $2.90 per share.
We have provided a wider than normal range based on the uncertainties surrounding the impact of COVID-19.
Let's take a deeper dive into our assumptions for the 2021 earnings per share guidance.
We are modeling funeral volume to be down versus 2020, but mid single-digit percentage is higher than the 2019 levels due to the expected impact on funeral volumes in the first few months of 2021 associated with COVID-19.
We anticipate double-digit year-over-year percentage increases through March.
Then while we expect the continued impact from COVID-19 deaths, we predict comparable volumes to trend lower for the rest of the year as compared to the very active final nine months of 2020.
We expect the funeral average to be down low single-digit percentages in January and February and begin to see favorable trends as we compare back to the early months of the COVID outbreak in 2020.
While we anticipate growth year over year, we still believe we will struggle to get back to 2019 levels as we now believe that many people will continue to be reluctant to gather in large groups.
We expect preneed funeral sales production to begin to rebound in the back half of the year and for the full year to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range.
Cemetery atneed revenues should see significant year-over-year growth in the first quarter, followed by a comparable decline in the last three quarters as we face a significant hurdle from the 2020 results.
For this year, we expect cemetery atneed revenue to be down versus 2020 but still show significant growth over 2019 pre-COVID levels.
Cemetery preneed sales production grew an unprecedented rate in the back half of 2020, and we believe that momentum will carry over into the first half of 2021.
We expect double-digit percentage growth for the first four months of the year before confronting challenging year-over-year comparisons beginning in May.
For the full year, we anticipate preneed cemetery sales production are to be down in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2020 but still be delivering solid growth as compared to our 2019 levels.
So in closing, in spite of experiencing the most challenging environment, our team continued to deliver.
We rose to meet challenges never faced by our company before, and you have been an extraordinary example of commitment, professionalism and agility.
It's an honor to work with such great people.
As we look ahead, I'm extremely optimistic about our future.
While we do not anticipate the impact from COVID to completely go away, it is our belief that we should see a more muted effect on our results for 2022.
Therefore, we expect a decline in case volume and atneed cemetery revenues and, therefore, on the associated earnings and cash flow from the pull-forward effects of 2020 and 2021.
However, this knowledge that we gained from this awful COVID experience is anticipated to produce a more competitive and profitable operating platform in the years to come.
Therefore, we predict an impressive earnings-per-share growth for 2023 approaching $3 per share, resulting from a combination of enhanced market share and a leaner infrastructure, leveraging technology and a more efficient sales structure.
As the pull forward impact wanes and the baby boomers begin to enter their late 70s, we expect a further acceleration of earnings growth.
With our eyes on the longer term, we are now also continuing to invest in technology and new service offerings that allow us to remain relevant with our consumers, enhance digital clients experience and more efficiently and effectively serve our customers.
And like I've done many times over the past few quarters, I'm going to start by providing you with an update on the strength of our financial position that has supported us through these very volatile times.
I will then move on to address our cash flow results during the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2020, followed by capital deployment activities for the year.
And then I'll end by providing some details of our outlook for 2021.
But I think more importantly than any of that, before we begin, when we are reporting our 2019 earnings almost exactly a year ago today, I don't think any of us could have anticipated what we would be facing in 2020.
During the year, our frontline associates helped our communities deal with this rapidly moving virus with unparalleled poise and dignity, particularly earlier on in the year when there was more speculation than there were facts available about coronavirus.
But even to this day, teams across our network are coming together and sacrificing their personal time, being away from home, all to support their colleagues and their broader communities as well who are managing in current COVID hotspots.
Now I'll shift to the financial update.
So while we entered the pandemic, anchored by a strong financial position and a favorable debt profile, we continue to be very well positioned with a significant amount of liquidity of roughly $670 million at the end of the year, consisting approximately $230 million of cash on hand plus $440 million available on our long-term bank credit facility.
On the higher EBITDA resulting from the strong Q4 results we're talking about today, our leverage remains low at 3.19x at the end of the year.
And as we look beyond the impacts of this pandemic, we still intend to manage leverage in a range of 3.5 to four times net debt to EBITDA.
So let's move to cash flow, which has been resilient for us throughout 2020.
Cash flow in the fourth quarter marked a much stronger-than-expected finish to the year, supported by the earnings outperformance that Tom just mentioned, associated with the surge of COVID-related deaths particularly in late November and in December.
We generated operating cash flow of $245 million during the quarter, representing an increase of $88 million or 56% over the prior year.
This increase is primarily related to the growth in cash earnings in the quarter as well as the decrease in cash interest payments of about $28 million, predominantly as a result of recent debt refinancing transactions.
Also remember, we continue to benefit from the deferral of our payroll tax payments as allowed under the CARES Act, which benefited the quarter by about $13 million and for the full year by about $41 million.
These positive inflows were partially offset by $25 million of higher cash tax payments on the higher earnings as well as a net use of preneed working capital, which we have seen all year on the growth in cemetery preneed property sales sold on an installment basis.
And as we step back and look at the full year, we have generated over $800 million in operating cash flow, representing an increase of $170 million over the prior year.
So let's talk about how we deployed this free cash flow.
During the quarter, we had a very robust capital program, deploying nearly $325 million of capital to reinvest in and grow our businesses as well as return value to our shareholders.
So regarding the breakdown, we invested $56 million in our businesses through maintenance and the cemetery development capital spend, which was about $2 million more than the prior year quarter but in line with our expectations.
Full-year spend was approximately $185 million, which represents a 9% decline from the prior year as we curtailed or deferred certain expenditures during the very early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect to make up in 2021, as I'll address later in my remarks.
During the quarter, we deployed about $35 million toward acquisitions, which was a nice pickup in activity at the end of the year.
For the full-year 2020, we deployed just over $100 million in both acquisitions and growth capex for construction of new funeral homes.
Then finally, in the quarter, we returned nearly $225 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
With our strong liquidity and cash flow as a backdrop, along with our favorable leverage profile, we took the opportunity to deploy a very healthy amount of capital to share repurchases in 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we bought back about 2% of our outstanding shares, bringing the full year reduction in outstanding shares to about 6%.
Now let's shift to our outlook for 2021 and in terms of cash flow and capital deployment.
Tom just gave you some color on the ever-evolving pandemic, making it challenging to forecast with great precision where our results will land in 2021.
There are a few items that I'd like to highlight when thinking about cash flow from ops in 2021.
We will incur three full quarters of what I would consider regular payroll taxes of about $40 million, which we're able to defer in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act.
Additionally, we will also be required to pay half or about $20 million of our deferred payroll taxes in the third quarter of 2021, and the remainder will be due in 2022.
These two items then collectively create a $60 million impact to cash flow in 2021 when you compare it to 2020 associated with payroll taxes.
Federal cash tax payments and state tax payments together are also anticipated to be about $25 million higher than 2020 at about $160 million in '21.
This increase is mostly related to the timing of cash tax payments associated with our stronger-than-expected Q4 2020 financial results that will be paid in early 2021.
And from an effective tax rate standpoint, we continue to model in the range of 24% to 25% in '21.
So moving on to some thoughts about capital deployment as we move forward.
Our expectation for maintenance and cemetery development capital spending in '21 is $235 million to $255 million, which is about $40 million higher than our pre-COVID level spend as we proceed with certain projects deferred from last year.
In addition to these recurring capital expenditures of $245 million at the midpoint, we also expect to deploy $50 million to $100 million toward acquisitions and roughly $50 million to $60 million in new funeral home construction opportunities, which, together, drive low to mid-teen aftertax internal rates of return, well in excess of our cost of capital.
And so with those remarks in closing, 2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we faced in a very long time.
Fortunately, we went into it with a superior balance sheet, and it stayed strong for the duration.
Despite everything that has occurred, 2020 has been an extremely successful year for us, while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges.
","In Q4 2020, Service Corporation International (SCI) reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, surpassing estimates due to a surge in COVID-19-related deaths. Funeral volumes grew 31% in December, driving an increase in funeral revenue despite a decline in funeral sale average. Cemetery revenue also increased significantly, boosted by both at-need and preneed sales. For 2021, SCI anticipates a decline in funeral volume but mid-single-digit growth in preneed funeral sales production. Cemetery at-need revenues are expected to decrease compared to 2020's elevated levels but remain strong. Preneed cemetery sales production is projected to grow in the first half of the year but face challenges later on. Overall, SCI expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.90 in 2021, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 pull-forward and a more efficient operating platform."
MMS_q4_2021.txt,"I'd like to remind everyone that a number of statements being made today will be forward looking in nature.
Please remember that such statements are only predictions.
Actual events and results may differ materially as a result of risks we face, including those discussed in Item 1A of our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K.
Management uses this information internally to analyze the results and believes that may be informative to investors in gauging the quality of our financial performance, identifying trends and providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Rick and David.
As we announced in January, I will retire at the end of this month and David Mutryn will become the Chief Financial Officer on December 1.
I am confident that David is the right person to succeed me as CFO to help guide Maximus in the future.
It has been a privilege to be the CFO for Maximus and a great place to finish my career.
I am proud of all that we accomplished together as a team during my time here.
While we have been diligently reporting our contributions to shareholders, we have not discussed in this forum, the substantial commitments to ESG and our accomplishments in this area over the last five years.
Maximus is a unique company dedicated to delivering better than average returns to all stakeholders, while simultaneously aligned with core ESG principles by making vital government services more accessible to millions of people.
If you look at our progression on the MSCI framework, we began with a B rating in 2016 and currently hold a BBB rating for 2021.
While BBB is a good score, we believe there is more progress to be made.
Our commitment to ESG is a journey of continuous improvement.
We view our ISS governance score of 2 as solid and we are quite pleased with our latest ISS social score of 1, both as of October 2021.
Our recent ESG report includes our updated ESG materiality assessment and ongoing commitment to provide essential services to the most vulnerable citizens in the communities we serve.
Fiscal year 2021 was the dynamic here with the COVID pandemic creating both challenges and opportunities.
Maximus accomplished significant milestones this year, including winning and operating over $1 billion of COVID response work and closing two large and strategic acquisitions.
We completed another significant acquisition in early October with the student loan servicing business for $5.6 million U.S. Department of Education owned borrower accounts, which we have branded as Aidvantage.
The revenue increase was primarily attributable to COVID response work, which grew about $0.9 billion year-over-year and totaled approximately $1.1 billion for the year.
Revenue also increased as a result of the Attain Federal and VES acquisitions, which together contributed $323 million of revenue in the year.
On the bottom line, our full year operating income margin was 9.6% and diluted earnings per share were $4.67.
As you know, operating income margin is calculated after the expense for amortization of intangible assets, which increased significantly due to the two acquisitions that closed during the year.
Excluding the amortization expense, our operating margin would be 10.6% and our adjusted diluted earnings per share would be $5.19.
Let me point out a few items specific to fourth quarter results.
Number one, as expected, short-term COVID response work declined and totaled $225 million in the fourth quarter, which is $246 million less than in the third quarter.
Number two, the fourth quarter included a write-off of fixed assets, leased assets and deferred contract costs pertaining to a contract in its start-up phase in the U.S. Services segment.
While there are often puts and takes in our results, this was a $12 million detriment to pre-tax earnings or $0.14 diluted EPS, and the most significant reason, our results were below the midpoint of our guidance range.
Number three, implied in our previous guidance was the low fourth quarter tax rate, but our tax expense was slightly more favorable.
And number four, adjusting for COVID response work and revenue from the Census contract, our fourth quarter revenue showed normalized organic growth of 3.4% over the comparable prior year period.
I'll now take you through segment fiscal 2021 results.
For the U.S. Services segment, revenue increased to $1.66 billion as compared to $1.33 billion in the prior year.
The segment experienced strong demand for COVID response work, which contributed an estimated $618 million of revenue to the segment in fiscal 2021 compared to an estimated $129 million of this type of work in the prior year.
The segment operating income margin was 15.3% for the full year and 12.2% in the fourth quarter, which fell short of our expectations, due primarily to the single contract write-off I mentioned earlier.
Excluding the write-off, the U.S. Services margin would be 16% for the full year and 15.2% in the fourth quarter.
The segment's COVID response work helped offset the negative operating income impact on core programs, most notably, the pause in Medicaid redeterminations.
The public health emergency has had multiple extensions, most recently of which occurred on October 15 and will remain in effect for 90 days.
Despite the prolonged negative impact, the guidelines for assuming this work, as communicated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, give us confidence that redetermination activities should resume in fiscal 2022.
For the U.S. Federal Services segment, fiscal 2021 revenue increased 15.9% to $1.89 billion.
The segment benefited from COVID response work and the two acquisitions, partially offset by the lower revenue due to the end of the Census contract.
COVID response work contributed an estimated $466 million of revenue to the segment in fiscal 2021 compared to an estimated $71 million of this type of work in the prior year.
As I mentioned, the two acquisitions contributed $323 million this year.
The Census contract contributed $448 million less revenue than in the prior year.
The operating income margin for U.S. Federal Services was 10% in fiscal 2021 as compared to 8.1% in the prior year.
The segment's fourth quarter margin was 9.2% and fell short of our estimates.
This was driven by several non-recurring investments made in the quarter that are expected to benefit our future operating results.
The Outside the U.S. segment experienced strong demand for employment services in fiscal 2021 as it rebounded from the most pronounced impacts of the pandemic.
Revenue for this segment increased approximately $200 million or 40% to $699 million.
Operating income was positive $20 million or a 2.9% margin compared to a $34 million operating loss in the prior year.
As we noted on the August earnings call, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 realized anticipated start-up losses, most notably, due to the U.K. restart program ramping.
Let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow items.
As of September 30, 2021, we had gross debt of $1.52 billion and we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $135 million.
The ratio of debt net of allowed cash to pro forma EBITDA for the full year ended September 30, 2021, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement is 2.3 times.
This compares to 2.4 times at June 30, 2021.
As we stated on our third quarter call, we used our free cash flow in the fourth quarter to reduce our debt.
Cash flows from operations totaled $517 million and free cash flow was $481 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to $245 million and $204 million respectively for the prior year period.
In addition to improved earnings, strong cash flows resulted from the decrease in the investment and working capital of more than $100 million.
This was driven by good collections combined with advanced payments on new work and deferral of payroll taxes as permitted by the U.S. government.
Pro forma DSO was 68 days at September 30, 2021 compared to 77 days for the same day last year.
Our DSO target remains 65 to 80 days.
Turning to fiscal year 2022 guidance.
Revenue is projected to be between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion.
Diluted earnings per share is projected to be between $4 and $4.30.
The midpoint of this guidance implies an operating income margin of 8.4%, which includes approximately $90 million of estimated amortization expense.
Excluding the amortization expense yields adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.07 to $5.37 and the implied operating income margin excluding amortization expense is 10.4%.
We expect cash flows from operations to range between $275 million and $325 million and free cash flow between $225 million and $275 million.
We are projecting that the investment in working capital will increase in fiscal 2022 as the payroll tax deferral is eliminated and the new work matures.
We expect interest expense to be between $30 million and $33 million and the effective income tax rate assuming no change in U.S. federal rates should be between 25% and 26%.
Absent share purchases, we would expect the weighted average shares to be between 62.5 million and 62.6 million.
Turning to segment margins.
We expect our U.S. Services segment to be between 13% and 14% for the year.
We expect the U.S. Federal Services margin to be in the 10% to 11% range.
This expectation includes the Aidvantage program, which we expect to deliver margins in line with similar BPO contracts in our federal portfolio over time.
However, as with many of our contracts, we expect the Aidvantage contract to start with lower margins and increase as the program matures.
Finally, we expect Outside the U.S. operating income margins in the 3% to 5% range.
Let me provide some commentary on the guidance.
On our top-line, the first notable item is COVID response work, which began winding down in the later stages of fiscal year 2021 and is currently expected to contribute about $250 million of revenue in fiscal 2022.
COVID response work is predominantly tied to unemployment insurance support and vaccine administration with shorter periods of performance.
It is important to note the relationships that began with COVID work are now leading to some longer term work, particularly related to unemployment insurance support.
The second item is the start-ups Outside the U.S., including U.K. Restart.
We forecast that these start-ups will add $150 million of revenue to fiscal 2022, which is unchanged from our thinking on the prior earnings call.
The third item is acquisition.
There will be full period revenue contributions from the Attain Federal, VES and the Aidvantage acquisitions.
Combined, these three acquisitions make up approximately $1 billion of our forecasted fiscal 2022 revenue.
If you separate out the COVID work, the acquisitions and a small amount of Census contract revenue in fiscal 2021, our top-line guidance reflects normalized organic growth of 18% with a profile that increases over the course of the year.
This demonstrates that our core business growth engine is accelerating driven by new contract awards in fiscal 2021.
We were successful in winning new work awards in the year with a total contract value of $3.5 billion.
Of that, less than $1 billion was associated with COVID response work.
Our largest single award was the U.K. Restart Programme with a total contract value of more than $960 million over six years.
In addition, the U.S. segments were awarded several new contracts, all of which are longer term work.
On the bottom line, we anticipate a slow start to fiscal 2022, but also a solid line of sight to a strong second half.
There are two primary factors causing this.
Number one, the continued delays in our core programs returning to pre-pandemic levels creates depressed earnings in the first half of fiscal 2022.
As a reminder, we previously noted that the COVID work may decline before we see the corp programs return, which is what we are now experiencing.
Number two, the start-up contracts in the Outside the U.S. segment, most notably U.K. Restart, will continue to ramp with operating losses in the first half of fiscal 2022.
We continue to anticipate these programs will achieve breakeven by the midpoint of the year and significant financial improvement in the back half with performance in our corporate guideposts of 10% to 15% operating income margins over their lives.
The start-up contracts are progressing well and are currently meeting our expectations.
To quantify the steeper ramp in earnings, we forecast 60% to 65% of our operating income and earnings to be realized in the second half of fiscal 2022.
While our earnings profile suggests a valley for the first half of the fiscal year, we anticipate exiting the year at a strong run rate.
I noted the expected segment margin ranges earlier.
The margins in all three segments are expected to improve over the course of the year as the quarterly revenue profile is expected to be less deep than earnings.
We do not provide quarterly guidance, but I will share that the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is forecasted to look similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 after normalizing for the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter.
Our guidance does reflect our expectation that the public health emergency will conclude and that redeterminations will restart in our third fiscal quarter.
The Outside the U.S. start-ups are ramping up, and we have other portions of the fiscal 2021 new work awards that are scheduled to begin generating revenue in fiscal 2022.
Delays to any of these items, many of which are outside our control, may cause revenue and earnings to move to the right and to potentially fall short of guidance for fiscal 2022.
In closing, Bruce, Rick and I, along with the broader leadership team, are proud of how Maximus rose to overcome the unique challenges in the last two years and emerge a stronger company.
We are pleased to see the underlying organic growth improving as we come out of the pandemic and our recent acquisitions performing well.
On behalf of the management team, we offer Rick our deep appreciation for your leadership.
You have led Maximus through many accomplishments during your tenure as CFO, including leading our M&A strategy development with six major acquisitions, beginning with Acentia in April 2015; closing a new corporate credit facility and funding the VES acquisition through new debt sources for the company; helping navigate our international growth into new geographies as we grew from four countries to nine; pushing us to think and operate as a company at scale, including maturing our corporate back office capacity, which proved vital to supporting our inorganic and organic growth; mentoring and sponsoring many of our rising stars and building a talent pipeline not only in the finance division, but across the company at large; and championing our ESG strategy development and advancements.
I should note that when we ended fiscal year 2014, we had revenues of $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.11.
Today, we are reporting $4.25 billion in revenue and diluted earnings per share of $4.67, a compound growth rate of 14% and 12% respectively.
Your expertise helped us continue our growth as a leading partner to government in the delivery of critical programs on a global scale.
Since the beginning of fiscal year '21, Maximus has completed four acquisitions, realized several large wins, transitioned leadership in our U.S. Federal segment and more.
I will spend my time today talking about the progress we've made toward executing the strategy I have articulated since April 2018, how these four acquisitions support those goals and some refinements we're making to that strategy.
On October 6, we closed a contract innovation with Navient Corporation, which the Department of Education Federal Student Aid or FSA approved on October 20 to begin servicing student loans in January 2022 under the new brand name Aidvantage.
As a long-term partner and provider of consumer engagement services to government, Maximus will focus on the end-to-end borrower experience and help fulfill FSA's mission, while remaining independent and conflict-free as we do not and will never provide loan origination, consolidation or collection services.
We view student loan servicing as an opportunity to apply our insights, expertise and quality-driven approach through support of both the FSA and the agency's customers, student borrowers.
Aidvantage is an extension of a long-standing partnership to support FSA and is in line with our core business.
This development demonstrates the availability of increased scope for companies that can successfully manage citizen interactions at scale and our ability to build on trusted relationships with government, a core component of our business model.
As you may recall, we have a position on the FSA NextGen contract vehicle to which this work will likely transition in future contract periods.
Our immediate priority is to successfully transition the 5.6 million Navient borrower accounts to provide stability and high quality service as student loan repayment obligations resume on February 1, 2022.
We subsequently will focus on the FSA's stated goals of improving the borrower experience through improved performance, transparency and accountability under the loan servicing contract.
To that end, our plan includes implementing best practices and continuous review, performance management and quality monitoring to promote greater transparency and maintain compliance.
Again, our role is solely to support student borrowers as they navigate repayment, and for many, options related to available authorized loan forgiveness programs.
As an independent and conflict-free partner to FSA, we will not own, consolidate or originate loans.
Meanwhile, the integration of our VES and Attain acquisitions are going as planned, operating as expected and delivering financial results that are consistent with our acquisition analysis.
To provide a bit more color, I'm particularly proud of our Attain colleagues' recent success, including securing the rebid and expansion of critical work for the Securities and Exchange Commission and supporting the U.S. customs and immigration services client at a critical juncture in their mission.
Likewise, our VES colleagues have achieved record volumes recently in scheduling veterans for critical disability benefit evaluations as that program moves closer to its pre-pandemic operating model.
As for our fourth acquisition in the United Kingdom, I'm pleased to share that Connect Assist, a market-leading provider of citizen engagement centers and digital services has joined Maximus U.K.
This combination strengthens our program administration capabilities and enables our expansion into adjacent markets.
As we previously lacked contact center capabilities in country, a pre-requisite for many government procurements.
Maximus now employees more than 4,500 people in the United Kingdom, including approximately 1,400 healthcare professionals across more than 270 locations, serving as one of the largest providers of employment, health and disability support program administration in the country.
The tireless work of our team this past year resulted in several new contracts and opportunities across the segments.
This includes approximately $1.1 billion of COVID response work to help governments respond to the pandemic.
Our ability to respond quickly and effectively for our clients has provided the proof points and enhanced our relationships now driving additional work opportunities such as unemployment insurance program support services for several states beyond the pandemic.
This fiscal year, we won more new employment services start-up work outside the U.S. than we projected.
This includes the notable U.K. Restart Programme where Maximus provides tailored support to help people back into work.
Thus far, thousands of people have been supported by our delivery of the Restart Programme with nearly 1,500 people finding sustainable employment since we began delivery at the end of June 2021, tracking very favorably against our forecast.
Turning to new awards and pipeline as of September 30.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, full fiscal year signed awards were $5.62 billion of total contract value at September 30.
Further, at September 30, there were another $721 million worth of contracts that have been awarded but not yet signed.
Of the $5.6 billion of signed work, $3.5 billion represents new work awards with less than $1 billion associated with COVID response work, illustrating a healthy level of new work in our core business.
Let me turn our attention to our pipeline of addressable sales opportunities.
Our total contract value pipeline at September 30 was $33.9 billion compared to $33.6 billion reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
The September 30 pipeline is comprised of approximately $8.8 billion in proposals pending, $1.4 billion in proposals and preparation and $23.7 billion in opportunities tracking.
Of the total pipeline, 69% represents new work opportunities.
It has been 20 long months since the start of the Public Health Emergency or PHE.
We anticipate that PHE will expire at the end of the first calendar quarter of 2022.
With this in mind, as David noted, we expect a solid second half of FY '22, which means, we should exit the year at a strong run rate.
Taken together, our view is that the market and company operating dynamics anticipated in the second half of FY '22 create a positive environment and momentum for the business.
These dynamics include not just the anticipated conclusion of the PHE and resumption of pre-pandemic activities, including redeterminations, but also the start-up contracts exiting that phase, new organic wins in U.S. Services coming online, the FY '21 acquisitions maturing in their integration and contribution and the benefits of a substantial new work pipeline.
I also want to address an area that has received national attention.
In September, President Biden signed an executive order requiring U.S. based employees or federal government contractors to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with limited exemptions for medical and religious reasons.
Earlier this month, per the President's direction, OSHA also mandated vaccination or weekly testing for employers with 100 or more employees, which goes into effect in January 2022.
We are planning for implementation of these requirements, which includes extensive employee education and resources, paid time off to receive a vaccination and frequent reminders regarding timelines and options.
As we have throughout the pandemic, we have prioritized employee safety and well being, and we actively monitor guidance and update our procedures accordingly.
Demand for talent is highly competitive.
Our implementation of these requirements may result in some workforce attrition and difficulty meeting our existing or future hiring needs.
That being said, Maximus has a strong talent brand that was if anything strengthened as a key differentiator over the past 20 months with the many benefits and programs we quickly implemented to support and protect our people.
During FY '21, we hired more than 42,000 employees around the world.
To support the training and development of our employees, over 165,000 online learning resources and tools are available, in addition to other development opportunities.
We continue to operate in a hybrid environment, recognizing that some employees are required to be on site due to customer requirements.
We are imagining new ways of working that put us in an even better position over the long-term to attract the necessary talent for our business through workplace flexibility and outside of historical geographical bounds.
On a final note, I am pleased that our execution on our three-pronged strategy of expanding our clinical business, driving digital transformation for our customers and the citizens we serve and expanding to adjacent markets has successfully led to balanced organic and inorganic growth since I became CEO and set the table for future organic growth in our expanded core and new markets.
With this as the backdrop and our current focus on delivering shareholder value through our FY '21 acquisitions, we have concurrently kicked off a three to five year strategy refresh initiative with participation from across the business.
Not only do we seek to define what the next phase in our clinical and technology journey will look like, but we are looking further over the horizon than we would in our annual planning process.
I'm excited about the energy and ideas that this collaborative process has already yielded and look forward to sharing more formal insights with our shareholders and the analyst community during our planned Investor Day in 2022.
And with that, we will open the line for Q&A.
","Maximus, a government services provider, announced financial results for fiscal 2021 and guidance for fiscal 2022. Revenue increased primarily due to COVID response work and acquisitions. The company expects fiscal 2022 revenue between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion, driven by full-year contributions from recent acquisitions and normalized organic growth. Excluding amortization expenses, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be $5.07 to $5.37, with a slower start in the first half due to delayed core program recoveries and start-up contracts. Despite this, the company anticipates a strong second half and solid earnings exit rate. The company has a robust pipeline of opportunities, with a total contract value of $33.9 billion. Ongoing ESG commitments continue to be a priority, as evidenced by the company's MSCI BBB rating and progress on its ESG materiality assessment. Maximus remains optimistic about the future, with a refreshed strategy initiative underway to drive organic growth, accelerate digital transformation, and expand into adjacent markets."
NX_q1_2021.txt,"I'll now discuss the financial results.
We reported revenue of $230.1 million during the first quarter of 2021, which represents an increase of 17.1%, compared to $196.6 million during the first quarter of 2020.
The increase was primarily the result of increased demand for our products across all product lines and operating segments.
We reported net income of $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the three months ended January 31, 2021, compared to $10,000 or $0.00 per diluted share during the three months ended January 31, 2020.
The increase in net income was somewhat offset by a $6.7 million increase in SG&A during the quarter, $4.6 million of which was related to the valuation of our stock-based comp awards, mainly due to an increase in our stock price, and $1.6 million of which was due to higher medical claims.
On an adjusted basis, net income increased to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.2 million or $0.04 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2020.
The adjustments being made to earnings per share are for restructuring charges, certain executive severance charges, loss on the sale of plant, accelerated D&A, foreign currency transaction impacts and transaction and advisory fees.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter increased by 55.4% to $24.3 million, compared to $15.7 million during the same period of last year.
The increase is largely due to operating leverage from higher volumes.
From a margin standpoint, this increase represents adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Cash used for operating activities was $3.4 million during the three months ended January 31, 2021, and compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2020.
While our free cash flow was negative, this is typical for the first quarter of each year, and we did show improvement compared to last year.
In fact, we did not need to borrow on our revolver during the quarter and still managed to both repay $5 million in bank debt and repurchase approximately $1.9 million of our stock.
Our balance sheet is strong, our liquidity position is solid, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA is unchanged at 0.6 times as of January 31, 2021.
We will remain focused on managing working capital and generating cash as the year progresses.
We will also continue to be opportunistic with respect to repurchasing our stock.
Based on our strong first-quarter results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year and now expect approximately 12% sales growth in our North American fenestration segment, approximately 5% sales growth in our North American cabinet components segment and approximately 22% sales growth in our European fenestration segment.
We're now comfortable providing the following full-year 2021 guidance: Net sales of $945 million to $965 million; adjusted EBITDA of $112 million to $122 million; depreciation of approximately $33 million; amortization of approximately $14 million; SG&A of approximately $105 million.
Note that this is higher than previously expected due to an increase in stock-based comp expense and more normalized medical costs; interest expense of $3 million to $4 million; a tax rate of 26% to 27%; capex of about $30 million; and then free cash flow of approximately $60 million.
If you adjust for the expected increase in SG&A, the implied incremental adjusted EBITDA margin is in the mid-20% range.
So we feel it would be necessary to provide some direction on a quarterly basis.
From a cadence perspective for Q2, on a consolidated basis, we expect net sales to be up approximately 25% year over year.
We believe the strongest revenue growth and margin expansion in Q2 will likely come from our European fenestration segment, since our plants in the U.K. were shut down in March of last year and didn't come back online completely until May.
Looking ahead, on a consolidated basis, we currently expect net sales growth of approximately 12% year over year in Q3.
And due to the tough comp, we may not see any growth in Q4.
In addition, again, on a consolidated basis, it could prove challenging to realize margin expansion in the second half due to inflationary pressures, increased stock-based comp expense and a normalization of medical expenses.
To summarize, on a consolidated basis for the full year, we currently expect to generate net sales growth of approximately 12% year over year to the midpoint of guidance, while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margin in the low 12% range.
Demand for our products during the first quarter of 2021 proved to be even stronger than our expectations.
And I'm very pleased with the results in what is traditionally our weakest quarter.
We remain steadfast in our pursuit of operational excellence, cash flow optimization and improving return on invested capital throughout all segments of our business.
Continued success on all these efforts will create further value for our shareholders and should position the company well for any opportunities that may arise in the future.
Prior to discussing the segment detail, I'd like to provide some color on the macroeconomic conditions of the markets we serve.
Overall, we are still experiencing high demand across all of our product lines.
In North America, the new construction market remains strong and sales of existing homes, which is a key indicator for repair and remodel also remains healthy.
Specific to cabinet components, the semi-custom segment, which is the main segment we serve, is starting to show growth above that of the stock segment.
As a matter of reference, there was a significant shift in market share away from the semi-custom segment to the stock segment over the past few years.
So the recent KCMA data is encouraging in that it shows the semi-custom segment gaining ground over stock.
and Germany remains robust despite the strict and ongoing COVID-related measures.
We believe the demand is strong because many international markets remain underbuilt with an infrastructure that is aging, and regulatory requirements on energy efficiency align very well with our product offering.
We also believe demand in Europe and the U.K. is being favorably impacted by the continued shift of the discretionary income away from travel and leisure activities into home improvement projects.
Although we remain optimistic on macroeconomic conditions in all the markets we serve, we also see some challenging headwinds.
We are seeing increased inflationary pressures on most of our major raw material input costs, as well as some large dollar expense items such as freight.
These pressures were recently exasperated due to the severe winter weather in Texas and along the Gulf Coast, which caused delays and shortages of key chemicals, feedstocks and energy supply.
As a reminder, for the most part, we have contractual pass-throughs for the major raw materials we use in North America, but there is often a lag depending on the contract, anywhere from 30 to 90 days.
We do not have these contractual pass-throughs in Europe and the U.K. So our ability to pass on any increases through price becomes more important.
And for the most part, we've been very successful in doing just that.
Another current headwind is the availability of labor.
Company wide, we have approximately 400 open positions, which equates to roughly 10% of our global workforce.
This is an issue that is not unique to Quanex, and it's impacting manufacturing operations in many different markets and industries.
In some of our plants, this issue has resulted in high levels of overtime, extended lead times and even customer allocations in some limited circumstances.
I will now provide my comments on performance by segment for our fiscal first quarter.
And as a general statement, results were outstanding in each of these operating segments.
Our North American fenestration segment generated revenue of $128.1 million in Q1, which was $17.7 million or approximately 16% higher than prior-year Q1.
Strong demand across all product lines, share gains in our screens business and increased capacity utilization on our vinyl extrusion assets, all contributed to the above market performance.
Adjusted EBITDA of $16.4 million in this segment was $7.7 million or approximately 88% higher than prior-year Q1.
Volume-related operating leverage, the implementation of annual pricing adjustments, operational improvements and lower SG&A, all contributed to the improved performance year over year.
Our European fenestration segment generated revenue of $49.1 million in the first quarter, which is $12.3 million or approximately 34% higher than prior year.
Excluding foreign exchange impact, this would equate to an increase of approximately 28%.
and Continental Europe remains strong.
Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million, resulted in margin expansion of approximately 660 basis points year over year.
Volume-related impacts, timing of pricing actions and operational improvements more than offset inflationary pressure toward the end of the quarter.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $54 million in Q1, which was $4 million or approximately 8% better than prior year.
Demand for our cabinet components products was solid throughout the quarter as the market continued to see strength in new construction and R&R.
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 million in this segment which represents margin expansion of approximately 330 basis points compared to prior year.
Increased volume and benefits realized from new assets put into service last year were the primary drivers of improvements in the quarter.
Unallocated corporate and other costs were $6 million for the quarter, which is $5.4 million higher than prior year.
As Scott mentioned, the primary drivers of this increase were stock-based compensation expense related to share price appreciation, along with higher medical expenses, as our employees have started to feel more comfortable going back to their doctors.
It is also worth noting that we realized the benefit for medical cost in Q1 of last year.
As I mentioned earlier, we remain focused on operational excellence, cash flow optimization and improving return on invested capital throughout all segments of our business.
Our continued progress on these fronts is driving results and has allowed us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down debt further during a quarter where we have historically been a net borrower.
In summary, macro data points for our business are positive.
We are executing on our plan and performing well from an operational standpoint, and our orders remain strong.
As such, on a consolidated basis, we are confident in our ability to deliver low double-digit revenue growth this year while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 12% range, despite the increasing inflationary pressures.
And with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.
","Quanex Building Products reported strong first-quarter results with revenue increasing by 17.1% to $230.1 million, driven by robust demand across product lines. Net income improved significantly, reaching $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share, despite increased SG&A expenses. Adjusted net income grew to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA surged by 55.4% to $24.3 million, reflecting volume growth and operating leverage. Management raised its full-year guidance, anticipating 12% sales growth in North America and Europe and adjusted EBITDA of $112-$122 million. However, the company faces headwinds from inflationary pressures on raw materials and freight, as well as labor shortages. Strong macroeconomic conditions and continued execution of operational improvements remain key drivers of success."
LPX_q1_2021.txt,"My name is Aaron Howald, and I'm LP's Director of Investor Relations.
All these materials are available on LP's Investor Relations website, www.
Rather than reading those statements, I will refer to you to those supplemental materials.
Robust customer demand for all of LP's products has continued, driven by ongoing strength in homebuilding and remodeling, resulting in an outstanding quarter for LP.
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million.
Smooth and ExpertFinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching 8% of total SmartSide volume.
OSB prices continued to climb throughout Q1, with the result that LP's OSB segment generated extraordinary cash flow.
LP's South American segment also had a very strong quarter, with 50% more sales and 3 times more EBITDA than the first quarter of last year.
As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records.
Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan Society.
Let me briefly update you on those projects.
Houlton conversion is under way and on schedule despite some expected difficulties with travel and contractor access presented by COVID.
We expect to begin SmartSide production at Houlton less than a year from now in late Q1 of next year.
We are excited about the capacity expansion of these investments in Houlton represent, and we are gratified by the enthusiastic responses from local and regional suppliers and community stakeholders.
Given the strength of SmartSide demand, we are exploring options to accelerate the conversion of Sagola.
We're also evaluating and prioritizing subsequent projects to add capacity by conversion and/or expansion of existing facilities as well as growing prefinishing capacity.
SmartSide has a long runway for growth ahead as we innovate, capture share, expand addressable markets and execute an aggressive capacity expansion strategy.
Process to resume OSB reduction in Peace Valley is also going quite well.
I want to complement the small containment has maintained the mill since we idled it in the summer of 2019.
They have kept the equipment in excellent condition, and we anticipate minimal impediments to an efficient restart.
Last quarter, I spoke about the challenges presented by shortages of MDI, the resident use and manufacture of SmartSide and OSB.
MDI availability has improved significantly, and we are essentially back to normal levels of supply with OSB mills once again using planned levels of MDI.
This episode has highlighted the strategic value of having Siding and OSB integrated in LP's portfolio.
SmartSide uses MDI exclusively, but OSB can use alternate rests.
When supply has become constrained, we were able to allocate scarce MDI from OSB to Siding.
Without which Siding, we have struggled to achieve another outstanding quarter of growth.
While the MDI supply has improved, global shortage of vital asset tape-based adhesives has forced decreased production of TechShield, LP's Radiant Barrier sheeting product in the second quarter.
The vinyl acetate supply situation is improving, and we expect to be back to normal levels of textile production by the end of the quarter.
However, as COVID subsides in North America and the broader county rebounds a tremendous supply chain disruptions and type logistics availability are likely to present challenges going forward.
We recognize the difficulties this creates for LP's customers, particularly in an environment with such strong demand.
We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of these issues through strategic sourcing and network optimization, and we are adding SmartSide and OSB capacity as safely, efficiently and quickly as possible.
Finally, I'm happy to announce that LP is in the initial phases of returning to our national headquarters after more than a year of working from home.
And while COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the U.S. and Chile, vaccination rates continue to lag in Canada and Brazil.
The situation is improving, but we are not out of the woods yet.
Ongoing diligence in care exercised by LP's pandemic response team and mill employees are helping minimize operational impacts from COVID, enabling LP to supply our customers the products they need to build and renovate homes.
I encourage all of them and all of you on the call to continue to exercise appropriate precautions and get vaccinated as soon as possible.
LP had a remarkable first quarter.
And while challenges remain, very strong housing in RNR markets resulting in intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, keeping our near-term outlook exceptionally positive.
Slide six shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by 74% to just over $1 billion, driven by 49% growth in SmartSide and over $330 million of significantly higher OSB prices.
The resulting EBITDA of $461 million is more than 5 times last year's result.
We generated $314 million of operating cash flow, including increased capital investments and heavy spending on logs, common practice for LP in the first quarter.
The $3.01 per share of adjusted earnings is 10 times that in the first quarter last year.
In terms of capital allocation, we paid $17 million in dividends in the first quarter and spent $122 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares.
We've continued buying back shares through the second quarter and as of the close of business yesterday, had just $32 million remaining of our existing $300 million buyback authorization.
All else equal, that remaining authorization will be exhausted by the end of this week.
I'm therefore, delighted to report that LP's Board of Directors has authorized a further $1 billion of share repurchases, which we plan to launch immediately.
LP's Board also declared a dividend of $0.16 per share payable on June 1.
Slide seven highlights the cleanliness of the quarter from a reporting perspective.
Continued SmartSide growth and OSB price appreciation resulted in $93 million and $333 million, respectively, of incremental revenue for the quarter, compared to which everything else is really just a rounding error.
All $333 million of the incremental OSB pricing and 55% of the incremental SmartSide revenue translated into EBITDA, with everything else aggregating to a net negative of $6 million.
Slide eight provides an update on our transformation.
On a trailing 12-month basis, SmartSide revenue grew at twice the rate of single-family housing starts.
Consequently, and as the table on the right shows, SmartSide growth dominates the first quarter, accounting for $53 million or $65 million transformation in the quarter.
The resident substitution, which Brad referenced earlier, accounts for the negative $4 million in efficiency.
Given that SmartSide growth contributes the lion's share of our transformation dollars in the quarter, Slide nine looks a little deep into that growth.
The bar chart on the left is not repeat of Slide 8.
This chart shows SmartSide revenue growth for just the quarter relative to single family starts.
The pie chart on the right provides more resolution of the also SmartSide growth.
While total volume grew by 39%, the volume of the more innovative smooth prefinished and shrink products grew to 140%.
As such, their share of the total volume increased under 5% to just over 8%.
The substantially higher average selling prices of these new products also contributed one point to overall price growth in the fourth quarter.
The waterfalls on Slides 10 and 11 show year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter.
Slide 10 covers Siding.
The 49% revenue growth for SmartSide is the result of 39% volume growth compounded by 7% price growth and at $93 million in sales and $51 million in EBITDA, for an incremental EBITDA margin of 55%.
OEE and sales and marketing efficiencies offset increased costs for freight and the dwindling nonrecurrence of fiber sales reduced revenue by $20 million and EBITDA by $2 million.
The resulting Siding segment EBITDA of $19 million on $285 million of revenue, yields an EBITDA margin of 32%.
Slide 11 shows the quarter in more detail for OSB and is dominated by ongoing record high OSB prices.
We estimate the impact of MDI scarcity and alternate resin substitution at roughly 80 million square feet or 7% of volume due to reduced operating efficiency for OEE.
And as Brad said, the supply chain for that resin seems to have stabilized.
We will, of course, continue to monitor that situation and other potential supply chain interruptions closely.
LP's ability to substitute alternate resins for OSB production and therefore, to be able to strategically allocate all available MDI to the Siding was a unanticipated benefit of having these segments under the LP umbrella.
OSB prices will continue to grab headlines for sure, but OMP's results this quarter are no small measure of testament to the agility of the Siding and OSB operations team and LP's strategic sourcing team as they collaboratively navigated the MDl shortage.
And this is almost entirely the result of OSB prices raising accounts receivable balances and the normal seasonal accumulation of logs I mentioned earlier.
The bridge from the $314 million of operating cash flow to the net change in cash is similarly uneventful.
With buybacks, capex, dividends and payments associated with refinancing, our long-term debt as the only material items.
Reconciliations of net income to both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income are also straightforward with depreciation and a rather large but appropriately proportional provision for taxes as the only items I've not already mentioned.
Slide 12 provides updated guidance for capital expenditures for the year.
As Brad said, we are exploring opportunities to accelerate our siding capacity expansion.
The Houlton conversion, restarting Peace Valley, other growth capital and the basis of sustaining maintenance, altogether, bring our capital expenditures for the full year in the range of $230 million to $250 million.
In other words, we're raising our tax guidance by about $10 million.
And with extremely robust housing and repair and remodel markets, fueling intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, our order files give us some visibility into the remainder of the second quarter.
For the OSB segment, prices continue to climb, with the result that we believe OSB revenue will be at least 30% sequentially higher in the second quarter than in the first.
We also expect another strong quarter of SmartSide growth with revenue for the second quarter, at least 30% higher than last year, which would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above 20%.
Assuming the Siding and OSB scenarios I just detailed and given all the usual caveats about certain demand shocks or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the second quarter to be at least $580 million, another quarter of record results and outstanding cash flow generation.
Before handing the call over for Q&A, I do want to discuss our expectations for full year revenue growth for SmartSide.
Demand continues to be very strong, and we expect to continue running our mills at or near capacity at for the remainder of the year.
Also, ExpertFinish, Smooth and Shakes, should continue to grow as a percentage of total Smartside volume and revenue.
However, given the acceleration of growth in the second half of last year, we simply cannot increase year-over-year revenue by much more than 10% in the second half of 2021.
So all said, this would bring full year SmartSide growth to roughly twice our previous long-term guidance of 10% to 12% per year.
","Driven by robust demand for SmartSide products, LP experienced exceptional first-quarter results. SmartSide net sales surged by nearly 50% to $283 million, with EBITDA more than doubling to $90 million, due in part to increased sales of innovative pre-finished products. OSB prices also remained high, contributing to remarkable cash flow in the OSB segment. Furthermore, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales and generated record quarterly EBITDA of $461 million and operating cash flow of $314 million, resulting in an impressive $3.01 per share in earnings. Looking ahead, LP is accelerating its SmartSide capacity expansion plan, with the Houlton conversion project on schedule to begin production in late Q1 2022. Despite supply chain challenges, including the recent shortage of vital adhesive, the company remains optimistic due to strong housing and repair markets, which are fueling high demand for both SmartSide and OSB. To further support growth, LP has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and declared a dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on June 1st."
AIR_q1_2022.txt,"I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 results.
Our positive momentum continued with another quarter of solid results, despite the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compared to the prior year period, sales were up 14% from $401 million to 405 -- $455 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 206% from $0.17 per share to $0.52 per share.
Our sales to commercial customers increased 52% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%.
We are particularly pleased that our sequential growth from Q4, Q1 was 4%, notwithstanding the fact that our first quarter typically declines from our fourth quarter as a result of seasonality in our business.
Sequential growth in our commercial activities was 17%.
This improvement was driven by our parts businesses, which is an encouraging indicator of returning demand.
The strong performance in the quarter was also due to the robust demand for our airframe MRO services.
Notably, the significant majority of our MRO volume has been on standard maintenance work as opposed to catch-up work.
Our operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter on an adjusted basis up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.
For context, our margin this quarter was actually higher than 2 years ago prior to the pandemic even though our revenue was down $86 million or 16%.
This performance demonstrates the operating leverage that we have created over the last 18 months by optimizing our MRO operations, exiting underperforming activities and reducing indirect and overhead costs.
It was another strong quarter, as we generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations.
We also continue to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program.
Excluding the impact of that AR program, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operation was $26 million.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced several new business wins.
First, we announced an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation product.
This award reflects the power of our independent distribution offering to component OEMs as well as the strength of our balance sheet.
Second, we announced a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes.
Like our prior C40 aircraft delivery contract with the U.S. Marine Corps, this contract demonstrates the significant cost savings available to government customers by procuring in the aftermarket.
Finally, we announced an extension of our component support program with Volotea, a growing low cost Spanish carrier which reflects the market's continued demand for this offering and our ability to drive, lower operating costs with superior operating performance.
Before turning it over to Sean, I would like to comment on the critical role that AAR in the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
We had over a 150 people station in country primarily in support of our WASS program.
Over a 36 hour period, our WASS team transported approximately 2,000 U.S. embassy personnel to Kabul International Airport to support their evacuation from the country.
All of our employees subsequently departed the country safely as well and I'm exceptionally proud of our team support of state department personnel under very difficult circumstances.
Our sales in the quarter of $455.1 million were up 14% or $54.3 million year-over-year.
Sales inour Aviation Services segment were up 19.8% driven by recovery in our commercial markets.
Sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down $17.7 million, reflecting the divestiture of our Composites business and strong performance of the U.S. Air Force pallet contract in the prior year quarter.
Gross profit margin in the quarter was 14.2% versus 12.1% in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 16.1% versus 13% in the prior year quarter.
The significant improvement reflects the cost take out and efficiency initiatives we have implemented.
As the commercial market recovers, we would expect to continue to generate higher gross margins, given the fixed nature of some of our cost of sales and the higher margin nature of our parts business, which is not yet participated in the market recovery to the same degree as our maintenance business.
As we indicated during last quarter's call, one of our commercial programs contracts was terminated during the quarter.
We recognized $10 million of charges primarily related to this termination and an asset impairment.
SG&A expenses in the quarter were $49.3 million or 10.8% of sales excluding severance of about $1 million, this would have been closer to 10.6% of sales.
This is down from 11.3% in the year ago quarter and 11.2% in Q4.
As a reminder, last year's results had contemporary cost savings due to salary and benefit reductions that were in place through Q2 of last year.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.7 million compared to $1.6 million last year, driven by lower borrowings.
Average diluted share count for the quarter was $35.7 million versus $35 million for the prior year quarter.
With respect to Afghanistan, as we discussed on last quarter's call, we had in-country activity on 2 programs, our WASS program supporting the State Department and our C130 program supporting four Afghan Airforce aircraft.
In conjunction with the state department's exit from Afghanistan, we are winding down related activities and expect that to be completed later this quarter.
The C130 program is currently continuing with support of 2 of the 4 aircraft based in the UAE.
In total, our FY'21 sales in Afghanistan were $67 million, the margins on these activities were consistent with the overall WASS program, which we have described in the past as being high single-digit operating margin.
As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $17.5 million as we continue to reduce our rotables and inventory balances.
In addition, we reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $8.4 million in the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $80.2 million and net leverage of only 0.6 times.
Looking forward, we expect that demand for our MRO activities will remain strong as airlines continue to focus both on readiness to support the recovery in air travel and on preserving a healthy maintenance supply chain.
With respect to part supply, while we saw increasing levels of activity during the quarter, we expect stable performance in the near term as a result of the uncertainty created by the Delta variant.
On the government side, the exit from Afghanistan as well as the programs nearing natural completion points will have a near-term impact on our business.
However, our Department of Energy contract is an offsetting award that demonstrates the fundamental value proposition of our commercial best practices business model.
In addition, we continue to build a solid past performance history.
As such, we believe that over time, we remain in an excellent position to grow our government business through additional program wins and expansions of our current positions.
Based on these near term dynamics, we currently expect overall Q2 performance to be similar to Q1.
While there remains uncertainty over the timing of the recovery.
We are confident that a recovery will occur and we believe, we are exceptionally well positioned.
We have emerged from the crisis with an even stronger balance sheet, our government and commercial pipelines are full and the operating leverage we have created positions us to continue to drive further margin expansion.
","In Q1, the company reported strong results despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Sales rose 14% to $455 million, driven by a 52% increase in commercial sales. Adjusted earnings per share surged 206% to $0.52. The robust demand for airframe MRO services and parts businesses fueled this growth. The company's operating margin improved from 5.2% in Q4 to 5.5% in Q1, highlighting its cost optimization efforts. Furthermore, the company generated $18 million in operating cash flow and reduced its accounts receivable financing program usage. It secured several new business wins, including an exclusive distribution agreement with Arkwin and a contract with the Department of Energy. The company's strong balance sheet, with net debt of $80.2 million and a net leverage ratio of 0.6x, positions it well for future growth. Despite the impact of the Afghanistan withdrawal on its Expeditionary Services segment, the company expects stable performance for Q2 and remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, relying on its enhanced operating leverage and a solid government and commercial pipeline."
JLL_q4_2021.txt,"During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors.
A transcript of this conference call will also be posted on our website.
The recovery we have seen over the past year continues to accelerate, led by strength in our leasing and capital markets businesses.
Our closely integrated One JLL philosophy and market-leading products and services are resonating with clients.
I would like to express my gratitude to all JLL employees for the outstanding service they provided to our clients in 2021.
This dedication to serve our clients has led us to transform JLL into a more efficient global enterprise.
Three years ago, we embarked upon an ambitious multiyear transformation to enhance the seamless global integration of our services and expertise.
During this time, we made several organizational design changes, orientating around business lines in set of geographies.
These realignments will enable JLL to reduce structural complexities and leverage best practices while accelerating growth.
Today, we are announcing the final phase of this transformation process, which will align our external reporting with how we internally manage our business.
This new reporting structure will make JLL easier for investors to understand and will provide enhanced transparency of our business line.
Karen will discuss the reporting change in more detail shortly.
Turning to the current market environment.
Conditions continue to improve, but still significantly vary by geography.
And the global office leasing market, the emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant has brought additional uncertainty to the return to office time line.
Despite this uncertainty, we have not noticed a discernible impact in our leasing numbers as companies continue to take a longer-term view of the future office needs.
Channels research indicates that in the fourth quarter, all three global regions registered positive net absorption in the office market for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, creating a solid foundation for the ongoing recovery.
remained slightly below 2019 levels, but continued to show improvement.
In the U.S. specifically, fourth quarter office leasing volumes were down 23% compared to pre-pandemic levels.
office leasing volumes were down 44% just two quarters ago.
Overall, we continue to believe office demand will recover to pre-pandemic levels and that the office will remain the center of the word ecosystem.
Shifting to other sectors.
Activity in the industrial and multifamily markets remain robust in the fourth quarter.
High demand and tight supply continued to define the industrial space, leading to rent increases and record low vacancy rates.
The scarcity of land near ports and other key logistical areas is driving a supply demand imbalance and additional supply will be needed to meet growing demand in these industrial markets.
Global capital markets transactions volumes reached an all-time high in 2021.
Investment activities served 54% to $1.3 trillion, supported by an improving global economy and high levels of liquidity.
Cross-border capital flows, which were at a depressed level in 2020 accelerated throughout 2021 and closed the year at record high levels.
The combination of accelerating cross-border capital flows and significant levels of dry powder bode well for sustaining recent growth rates within capital markets.
Similar to the trends in leasing, strong performance in the industrial logistics and multifamily sectors benefited capital markets volume in 2021.
The office and retail sectors improved as the year went on, although their share of transaction volume remains below pre-pandemic levels.
Fundamentals in the multifamily market remained strong and show no signs of cooling off.
Urban markets are recovering while rent increases in suburban markets persist.
Global investor interest in multifamily assets remained high in the fourth quarter.
This is evidenced by two of the sector's largest ever deals being completed in Germany during the quarter.
Institutional investors remain active in Asia Pacific, particularly in Japan and Australia.
Let's now shift our attention to JLL's performance.
As I mentioned at the beginning, fourth quarter and full year financial results were very strong and broad-based.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenue rose 23% to $5.9 billion, and fee revenue increased 42% to $2.8 billion in local currency.
Fee revenue benefited from strong performance in our leasing and capital markets businesses, which recorded growth of 68% and 62%, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA of $622 million represented an increase of 50% from the prior year, with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding from 21.3% to 22.4% in local currency.
Adjusted net income totaled $447 million for the quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.66.
Our adjusted EBITDA results in the fourth quarter benefited from $103 million of equity earnings, primarily a result of an increase in the market value of our strategic technology investments.
Technology is a key differentiator for JLL, and our focus continues to be to bring the best technology to our clients and raise the productivity of our brokers and account managers.
For the full year, consolidated revenue rose 15% to $19.4 billion, and fee revenue increased 31% to $8.1 billion in local currency.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year rose 73% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a margin of 18.6%.
Our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin was toward the upper end of our 16% to 19% target range, driven by the strong gains in our higher-margin transactional businesses investment gains in JLLT and LaSalle and disciplined cost management.
We continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter, returning over $150 million to shareholders.
This brings our full year return of capital to over $340 million, up significantly from $100 million in 2020 and $43 million in 2019.
In addition, I am pleased to announce that the Board has authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.
We remain committed to investing in the business to drive future growth while also returning capital to shareholders.
Fourth-quarter results reflect a strong finish to a year that began with considerable uncertainty.
Our investments in our people and global platform over the last several years allowed us to enhance our competitive position, capitalize on accelerating business momentum and deliver full-year results that were well ahead of both our initial expectations and 2019 levels.
Over the course of 2021, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities, investing to meet the evolving needs of our clients while also accelerating our return of capital to shareholders.
The robust business fundamentals, along with our continued efforts to improve our operating and capital efficiency resulted in nearly $800 million of free cash flow in 2021, reflecting a cash conversion ratio of approximately 80%.
Moving to a detailed review of operating performance.
Our fourth-quarter consolidated real estate services fee revenue increased 42%, driven by strength in the Americas and transaction-based revenues globally.
Compared to a strong fourth quarter 2019, real estate services fee revenue grew by 19%.
The real estate services adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.8% compared with 21% a year earlier and 20.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The growth of our transaction-based revenues and $83 million of equity earnings from JLL Technologies more than offset higher commissions and incentive compensation related to differences in business mix, the impact of COVID-related discrete items, the expected reduction of certain 2020 nonpermanent savings, and incremental investments in our people and technology.
Turning to the Americas.
Capital Markets and Leasing led broad-based fee revenue growth.
Fee revenue increased by 56% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and with growth across most service lines.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, fee revenue increased by approximately 31%, which is an acceleration from the third quarter increase of 25% relative to 2019.
Within Americas capital markets, unprecedented strength in industrial, multifamily and alternative along with improving activity in the retail, office and hotel sectors and the surge in cross-border capital flows led to record transaction activity that drove 75% growth in fee revenue over the prior year quarter, and a 62% increase compared with fourth quarter 2019.
Fee revenue from U.S. investment advisory sales more than doubled and U.S. debt and equity advisory increased approximately 60% from the prior year quarter.
Our multifamily debt origination and loan servicing businesses maintained strong momentum, highlighted by loan servicing fee revenue growth of approximately 34%.
Our full year 2022 U.S. capital markets pipeline is up 47% compared with this time last year, supporting our optimism for healthy growth opportunity in the year ahead.
Americas leasing fee revenue growth of 74% over the prior year quarter was led by a rebound in the office sector and continued strength in industrial.
Compared with fourth quarter 2019, Americas leasing fee revenue increased 22%, with strong industrial sector growth more than offsetting a not fully recovered office sector.
We saw a significant increase in transaction size versus both a year ago and the comparative 2019 quarter with average deal size up 33% and 25%, respectively.
Deal volume, as measured by the number of transactions has also increased meaningfully versus last year, up 35%, and return to the 2019 level.
From a profitability standpoint, the Americas adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 27.5% from 25% in 2020 and 22.5% in 2019.
Strong growth in transactional revenues and JLLT equity earnings more than offset the expense pressures impacting the consolidated real estate services margin.
Anemia, fee revenue grew 24% over fourth quarter 2020 and 1% versus the comparative 2019 quarter, driven primarily by higher leasing and capital markets volumes as economic activity and investor sentiment improved.
Leasing fee revenue increased 55% versus fourth quarter 2020 and 22% over fourth quarter 2019 with growth across all asset classes, most notably the office and industrial sectors.
For the quarter, EMEA Capital Markets grew 45% versus 2020 and 14% compared with 2019, driven by accelerated recovery in our key markets and a significant increase in the number of large deals.
EMEA's fourth quarter profitability declined versus the prior year due to several factors, including the expected reduction of certain 2020 nonpermanent savings and discrete items, higher incentive compensation due to differences in business mix, and incremental investments in our people and technology platform.
We are encouraged by the growth within EMEA and remain focused on improving the margin profile for the region.
Within Asia Pacific, quarterly fee revenue grew across all service lines, except property and facility management, which was flat compared to the prior year.
Led by the office sector, Asia-Pacific leasing fee revenue was particularly strong as growth accelerated to 49% from 33% in the third quarter and was up 20% versus fourth quarter 2019.
Higher commissions due to differences in business mix, the expected reduction of certain 2020 nonpermanent cost savings and incremental investments in our people and technology platform drove a decline in Asia Pacific's profitability, partially offset by the growth in our higher-margin transaction-based revenue.
Built primarily by new client wins and contract extensions in the Americas and EMEA, our global work dynamics fee revenue grew 7% versus the prior year, with growth of its annuity-like business more than offsetting the absence of COVID-related project work in 2020.
Work Dynamics fee revenue was up 3% compared with 2019.
The global real estate services outsourcing market opportunity remains compelling, and we believe JLL is well-positioned for continued growth.
Valuation increases and continued robust capital raising drove an 11% increase in assets under management and translated to advisory fee revenue growth.
In addition, strong investment performance across the platform, led to $56 million of incentive fees in the quarter.
Considering LaSalle's approximate $12 billion of dry powder at year-end, and $8.2 billion of capital raised over the past year, including $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, we expect a continuation of the recent LaSalle advisory fee growth trends in 2022.
Equity earnings on LaSalle's approximate $350 million co-investment portfolio totaled $18 million in the quarter, about half of which was cash.
I'll expand briefly on our JLL Technologies investment as I discuss the strategic rationale of our early stage PropTech investment on prior earnings calls.
At year-end, the fair value of our JLLT investment totaled approximately $350 million, up from nearly $100 million a year earlier, driven in part by approximately $140 million of valuation increases.
Beyond the investment returns, which were substantially a function of subsequent financing rounds at higher valuation, the investments in former strategic direction allow us to evaluate and test technology solutions for our clients.
and generate incremental revenue.
Shifting now to an update on our balance sheet and capital allocation.
Along with the growth in our business and resiliency of our cash flow, our balance sheet remains solid, as indicated by our net leverage at 0.2 times and liquidity of $3.2 billion at year-end.
This provides a strong foundation to execute on our strategic priorities, which are: first, to invest in our business and capabilities to better serve our clients and drive long-term profitable growth; and second, to return capital to shareholders.
As Christian mentioned, we did both in 2021.
We invested in our people and global platform, completed acquisitions totaling approximately $450 million and made strategic investments of over $100 million, net of distributions and our JLLT initiative and LaSalle co-investments.
In addition, we repurchased $343 million of shares representing about 43% of free cash flow generated in 2021.
Investment opportunities remain dynamic and we intend to maintain flexibility to capitalize on organic investments and select M&A opportunities alongside continued share repurchases to drive long-term shareholder value.
Looking ahead, our underlying business fundamentals and investments in growth initiatives, along with positive industry trends and the global economic outlook, provide an attractive backdrop for continued business momentum and fee revenue growth in 2022.
We continue to expect to operate within our 16% to 19% adjusted EBITDA margin target for the full year 2022, effectively managing a return of certain expenses and inflation while also investing in growth initiatives.
Like 2021, business mix, the pace of economic growth and evolution of the pandemic and the amount of equity earnings, among other factors, will influence where we will land within our target margin range.
We expect our 2022 full-year effective tax rate to be similar to 2021 at approximately 22%, based on our assumptions that meaningful changes to tax code will not be implemented until later this year.
I also note that we are closely monitoring the escalation and geopolitical events in Ukraine, but it is too early to comment on a potential business implications.
Our focus is the safety and well-being of our people, clients and suppliers.
Before closing, I'll briefly elaborate on the segment recording change Christian announced in his remarks.
Beginning with the first quarter 2022, we will transition our reporting to five business line segments, comprising markets advisory, capital markets, work dynamics, JLL Technologies and LaSalle.
Additional service line revenue detail will be provided within each segment.
Profitability will continue to be reported at the segment level.
The new financial reporting structure better aligns with how we've evolved our management structure over the past several years and improved transparency, making it easier for investors to understand our performance and our key drivers.
In closing, I'd like to express deep gratitude to my JLL colleagues for their astounding collective efforts in 2021, embracing our One JLL philosophy to deliver exceptional service to our clients and generating a substantial long-term value for all stakeholders.
Christian, back to you.
Improving global economic trends, increasing allocations of capital to the CRE industry and positive investor sentiment provide a favorable market backdrop as we enter 2022.
Geopolitical turbulences continue to be the main limiting factor to an ongoing growth of our target markets.
The outlook for 2022 is less tied to the pandemic than the past two years.
Labor markets are tight and attracting and retaining top talent will be a key focus point for organizations in the coming years.
Inflation is likely to remain high in 2022.
Real interest rates will stay deeply negative despite all the expected rises of interest rates by relevant central banks.
And that environment, real estate continues to be a standout asset class.
The tight labor markets, combined with the significant inflation have resulted in rising compensation costs.
We take every effort to make use of our global platform and our superior tech infrastructure to hire the talent wherever we can find it streamline our processes and support the productivity of our producers to continue to raise the revenue per head.
In closing, our fully integrated suite of services and industry-leading technology platform makes JLL a preferred partner for clients around the globe.
We remain well-situated to capitalize on the continued macroeconomic recovery and favorable underlying trends altering the commercial real estate industry.
I continue to be very optimistic in JLL's ability to achieve sustained growth and create meaningful shareholder value not only in 2022, but also for the years to come.
Operator, please explain the Q & A process.
","JLL reported a strong finish to 2021, with record fourth-quarter revenue of $5.9 billion, a 23% increase, and fee revenue growth of 42% to $2.8 billion. This growth was primarily driven by robust performance in leasing and capital markets, which recorded a combined 68% increase in fee revenue compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 50% to $622 million, with a margin expansion to 22.4%. The company's three-year transformation process, which streamlined operations and integrated its global services, has enabled JLL to reduce structural complexities and enhance growth. The positive market outlook, characterized by increased investment in the commercial real estate industry and high levels of liquidity, bodes well for JLL's continued growth in 2022. However, the company remains cautious about the potential impact of geopolitical events in Ukraine and tight labor markets. Despite these challenges, JLL's strong balance sheet, solid cash flow, and investments in its global platform and capabilities position it well to navigate the current environment and deliver long-term shareholder value."

These non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
This was another excellent quarter, and I'm extremely proud of the entire SentinelOne team.
Our ARR growth accelerated to 131% year over year in the third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth.
We continue to scale our business on the back of leading endpoint protection, machine speed DDR, XDR innovation, and our powerful partner-supported go-to-market strategy.
The demand environment remains incredibly strong.
Before digging deeper into the details of our quarterly performance and results, I'd like to share some perspectives on the cybersecurity landscape.
I'd encourage you all to also look at our shareholder letter we have on our Investor Relations website, which provides a lot more detail.
We're still early in the generational shift in cybersecurity led by the ongoing digital transformation of the enterprise.
There are millions of cyberattacks inflicting trillions of dollars in damages every year.
This is unacceptable and a growing risk to enterprises across the world.
The increasing number of attacks and sophistication clearly shows that enterprises must deploy best-of-breed solutions that enable them to stay one step ahead of attackers.
Take the current state of ransomware.
Attackers have shifted from simply holding operations hostage to actual data compromise and infiltration, infiltrating both legacy and unprotected devices.
That's where SentinelOne comes in.
We pioneered the world's first purpose-built, AI-powered XDR platform to make cybersecurity defense truly autonomous from the endpoint and beyond.
We believe it's essential to protect all parts of the enterprise estate, such as unknown devices, cloud workloads, and the data itself.
We focus on data to provide enhanced visibility and advanced analytics.
We protect our customers in real-time at machine speed, empowering human operators with the speed, scale, and precision of technology.
Our approach is resonating with our customers.
We received the highest overall rating in the 2021 Gartner Voice of the Customer Report for endpoint protection platforms where 97% of reviewers would recommend the SentinelOne Singularity XDR platform.
I'm very proud of the work we all do to keep our customers secure, engaged, and delighted.
We focus on putting our customers first.
Let's turn the discussion to how we're executing.
During our IPO earlier this year, we outlined five key aspects to our growth strategy.
Our third quarter results demonstrate success and progress against each of these.
First, we continue to innovate and enhance our cybersecurity and data platform.
Automation is a top priority for SentinelOne.
Machine speed automation can help counter instantaneous cyberattacks and enable under-resourced IT teams.
Last quarter, we introduced Storyline Active Response, or STAR, for customized dynamic detection and response rules.
This quarter, we began offering Remote Script Orchestration, or RSO, to instantly investigate and triage threats on multiple endpoints across entire organizations remotely.
Together, these two capabilities deliver increased level of automation, as well as help enterprises, consolidate legacy workflows in tooling with the Singularity XDR platform.
I want to dig more deeply into RSO.
We designed RSO to transform endpoint management for incidence response providers and enterprises.
We're offering complete remote control and orchestration across endpoints.
It's a scalable way for security providers to not only detect and respond with existing endpoints but also manage and control the entire deployed footprint.
It's like having a security analyst on every single endpoint at all times.
Our customers and partners are already realizing the benefits of the advanced capabilities of RSO.
One of our incident response partners said RSO helps eliminate time-consuming efforts to collect and consolidate forensics data in rapidly contained attacks, enabling us to minimize adversary impact.
On the customer side, a Fortune 500 wholesale company added RSO to help ultimate threat hunting capabilities, making SentinelOne more powerful and integral to their security posture.
In addition to automation, we believe a true XDR platform must be a comprehensive and open platform that provides visibility, protection, and response across the entire enterprise landscape.
Customers have been asking us to provide mobile protection to complement our leading protection capabilities.
And just this week, we announced Singularity Mobile.
SentinelOne customers can now manage mobile device security alongside endpoint, cloud workloads, and IoT devices.
Singularity Mobile brings behavioral AI-driven machine speed protection, detection and responds directly to iOS, Android, and Chrome OS devices.
Putting this all together, we were recently recognized as a strong performer in the Forrester New Wave Extended Detection and Response Providers report.
Forrester highlighted that SentinelOne Singularity XDR platform is the best fit for companies that want customizability and to grow into XDR. We were also named Best Innovator in SE Labs' Annual Report.
The second part of our strategy is to protect more enterprises every day.
In Q3, our ARR grew by 131% year over year, and our revenue was up 128%.
Our business is performing exceptionally well.
We added over 600 new customers sequentially.
We grew our total customer count by over 75% to over 6,000 compared to a year ago.
Customers with ARR over $100,000 grew 140%, and we continue to see a growing mix of large enterprises within our business.
In addition to expanding our global presence through direct sales teams, our channel remains a source of scalable growth and differentiation.
With our partner-friendly approach, we're succeeding by further expanding our scale with incidence response in managed security service provider partners.
Nick will touch on this in more detail later on.
Third, we're unlocking further product adoption within our existing customer base.
In the fiscal third quarter, our net retention rate reached 130%, a new record for our company.
This growth was driven by strong license expansion, platform upgrades, and customer adoption of our new capabilities.
We're early in our module strategy, but we're seeing great customer interest and adoption.
Our emerging products such as Ranger IoT, cloud workload protection, and data capabilities are all growing at impressive triple-digit rates.
In particular, our cloud workload protection product delivered the highest growth during the quarter, a testament to the demand for our real-time run-time protection for cloud workloads and containerized environments.
In one case, a leading book publisher selected SentinelOne for cloud workload protection because of its ease of use, simplicity of deployment, and having a true EDR in one console to manage their cloud-native Windows, Linux, and Kubernetes environments.
The fourth element of our growth strategy is to further expand our global footprint.
Revenue from international markets grew 159% year over year.
International markets now represent 33% of our total revenue, up from 29% a year ago.
As an example, in Q3, we secured a European conglomerate by replacing over 20 different antivirus products.
This shows how our platform can help with vendor consolidation while also delivering leading performance.
We're growing our sales coverage and channel presence in international markets.
Last quarter, we talked about opening a new R&D center in the Czech Republic, and I'm excited that we're hiring great talent in this region.
These initiatives will continue to strengthen our international presence.
Fifth and last, we're well-positioned to expand our total addressable market through both acquisitions and strategic investments.
We further strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of Rob Salvagno to lead Corporate Development.
As we consider acquisitions, we evaluate prospects that align with our product, customer, and strategic market opportunities.
Over time, we intend to use these opportunities to extend the reach of our XDR platform into adjacencies that complement our offerings.
Our strategy also involves making minority investments.
We recently made two strategic investments in early funding rounds for Laminar and Torq, companies that align with our approach to automation and APIs.
Investments in emerging technologies will allow us to constantly enhance the SentinelOne platform in areas that may be of future interest to us.
These investments reflect our long-term commitment to innovation, automation, and securing data wherever it resides with a front-row seat into cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies.
Finally, as part of our XDR road map, Scalyr is performing extremely well and has continued to grow year over year and quarter over quarter.
At the same time, we're onboarding all new customers on our revamped back end seamlessly.
We've begun migrating select existing customers.
By using Scalyr, our customers are enjoying faster performance and advanced analytics capabilities.
Our true competitive advantage comes from the employees of SentinelOne.
We've invested in talent across sales, marketing, engineering, and corporate functions while cultivating an inclusive and diverse workplace.
We've grown rapidly in the past year, and our number of employees has gone from 600 to about 1,100.
This has been no small feat, and we're continuing to grow and expanding the team.
We work very hard to foster a productive and inclusive culture, and our efforts are showing up in results.
As part of the 2021 Great Places to Work certification, 96% of responses from employees said SentinelOne is a great place to work.
We received several other awards during the quarter that recognize our workplace culture.
With the combination of our differentiated technology and dedicated team, we're helping our customers stay ahead of adversaries, prevent breaches, and autonomously respond to innovation.
We're helping our customers reimagine cybersecurity.
I'm excited about what we can do from here.
Our go-to-market flywheel of sales and marketing, channel, and technology partners resulted in another outstanding quarterly performance across the board.
Strong demand for our Singularity XDR platform is evident by our third quarter results.
Our customers are clearly choosing SentinelOne as a partner and technology of choice.
In Q3, we reported an impressive ARR growth of 131%, reaching $237 million compared to last year.
This growth was driven by a healthy combination of new customer additions, existing customer renewals, and upsells.
Today, we are protecting over 6,000 customers through our Singularity XDR platform.
That's total customer growth of more than 75% or almost 2,500 more customers compared to last year.
Our focus on automation, speed, and accuracy is critical to any enterprise, in fact, all enterprises.
I want to be clear.
This is a competitive market.
The environment has not changed, yet we've maintained incredibly strong win rates in all competitive situations against legacy and next-gen vendors.
With every new quarter, we're protecting more and more mission-critical businesses around the world.
In Q3, we added a leading global financial exchange in a seven-figure multiyear agreement.
This was a true platform win.
They selected SentinelOne for endpoints, cloud workload protection, remote script orchestration, and data applications.
It's telling that we're getting so much attention by our competitors, which speaks to the traction we're having in the market.
We're winning more and more customers, and our growth rates speak for themselves.
What enterprises need is automated security, not repackaged legacy AV and crowd-powered protection.
Our mission is to elevate security for our customers through a relentless focus on innovation.
And our customers are happy with 97% gross retention rate and the highest score in Gartner's Voice of the Customer survey.
That's hundreds of customer reviews, and that speaks volumes compared to any single customer example.
Let me take a step back and share some details around our customer and business mix.
We grew customers with ARR over $100,000 by 140% versus last year.
Our business mix from customers with ARR over $100,000 continues to grow driven by our success with larger enterprises, strategic channel partners, and increasing module adoption.
In addition to protecting new larger customers, we're seeing strong retention and expansion within our existing customer base.
Gross retention rates remained consistent with prior quarters.
Our net retention rate was 130% this quarter, a new record for our company.
This record NRR was driven by license expansion, platform tier upsells, and adoption of emerging capabilities.
In Q3, two of our Fortune 10 customers renewed with multiyear deals, and both expanded their use of the Singularity platform, adding modules such as Ranger and Remote Script Orchestration.
I'd like to talk more about our channel partners.
Our partner ecosystem helps magnify our market access and significantly extends our reach and efficiency.
We do not compete with our partners.
Instead, we equip them with industry-leading capabilities like multi-tenancy and open APIs.
In fact, we're expanding our partner ecosystem, and this is driving significant growth for us.
Let me double click on our managed security service provider partnerships as an example.
MSSPs provide outsourced monitoring and management of security devices and systems.
Our growing and highly scalable partnerships with MSSPs give us robust mid-market and large enterprise coverage.
Together, we have fueled significant new customer and business growth over the past several quarters.
We're proud to partner with companies like N-able, AT&T, Pax8, Continuum, Kroll, and many others.
To demonstrate the momentum we're seeing, in our third fiscal quarter, ARR from our MSSP channel increased by 300% year over year.
In addition to MSSPs, our incident response partners leverage the SentinelOne platform for their breach response services, making us an integral part of their capabilities.
Last quarter, we talked about our commitment to support even more IR partners through our Singularity platform.
In Q3, we built upon that progress and further expanded our network of IR partners.
We added KPMG as a global go-to-market partner for incident response and proactive cybersecurity services.
Our growing network of IR partners continues to help secure businesses.
As an example, during the quarter, we won a large airline customer in Asia through one of our IR partners.
Finally, I'd like to share how we're putting our customers and partners first.
We recently hosted our first-ever customer conference called OneUP.
Participation and response has been incredibly positive.
We've also hosted partner conferences throughout the Americas and EMEA.
Our goal is to educate on our latest innovations and continue to build on our momentum.
Over the last few quarters, we've also received great feedback on our accreditation programs.
We added continuing education courses to complement our accreditation programs.
These courses keep our partners up to date on new capabilities and modules, which in turn support our growing scale and platform reach.
We had around 2,000 accreditations in June 2021.
We've made amazing progress since then and now have surpassed over 6,000 accreditations across our sales and presales courses through the end of November.
This tremendous improvement illustrates the growing attention we're seeing in the channel.
I'm proud to work with our global team of relentless Sentinels every day.
I'm excited about our future.
We will continue to deliver on our vision with focus on execution and listening to our customers.
I'll touch on the financial highlights from the quarter and then provide additional context around our guidance for Q4 and fiscal year 2022.
Our third quarter results exceeded expectations across the board.
Our revenue and ARR growth both accelerated in the quarter.
Our performance strength was broad-based, coming from a healthy mix of new customers and existing customer expansion.
It also balanced across geographies and customer sizes.
We achieved revenue of $56 million, increasing 128% year over year, and delivered ARR of $237 million with growth accelerating to 131% over the same period.
Turning to our costs and margins.
Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 67%.
This was up 9% year over year and up 5% quarter over quarter.
The biggest benefits are coming from our increasing scale and business expansion, including modest benefits from module and platform upsell.
Costs associated with the migration of existing customers to our Scalyr back end were minimal in Q3.
This contributed to the gross margin upside relative to our prior expectations.
I want to provide more detail here.
Scalyr is a critical part of our XDR road map and future innovation, giving us enhanced data storage and ingestion capabilities.
We are balancing our product road map with our migration of existing customers.
We will follow the optimal cadence for our customers and our business.
In Q3, we took a more measured approach to migrations, which had less of an impact to margin.
We anticipate migrating more customers in Q4 and the first half of next year.
That said, when I look at our Q3 gross margin of 67% and how far we've come in just the past few quarters, I see glimpse of scale and efficiency in our model.
Looking at the rest of our P&L.
We're investing for growth and achieved triple-digit growth rates in ARR and revenue again this quarter.
Our non-GAAP operating margin was negative 69%.
We're continuing to make strategic investments that enhance our product and scale our go-to-market.
Even still, this is a significant improvement from negative 102% in the year-ago quarter and also from negative 98% last quarter, showcasing the potential for leverage throughout our business model.
We remain in investment mode in the near term, which is the right strategy given the vast opportunity in front of us.
Now for our outlook for Q4 and the full fiscal year.
In Q4, we expect revenue of $60 million to $61 million, reflecting growth of between 101% to 104% year over year.
We're raising our full-year revenue guidance from $199 million to $200 million.
This implies full-year growth of 115% at the midpoint.
The structural tailwinds of digital transformation, hybrid work environment, and an evolving yet persistent threat environment are here to stay.
We're executing extremely well.
Our product innovation, increased brand awareness and scale, and go-to-market are giving us favorable opportunities to engage with existing and prospective customers.
We expect Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be between 62% to 63% and full-year non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% to 62%.
Our Q4 guidance implies a minimum of 8% non-GAAP gross margin expansion year over year as we're benefiting from increasing scale, improved cloud hosting agreements, and processing efficiency gains.
Our guidance also reflects the migration of existing customers to Scalyr, which we expect will continue into the first half of next year.
Finally, for non-GAAP operating margin, we expect negative 83% to 80% in Q4 and negative 91% to 90% for the full year.
We see tremendous opportunity for growth and the investments we're making today will put us in a position to succeed for the long term.
Additionally, as a reminder, our IPO lockup expires, and vested options and outstanding shares can be traded starting December 9, 2021.
This is a continuation of late September's 15% lockup expiration.
In closing, Q3 was another excellent quarter with strong execution companywide, and we're expecting that momentum to continue into the end of our fiscal year.
","SentinelOne reported an exceptional third quarter with triple-digit ARR growth of 131% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of its endpoint protection and XDR platform. The company's focus on automation, speed, and accuracy has fueled its success, leading to customer wins with enterprises ranging from Fortune 10s to global financial exchanges. Revenue surged by 128% to $56 million, driven by both new customer acquisitions and existing customer upsells. Gross margin expanded to 67%, showcasing the company's increasing scale and business efficiency. SentinelOne's strategic investments in its go-to-market strategy have also paid off, with ARR from managed security service providers growing 300% year-over-year. The company remains bullish about its growth trajectory, projecting Q4 revenue between $60 million and $61 million, implying continued triple-digit growth rates. SentinelOne's strong performance in Q3 is a testament to its innovative technology, expanding customer base, and relentless focus on market execution."
DRI_q2_2022.txt,"Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardinas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.
Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance is a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the second quarter quarter of fiscal '21.
We plan to release fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 24 before the market opens followed by a conference call.
Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook.
Sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter, as all our brands stayed laser focused on creating memorable guest experiences.
Despite the toughest inflationary environment we've seen in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth.
Our ongoing success navigating the pandemic is a testament to the power of our strategy, driven by our back to basics operating philosophy and the strength of our four competitive advantages.
Our disciplined commitment to our strategies allow us to manage this environment well, while returning significant cash to our shareholders.
People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute.
Additionally, our teams have done a great job managing inflation effectively and Raj will provide more color on that during his remarks.
Holidays are the busiest time of year for our restaurant teams as they delight our guest and help create lasting holiday memories.
This time of year is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business, which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities.
One of the ways we serve our communities is by helping fight hunger, this fiscal year, through our foundation, Darden provided $2.5 million to help our partners at Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks to support mobile pantry programs and distribution in communities facing high rates of food insecurity.
We are uniquely positioned to help and by leveraging our scale and relationships with partners like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proud to do our part to help get food into the hands of people who need it.
Finally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30th, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors.
This is the right time for this transition and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman.
Our company is in a clear position of strength and this is also the right time for me and my family, I'm excited for Rick, who has been a tremendous partner over the last seven years and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked alongside.
Our brands have tremendous opportunity ahead of them and Rick is the perfect person to lead Darden into the next chapter.
It is an honor to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer and I'm grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me.
It is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members, who nourish and delight everyone we serve.
I was incredibly fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs.
So, I have a strong appreciation for the legacy of leadership I'm inheriting.
By upholding our commitments to operational excellence and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value.
Turning to the quarter.
Our restaurants continue to execute at a high level.
Our focus on simplifying operations to drive execution remains our top priority, which is why we once again paused any new initiatives during the quarter in order to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts.
This pause also ensures they can zero-in on people and product as we navigate through the current staffing and supply chain challenges.
From a people perspective, we feel good about the progress we've made on the staffing front.
Across our brands manager staffing levels are above historical norms and team member staffing levels continue to improve.
Our new hiring system has made it easier to source talent, giving our management teams more time to focus on successfully onboarding and training new team members.
We also continue to invest in our team members further strengthening our industry leading employment proposition.
Earlier this year, we committed to increasing the minimum hourly earnings for our restaurant team members to $12, which includes income earned through gratuities by January 2023.
However, given the strength of our performance, we are accelerating that timing to January 2022.
This primarily impacts entry level roles, such as hosts, busters [Phonetic] and dishwashers.
And with this change, we expect our restaurant team members will earn on average approximately $20 per hour.
Our people are the key to our performance.
We work hard to be the employer of choice in our industry and we're proud that our retention rates for managers and team members are both in the top quartile.
And we will continue to invest in them to retain and attract the best talent in the industry.
On the product side, our supply chain team continues to do a great job making sure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests.
Our inventory levels are strong and the team's ability to meet the needs of the business can be seen in the fact that we shipped more cases in the last two quarters than at any time during Darden's history.
The ability to maintain supply continuity for our restaurants minimizes distractions and allows our operators to focus on executing at the highest level, whether our guests or in our dining rooms or enjoying the convenience of to-go.
During the quarter to-go sales continued to benefit from the strength of our digital platform.
This platform not only makes it easier for our teams to execute, it makes it more convenient for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up.
Off-premise sales accounted for 28% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse.
Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales.
Finally, we successfully opened 12 new restaurants during the quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Time Square with minimal staffing challenges.
The time to build a new restaurant is longer today than it has been historically and we are also beginning to see longer lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware.
Regardless, we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year.
I also want to recognize our team members in our restaurants and our support center for your tireless efforts in creating exceptional experiences for our guests.
I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season.
Total sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants.
Average weekly sales grew by more than 7% compared to pre-COVID.
Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48.
Total EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 14.7%.
The significant business model improvements we made over the past year and half combined with strong sales resulted in margin growth of 270 basis points compared to pre-COVID.
We expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year as this quarter has the most opportunity given its low seasonality.
We continue to return significant cash to shareholders paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter.
And while we're happy with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations on both commodities and labor with total inflations of 6% this quarter.
Our teams continue to demonstrate agility in managing through this environment.
This quarter we implemented several mitigating actions to preserve the strength of our business model, while balancing the impact of our guests and team members.
One of these actions was taking additional pricing.
For the second quarter, total pricing was 2% and we expect back half pricing to approach 4%, resulting in total pricing of just under 3% for the full fiscal year.
We continue to execute our strategy of pricing significantly below our overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position by leveraging our scale.
This level of pricing covers most of what we consider to be the structural and long lasting impacts of the current inflationary environment and absorbing what we consider to be more short-term fluctuations, while providing future flexibility should there be a need.
For the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Now turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter.
We're comparing against pre-COVID results in the second quarter of 2020 which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity.
For the second quarter, food and beverage expenses were 220 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodity inflation of 9%, as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation.
Restaurant labor was 90 basis points favorable, driven by sales leverage and efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures.
Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was almost 9%.
Restaurant expenses were 130 basis points lower due to sales leverage, which more than offset higher utilities costs.
Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability.
As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels.
G&A expense was 40 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense and sales leverage.
Turning to our segment performance.
Second quarter sales at Olive Garden increased 5% versus pre-COVID, strong performance, especially as we were wrapping against nine weeks of never-ending possible.
This sales growth combined with the business model improvements at Olive Garden helped drive a segment profit margin increase of 320 basis points even while offsetting elevated inflation.
LongHorn continued its strong sales growth with an increase of 22% versus pre-COVID.
However, inflationary pressures including double digits for commodities were at their highest level in the second quarter, resulting in reduction of segment profit margin by 80 basis points.
Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance.
Segment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation.
Our other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points.
This segment continues to perform well and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist.
Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the remainder of the year.
We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels, same restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31% and 35 to 40 new restaurants.
Capital spending of approximately $425 million, total inflation of approximately 5.5% with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%, total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5% which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%.
EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion and annual effective tax rate of approximately 14% and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year.
All resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60.
This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales helping offset elevated inflation.
","Darden Restaurants reported strong financial results in Q2, driven by robust sales and margin growth. Comparable restaurant sales surged 34.4%, while total sales reached $2.3 billion. Earnings per share surpassed expectations at $1.48. Despite inflationary pressures of 6%, Darden's teams effectively managed costs through pricing and operational simplifications. The company expects full-year sales of $9.55-$9.7 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 29-31%, and diluted EPS of $7.35-$7.60. Darden remains committed to investing in people, with plans to accelerate the minimum hourly earnings increase for restaurant team members to $12 by January 2022. The company is also on track to open 35-40 new restaurants this fiscal year."
WU_q3_2021.txt,"On our call today is our CEO, Hikmet Ersek; and our CFO, Raj Agrawal.
During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.
We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.
We will also discuss certain adjusted metrics.
The expenses that have been excluded from adjusted metrics are specific to certain initiatives, but may be similar to the types of expenses that the company has previously incurred and can reasonably expect to incur in the future.
We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our third quarter results and the progress of our business.
Our business continues to rebound from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic delivering double-digit revenue growth in digital and Business Solutions as well as strong profitability and operating cash flow during the quarter.
Additionally, we are continuing to make good progress on our key initiatives, including our pricing evolution and platform enhancements.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results.
Overall, we achieved revenue growth in the quarter of 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, which was driven by 15% growth in digital and 31% growth in Business Solutions.
While these two business grew nicely, the Retail business was affected by the slower economic recovery, in particular, recovery in the labor markets where employment of migrant workers remains below 2019 levels.
As a result, our C2C revenue was flat on a reported basis or down 1% in constant currency terms with transaction growth down 1%.
Both principal per transaction and cross-border principal increased approximately 4% during the quarter.
Year-to-date, our cross-border principal increased 19%, reflecting the elevated levels of support that our customers provide to their loved ones during the period of uneven economic recovery.
With that, based on the latest World Bank forecast, we believe we are growing market share.
Our digital business continues to generate strong growth.
Revenue generated during the quarter was $266 million, maintaining the record high level that we achieved in the second quarter and putting us well on pace to exceed $1 billion in revenue this year.
Most of our digital business is westernunion.com, which grew at a healthy pace in the third quarter with 16% principal growth and 12% revenue growth.
Wu.com average monthly active users increased 8% in the quarter.
Although wu.com growth is moderating as expected, as we grow from a much larger base and compare results against the prior year's accelerated growth levels, we anticipate growth to remain healthy as we continue to invest in marketing, product and customer experience.
We were particularly encouraged by the results we are seeing in our account-to-account business, which is the fastest-growing portion of our business.
The other component of our digital business is digital partnerships.
Momentum is building in this business as we expand relationships with existing partners and launch new partners.
We recently completed our previously announced acquisition of a minority stake in stc Bank, formerly known as STC Pay, which was a leading digital wallet service provider and is now in the process of launching as one of the first digital banks in Saudi Arabia.
In addition, we are planning to launch a number of new partners in upcoming months.
Our progress confirms that the capabilities we have built to serve our branded direct digital business is also well suited to serve the needs of leading banks and digital wallet providers.
Our solution emphasizes flexibility and choice built on a strong foundation of compliance and technology.
We are able to offer a branded solution partners who want to feature our leading brand in cross-border payments or we can offer capabilities that partners incorporate as a white label solution.
Our real-time account payout capabilities, currently available in over 100 countries, improve on incumbent solutions while also providing choice for consumers who preferred to direct transfer to our agent network.
We recently announced that Western Union International Bank has joined SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme as a direct participant, further enhancing our real-time payment capabilities in Europe.
Our capabilities have focused on cross-border remittances historically, but partner needs are evolving to include broader use cases.
Thus, as we have integrated with traditional payment systems in the past, our platform can also be extended to incorporate future use cases related to digital currencies.
Key to our success, whether serving our direct consumers through our branded offering of -- or serving the customers of our partners is our omnichannel capabilities, which enable payouts to more than 200 countries and territories in over 130 currencies through our extensive global network of billions of bank accounts, millions of wallets and cards, and approximately 600,000 retail locations.
We continue to invest in expanding our payment capabilities to provide our customers and partners with additional options and convenience across platforms, devices, borders and currencies.
Turning to our profit performance in the quarter.
Profitability was strong, with operating margin increasing to approximately 25%, as a result of solid Business Solutions revenue growth and lower planned marketing investments, which was partially offset as we continued to invest in our technology and global omnichannel platform.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.57 on a reported basis and $0.63 on an adjusted basis.
Before turning it over to Raj to discuss our financial performance for the quarter in more detail and our updated 2021 financial outlook, I'd like to provide an update on a few key strategic initiatives.
Starting with Business Solutions, our planned divestiture remains on track.
The majority of the business and the entire proceeds are expected to transfer in the first quarter of 2022.
As we announced earlier today, we are expanding our ecosystem strategy.
We are on track to launch our digital bank pilot in Germany and Romania in the fourth quarter, offering customers a digital banking and integrated money transfer solution through our Western Union International Bank.
The digital banking offerings Western Union branded WU Plus is an important part of our ecosystem strategy, which is focused on bordering and deepening our relationship with customers by offering them additional relevant products and services.
Another component of our ecosystem strategy is WU Shop, a shopping and cash back rewards program that enables our customers to shop internationally at over 12,000 online stores and send gifts directly to their families and friends in other countries while receiving cash back on their purchases.
WU Shop is now live in Germany and Austria, several more countries, including the U.S., are targeted to launch by year-end.
Overall, despite an uneven economic recovery and the continuing effects from the pandemic, our business proved resilient, and we are on solid footing as we finish the year.
Today, I will discuss third quarter results and our full year 2021 financial outlook.
Third quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 2% on a reported and constant currency basis.
Currency translation net of the impact from hedges benefited third quarter revenues by approximately $3 million compared to the prior year.
In the C2C segment, revenue was flat on a reported basis or decreased 1% constant currency.
B2C transactions declined 1% for the quarter as the slow recovery from COVID-19 impacted retail money transfer, partially offset by 19% transaction growth in digital money transfer.
The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth was one percentage point on a reported basis and flat on a constant currency basis.
Total C2C cross-border principal increased 4% on a reported basis or 3% constant currency, driven by growth in digital money transfer.
Total C2C principal for transaction or PPT continued to grow and was up 4% or 3% constant currency, driven by mix and changes in consumer behavior.
Digital money transfer revenues, which include wu.com and digital partnerships increased 15% on a reported basis or 14% constant currency.
Wu.com revenue grew 12% or 11% constant currency on transaction growth of 9%.
Wu.com cross-border revenue was up 16% in the quarter.
Regionally, wu.com revenue growth was led by North America and Europe and CIS.
Digital partnerships continued to show solid growth across revenue, transactions and principal in the quarter.
Moving to the regional results.
North America revenue decreased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, on transaction declines of 5%.
Constant currency revenue was impacted by U.S. outbound, including U.S. regulations concerning Cuba that limit our ability to provide services there and continued declines in U.S. domestic money transfer.
Revenue in the Europe and CIS region declined 3% on a reported basis or 5% constant currency on transaction growth of 3%.
Our digital business continued to generate strong transaction and revenue growth, offset by softness in the retail business.
The digital partnership business in Russia was the primary contributor to the spread between transactions and constant currency revenue in the quarter.
Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region declined 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions grew 2%.
The digital partnership business continued to generate strong performance, driving regional transaction growth in the quarter and was the main contributor to the spread.
Constant currency revenue declines were driven by the regional business.
Revenue growth in the Latin America and Caribbean region was up 25% or 26% constant currency on transaction growth of 10%.
Constant currency revenue growth was generally broad-based as the region recovered from prior year economic dislocation due to COVID-19 with growth led by Mexico, Chile and Ecuador.
The driver of the spread between transactions and constant currency revenue growth was due to business mix.
Revenue in the APAC region increased 1% on a reported basis and declined 1% on a constant currency basis while transactions declined 13%.
Constant currency revenue in the region continued to be impacted by COVID-19.
Business Solutions revenue increased 31% on a reported basis or 28% constant currency.
Revenue growth was driven by increased payment services activity and the education vertical, while trends remained on a positive course with the continuing recovery in cross-border trade.
The segment represented 9% of company revenues in the quarter and benefited by growing over lower revenue in the prior year period.
Other revenues represented 5% of total company revenues and increased 3% in the quarter.
Turning to margins and profitability.
The consolidated GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 24.8% compared to 22.7% in the prior year period, while the consolidated adjusted operating margin was 25.2% in the quarter compared to 23.5% in the prior year period.
The GAAP and adjusted margin increases were primarily driven by revenue growth and lower planned marketing investment, partially offset by higher technology investment.
The GAAP operating margin also benefited from prior year restructuring costs.
Adjusted operating margin excludes M&A expenses in both the current and prior year period and last year's restructuring expenses.
Moving to segment margins.
Note that M&A expenses are included in other operating margins for both the current and prior year period and segment margins exclude last year's restructuring charges.
B2C operating margin was 24.3% compared to 24.6% in the prior year period.
The slightly lower operating margin was due to higher technology spend as we continued to invest in our platform partially offset by lower planned margin investments.
Business Solutions operating margin was 32.9% in the quarter compared to 10.5% in the prior year period.
The increase in operating margin was primarily due to increased revenue.
During the last 12 months, the Business Solutions segment generated $402 million of revenue and $86 million of EBITDA.
Other operating margin was 18.3% compared to 20% in the prior year period due to higher M&A costs this year related to the divestiture of Business Solutions.
The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.2% compared to 12.4% in the prior year period, while the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 13.7% compared to 12.7% in the prior year period.
The increase in the GAAP effective tax rate was due to deferred taxes recorded on the pending sale of Business Solutions.
GAAP earnings per share or earnings per share was $0.57 in the quarter compared to $0.55 in the prior year period, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 in the quarter compared to $0.57 in the prior year period.
The increase in earnings per share reflects the benefit of revenue growth and lower planned marketing investments, partially offset by a higher tax rate and higher technology investment.
GAAP earnings per share includes a $0.05 impact related to the deferred taxes recorded on the pending sale of Business Solutions.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet.
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $686 million.
Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $35 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had cash of $1 billion and debt of $2.9 billion.
We returned $170 million to shareholders in the third quarter, consisting of $95 million in dividends and $75 million in share repurchases.
The outstanding share count at quarter end was 404 million shares, and we had $558 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of this year.
Moving to our outlook for 2021.
Today, we provided an updated financial outlook reflecting recent business trends in macroeconomic conditions.
As Hikmet mentioned earlier, the pace of recovery from COVID-19 has created a fluid environment.
For example, GDP expectations were revised downwards in recent months and labor markets have not fully recovered.
Our outlook assumes that the macroeconomic environment will be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, while our previous outlook assumed a moderate improvement.
We now expect full year 2021 GAAP revenue growth will be approximately 150 basis points higher than constant currency revenue growth.
Our previous GAAP revenue outlook calls for a mid- to high single-digit increase.
Constant currency revenue, excluding the impact of Argentina inflation is expected to grow between 3% and 4%, while our previous outlook call for a mid-single-digit increase.
Our operating margin outlook has not changed, with the full year GAAP operating margin expected to be approximately 21%, while the adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5%.
Compared to the third quarter, fourth quarter margins are expected to be closer to the full year average as we anticipated from incremental investment in lower revenue from Business Solutions in the fourth quarter, which benefited from seasonal factors like tuition payments.
We continue to anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the mid-teens range on a GAAP and adjusted basis.
GAAP earnings per share for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.85 compared to the previous outlook of $1.82 to $1.92, reflecting the tax impact related to the pending sale of Business Solutions.
We are also raising the bottom end of the range for adjusted earnings per share with a new range of $2.05 to $2.10, which compares to $2 to $2.10 in our previous outlook.
To summarize, we're pleased with the progress we continue to make toward achieving our long-term strategic objectives.
And operator, we are now ready to take questions.
","Western Union saw a strong Q3 with 2% reported revenue growth, driven by 15% growth in digital and 31% growth in Business Solutions. Digital revenue remained robust, maintaining the record high set last quarter and on pace to surpass $1 billion this year. The company's account-to-account business, which is the fastest-growing segment, performed particularly well. Western Union's omnichannel platform enables payouts to over 200 countries and territories in more than 130 currencies through its extensive network of bank accounts, wallets, cards, and retail locations. Despite economic challenges, Business Solutions revenue rose 31%, with growth driven by increased payment services activity and the education vertical. Western Union expects full-year 2021 constant currency revenue (excluding Argentina inflation) to grow 3-4%, and adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.05 to $2.10."
JBL_q1_2022.txt,"To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our investor relations section.
At the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website.
These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings.
With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our strong quarter and outstanding results.
First off, the team delivered $400 million of core operating income on roughly $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%.
These results were primarily driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and of course, mobility, as customary for our first fiscal quarter.
And finally, it's worth noting that our team was able to accomplish all of this in spite of the chaotic global supply chain environment.
In summary, we delivered strong results, grew in key end markets, and successfully navigated a dynamic global supply chain, clearly demonstrating the power of Jabil by way of our scale, tools, team, and relationships.
In a few moments, both Mike and Mark will provide more details on the quarter, while also addressing our improved outlook for the year.
But before I hand it over, I'll pass along some thoughts from Jabil's procurement and supply chain team, as you may find it helpful when modeling our year.
In short, demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, an issue that has persisted since 2019.
That said, Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize our allocation and keep the factories in production to the best of our ability.
So far, we have been extremely successful.
As we move ahead, we anticipate continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated in our guidance similar to previous quarters.
We do expect some relief toward the back half of the fiscal year, but the general consensus is that demand will remain ahead of supply for the next six months.
As Adam just highlighted, Q1 was an exceptional quarter.
The team delivered strong results on three fronts: revenue, core operating income, and core diluted earnings per share.
Our results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end-market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team, along with lower tax and interest expense.
Net revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter.
GAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63.
Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%.
Core diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior-year quarter.
Now turning to our first quarter segment results on the next slide.
Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.7 billion, an increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis.
The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based, with strength across our healthcare, automotive, and mobility businesses.
Core margin for the segment came in at 5.4%.
Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.
The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad-based, with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi cap, and 5G wireless and cloud businesses.
Core margin for the segment was 3.8%, 40 basis points higher than the prior year, reflecting solid execution by the team.
Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.
In Q1, inventory days came in at 66 days, a decline of five days sequentially.
The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment.
And I expect over the medium to longer term, our inventory days to normalize below 60.
Cash flows used in operations were $46 million in Q1 and net capital expenditures totaled $73 million.
We exited the quarter with total debt-to-core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.3 times and cash balances of $1.2 billion.
During Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares or $127 million.
Turning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide.
DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 4% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to $3.6 billion.
We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million.
GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $266 million to $326 million.
Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.55.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39.
The tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 24%.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market.
Today, both segments are in incredibly good shape.
In September, I highlighted several long-term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets, such as Healthcare, Automotive, Cloud, Semi-Cap, 5G Infrastructure, and the associated connected devices, along with power generation and energy storage.
For the remainder of FY '22 and beyond, we continue to expect these secular trends to drive strong growth.
Our electric vehicle business in particular continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to ED accelerates.
And importantly, our broad-based growth associated with these secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin expansion in both segments.
All of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong financial results for FY '22.
And a balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders.
I would like to wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday.
I'd also like to recognize their hard work and tireless commitment, which drove solid results for our first fiscal quarter.
Not only did our team deliver a favorable first quarter, but the diversification of our business was fundamental to the results, with each sector having a material contribution in the solutions we offer our customers and with each sector having a material contribution to our financial results.
Specifically, the four sectors in our DMS segment focus on margins while offering reliable cash flows, while the four sectors in our EMS segment focus on cash flows, while offering reliable margins, a perfect complement as the well-diversified construct of Jabil continues to drive our execution.
If we dig a little deeper, we find secular trends embedded within certain sectors, secular markets where we now play and have a substantial presence.
We believe these markets will drive our growth, with the overwhelming majority of such growth occurring organically as we place our attention on secular opportunities, opportunities such as 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.
Furthermore, our commercial portfolio is intentional, and we think quite special.
Each slice of this pie harbors domain expertise, affording us an essential collection of valuable capabilities.
Although what's most impactful is the way in which we merge these capabilities with precision and speed as we serve our customers.
Our approach is further enhanced by seamless collaboration across the organization, combined with our unique Jabil structure.
And when done correctly, we simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands.
And we do so as we lean into a massive market, where things need to be built and supply chains need to be optimized.
One of the key outcomes of our approach is the fact that with each passing year, our results become less dependent on any single product or product family, which improves our resiliency, especially during times of macro disruption and cyclical demand.
I'll now take you through an update to our fiscal '22 financial plan where you'll see the continued earnings power of the company.
We've increased core earnings per share to $6.55 for the year, up $0.20 from our September outlook.
We've also increased revenue to $31.8 billion, up from our initial guide of $31.5 billion.
In addition, we're committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million, while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year as we navigate this challenging environment.
In concert with these strong numbers, please note that our path forward is well understood throughout the company and what needs to be done remains crystal clear.
Quite simply, what we're doing is working a positive testament on how our team is managing the business.
Moving on from the financials, I'd like to talk about purpose.
At Jabil, purpose serves as our guidepost.
When we think about purpose, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and giving back to the many communities where we live.
Please note that these behaviors, as displayed by our team, are exceptional.
In closing, our improvement is steady and our strategy is consistent.
And as a team, we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to those we serve.
All in all, I feel good about where we've been, but I feel even better about where we're going.
In simple terms, at Jabil, we build stuff, and we do so really, really well.
We also solve problems over and over again.
I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety as you care for one another.
To everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday.
Before we begin our Q&A session, I'd like to remind everyone on our call that we cannot address customer or product-specific questions.
Otherwise, we're now ready for your Q&A.
","Jabil reported strong Q1 results with $400 million in core operating income and revenue of $8.6 billion, driven by strength in healthcare, industrial, semi cap, and mobility markets. The company successfully navigated global supply chain challenges, expecting them to continue but with some relief in the second half of the fiscal year. Despite the challenges, Jabil's team and their tools helped them maximize allocations and keep factories running. For Q2, the company anticipates revenue between $7.1 billion and $7.7 billion and core diluted earnings per share between $1.35 and $1.55. Jabil's outlook for FY22 is positive, with revenue now projected at $31.8 billion and core earnings per share increasing to $6.55. The company remains focused on driving growth through secular trends in healthcare, automotive, cloud, semi-cap, and clean energy markets. Jabil's diversified portfolio and seamless collaboration have led to improved resilience and reduced dependency on any single product family."
MAC_q3_2020.txt,"regional and global economy, and the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its tenants.
Joining us today are Tom O'Hern, chief executive officer; Scott Kingsmore, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer; and Doug Healey, senior executive vice president, Leasing.
We had releasing spreads of 5% and occupancy at nearly 91%.
At the end of the third quarter, most of our town centers were open with only our three closed centers in Los Angeles remaining closed by government mandate.
Those centers reopened in early October.
So as of today, all of our centers are open and our tenants are eagerly planning for a busy holiday season.
Most of the results were better than the second quarter, but we were obviously adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID in general and specifically due to the protracted California and New York City closures.
I'm very appreciative of the entire Macerich team that did a tremendous job of getting our centers reopened safely in some cases for a second time.
Some of the self-health and safety measures we took went way beyond CDC recommendations that included significantly upgrading our air filtration systems to include hospital quality air filtration with [Inaudible] filters; engage the clinical head of Infectious Disease at UCLA Medical Center to review and advise us on our protocols and policies.
We hired a nationally renown engineering firm to advise us on advanced HVAC systems and protocols.
We implemented modified hours, increased cleaning and sanitizing protocols, CDC guidelines, and approved products that are baseline for our services.
In terms of rent collections, we are much better off in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
During the third quarter, our average rent collections were 80%.
October is trending above 80%.
For most of the tenants not paying rent during the closure period, we would generally come to terms with them.
In general, we agreed to rent relief usually in the form of deferred rent for the closure months with repayment in 2021.
In many cases, in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to leases.
There were some large reserves for uncollectible rents in the quarter, which Scott will comment on.
Cash flow continues to improve by the month as we move into the fourth quarter, and I expect that to continue.
As of today, we have significant liquidity and currently have approximately $675 million of cash on the balance sheet.
The tenant reactions to reopening has been good.
Our tenants, almost without exception, were eager to get reopened.
By October, for centers opened at least eight weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels.
The consumer is shopping with a purpose and there has been pent-up demand.
Our second quarter was more about getting centers opened and getting our tenants open safely and less about leasing.
The focus in the third quarter was collecting past due rents and started to shift back to leasing.
Looking at traffic, in general, it's running about 80% compared to a year ago.
Some of that has to do with capacity limits, particularly for restaurants and also for having no seating in the food court.
Sales, on the other hand, are running on average 90% of a year ago, which means there, I'd say, higher capture rate.
This year will be a different holiday season.
We believe it's going to start earlier.
Operating hours will be shorter.
There will be capacity limits.
With consumers not spending money on vacations and entertainment during COVID, most of our consumers in our markets have money to spend this holiday season.
Top categories are expected to be fitness and wellness, home furnishings, electronics and athletic leisure.
There will be [Inaudible] but with lots of social distancing.
We've got a number of questions about potential for property tax increases in California, although small in the political scheme of things.
There was a proposition in California that would have increased property taxes on commercial property.
It is known as Proposition 15.
That proposition would have removed the protection of Prop 13 from commercial properties in California.
For us, generally, we structure our leases to pass-through taxes to the tenant as a recoverable expense with a significant bottom line impact that the [Inaudible] shows Prop 15 passing.
As of today, it is trailing.
The yes votes stand at 48.7%, the no are at 51.3%.
So hopefully, that means no increase for commercial taxes in California.
Looking at the balance of 2020.
The pandemic has shown that good retail is not going away, especially in A quality centers.
Digitally native brands appreciate, more than ever, the profitability of their physical stores.
Big format retailers got active again in the third quarter, and you'll hear some of the specifics from Doug.
Although we are still in the midst of COVID, our centers are operating at 90% capacity, sales levels of 90% pre-COVID.
And even if you look at one of the more challenging categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 restaurants and 94% of those are open today.
The second quarter was an extremely unique quarter and some of the second quarter challenges carried into the third quarter and may even carry partially into the fourth quarter.
But many metrics got better in the third quarter, specifically collections.
And the number of tenants opened and the progress we are making on leasing activity.
The impact on reserves for adoption accounts was less than 20 — second quarter of '20, but still much higher than normal.
We expect to gradually improve to a more normal level in the first quarter of '21.
Although there are still too many uncertainties to give guidance, we expect the fourth quarter of 2020 and the year 2021 to be much better than the second and third quarters of 2020.
Disruption from COVID-19 continued to severely impact 2020 results in the third quarter.
Funds from operations for the third quarter was $0.52 per share, down from the third quarter of 2019 at $0.88 per share.
Same-center net operating income for the quarter was down 29%, and year to date, it was down 17%.
Changes between the third quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by the following factors and the numbers I'm going to cover [Inaudible] for the company: One, $20 million — $21 million in bad debt allowance in the form of the $14 million of increased net debt expense versus the third quarter of 2019, coupled with $7 million of lease revenue reverse for tenants, that are accounted for on a cash basis per GAAP within the third quarter; two, over $20 million of short-term nonrecurring rental assistance; three, a $9 million decline in common area and ancillary revenue as well as percentage rents; four, a $4 million decline in parking income driven by protracted property closures and reduced parking utilization at our urban centers in New York City and Chicago primarily; five, interest expense increased $4 million due to a decline in capitalized interest; six, net operating income declined from the Hyatt Regency Hotel [Inaudible], it was about a $2 million decline; seven, a negative $0.03 per share dilutive impact from shares issued in the second quarter relating to our stock dividend issued in the second quarter.
These factors were all offset by increased lease termination income of $7 million and land sale gains totaling $11 million net impact.
Revenue declines from occupancy loss also contributed to declines in both net operating income and FFO for the third quarter.
As Tom mentioned, we are not providing updated 2020 earnings guidance given continued uncertainties.
We do anticipate continued volatility operating results in the fourth quarter.
While we're not providing guidance for 2021, as we mentioned last quarter, we still believe that 2020 will be a trough in the company's operating results including primarily to the following factors: The pandemic has effectively accelerated the financial troubles with numerous [Inaudible], resulting in a wave of bankruptcy filings that were funneled and due 2020.
We do not anticipate this volume to recur in 2021.
The majority of the filings have resulted in reorgs and not full fleet liquidations.
We do expect approximately a 3% cumulative drop in occupancy from lease rejections, approximately half of which is already embedded within the 90.8% reported occupancy [Inaudible] third quarter, and the balance of these stores will close within the fourth quarter.
Year to date, we have reported $57 million in additional bad debt reserves versus 2019, including $50 million of bad debt expenses and $7 million of lease revenue reversals for tenants accounted for on a cash basis.
Similar levels of reserves are certainly not anticipated going forward.
We've recorded well over $20 million in nonrecurring short-term rental assistance year to date and we expect those to continue into the fourth quarter of 2020.
And then lastly, we anticipate increases to transit revenue line item going forward into 2021, namely the percentage rent, temporary tenant income, parking garage revenue, advertising, sponsorship, vending and other ancillary property driven revenue.
We look forward to providing 2021 guidance on our typical cadence this time next quarter.
Given the continued improvement in rent collections of 80% in the third quarter and over 80% in October, liquidity continues to improve.
Cash on hand has increased from $573 million at June 30 to $630 million at September 30.
And as Tom noted, liquidity continues to improve to this day.
This improved liquidity is solely due to improved operating cash flow and is a testament to the herculean efforts by our people to both secure the right to open all of our properties and to negotiate thousands of agreements with our retailers.
With continued progress in these negotiations, which Doug will soon elaborate upon, we anticipate further improvement to operating cash flow throughout the year.
We are closing on a 10-year $95 million financing on Tysons Vita, the residential tower at Tysons Corner.
The loan will have a fixed rate of 3.3% and will include interest-only payment during the entire loan term.
This will provide approximately $47 million of liquidity to the company, and we expect the loan closing to occur within the next several weeks.
We secured a short-term extension on Danbury Fair through April 1, 2021.
The loan amount and interest rate remain unchanged following that extension.
We have agreed to terms with the loan servicer for a three-year extension on Fashion Outlets of Niagara, which will extend the loan maturity through October of 2023.
We expect the loan amount and interest rate also to be unchanged following that extension.
And then lastly, we continue to work with our lenders to secure loan extensions for the nonrecourse mortgages on each of FlatIron Crossing, Green Acres Mall and the power center adjacent to that Green Acres Commons, and we anticipate securing extended term within the coming weeks.
Like the second quarter, the majority of our efforts in the third quarter involved getting our retail partners open as quickly and as safely as possible once our centers were allowed to reopen.
To date, all of our properties are open, and I'm happy to report that 93% of the square footage that was opened pre-COVID is now open today.
As I discussed on our last call, it has been the case in the third quarter, much of our time and energy was spent working with those retailers that did not have the ability to pay rent while closed.
And we've made great progress.
In fact, as we look at our top 200 rent paying retailers, we've either received full rent payment or secured executed documents with 147 and are in LOI with another 23, all of which totals approximately 93% of the total rent these top 200 pay.
Consequently, collections continue to improve.
Third quarter saw an average collection rate of 80%, that's compared to 61% in the second quarter.
And as of today, as Tom mentioned, our collection rate for October stands at about 81%.
But the third quarter wasn't all about collection.
As our centers continue to open and as our retailers opened and were able to trade with some consistency, the leasing climate began to improve.
Retailers began executing leases that have been out since before COVID.
But most importantly, the retailers began committing to new deals again.
A true sign that for the first time in months, we're now looking forward rather than solely focusing on the past.
I'll expand on this in a moment, but first, let's take a look at some of the third-quarter metrics.
Portfolio-related sales for the third quarter were $718 per square foot, and that's computed to exclude the period of COVID closures for each tenant.
The $718 is down from $800 per square foot at the end of the third-quarter 2019.
For centers opened the entire month, sales in September were actually 92% of what they were a year ago, once we exclude Apple and Tesla.
Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 90.8%.
That's down 50 basis points from last quarter and down 3% from a year ago.
This is primarily due to store closures for bankruptcies and from our local tenants that couldn't survive the pandemic.
Temporary occupancy was 5.7%, that's down 70 basis points from this time last year.
Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 4.9%, that's down from 5.1% last quarter and down from 8.3% in Q3 2019.
Average rent for the portfolio was $62.29, down from $62.48 last quarter, but up 1.8% from $61.16 one year ago.
As I mentioned earlier, the leasing environment continues to improve.
In the third quarter, we signed 120 leases to 342,000 square feet.
This is over 3x the number of deals and square footage that was signed in the second quarter, and these stats do not include any COVID workouts.
Some leases signed in the third quarter of note include Gucci, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Ducati Paris at Scottsdale Fashion Square; Kids Empire and State 48 Brewery at SanTan; Barbarie's Grill at Danbury Fair; Starbucks at Fashion District Philadelphia; Madison Reed at 29th Street; Polestar at The Village at Corte Madera; finally, Lucid Motors at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Tysons Corner.
Both Lucid and Polestar are new additions to the electronic car category and first to the Macerich portfolio.
As we head toward the end of the year, much of our focus is on our 2021 lease expiration and finalizing deals in order to secure as much expiring square footage in 2021 as possible.
At this point in time, by virtue of COVID workouts and through the normal course of leasing, we have commitments on 26% of our 2021 expiring square footage with another 67% in the LOI stage.
This brings our total leasing activity on 2021 expiring square footage to just over 90%.
Turning to openings in the third quarter.
We opened 44 new tenants and 276,000 square feet, resulting in total annual rent of $11.3 million.
This represents 65% of the openings we had at the same quarter last year, but with 15% more square footage and virtually the same total annual rent.
Given the conditions our industry has faced over the last several months, I think this speaks volumes to the strength of the leasing pipeline we had pre-pandemic.
Notable openings include adidas and Tory Burch at Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls; Aerie at Vintage Faire; West Elm at La Encantada; and Golden Goose, Capital One Cafe and a new Levi's store at Scottsdale Fashion Square.
In the large-spread — in the large-format category, we opened Dick's Sporting Goods at Deptford Mall, in a portion of a former Sears store; Saratoga Hospital at Wilton Mall, also in a former Sears store; a new and spectacular looking restoration hardware gallery at The Village at Corte Madera.
And all of this was in the third quarter.
In October, we finished the repurposing of Sears at Deptford with the opening of Round One.
And also in October, we remained active with Dick's Sporting Goods, opening them at Vintage Faire in a portion of Sears, and at Danbury Fair in the former Forever 21 box.
The digitally made of and emerging brands continue to expand their omnichannel presence by opening stores.
And the third quarter was no exception.
We opened Amazon 4-Star and Indochino at Scottsdale; two Warby Parker stores at Scottsdale and 29th Street, along with Amazon Books and Tempur-Pedic at FlatIron Crossing.
And our pipeline remains strong.
At this point, we have signed leases with 190 retailers scheduled to open throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021.
This totals 1.7 million square feet for a total annual rent of $63 million.
And since the pandemic, only nine of these retailers with signed commitments have informed us that they won't be reopening — they won't be opening.
Total impact of this is only 60,000 square feet of the 1.7 million square feet and only $3 million of the $63 million in total rent.
Lastly, I want to address the issue of traffic.
There's been a ton of focus on traffic and the fact traffic is down compared with last year, and it is.
There's no arguing that.
However, I struggle with the notion that traffic seems to be perceived as the sole means to a retailer's success.
Why aren't we talking more about conversion or sales or the combination of both?
Despite less traffic, the Macerich portfolio is seeing tremendous success in the reopening of stores that were forced to close due to COVID, like Primark at Danbury, being the No.
1 store in its region since reopening; or like Bath & Body Works at Freehold, beating last year's sales three months in a row with capacity limited to 50%; or HomeGoods at Atlas Park, outperforming last year by 15% while also at 50% capacity; or Burlington, reopening at Kings Plaza and selling through inventory that took a month to replace; or Sephora at Broadway Plaza, is currently ranked as one of the top stores in the company by virtue of conversion rates that are 20% to 30% higher than last year; or Round One at Deptford and Valley River, operating at full capacity with hour-long waits at night and on weekend; luxury retailers at Scottsdale Fashion Square such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Golden Goose, all exceeding planned by 25% to 40%; or North Italia, a restaurant at La Encantada, back to pre-COVID sales even at 50% occupancy; and Tillys at Arrowhead, reported double-digit sales increases since reopening in May and is expecting their best holiday season ever at this location.
And the list goes on and on.
Unfortunately, these success stories are too often overshadowed by the overwhelming focus on the effect this pandemic has had on traffic in the short-term and pre-vaccine.
Make no mistake, traffic is important.
There's no denying that.
However, I do think it's time we stop thinking so one dimensionally and focus on other metrics in addition to simply traffic.
And when we do, I think we'll all find that we are in a much better place than many think.
","Macerich's Q3 performance reflects the significant impact of COVID-19, with funds from operations (FFO) per share declining to $0.52 excluding certain items. However, there has been progress in reopening centers, with all now operational, and rent collections improving to an average of 80% in Q3 and over 80% in October. Occupancy remains at 90.8%, a slight decrease from the previous quarter, primarily due to bankruptcies and local tenant closures. Leasing activity has improved, with 3x the number of leases and square footage signed compared to Q2, including deals with Gucci and Lucid Motors. Despite lower traffic levels, retailers are reporting strong sales, suggesting higher conversion rates and consumer demand. The company's liquidity has increased to $675 million, and it has secured several loan extensions. Macerich anticipates that 2020 will be a trough year for operating results, but expects improved performance in 2021 due to reduced bankruptcy filings, increased lease termination income, and higher ancillary revenue."
MSI_q3_2021.txt,"Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.
I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.
First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business.
We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year.
Second, we saw strong growth in all three technologies during the quarter.
In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment and video security and access control revenue was up 26%, driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings.
And in Command Center Software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing installed base and win new customers.
And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS.
Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion, up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates.
GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 26.3% of sales, up from 24.8%, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter.
The increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments.
Opex in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow.
Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year, while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year.
The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital, inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings.
Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, up $225 million compared with last year, and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year.
The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year.
Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of capex.
Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution.
And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envysion, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash.
Moving next to our segment results.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.3 billion, up 14%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $12 million.
Operating earnings were $273 million or 20.6% of sales, up from 18.9% in the year prior on higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include $72 million of P25 orders from a large U.S. federal customer, a $70 million TETRA order from the German Navy, a $45 million TETRA upgrade from a large EMEA customer, a $43 million P25 order from a large North America customer, a $22 million P25 upgrade from Metro Sao Paulo in Brazil.
And also during the quarter, we grew our Video Security and Access Control product revenue by 23%.
Moving to the Software and Services segment.
Q3 revenue was $782 million, up 11% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $3 million.
Operating earnings were $282 million or 36% of sales, up 140 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved opex leverage.
Within this segment, some notable Q3 wins included a $41 million command center software contract with a large U.S. state and local customer, $31 million P25 multiyear extension with a customer in North America, a $17 million push-to-talk over broadband multiyear renewal with a large U.S. customer, a $7 million Command Central suite and video security order with the city of Yonkers, New York, which expanded off of a prior body-worn camera win.
During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 32%.
Additionally, we launched the M500, the first in-car video system enabled by artificial intelligence.
Moving next to our regional results.
Q3 North America revenue was $1.4 billion, up 14% and growth in LMR, video security and command center software.
International Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software.
We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries.
Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year, driven primarily by growth in North America.
Sequentially, backlog was up $144 million, also driven primarily by growth in North America.
Software and Services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year, driven by a $479 million increase in multiyear services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN over the last year.
Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America.
Products and SI backlog was up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning next to our outlook.
We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to prior guide of 9.5% to 10%.
And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share.
This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%.
It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5%, along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares.
And finally, we now expect full year opex to be $1.95 billion, inclusive of our two latest acquisitions, Openpath, and Envysion, and we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate.
First, our results for the quarter were outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment.
We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and earnings per share and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog.
Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the two segments.
In Products and SI, demand for both our LMR and video security remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog.
Supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business and in particularly, our PCR business as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3, and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4.
In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improved profitability.
In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment.
Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services.
And in software, while we now expect Command Center Software revenue growth to be low double digits, our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio.
Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned.
Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility.
We're expanding our relationships within our existing installed base to provide more software and services.
The customer funding is as good as I've seen it.
And our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions.
And while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in 2022.
[Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.
","Despite supply chain challenges, the company reported a strong Q3 with a 13% revenue growth to $2.1 billion, driven by increased demand across all technologies. Revenue grew 11% in LMR, 26% in video security, and 13% in command center software. Operating margins expanded by 150 basis points, resulting in a record Q3 ending backlog of $11.4 billion. Based on this performance, the company raised its full-year guidance to revenue growth of 10% to 10.25% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.00 to $9.04. The strong backlog, ongoing customer investment in services, and expansion of relationships within the installed base provide visibility for continued growth in 2022, even amid ongoing supply chain challenges."
OXM_q2_2021.txt,"Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to our fiscal 2019 results.
Our performance was strong across all of our brands, particularly in our direct-to-consumer channels of distribution.
While we are benefiting from some favorable market conditions, the numbers that we delivered are the direct result of our team's ongoing efforts to navigate through the short-term challenges posed by the pandemic, while staying focused on our long-term strategic objective of delivering happiness to our customers.
Our excellent results are attributable to the strength of our brand portfolio and how we communicate our aspirational upbeat brand messages through beautiful inventory, differentiated products and exceptional customer experiences.
To deliver superior customer experience in today's market, we need to stay focused on our long-term North Star Objective of continuing to improve our customer centric, digitally driven, seamless, cross channel shopping experience, with an emphasis on mobile.
We continue to invest heavily in further improving the customer experience, with enhancements to our mobile apps, search engine optimization, customer data and insights, customer service and much more.
The boundaries between our retail and e-commerce businesses are becoming increasingly blurry.
We recognize that an ever-growing number of customer journeys to purchase, include both physical and digital elements.
Most consumers no longer distinguish between the relationship with the digital aspect of the brand and their physical relationship with our brands, they simply think of their relationship with our brands.
They want and expect to be able to mix and match digital and physical elements at will.
We are determined to fulfill this desire and continue to invest in the people, processes and technology, that will allow us to do so.
We have talked many times about our ability to ship from store, as an example of the blending of these two channels.
We have also routed capabilities, such as drive-to-store digital marketing; buy online, pickup in store; reserve online, pickup in store; virtual shopping appointments; and cross-channel customer service, to better meet the needs of our customers.
The better we are at providing a truly seamless omnichannel experience, the better our customers' overall experience will be, which will ultimately result in increased brand loyalty, and a stronger business over the long term.
Our team's relentless focus on improving our customer experience is evident in our numbers, which exceeded 2019 levels.
During the second quarter, our combine to direct-to-consumer, full price store and e-commerce comp grew by an impressive 22% compared to 2019 with 15% growth in our biggest brand, Tommy Bahama and a remarkable 31% growth in Lilly Pulitzer.
Growth in our direct-to-consumer channel was led by our highly profitable e-commerce business, which grew by 49% over the second quarter of 2019.
In addition to the impressive top line growth, we were able to simultaneously expand our e-commerce gross margin.
Our e-commerce business has been enhanced by our ship from store capability, which allows us to leverage inventories located in stores, to serve the e-commerce demand, as well as demand from other stores.
For the year, we expect our total e-commerce business to be roughly a third of consolidated sales, compared to 23% in fiscal 2019.
While e-commerce is our fastest growing channel, physical stores remain an incredibly important part of our direct-to-consumer business.
In certain instances, there is no substitute for the personal interaction and high level of service that we are able to provide in stores.
Our retail stores grew top line during the quarter, modestly over 2019 levels, despite lower traffic with sequential improvement through the second quarter across all regions of the country.
As we did in e-commerce, we were also able to expand retail store gross margins during the quarter, driven by full price selling and higher IMUs.
For this year, we expect retail stores to be just under 40% of our total business.
We further differentiate our omnichannel approach to delivering happiness to our customers, with our food and beverage offering.
Restaurant and bar sales grew 26% during the quarter compared to 2019.
We have positive comp growth in all locations as compared to second quarter of 2019, with all, but a couple at double-digit levels.
For this year's second quarter, we have five additional Marlin Bar locations as compared to 2019.
Our food and beverage capabilities give us a unique and powerful way to build relationships with new customers as well as reinforce the love that existing customers have for our Tommy Bahama brand.
Based on the strong start to 2021 and our growing footprint, we expect our restaurant and bar business to achieve close to $100 million in revenue this year.
Finally, while our wholesale business only comprises about 20% of our total sales, it remains an important channel of distribution.
In situations, where both we and our wholesale partner can be profitable, wholesale can be an important vehicle for exposing new customers to our brands, and another way in which we can serve our customer, when and how she wants to be served.
The excellent performance across the enterprise for the quarter was driven by stellar achievements within each of the individual brands.
Starting with Tommy Bahama, the brand delivered double-digit top line growth over 2019.
Higher sales combined with improvement in gross margin and excellent expense control, drove 1,000 basis points improvement in operating margin to a very strong 22.7%.
During the quarter, much of the growth was driven by knit tops and shorts in both men's and women's, including many of our IslandZone Performance styles.
The strength in these categories is a terrific example of how Tommy Bahama benefits from and is capitalizing on the long-standing trend toward casual, easy care and easy-to-wear product.
At the same time, Lilly Pulitzer achieved top line growth, up 16% over 2019, expanded their gross margin and also controlled expenses well.
Combined, these results drove a 230 basis point improvement in the operating margin to an impressive 29.5%.
From a product perspective, we have seen a nice rebound in woven dresses, which has been a historical strength for Lilly, but the biggest growth category has been our Lilly Luxletic activewear, which is now about 12% of our business.
In our Southern Tide business, excellent growth in e-commerce, plus the addition of our new retail stores, drove 17% sales growth, which, combined with expanded gross margins, resulted in a 21% operating margin.
While it is early in Southern Tide's retail journey, operating just a handful of company-owned stores in Florida, we are encouraged by the results that we are seeing.
Finally, our early stage businesses, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head, while currently small, are an important part of our overall enterprise growth strategy.
With our strong e-commerce businesses and growing wholesale businesses, both The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head delivered strong growth and expansion in both gross and operating margin.
In addition, we are thrilled to have signed our first lease for a company-owned store for The Beaufort Bonnet Company, and look forward to opening later this year.
As we head into the second half of the year, while being mindful of the ongoing COVID-related challenges in supply chain and store and restaurant operations, we believe that our focus on executing our long-term strategic initiatives will continue to drive strength in our business.
We have built a powerful and profitable, seamless, digital and mobile-first omni-channel platform, that is driving growth by providing a superior, modern customer experience.
From a product perspective, the trend toward casual, easy care and easy-to-wear, plays right into the sweet spot of our brands, and we are doing a great job of capitalizing on the market opportunity.
As Tom just mentioned, outstanding performances in each of our brands in the second quarter, resulted in record breaking revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings.
On the top line, demand for our products remained high, and revenue exceeded 2019 levels in each of our direct-to-consumer channels, and in each of our brands.
Consolidated sales in the second quarter were $329 million, compared to $302 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Our gross margin continue to track significantly higher than 2019.
On an adjusted basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points over 2019 to 64% in the second quarter.
Driving this improvement was a higher proportion of full price sales, our overall shift in our sales mix to higher margin direct-to-consumer channels of distribution and improved IMUs.
Higher freight costs put some pressure on margin in the quarter, partially offsetting some of the improvement.
We gained SG&A leverage in the second quarter, improving from 47% of sales in 2019 to 44% of sales.
SG&A dollars increased modestly from 2019 levels, with the increases in performance based incentive compensation and marketing expense, partially offset by decreases in other employment costs, due to headcount reductions and lower occupancy cost.
In the second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded 820 basis points over 2019 to 22%, with operating margin expansion in all operating groups.
Our business is well supported by our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow from operations.
Our liquidity position is strong with $180 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at the end of the second quarter.
Cash flow remains very strong.
In the first half of 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $149 million compared to $24 million in the first half of 2020.
On a FIFO basis, inventory decreased 34% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding Lanier Apparel, which we are exiting, FIFO inventory decreased 26% as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each lowered inventory levels year-over-year, conservative purchases of seasonal inventory and higher than expected first half sales.
Ongoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems were also contributing to a more efficient use of inventory.
On a LIFO basis, inventory decreased 48%, and excluding Lanier Apparel, decreased 39% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Our outlook for the back half of the year reflects our expectation of strength in our full price direct-to-consumer business.
We expect full price direct-to-consumer sales growth and consolidated gross margin expansion over 2019.
While we have raised our outlook for the second half, year-over-year improvement in our full price direct business is expected to be partially offset by a handful of specific headwinds in the back half of the fiscal year.
The strong first half full price sales has left us with less inventory for our second half clearance events, including an expected $15 million reduction in Lilly Pulitzer's third quarter flash clearance sale, compared to 2019.
In addition, initial spring wholesale shipments, which have historically shipped in the fourth quarter, are likely to ship in the first quarter of 2022, due to supply chain delays.
Finally, the exit of Lanier Apparel is expected to impact revenue in both the third and fourth quarters.
We expect sales from Lanier Apparel to be approximately $25 million lower than 2019's third quarter, and $20 million lower than 2019's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we now expect sales in a range of $1.085 billion to $1.105 billion, as compared to sales of $1.12 billion in 2019.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $6.45 and $6.70, a significant increase from our previous guidance.
This compares to earnings of $4.32 per share on an adjusted basis in 2019.
For the full year, sales from Lanier Apparel are expected to be $25 million in 2021 compared to $95 million in 2019.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be between $220 million and $230 million, compared to sales of $241 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect earnings of $0.20 to $0.30 per share on an adjusted basis compared to earnings of $0.10 per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2019.
Our outlook includes strong quarter-to-date results, with August as the most impactful month of the quarter in 2021.
The company's effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 23%.
We continue to support our business in fiscal 2021 with investments for future growth.
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $40 million in fiscal 2021, as we focus on technology related to digital marketing, customer service, mobile enhancements and improve distribution.
In addition, we will be investing in additional brick-and-mortar locations with our newest Marlin Bar at Town Square in Las Vegas slated to open tomorrow.
This Marlin Bar is replacing the recently closed full service restaurant in the same center.
Finally, we are proud of our long history of returning value to our shareholders through dividends, which we have paid every quarter since going public in 1960.
This quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share.
","Oxford Industries' earnings call highlighted strong performance in Q2, exceeding 2019 levels. Direct-to-consumer channels (full price, e-commerce, and retail stores) grew 22%, with e-commerce alone growing 49%. All brands reported double-digit growth, led by Lilly Pulitzer with 31%. Improved gross margins, expense control, and positive comparable sales contributed to operating margin improvement, with Tommy Bahama seeing a 1,000 basis point increase. The company remains focused on its long-term strategy of providing exceptional customer experiences and capitalizing on the trend towards casual, easy-care clothing. They are investing in technology, marketing, and physical locations to enhance their omnichannel presence. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year are projected at $6.45 to $6.70, a significant increase compared to $4.32 in 2019."
DNB_q4_2020.txt,"On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher.
our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.
I'd like to take some time today to discuss highlights from 2020 and our plans for 2021.
2020 was an incredible year for Dun & Bradstreet.
In the midst of a challenging new environment, we're able to successfully complete our IPO, signed a definitive agreement to acquire Bisnode, and continued to transform our business with significant enhancements for our technology, data, and analytics, which are ultimately laying the foundation for our ability to execute on our near- and long-term growth strategies.
Returning to the public markets last July was a major milestone for our company and allowed us to raise approximately $2.4 billion.
The net IPO proceeds allowed us to pay down our entire preferred equity, and 40% of both are secured and unsecured notes.
This significantly improved our financial profile and is saving us more than $175 million of annual dividend and interest expense.
With our lower leverage and increased cash flow, we now have significantly more financial flexibility to accelerate our growth strategy, both organically and inorganically.
For example, we're able to execute a critical step in our international growth strategy, the acquisition of Dun & Bradstreet Worldwide Network member, Bisnode, which was signed in October 2020 and closed on January 8, 2021.
The acquisition of Bisnode significantly expands our footprint to additional territories that make up 40% of the GDP of Europe and are home to 50 of the Global 500 companies.
The combined business, with nearly 250,000 clients collectively, will now be able to provide mission-critical solutions to an expanded European footprint with more local data, more local knowledge, and more streamlined delivery channels.
As a global company, having local expertise and knowledge helps us to engage with clients of all sizes in the region and across the globe to provide solutions and support necessary to meet their increasing demands.
As we've now been operating the business for around a month, we're even more excited about the opportunity.
The business came with a combination of Dun & Bradstreet products along with some legacy disparate solutions.
We will sun-down the legacy solutions and invest in the development of our market-leading global platforms and localized solutions.
We also have identified approximately $40 million in annualized run-rate savings that we expect to have actioned by the end of 2022.
Bryan will provide incremental financial details, including our expectations for 2021, in his section.
But overall, we already have strong momentum under way and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.
Now, turning back to the fourth quarter and full-year 2020.
We delivered solid financial results in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 despite known headwinds and a challenging macro environment.
Fourth-quarter revenues were up 1.8%, excluding the net benefit of the lower deferred revenue purchase accounting impact.
Adjusting for the previously communicated headwinds, normalized revenues on a constant-currency basis were up 3.5% for the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year.
Total company revenue retention for the year was 96%, an increase of 70 basis points versus prior year.
And we now have 36% of our business under multi-year contracts.
Revenue retention for our strategic account segment for the year is 99.8%, which once again reinforces our position as a mission-critical provider to the largest businesses in the world.
2020 was certainly a challenging year in terms of businesses of all sizes navigating their way through a difficult environment.
I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish in terms of retention, and in some cases, expansion, especially when you look at what we did with our strategic accounts.
Building on the near-100% gross retention I just mentioned, we're able to grow our revenues with our strategic customers by 3% versus prior year.
We also increased our multiyear business in the strategic channel by 11 percentage points to 67.5%.
These multi-year contracts not only have built-in growth.
They also create recurring revenue streams that allow us to continue to cross-sell additional solutions.
A great example of this was with one of the top three wireless providers in the U.S. as they adopted a multi-year agreement with Master Data, digital marketing, and global analytics solutions.
Next, I'll talk about the significant progress we made in our government channel, where we had a strong year with wins in the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Small Business Administration.
And in the fourth quarter, we were able to secure a sole-sourced 16-month contract with two six-month options to further support the General Services Administration or the GSA.
As governments both domestically and globally look to grapple with a rapidly evolving environment, we are pleased to be able to assist such critical work through our unique and differentiated offerings.
Moving on to our field sales accounts.
We saw customers, including one of the leading hedge funds in the world and an online brand management technology company, renew at or slightly above prior-year levels, which was reflective of the overall customer segment.
These businesses, which range from $100,000 to $1 million of potential spend a year, were more impacted by the current adverse environment.
However, they maintained consistent spend with us given the criticality of the solutions we provide despite their overall budget limitations.
We continue to have dialogue in terms of the adoption of incremental solutions as things begin to return to a more normalized environment and look forward to deepening our relationships going forward.
Finally, our small and medium business accounts were an area that went through a significant evolution.
We spent the later part of 2019 beginning to execute a digital strategy that shifts our reliance on direct mail campaigns and telephonic interactions to a more e-commerce-centric interaction.
While revenues from direct mail and telesales were down significantly versus prior year, we're able to partially offset those declines with digital sales up 53% over the prior year.
We carried this momentum through the back half of 2020 and are excited about our progress in expanding upon our SMB digitization efforts, which I will discuss further in my 2021 operations section.
From an international lens, as we continue to expand and improve our beneficial ownership data, we're able to secure a new contract with one of China's top four banks.
This solution will help the bank manage and screen their client shareholders in order to meet anti-money laundering requirements in the Know Your Customer compliance process.
In the U.K., we expanded our business with a Fortune 500 online payments provider whose platforms are available in more than 200 markets around the world.
They will be using our modern API and cloud-based Software-as-a-Service solutions globally to provide entity verification screening and monitor potential fraud.
We also continue to grow our Sales and Marketing solutions internationally.
A British multinational enterprise software firm, Sage Global Services, a market leader for integrated accounting, payroll, and payment systems, will be using our global data to assist with their Sales and Marketing efforts through cleansing and updating data within their CRM systems and assisting in account-based marketing efforts.
As you can see, client engagement is strong, and we believe this momentum is a direct outcome of the substantial progress we've made in terms of our ongoing transformation that is producing higher quality, more modern, and scalable global solutions.
In 2020, we invested approximately $115 million in capitalized software development, focused on enhancing and expanding our data supply chain, innovating new solutions, and modernizing our existing platforms via integration, enhanced user interfaces, and decreased latency.
As we've discussed before, Project Ascent has been an important piece of our technology transformation as we continue to enhance and expand our ability to ingest and curate data, diversify our coverage of existing data and expand access to a variety of alternative data sets.
We also made significant progress in simplifying and scaling our infrastructure for further growth.
Converging multiple existing legacy environments onto a common platform, primarily in the cloud, improves our stability and operating costs and enables automation, continuous integrating, and on-demand provisioning, so our developers can deploy more rapidly into production, ultimately allowing us to scale quickly and efficiently.
An example of taking an existing set of solutions, focusing on the modern offering, and connecting it to enhance data supply chain, is what we're doing with our Direct+ API.
All alternative data sets that come to Dun & Bradstreet are now ingested through Ascent and delivered by Direct+, providing our customers with the freshest, most complete, and accurate results, which allows our customers to access the most up-to-date data and analytics available in our ecosystem.
Over the next year, we will continue to load new data and begin migrating existing data sets to be curated through Ascent.
These particular investments, along with all the new product innovations we rolled out in 2020, are creating the foundation for our future growth.
And finally, as we invest in the business, we also continue to focus on efficiency, reflected in our improved EBITDA margins and annualized run-rate cost savings to date of $241 million, which is up $16 million from the third quarter.
This was achieved through a rationalization of our real estate footprint and net reduction from external providers as we expand our global capability and continued rationalization of our back-office support structure.
As I said, 2020 was an incredible year.
Our team continue to make great strides in executing on our strategy, and we are well-positioned for 2021 and beyond.
Now, turning to 2021, we will continue to focus on our transformation effort as we look to leverage the work we did in 2020.
One area I'd like to highlight is our new SMB digital platform, which will provide small- and medium-sized businesses a one-stop shop and help to deepen our relationships with cross-sell opportunities, extend our reach to new customers, particularly small businesses, and increase our revenue from new channels, including self-service e-commerce.
We have thousands of small businesses coming to our website each day for a whole host of reasons, including registering for a Dun's number, looking to improve their credit profile, or becoming a qualified supplier to a major corporation.
We took multiple digital entry points and established a unified site that provides a single corridor for these businesses to not just access our products, but to gain access to a more expansive environment, including partner products designed specifically for small business.
This helps us to grow our small, medium business sales; increase stickiness with current clients, and create partnership opportunity with our largest enterprise clients to bring new solutions and services to small business.
As we look to our Finance and Risk and Sales and Marketing portfolios, we will continue to launch new, innovative capabilities throughout the year.
And internationally, we'll continue to focus on launching new products in our respective markets through globalizing existing new North America solutions, introducing new offerings concurrently with North America, and launching specific local offerings.
These solutions will largely leverage existing technology platforms and data supply chains but be tailored for market users with local language, data, and feature requirements.
2020 was another year of remarkable transformation, and we are poised to accelerate growth in 2021.
Our key priorities are to continue the transformation of our technology to scale for growth, deliver more to our clients digitally, expand our data and analytics capabilities, integrate Bisnode, and grow both organically and inorganically as we look for new and better ways to serve our clients.
We are excited for what's to come.
Today, I will discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results and our outlook for 2021.
Turning to Slide 1.
On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter revenues were $480 million, an increase of 11% or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter.
This includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $39 million.
Net income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $7 million or a diluted income per share of $0.02 compared to a net loss of $263 million for the prior-year quarter.
This was primarily driven by prior year's expense of $172 million related to the make-whole provision associated with the Series A preferred stock, which was redeemed as a result of the IPO, also the net impact of the lower deferred revenue adjustment of $39 million, as well as a higher non-operating gain of approximately $24 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign currency pilot.
Before I get to the full-year results, let me clarify that comparisons to full-year 2019 are being compared to the combined pro forma results, which include the predecessor period prior to the privatization, the successor period post-privatization, and pro forma adjustments that give effect to the take-private transaction as if it had it occurred on January 1, 2019.
For revenue and adjusted EBITDA, the only pro forma adjustment was a $16 million reduction due to additional deferred revenues.
On a GAAP basis, full-year 2020 revenues were $1,738 million, an increase of 10% compared to 2019.
This includes the net impacts of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $134 million and an international lag adjustment of $26 million, which had a combined 10 percentage point impact on year-over-year growth.
We had a full-year net loss of $176 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.48 compared to a net loss of $599 million for the prior year.
Turning to Slide 2, I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year.
Fourth-quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $480 million, an increase of 11% or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis.
This increase includes the $39 million net impact of lower deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments, a 9-percentage point impact on year-over-year growth.
This increase was partially offset by known headwinds as previously communicated.
These headwinds include Lower usage revenues primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $8 million; lower royalty revenues from the wind-down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $6 million; a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within legacy Credibility solution of $1 million; partially offset by the shift of $4 million of government revenues from the third quarter.
The total net impact of these known headwinds was approximately $11 million.
Excluding these unique transitory items and the impact of currency, the underlying revenues for the total company grew approximately 3.5%.
Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $209 million, an increase of $51 million or 32%.
This increase includes the $39 million net impact of lower deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments, a 26-percentage point impact on year-over-year growth.
But the remainder of the improvement is primarily due to lower overall operating costs, driven by ongoing cost management initiatives, including lower net personnel expenses, partially offset by increased public company cost.
Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.5%.
Fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $118 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28, an increase from fourth quarter's 2019's adjusted net income of $51.5 million.
Full-year adjusted revenues for the total company were $1,738 million, an increase of 8% compared to 2019 adjusted revenues combined pro forma.
This increase includes the net impact of lower deferred revenues; purchase accounting adjustment of $134 million, an 8-percentage point impact; and known headwinds as previously communicated.
These headwinds include lower usage revenues, primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19, of approximately $20 million; lower royalty revenues from the wind-down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $20 million; a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within legacy Credibility solution of $11 million; and Worldwide Network and nonrecurring revenues of $6 million.
The total impact of these known headwinds was approximately $57 million.
Excluding these unique transitory items, along with the deferred revenue adjustment, revenues on a constant-currency basis grew approximately 3%, primarily from growth in our subscription-based revenues in our Finance and Risk solution.
Full-year adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $715 million, an increase of 30%, primarily driven by $134 million of lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustments reflected in the corporate segment, which has a 25 percentage point impact on the year-over-year growth; along with lower net personnel, travel, and marketing cost of approximately $55 million in the current year period, primarily resulting from ongoing cost management efforts; partially offset by increased technology cost of approximately $42 million related to data processing and data acquisition cost.
Full-year adjusted EBITDA margin was 41.2%, an increase of 670 basis points.
The net impact from deferred revenue had an impact of 5 percentage points on the year-over-year margin improvement.
Full-year 2020 adjusted net income was $350 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.95 compared to 2019 adjusted net income of $175 million.
The increase was primarily driven by the net impact of lower deferred revenue adjustment in the current year; lower personnel and travel costs, primarily driven by ongoing cost management; and lower interest expense; partially offset by higher technology cost primarily related to data processing and acquisition cost.
Turning now to Slide 3.
I will now discuss the results of our two segments, North America and International.
In North America, revenues for the fourth quarter increased 0.3% to $401 million.
The fourth-quarter net headwinds of $11 million mentioned earlier all related to North America.
Excluding these revenues, underlying growth was approximately 3%, driven by increased subscription-based revenues.
Finance and Risk fourth-quarter revenues were $218 million, an increase of 0.4%, driven by the shift of a $4 million government contract from Q3; higher subscription-based revenues; partially offset by known, transient headwinds of $1 million; and structural changes in Credibility solutions; and $8 million in lower usage compared to an elevated Q4 2019, along with the impact of COVID-19.
North America Sales and Marketing fourth-quarter revenues were $183 million, an increase of 0.2%.
The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues of approximately $8 million from our D&B Direct API Solutions, partially offset by lower royalty revenues of approximately $6 million from the Data.com legacy partnership.
North America fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $198.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 49.5%.
Turning now to Slide 4.
I will now discuss full-year results for North America.
In North America, revenues for 2020 were $1,460 million.
Excluding the net impact of $48 million of headwinds communicated, $20 million related to Data.com, $11 million related to the structural changes we made within our legacy Credibility solutions, and $17 million of lower usage primarily related to COVID-19, North America underlying revenues increased 3%.
North America Finance and Risk full-year revenues were $811 million, an increase of $2.5 million or less than 1%.
The increase was primarily driven by higher subscription-based revenues of approximately $30 million; partially offset by lower revenues of approximately $17 million of lower usage primarily attributable to the impact of COVID-19; and lower revenues of approximately $11 million primarily due to structural changes we made within our legacy Credibility solutions.
North America Sales and Marketing full-year revenues decreased $7.3 million or 1% to $649 million.
The decrease was primarily due to lower royalty revenues of approximately $20 million from the Data.com legacy partnership, along with lower usage revenues across our Sales and Marketing solution, partially due to the impact of COVID-19.
These transitory headwinds were offset by a net increase in revenue across our Sales and Marketing solutions of approximately $6 million, largely attributable to our D&B Direct API solution.
In addition, revenue increased by $6.5 million from the acquisition of Lattice, which was acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019.
Full-year adjusted EBITDA for North America increased to $696 million primarily due to lower operating costs resulting from ongoing cost management efforts that drove lower net personnel expenses.
Full-year adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 47.7%, an increase of 60 basis points.
Turning to Slide 5.
In our International segment, fourth-quarter revenues increased 10% or 8% on a constant-currency basis to $80 million, primarily driven by growth in the Worldwide Network and the United Kingdom.
Finance and Risk fourth-quarter revenues were $64 million, an increase of 11% and an increase of 8% on a constant-currency basis primarily due to higher revenue of approximately $4 million in Worldwide Network alliances due to higher cross-border data sales and higher revenue from Risk Solutions in our U.K. market for approximately $1 million.
Sales and marketing fourth-quarter revenues were $16 million, an increase of 6% and an increase of 4% on a constant-currency basis, primarily attributable to higher revenue from API solutions in our U.K. market of approximately $1 million.
Fourth-quarter International adjusted EBITDA of $23 million increased 4% versus fourth-quarter 2019 primarily due to higher revenues.
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 29%.
Turning to Slide 6.
In our International segment, full-year 2020 revenues were $299 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 2% or 1% on a constant-currency basis.
Excluding $9 million of transitory headwinds, $6 million from the Worldwide Network and our U.K. business, $3 million from COVID-19, International revenues grew approximately 5% on a constant-currency basis.
International Finance and Risk full-year revenue of $244 million increased $9 million or 4%, 3% on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by higher revenue of approximately $10 million from Worldwide Network due to higher cross-border data sales, higher revenues of approximately $1 million from the increased sales of risk solutions in the United Kingdom and $2 million from our Greater China market driven by solutions targeted at small businesses, partially offset by lower usage volumes in our Asian markets of approximately $2 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and transitory headwinds in the Worldwide Network in the U.K. of $6 million.
International Sales and Marketing full-year revenues of $56 million decreased $2 million or 4% and 5% on a constant-currency basis.
Excluding the positive impact from foreign exchange of $0.4 million, the decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower product royalties from our Worldwide Network alliances of approximately $1 million and lower usage volume in our Asia market of approximately $1 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19.
Full-year 2020 International adjusted EBITDA of $95 million decreased $4 million or 4% versus 2019 due to net revenue increases from solutions with incremental costs, including increased Worldwide Network data expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.7%.
Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA for the Corporate segment increased $50 million primarily due to the net impact of lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustments of $39 million.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Corporate segment for the full-year 2020 improved by $160 million or 68% compared to prior year on a combined pro forma basis.
The improvement was primarily due to the net impact of lower deferred revenue adjustments of $134 million and lower net personnel expenses due to lower incentive-based compensation.
Turning to Slide 7.
I'll walk through our capital structure.
At the end of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $354 million, which, when combined with full capacity of our recently upsized $850 million revolving line of credit due 2025, represents total liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion.
As of December 31, total debt principal was $3,381 million, and our leverage ratio was 4.6 times on a gross basis and 4.1 times on a net basis.
The credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.4 times.
On January 27, 2021, we repriced our term loan with a 50-basis point lower spread, now at 325 basis points.
This will save us approximately $14 million of annual interest.
We are happy with the progress we are making to deleverage our balance sheet and improve our credit rates, allowing us more flexibility to further support our growth, both organically and inorganically.
Regarding our January 8, 2021, closing on the acquisition of Bisnode, the transaction closed with a combination of approximately 6.2 million newly issued shares of common stock of the company in a private placement and approximately $625 million of net cash.
The cash portion was funded with $300 million of incremental term loan and cash on the balance sheet and a small amount from the revolving credit facility which has since been paid down.
Turning now to Slide 8.
I'll now walk through our outlook for full-year 2021.
Adjusted revenues are expected to be in the range of $2,145 million to $2,175 million, an increase of approximately 23.5% to 25% compared to full-year 2020 adjusted revenues of $1,738 million.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $855 million, an increase of approximately 17.5% to 19.5%, compared to full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $715 million.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06.
These estimates include the impact of Bisnode.
With the combination of the two entities, certain revenues and costs became internal transfers and are now being eliminated.
We are currently estimating $65 million of elimination that will be EBITDA-neutral but does impact comparability to the prior revenues and expenses reported by Bisnode through Ratos.
Subsequent to the application of these elimination, the incremental adjusted revenues will have a 19-point impact on the total full-year growth, which includes the sun-downing of approximately $50 million in legacy solutions revenues that we expect to have fully run off by the end of 2022.
Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows: Interest expense of $200 million to $210 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $90 million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 430 million; and finally, capex of approximately $160 million.
Although we do not provide quarterly guidance, I want to provide you with some color as to how we expect to progress throughout the year.
Excluding the deferred revenue adjustment of $17.4 million in Q1 2020, we are projecting adjusted revenue growth in the first quarter of 2021 to be at the low end of our guidance range as we work through the end of the Data.com wind-down and the impact of COVID-19.
As we enter the second quarter, we expect to be toward the middle end of our guidance range with growth accelerating to the high end of our range into the fourth quarter due to the lack of prior-year transitory headwinds, the impact of contractual revenue increases, and the ramp-up of new solutions revenues.
For adjusted EBITDA, excluding the deferred revenue adjustment of $17.4 million in Q1 2020, we are projecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter to be at the low end of our range as the annualization of cost savings for 2020 are partially offset with increased public company costs of approximately $4 million per quarter in the first half and $1.5 million per quarter in the second half.
We expect the second and third quarters to be below the low end of the range and the fourth quarter to be above the high end of the range of our guidance.
Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we made in 2020 related to our transformation and the underlying performance of the business, and we are excited about our momentum headed into 2021.
With that, we're now happy to open the call to questions.
Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A?
","Dun & Bradstreet's strong 2020 performance was capped by a solid Q4, with 1.8% revenue growth (3.5% on a constant-currency basis), excluding lower deferred revenue. Adjusted revenue increased 11% (10.5% on a constant-currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA rose 32%. Total company revenue retention was 96%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, with 36% of business now under multi-year contracts. Strategic account revenue retention remained high at 99.8%, and revenues with these customers grew 3%. Dun & Bradstreet also made progress in the government, field sales, small and medium business, and international channels. Significant investments in technology, including Project Ascent, and enhanced global solutions have prepared the company for future growth. The acquisition of Bisnode is expected to significantly expand Dun & Bradstreet's European footprint and generate annualized run-rate savings of $40 million by the end of 2022. Financial flexibility has improved due to lowered leverage and increased cash flow, resulting in more than $175 million in annualized dividend and interest expense savings. Dun & Bradstreet expects continued momentum in 2021, with adjusted revenue growth of 23.5% to 25% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.5% to 19.5%. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06."
GHM_q2_2021.txt,"We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Graham's Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Results.
We also have slides associated with the commentary that we are providing here today.
If you do not have the release or the slides, you can find them on the company's website at www.
We will then open the lines for Q&A.
These documents can be found on our website or at www.
I also want to point out that during today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance.
As Chris mentioned, we're starting on slide four.
It was very nice to operate in Q2 a normal capacity after running at approximately 50% capacity in Q1 due to COVID-19.
Q2 sales were $28 million, up from $21.6 million in Q2 of last year.
Sales in the defense, the Navy market were $9.4 million in the quarter.
In the quarter, we had a quick turn material order, which made up approximately half -- a little over half of the revenue in the Navy.
We expected this to occur in the quarter.
While it is not a repeatable type sale, it was not a surprise.
Year-to-date, defense sales were $12.9 million or 29% of sales.
This is slightly higher than we expect for the full year.
We would expect around 25% of our sales to be for the Navy for the full fiscal year.
The quarter also benefited from an acceleration of some work at one of our Asian subcontractors.
They had available capacity and pulled some work from Q3 into Q2.
Q2 net income was $2.7 million or $0.27 per share, up from $1.2 million or $0.12 per share last year.
Stronger revenue and margins drove the improvement.
Cash is still good at nearly $68 million.
Finally, orders in the quarter were $35 million, driven by strong international refining awards in Asia and defense in the United States.
Our backlog improved to $114.9 million.
The conversion of a portion of our backlog provides the foundation for our improved guidance for the fiscal year.
Moving on to slide five.
I discussed the sale detail on the last slide with the quarter at $28 million.
Sales in the second quarter was 62% domestic, 38% in international.
Last year's second quarter was 73% domestic, 27% international.
Gross profit in the quarter was -- increased to $7.7 million, up from $4.9 million last year, primarily due to volume.
Gross margins were 27.5%, up from 22.9%.
EBITDA margins were 14.2%, up from 7.8% in last year's second quarter.
And finally, net income was $2.7 million, up from $1.2 million last year.
On to slide six.
For the first half of fiscal 2021, sales were $44.7 million compared with $42.2 million in the first half of last year.
This increase was despite the challenging Q1 when our production capacity was at 50% due to COVID-19.
Year-to-date sales are 60% domestic, 40% international compared with 71% domestic and 29% international last year.
Gross profit was $9.3 million, slightly off the $9.7 million last year, and gross margins were down 20.7% versus 22.9% last year, again, impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter.
Year-to-date EBITDA margins were 4.9% versus 4.5% in the first half of last year, and net income was $900,000 or $0.09 per share, down from $1.3 million or $0.13 per share last year.
Again, the first quarter loss due to COVID-19 was substantial, but we have more than recovered that in the second quarter.
Finally, moving on to slide seven.
Cash is at $67.9 million, down from $73 million at the end of fiscal 2020, but this is simply timing of working capital namely accounts receivable and accounts payable.
We are expecting this to come back in the third quarter.
Our quarterly dividend remains firm at $0.11 a share.
Capital spending has been light in the first half of the year at $800,000 compared to $700,000 last year.
As we have seen in the last few years, our capital spending will increase in the second half of the year, and we still expect the total spend for the year to be between $2 million and $2.5 million.
Finally, as we continue to work on our acquisition pipeline and activities, COVID has not had an adverse effect on our efforts as we have built some very good relationships over time, and these conversations continue.
However, many of them are remote as opposed to in-person.
But there's still -- they are still occurring and still very active.
I'd ask that you refer to slide nine.
Sales for the second quarter were $28 million.
As Jeff had mentioned in his remarks, the company completed a large material-only order for a defense customer, which required very little conversion resources.
Sales to defense industry were up $6.8 million year-on-year due to prior -- due to the prior mentioned materials order and greater defense conversion as we continue to grow our naval workforce.
Lastly, and importantly, due to the strength of our backlog, annual guidance has been increased from $90 million to $95 million to $93 million to $97 million.
Please move on to slide 10.
While COVID-19 has impacted demand for our product, there are several actions that are being implemented to ensure that we maximize the margin of the work that is expected to convert during this financial year.
During the first quarter conference call, I outlined several initiatives that the company was pursuing in order to maximize the realized margins.
In particular, we are focused on reducing our material costs, hiring and quickly onboarding welders, differentiating our company from our competitors in the defense industry through superior execution and leveraging IT tools to increase the productivity of our team.
On the material procurement front, the team has had success in reducing our costs.
Graham is a relatively small buyer of carbon steel and stainless steel plate.
Therefore, we typically procure our plates from distributors.
However, we are finding in this time of low demand, the mills are willing to sell directly to us, thus reducing our cost.
We are also focused on growing our workforce in order to increase the production volume.
To this end, we have recently completed an expansion of our weld school.
We now have the capacity to train up to 10 welders up from 5.
The work for the Navy has higher welder content than does for other work.
Welding is a critical skill set for the company, and we must expand our capacity.
The welds on our campus is a terrific addition for workforce development.
Currently, we are prioritizing improving our productivity in the Navy production areas now that the company has completed many of the first-time operations.
Productivity enhancements will stem from improved bill flows, employee training, creation of jigs and fixtures, and lastly, applying lessons learned.
Our IT department continues to develop tools, which will improve our ability to manage our global fabrication partners.
A management dashboard is getting developed to track all aspects of our outsourced projects.
The dashboard will aggregate information that is stored on several IT platforms and will improve the productivity of our project managers.
I'll begin my remarks starting with slide 12.
Order level in the quarter was strong, especially given the state of crude oil refining and petrochemical markets.
The strong order level in the quarter is the result of implementing effectively diversification strategy.
We discussed during the past couple of years actions taken to be successful in the more price-conscious segment of refining and chemical markets.
Both participation and market share were low, which afforded an opportunity to address this segment differently.
Opportunity generation and bid management structure were modified and also execution strategy changed.
Replicating the success in China, a subsidiary structure was established in India.
It is necessary within India, as an example, to localize selling certain technical resources and quality control personnel.
We have the best chance to secure large project orders when they are supported and followed for a long time.
A local presence permits that.
This then allows for pulling a customer toward Graham rather than Graham having to move toward its competition.
Also, fabricating certain components locally within India is important.
As a result of this strategy, $10 million of new orders for India were secured in the quarter.
These orders were for both customers and end users that had not used Graham before.
I am pleased with our success in India.
We plan to pursue principally large project work.
And as of today, the company secured two of the three most recent large projects.
I commend the team that initiated and drove the strategy and those now executing the orders.
Another highlight was securing additional work for the U.S. Navy.
Navy find value in our engineering and fabrication capabilities, program management strengths, willingness to listen to feedback and implement improvements, our quality program and also that we will invest in facilities, modern machine tools, personnel and employee development.
General conditions in our crude oil refining and petrochemical markets is weak, while the pipeline for the U.S. Navy is strong.
This is noted by orders for our crude oil refining and petrochemicals being down compared with last year.
Let's move on to slide 13.
I want to discuss briefly market outlook and what we are seeing in our key markets.
I plan to go clockwise, beginning in the upper left quadrant.
The sales team did well to secure a significant amount of work that is for Asia.
The Indian work mentioned a moment ago, plus approximately $10 million in additional orders fiscal year-to-date that are for Asia.
The pipeline must rebuild and move from early stage activity to procurement stage.
We expect the next few quarters to be about building the pipeline.
We are seeing COVID having an impact in Asia as one large project in the bid pipeline that was teed up to be placed, in order to be placed, had to be postponed due to workforce impact from the disease.
We believe it will be activated again once the country has the spread of the disease back under control.
Our team in India, our team in China and those overseeing Southeast Asia point to COVID is on the rise again, resulting in slowing of activity along with heightened uncertainty.
In the Americas, it was quite slow for both revamp retrofit and also routine spare parts.
Refiners, they are focused on preserving cash right now and are postponing MRO or capital projects.
We don't see this picking up until demand recovers following having COVID under control.
Those projects that may proceed, we are carefully following.
On a positive note, an engineering-only order for a large crude oil refinery revamp was secured, that we hope proceeds within the next 12 months.
For that case, the refiner could fund only upfront engineering at this stage so that detailed layout is done, enabling the project to proceed quickly once it is ultimately released for fabrication.
If and when it proceeds into fabrication, we anticipate that a change order will exceed $5 million.
Crude oil below $40 a barrel and pandemic-driven global disruption have resulted in activity being pulled in by most national integrated and independent oil refiners.
Moving over to U.S. Navy.
Navy in particular and defense overall is active.
We have a solid pipeline of activity.
Some of it is for new components that we have not done before, while others are repeat components for upcoming vessels.
Submarine programs are vital for national defense and other strategic missions for our country.
There's terrific visibility into multiple year new vessel requirements that underpin this segment continuing to be strong.
We have identified and are pursuing $40 million to $60 million of opportunities for the Navy, and they should be placed with a selected vendor over the next nine months.
We have M&A target identification and development concentrated in the defense segment due to its strong long-term fundamentals.
As Jeff noted, relationships in certain cases were established prior to COVID, and we continue to nurture them with a combination of remote interactions along with selective visits.
Short cycle work is off 20% to 30%.
Crude oil refining and petrochemical markets are where the majority of spares revenue -- spare parts revenue was derived.
These markets, as I mentioned, are in cash preservation mode until the global economy is back on its feet and demand subsequently recovers.
On an upbeat note, there is step-up in short-cycle inquiries.
However, that has not translated into an improved order level just yet.
Chemicals and petrochemicals are also down.
Projects have been shelved or delayed.
The pandemic sent a demand shock that is not yet fully abated.
Getting COVID behind in most regions throughout the world is the catalyst for demand returning.
Let's now move on to slide 14.
Backlog is a healthy $115 million, split evenly between commercial and defense.
The staging of backlog or work in process already provides an ability to state guidance at this extraordinary time when many companies cannot.
60% to 65% of backlog is planned to convert during the next four quarters with approaching 40% of backlog planned to convert during the next two fiscal quarters.
Please go on to the next page.
As Jeff and Alan mentioned, we are updating our guidance.
We've increased the revenue range to between $93 million and $97 million, implying the second half should be between $48 million and $52 million for revenue.
Gross margin is expected to be between 21% and 23%.
SG&A spend between $17 million and $17.5 million.
And we're projecting the effective tax rate is approximately 22%.
","Graham's revenue rose to $28 million in fiscal Q2 2021, with stronger revenue and margins driving a $2.7 million net income for $0.27 per share, up from $1.2 million or $0.12 per share last year. Despite being impacted by COVID-19, diversification efforts have strengthened Graham's order pipeline, resulting in an increase in their annual revenue guidance to a range of $93 million to $97 million. The company's backlog remains healthy at $115 million, with 60-65% expected to convert to revenue within the next 12 months, providing a foundation for improved guidance. Graham's strong performance in the Navy market and ongoing efforts to increase productivity and reduce costs are expected to continue driving growth."
TNC_q3_2021.txt,"I'm William Prate, Senior Director of Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.
Dave will brief you on our operations and enterprise strategy, and Fay will cover the financials.
After their remarks, we will open the call to questions.
The risks and uncertainties are described in today's news release and the documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We encourage you to review those, particularly our Safe Harbor statement, for a description of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results.
Additionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items.
Our third quarter results reflect the returns of pre-pandemic demand across the majority of our geographic markets and verticals.
Our comprehensive and innovative product offerings are resonating with customers during this broad-based market recovery, and we expect this demand environment to continue for the foreseeable future.
While we are certainly encouraged by these positive trends, our financial performance continued to be impacted by the unexpected and prolonged global supply disruptions, inflation and labor constraints that have affected virtually every industry and geographic markets.
The increased demand for our products combined with the effect of macro level constraints on our production capabilities contributed to a record order backlog that varies by product category or region and is now 3 to 5 times our historical averages.
In response, we've taken actions wherever possible to minimize the impact on our operations.
Our plants continue to remain open and operate due to the significant efforts by our global teams to maximize output and to safeguard our customers' experience.
While we expect that these macro headwinds will continue well into 2022, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth and improve our operational efficiencies to generate long-term value for our shareholders.
We are doing so not only through short-term mitigation actions, but also to the changes we've made and continue to make as part of our enterprise strategy.
To minimize the impact of higher freight costs and related supply disruptions, we continue to prioritize local-for-local and region-for-region manufacturing and sourcing to allow us to manufacture our products closer to our customers.
As an example, we are making the necessary investments to add production of our T16 line to our China plants mid next year.
The T16 is a highly maneuverable battery-operated ride-on scrubber that has proven to be very popular with our customers within the APAC region.
By adding production to the local market, we can help minimize freight costs, improve lead times and better leverage our global production capacity.
We have continued to make capital investments to drive greater efficiency and capacity in all of our plants.
As just one example, we have invested in the new lays in our Minneapolis plant that will improve production flow, reduce the amount of labor spent machining parts and will allow us to in-source items that we would have otherwise purchased from vendors.
New tooling, specifically tooling related to our rotational molding machines, is another example of how we are investing in our business to support our local-for-local initiatives.
This lets us manufacture key components at the point of assembly, meaning, we can avoid situations where we manufacture in one location before shipping to a second location for final assembly.
These actions help avoid unnecessary shipping delays, freight costs, added time to manufacture and inventory carrying costs.
While our teams are taking every opportunity to find creative solutions to address the current supply chain environment, each day brings new challenges in terms of parts availability.
Right now, the lack of availability of hydraulic pumps, chips and other electronic components, which are critical parts within our machines, are main drivers of our increased backlog and are directly affecting our ability to deliver on our full year potential.
However, we will continue to control everything we can control and work diligently to capitalize on the strong demand environment.
An important component of our enterprise strategy is a long-term move toward platform design.
In the current environment, our engineering teams are taking a balanced approach to this initiative as they weigh the long-term benefits of platform design with the near-term need to adjust our designs to allow for available parts and to increase our sourcing flexibility.
Of course, our commitment to quality and safety and meeting the needs of our customers will not waiver.
Regarding labor shortage, specifically in manufacturing, we are staying competitive with wages and are making every effort to attract new talent by providing a safe, rewarding and fulfilling work environment.
We are also supplementing and strengthening our talent acquisition teams by partnering with third-party vendors to assist with our employment outreach through targeted marketing campaigns and professionally staged hiring events.
We are encouraged by these actions which are having a positive effect on our recruiting and helping to mitigate the ongoing labor challenges.
As Fay will discuss, while our revised full year guidance reflects what continues to be a challenging operating environment, our team remains committed to meeting the needs of our customers and executing against our enterprise strategy to deliver on our long-term financial commitments.
In particular, we continue to innovate for profitable growth, which is the third pillar of our enterprise strategy.
Over the past year, we've announced the introduction of new products to help address the evolving needs of our customers.
Earlier this year, we introduced new mid-tier products, which leverage our IPC product portfolio, to meet the needs of a broader segment of customers by offering a wider range of performance and price points.
Our mid-tier products have been well received by our customers and distributors.
While they leverage the same IPC platform, these Tennant-branded products benefit from the broader customer experience associated with the Tennant brand, including the full ecosystem of application expertise, technological innovations and best-in-class sales and service support.
During the past year, we've also introduced two key new products to our AMR portfolio, including the T380AMR and the T16AMR. Together with the T7AMR, these products have created a comprehensive robotic portfolio to meet all of our customers' needs.
With the addition of these new products, we have been able to strategically enter new verticals outside of just retail, including manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and education, among others.
Our AMR portfolio continues to be well received by an expanding number of customers, and we look forward to updating you on a number of other AMR innovations as they materialize.
The one strategic pillar I haven't yet touched on is winning where we have a competitive advantage.
For example, we recently launched a value realization exercise in Australia building on our successful North American execution back in 2019 where we assessed all of our strategic accounts and distributor partners.
In Australia, this allowed us to realign over 40% of our strategic account customers and 80% of our distributor partnerships, ensuring that we have an optimized channel structure in place to serve this highly competitive market.
By adjusting our customer segmentation appropriately, we can better adjust lead times, pricing and sales support across our customer base.
In doing so, we are aligning the customer experience with our profitability goals.
Moreover, we are relentlessly focused on providing our customers with high quality products and exceptional service as we execute on our enterprise strategy.
With that goal in mind, we will continue to take decisive and appropriate actions to maintain our customer experience, while remaining focused on our business objectives.
For the third quarter of 2021, Tennant reported net sales of $272 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year, which included a favorable foreign currency effect of 1.2% and a divestiture impact of negative 2% related to the sale of our Coatings business in the first quarter of 2021.
Organic sales, which exclude the impact of these currency effects and divestitures, increased 4.7%.
As Dave mentioned, our revenue results were tempered by the continued global supply chain disruptions and labor constraints, with North America being the most affected.
Tennant groups its sales into three geographies.
The Americas, which include all of North America and Latin America.
EMEA, which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
And Asia Pacific, which includes China, Japan, Australia and other Asian market.
In the third quarter, sales in the Americas decreased 0.6% year-over-year, which included a negative divestiture impact of 3.1%, organic growth of 2% and a favorable foreign exchange effect of 0.5%.
Strong customer demand in Brazil and Mexico drove a year-over-year increase in sales in Latin America.
North America delivered modest organic growth as compared to the prior year, due to the previously mentioned supply chain and labor challenges as well as the lapping of the significant AMR order in the prior year.
Additionally, the current year period benefited from an increase in our service, parts and consumables businesses.
Sales in EMEA increased 16.1% or 14% organically, including a favorable foreign exchange effect of 2.1%.
The results which were impacted by global supply chain challenges reflected growth across all countries and product categories in the region as demand returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Sales in APAC decreased 0.4% or 2.9% on an organic basis and included a positive foreign exchange effect of 2.7% and a negative revenue impact of 0.2% related to the sale of the Coatings business.
The sales decline was partially attributed to pandemic-related lockdowns in some regional markets during the third quarter of 2021.
Supply chain disruptions and labor constraints impacting North America plants that supply APAC also limited our ability to meet orders across the region with the largest impact experienced in China and Japan.
Even so, the region experienced strong results for parts and consumables and service with strength in the Australian market across all product categories.
Reported and adjusted gross margin in the third quarter were both 40.1% compared to a reported gross margin of 39.6% and adjusted gross margin of 39.8% in this year ago period.
Although the comparison to the prior year was favorable, the year ago period was unfavorably impacted by certain strategic investments and pandemic-related productivity challenges.
As we highlighted during our last conference call, our third quarter adjusted gross margin was lower than the adjusted gross margin in the first half of 2021.
This decrease was primarily due to increased material and freight costs and productivity challenges caused by parts availability.
As for expenses, during the third quarter, our adjusted S&A expenses were 28.3% of net sales compared to 29.3% in the year ago period.
The year-over-year improvement in leverage was a direct result of the cost saving actions as well as the adjustment of management incentives in Q3 of 2021 to better reflect current expectations.
Net income in the third quarter was $21.5 million or $1.14 per diluted share compared to $11.7 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the year ago period.
Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude non-operational items and amortization expense was $1.33 per share compared to $0.90 per share in the year ago period.
The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by lower interest expense and increased business performance.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased to $36 million or 13.2% of sales compared to $32.6 million or 12.4% of sales in Q3 of last year.
The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by increased revenues based on strong demand as we continue to lap the pandemic-related slowdown of 2020 as well as improved gross margins and an adjustment of management incentives previously mentioned.
As for our tax rate, in the third quarter, Tennant had an adjusted effective tax rate excluding non-recurring expenses of 3.8% compared to 11.3% for the third quarter of 2020.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by a tax benefit resulting from an election to step-up the tax basis of certain assets in Italy.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items.
Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investment in growth, appropriately managed leverage, pursue strategic and accretive M&A and then to return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We ended the quarter with $140.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net leverage of 0.93 times adjusted EBITDA is lower than our stated goal of 1.5 to 2.5 times.
Cash flow from operations was strong with $25.1 million generated in the third quarter and $62.9 million generated on a year-to-date basis.
Additionally, capex is approximately $12 million for the first nine months of the year.
Our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to return capital to shareholders through the following actions.
First, and as previously announced, Tennant's Board of Directors has authorized a 9% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share.
The increased dividend is payable on December 15, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2021, marking the 50th consecutive year that the company has increased its annual cash dividend.
Secondly, during the third quarter, Tennant repurchased approximately 102,000 shares of its common stock for $7.5 million under its existing share repurchase program.
The increase in the dividend and our share repurchase activities are aligned with our long-term capital allocation priorities and display continued confidence in our ongoing business performance and future cash flow generation.
Lastly, turning to guidance.
As included in today's earnings announcement, Tennant adjust its full year guidance for 2021 as follows.
Net sales of $1.09 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting organic sales growth of 9% to 10%.
Full year reported GAAP earnings in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.40 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA of $137 million to $142 million.
Capital expenditures of approximately $20 million.
And an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 15%.
The challenges we're facing with global supply chain and labor shortages are not unique to Tennant and are likely to remain for the foreseeable future.
These challenges did have a direct impact on our Q3 results and our ability to meet our full potential in 2021.
However, we are encouraged by the strong response to our innovative suite of products and the market recovery that is now at pre-pandemic levels of demand.
Our continued execution of our enterprise strategy has enabled us to better navigate to continued macro challenges facing the overall economy.
But more importantly, the strategic actions we've taken over the past couple of years will ultimately drive long-term growth and profitability and enhance shareholder value.
We will now open the call to questions.
","Tennant's Q3 earnings reflected a 4.7% increase in organic sales to $272 million, driven by strong demand and a return to pre-pandemic levels. However, supply chain disruptions and labor constraints, particularly in North America, impacted revenue growth. Despite these challenges, the company's adjusted gross margin remained stable at 40.1%. Adjusted S&A expenses improved as a percentage of sales due to cost-saving measures. Net income and earnings per share rose year-over-year, reaching $21.5 million and $1.14, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS increased to $1.33 per share. The company continued implementing its enterprise strategy, focusing on platform design, supplier flexibility, and talent acquisition. Tennant revised its full-year guidance, projecting net sales between $1.09 billion and $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.40. The ongoing supply chain and labor headwinds are expected to continue, but the company remains optimistic about meeting customer needs and executing its long-term strategy."
GHL_q1_2021.txt,"I am Patrick Suehnholz, Greenhill's Head of Investor Relations.
And joining me on the call today is Scott Bok, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
These statements are based on our current expectations regarding future events that, by their nature, are outside of the firm's control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Or a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
We reported first quarter revenue of $68.9 million, operating profit of $7.2 million and net income per share of $0.09.
Our quarterly revenue was 3% higher than last year and our operating profit and earnings per share compared to a loss last year.
Given that this quarter followed one where we had our best quarterly revenue ever, we see these as respectable results that mark a solid start to the year.
We are also pleased that after quarter end, we further accelerated the pay down of our debt and that we have made good progress toward our recruiting goals.
I will now comment very briefly on our operations as we continue through the pandemic, then on the state of each of our businesses, then speak on each of our key financial metrics.
As I've said in each recent quarterly call, our firm has operated well throughout the pandemic.
At this point, most of our offices have at least some people back from home, and some are operating fairly normally.
In-person attendance will naturally grow as more people get vaccinated and the virus risk declines, both generally and particularly for our people, most of whom I expect have been or will be vaccinated.
To the extent people are still working from home and may be for some time to come, we have proven that we can be very effective at both executing for existing clients and winning new clients in that format.
But we do think working from the office is better for our team's productivity, efficiency, training, morale and other reasons.
So our goal is to get largely back to that over the next few months in most of our office locations.
Turning to our businesses.
M&A activity is stronger than it has been in recent years in each of our main markets.
It is particularly strong in the U.S. where it is running at a record pace.
We see this in the fact that we are winning a significantly larger number of assignments than we did last year just pre-pandemic or the year before, which benefited from a good economy and no unusual health risks.
The timing of deal announcements and completions is what determines quarterly results.
So those results vary as they always have, given the serendipitous nature of deal timing.
But we feel like we're off to a good start this year in all respects.
Consistent with industrywide statistics, the U.S. is the most active part of the firm, but we are also very busy in place is the were less active last year, like Australia and Canada.
Our hope and expectation is that as other countries emerge from the pandemic period as the U.S. appears to be now, we will see economic and deal activity rebound sharply there just as we are seeing it in the U.S. now.
With respect to restructuring activity, I said last quarter that activity had slowed considerably from last year's frenetic pace, and that continues to be the case.
There will come a time when financing markets will tighten simply because that's always the case.
And there will then be another surge of restructuring activity.
In the meantime, we are supplementing our traditional restructuring activity with an increased emphasis on financing advisory work.
The debt markets have become far more diverse in recent years with the proliferation and growth of so-called alternative lenders.
We can be very helpful to our clients in accessing that market.
Lastly, after a very slow period last year, the market for private capital advisory transactions is again very active.
In our private capital advisory business, we are busy in Europe and Asia doing transactions in the secondary market, including many larger, more complex assignments for the general partner of a private equity fund, is accessing the secondary market to achieve strategic goals.
In the U.S., we've made good progress rebuilding our team.
And as part of that, we have taken steps to build a primary fundraising business, which we think can be productive in its own right, but also highly complementary to the secondary business.
We expect very shortly to have a fully functioning global team for the private capital advisory business, encompassing primary capital raising, secondary sales and general partner-led fund restructurings.
We have other recruits well in progress and expect this year to be an important year in terms of M&A recruiting with an emphasis on the U.S. market and on adding incremental industry sector expertise.
For a wide range of reasons, we are seeing a lot of good candidates.
Now turning to our costs.
Our compensation costs were lower than last year in absolute terms, but our compensation ratio was higher than our target range.
Our objective is to bring the ratio down to the target range for the full year.
Where we end up, as always, depends heavily on our revenue outcome for the year.
Our non-compensation costs were lower than last year and are running at a rate consistent with our target.
There were a few unusual expenses this quarter, primarily related to foreign exchange losses, and we continue to look for opportunities to drive costs lower even post pandemic.
Our interest expense continues to trend lower, given declining debt levels and continued low short-term interest rates.
Our tax rate of 26% for the quarter after adjusting for the impact of charges related to the vesting of restricted stock is consistent with our guidance.
We ended the quarter with $87.9 million of cash and $326.9 million of debt.
We paid down another $20 million of that debt since quarter end.
We also declared our usual $0.05 quarterly dividend and bought back just under a million shares and share equivalents for a total cost of $14.5 million.
We have $35.5 million of repurchase authority available for the year ahead through next January.
As I said last quarter, our principal focus is on deleveraging, but we also intend to purchase shares in a prudent manner to further enhance the upside potential for continuing shareholders.
Our employees currently own about half of the economics of the firm through stock and restricted stock and thus are fully aligned in trying to drive shareholder value in the quarters and years to come.
With that, I'll be happy to take any questions.
","Greenhill reported a solid start to the year with $68.9 million in revenue, a 3% increase year-over-year. Operating profit and earnings per share surpassed last year's losses, reaching $7.2 million and $0.09 respectively. M&A activity is particularly strong in the U.S., where it's surpassing pre-pandemic levels. While restructuring activity remains subdued, the firm is expanding into financing advisory work. The private capital advisory market is thriving, particularly in Europe and Asia, prompting the company to invest in building a global team for this segment. The company has accelerated debt payments and progressed towards its recruiting goals. While compensation costs were lower, the compensation ratio exceeded the target range. Non-compensation costs and interest expense are trending down. The company paid a dividend and repurchased shares. With $35.5 million in repurchase authority remaining, the focus remains on deleveraging while also enhancing shareholder value melalui share buybacks."
UNM_q2_2021.txt,"Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 included the after-tax cost related to the early retirement of debt of $53.2 million or $0.26 per diluted common share.
The after-tax amortization of the cost of reinsurance of $15.5 million or $0.08 per diluted common share, an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset related to one of our operating leases for office space we are no longer using to support our general operations of $11 million or $0.05 per diluted common share, a net after-tax realized investment gain on the company's investment portfolio of $600,000 or $0.01 per diluted common share and a net tax expense related to a U.K. tax rate increase of $24.2 million or $0.12 per diluted common share.
Net income in the second quarter of 2020 included an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset of $10 million or $0.05 per diluted common share and a net after-tax realized investment gain of $25.4 million or $0.12 per diluted common share.
So excluding these items, after-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2021 was $286.2 million or $1.39 per diluted common share compared to $250.1 million or $1.23 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.
I am very pleased with our second quarter results.
We showed a 13% increase year-over-year in after-tax adjusted operating income to $1.39 per share.
These improved results were driven in large part by the significant decline in COVID-related mortality this quarter and by excellent performance in our investment portfolio.
Given our strong second quarter results, we are raising our outlook for full year 2021 growth in after-tax adjusted operating income per share to a decline of approximately 1% to 3% compared to our previous outlook of a decline of 5% to 6%.
We believe we're making good progress to returning to our pre-pandemic levels of profitability and margins over the coming quarters with the trajectory of that improvement dependent on the developing trends in COVID and the Delta variant.
Embedded in our expectations is that COVID mortality will improve but only slightly in the third and fourth quarters.
In many ways, results for this quarter played out in line with our expectations, with declining mortality impacts, solid underlying premium trends and further strengthening of our healthy capital position.
This quarter was also highlighted with some areas of positive upside relative to our expectations.
Most notably, we saw continued excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio, which is benefiting from the strong financial markets and growth in the economy.
We also saw a record level of quarterly operating income for Colonial Life along with an impressive recovery in sales.
And rounding it out, we had favorable underlying benefits experience from our Closed Block business lines, both long-term care and the Closed Disability Block.
In addition to the positive trends we saw this quarter, I am pleased that our indicators continue to support our expectation of generating slightly positive growth in premium income in our core business segments this year with further improvement expected into 2022.
Sales trends are emerging in line with our expectations at our primary business lines within Unum US.
And Colonial Life showed very strong results this quarter with over a 50% increase from the year ago quarter, a good indicator of consumer interest in the basic financial protection products we offer.
It also highlights that the agency model of Colonial Life is quite resilient as we saw some of the most pronounced headwinds in the early stages of the pandemic.
In addition to sales trends, we remain very encouraged with the strong levels of persistency we're seeing across the majority of our business, which provide a solid base to grow.
Finally, we're seeing a pickup in natural growth primarily from higher wages in many sectors of the economy as we continue to build back premium income that was impacted by the sharp spike in unemployment in the first half of 2020.
The environment we are seeing today is quite good for our core business.
We often talk about wage inflation, but you have to add to the mix there is renewed recognition for the need to prepare for the unexpected.
And in a competitive world for talent, employers are looking to ensure that they have competitive benefits package for their current and prospective employees.
Turning to our capital position at quarter end.
It remained very healthy as well, with holding company cash of $1.7 billion and weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. insurance companies at 375%.
Both of these measures are in excess of our targets and provide substantial flexibility for us going forward.
Additionally, this quarter, we successfully completed a 30-year debt issue and redeemed a shorter high-coupon maturity, enabling us to further extend our debt stack while reducing the overall coupon.
Leverage remains approximately 28% -- 26% and provides further capital flexibility for us.
This strong capital position creates options for us as we look to create value for our shareholders.
Our deployment strategy will first focus on continuing to invest in the growth of our core business segments, both organically and through capability-driven acquisitions.
We like our position in the employee benefits market, and putting money to work to grow our core franchise is where we are focused.
We also expect to be consistent in returning capital to shareholders through dividends, which will increase by 5.3% with the dividend to be paid this month.
We do have funds in excess of these needs, so as we look to the future, we are constantly evaluating how to best deploy or hold on to this capital.
A key question is how we can use these funds to lessen the challenge to our current share price from the overhang of our legacy LTC block.
Our goal is to help reduce the LTC discount in our stock.
And in the future, this funding would be utilized in any risk transfer transaction that we explore on a portion of this block should that become an option for us.
While we are clearly optimistic looking forward, we do see areas of our business that continue to be impacted by the pandemic.
Results in our short-term disability line and leave services continue to be impacted by COVID-related claims, which remains stubbornly high.
The group life and AD&D business within Unum U.S. returned to profitability in the second quarter after recording losses in the previous two quarters as COVID-related mortality in the U.S. declined materially from the peak levels experienced late last year through the early months of 2021.
What we are watching now is that the Delta variant is impacting a younger, unvaccinated population that has different dynamics from what we have seen to date from COVID-19.
Recently updated estimates for COVID-related mortality for the third quarter and second half of 2021 are pointing to persistently high counts and only a marginal improvement relative to the second quarter.
We continue to watch these trends closely and are reflecting them in our own plans.
There is room for optimism, though, as we have started to see employers looking at the role that they might play in getting more of the population vaccinated.
As we look at growth in our enterprise, the steps we're taking -- we've taken to run our business more efficiently have freed up funds that we're reinvesting in new products and capabilities that tackle some of today's critical business workplace challenges.
During the quarter, we launched our new Total Leave and behavioral health solutions, and we've logged our first sales for both offerings.
On the digital front, platforms like My Unum and Colonial Life's improved portal are steadily providing more self-service, real-time capabilities for clients and customers.
And new technology we're testing will enhance the digital enrollment experience, automate processes and allow people to interact with us in new ways.
Equally important is the work we're doing to strengthen our culture and engage our employees across the enterprise.
We've taken steps during the quarter to accelerate and expand our inclusion and diversity journey, and we broaden the scope of our social justice fund to support even more groups facing discrimination.
These and many other efforts help place Unum among the Points of Light, Civic 50, and in Forbes Best Employers for Diversity, Best Employers for Women and Best Employers for New Graduates.
We're also happy to receive another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to be named a best place to work for disability inclusion.
These efforts and accomplishments reflect the strong culture we have built.
We are proud of how it has helped us endure through the challenges of the past 1.5 years and how the engagement of our team will propel us going forward.
Now I'll ask Steve to cover the details of the second quarter results.
I'll start with the Unum US segment, which reported adjusted operating income for the second quarter of $179.3 million compared to $115.7 million in the first quarter.
These results improved significantly due to the improvement in COVID-related mortality in our group life business line, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment.
We also saw improved operating income from the supplemental and voluntary line, while income in the group disability line declined compared to the first quarter.
Within the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported operating income of $59.9 million in the second quarter compared to $64.1 million in the first quarter.
The primary driver of the change was lower net investment income, which largely resulted from a lower level of on calls.
Premium income was generally consistent between the two quarters and on a year-over-year basis increased 1.1%.
The group disability benefit ratio for the second quarter was 74.7%, which is consistent with the first quarter benefit ratio of 74.8%.
We feel the benefit ratio will likely remain at this level over the near term due to the impacts we are seeing from COVID in the Delta variant, which we now believe will likely persist through the second half of the year.
Adjusted operating income for Unum US group life and AD&D showed a sharp improvement in the second quarter to income of $5.2 million compared to a loss of $58.3 million in the first quarter.
This improvement is consistent with our expectations and largely explained by the significant reduction in COVID-related mortality in the U.S., which declined from approximately 200,000 nationwide observed deaths in the first quarter to approximately 52,000 in the second quarter.
We estimate that we incurred approximately 800 excess claims from COVID in the second quarter compared to an estimate of 2,050 COVID claims in the first quarter.
Our average size of claim increased in the second quarter by approximately 10% as we experienced a mix shift to a more younger, working-age policyholders who typically have higher benefit amounts.
Non-COVID-related mortality had little impact on results this quarter relative to the first quarter as lower incidents was offset by higher average claim size.
Now looking ahead to the third quarter, our current expectation for nationwide COVID related mortality of approximately 40,000 compared to approximately 52,000 experienced in the second quarter.
Assuming the shift in the mix continues to more younger, working-age individuals with a continued higher average benefit amount, we would estimate third quarter group life operating income to show a modest improvement over second quarter results to approximately $15 million.
We are closely watching the impacts emerging from the COVID variants, which have led to increase in estimates for second half mortality expectations.
Now shifting to the Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines.
We saw an improved quarter with adjusted operating income of $114.2 million in the second quarter compared to $109.9 million in the first quarter.
Looking at the three primary business lines.
First, we remain very pleased with the performance of the individual disability recently issued block of business both in the second quarter and throughout the pandemic.
Though the benefit ratio did increase to 48.4% in the second quarter from 42.4% in the first quarter, it continues to perform quite well compared to our pre-pandemic experience as new claim incidence trends and recovery levels remain favorable.
The voluntary benefits line recorded a strong level of income as well.
The benefit ratio increased in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, though it did remain consistent with the pre-pandemic results.
The benefit ratio in the group critical illness line increased, offsetting the improved experience in the life lines of business.
And then finally, utilization in the dental and vision line was higher this quarter, as was the average cost per procedure, pushing the benefit ratio to 77.1% in the second quarter compared to 73.2% in the first quarter.
Dental and vision utilization has been volatile since the significant decline in utilization we did experience in the second quarter of 2020.
Sales for Unum US in total declined 3.1% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to a decline of 10.3% in the first quarter.
For the employee benefit lines, which include LTD, STD, group life, AD&D and stop loss, total sales declined by 3.1% this quarter.
We saw good activity and results in the core markets for group disability and group life.
While large case sales were down year-over-year, we are seeing a good level of quote activity in the group markets, which is back to pre-pandemic levels.
Sales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines showed similar improvement in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.
For this quarter, total sales declined 3.1% year-over-year compared to the 22.3% decline in the first quarter.
Our recently issued individual disability sales increased 4.9%, and dental and vision sales increased 2.4% year-over-year.
Voluntary benefit sales were down 7% in the quarter, which is consistent with our view that these sales will take longer to recover.
Large case DB sales in particular have a longer sales cycle and are more concentrated around January one effective date.
Persistency for our major product lines in Unum US remained in line to higher this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2020, providing a good tailwind for premium growth for the full year and into 2022.
We have also seen favorable trends and natural growth in our employee benefits lines primarily from higher wage growth at this point.
Now moving to the Unum International segment.
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $24.8 million compared to $26.4 million in the first quarter and $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The primary driver of these results is in our Unum UK business, which generated adjusted operating income of GBP16.8 million in the second quarter compared to GBP18.6 million in the first quarter and GBP10.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We are pleased with these results, which showed improved underlying benefits experience particularly in our group life line.
The reported benefit ratio in Unum UK, which showed an increase to 82.5% in the second quarter from 75.3% in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in inflation in the U.K. in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Higher inflation triggers higher inflation-related benefits to certain of our policyholders as well as higher net investment income from the inflation index linked yields in our investment portfolio.
The rapid increase in inflation in the U.K. from the first to second quarter did distort somewhat the timing of these two factors and produced a net negative impact of slightly less than GBP three million to adjusted operating income this quarter.
This short-term impact to income is expected to balance out over the course of the year.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results in our International business with benefit ratios adjusted for inflation for Unum UK improving both on a sequential and year-over-year basis.
Premium growth for our International businesses was also favorable this quarter compared to a year ago.
Looking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 3% with strong persistency and the ongoing successful placement of significant rate increases on our in-force block.
And Unum Poland generated growth of 12.4%, a continuation of the low double-digit growth this business has been producing.
With this growth, our Unum International in-force premium is now at its highest level.
Next, we are very pleased with the results generated by Colonial Life, with adjusted operating income of $95.8 million in the second quarter compared to $73.3 million in the first quarter.
This record quarterly income level was primarily driven by improved benefits experience and higher net investment income.
The benefit ratio improved to 51.7% in the second quarter from 55.4% in the first quarter as experience in the life insurance block improved with the overall decline in COVID-related mortality.
Experience in both the accident, sickness and disability lines and the cancer and critical illness line also improved relative to the first quarter.
Additionally, net investment income increased on a sequential basis, which was primarily driven by higher income from bond calls.
Looking out to the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted operating income to settle back to the low to mid-$80 million range as some of this favorable experience moderates.
We're very excited with the rebound in sales activity we experienced in Colonial Life this quarter, increasing 53.7% on a year-over-year basis.
While this strong recovery comes off of a COVID depressed result in the year ago quarter, this quarter marks a return to year-over-year growth as face-to-face sales reemerge, and we drive further utilization of our digital sales and enrollment capabilities.
As expected, premium income declined 4.3% on a year-over-year basis and will likely continue with negative comparisons for the next couple of quarters until sales volumes have sufficiently recovered.
Persistency for Colonial Life continues to show an encouraging trend at 78.3% for the first half of 2021, almost one point higher than a year ago.
Then in the Closed Block segment, adjusted operating income was $111.2 million in the second quarter compared to $97 million in the first quarter, both very strong quarters relative to our historical levels of income for this segment.
Results this quarter benefited from strong levels of net investment income due to higher levels of miscellaneous investment income, which I'll cover in more detail in just a moment, as well as favorable underlying benefits results in both long-term care and the Closed Disability Blocks.
Looking within the Closed Block, the LTC block produced a slightly lower interest adjusted loss ratio of 74.6% in the second quarter compared to 77.7% in the first quarter, both results quite favorable to our long-term expected range of 85% to 90%.
Over the past four quarters, the benefit ratio for LTC was 70% excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2020 reserve assumption update.
We continue to see higher mortality experience in the claim a block in the second quarter and estimate that counts were approximately 5% higher than expected.
LTC claims incidence was slightly higher in the second quarter, though we have seen higher recoveries on many of these claims, which mitigates the financial impact.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we anticipate that the interest adjusted loss ratio for LTC will likely remain slightly favorable to our long-term assumption range as mortality and incidence trends continue to normalize from the impacts of COVID.
For the Closed Disability Block, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 69.6% in the second quarter and 68.9% in the first quarter.
The underlying experience on the retained block, which largely reflects the active life reserve cohort and certain other smaller claims blocks we retained, performed favorably to our expectations primarily due to lower submitted claims.
So overall, it was a very strong performance this quarter for the Closed Block segment driven by both higher miscellaneous income and favorable underlying benefit experience.
We estimate the quarterly operating income for this segment will over time run within the range of $45 million to $55 million, assuming more normal trends for investment income and claim results.
So wrapping up my commentary on the quarter's financial results.
The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment was $48.5 million in the second quarter compared to $38.9 million in the first quarter.
We anticipate the quarterly losses in the Corporate segment will moderate in the second half of the year to the low to mid-$40 million range.
I'd now like to turn to our investment portfolio, where we are seeing very favorable overall credit trends.
First, there were no downgrades of investment-grade securities to high yield this quarter.
In fact, we had net upgrades in ratings overall for the portfolio, which generated a small capital benefit to us this quarter.
In addition, our internal watch list of potential credit concerns is now lower today than it was coming into the pandemic in early 2020.
First, we saw a high level of miscellaneous investment income from bond calls again this quarter as many companies look to refinance higher coupon debt and take advantage of today's lower interest rates and tight spreads.
We had approximately $10 million higher investment income from bond calls this quarter relative to our historical quarterly averages.
Over the past several quarters, this has been extremely volatile and difficult to predict from quarter-to-quarter.
While these bond calls enhance current period investment income, it is a challenge to replace the lost deals in today's low interest rate environment.
Second, as I mentioned previously, we continue to see strong performance in the valuation mark on our alternative investment assets, which totaled $51.9 million in the second quarter following a positive mark of $35.9 million reported in the first quarter.
Both quarters are well above the expected quarterly positive marks on the portfolio of $12 million to $14 million.
This quarter's very strong returns, primarily reflected returns for the period ending March 30, 2021, due to the lags in reporting typical on many of these investments.
The higher returns this quarter were generated from all three of our main sectors, credit, real estate and private equity, and reflect the strong financial markets and strong economic growth.
It is hard to predict quarterly returns for miscellaneous investment income, but the third quarter so far, we are seeing a continuation of favorable trends in bond call premiums.
Moving now to our capital position.
The financial position of the company continues to be in great shape, providing a significant financial flexibility.
The risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies improved to approximately 375%, and holding company cash was $1.7 billion as of the end of the second quarter, which are both well above our targeted levels.
During the second quarter, we successfully completed a debt offering issuing $600 million of a 30-year senior note with a coupon of 5 1/8.
This was the lowest coupon on a 30-year debt issue in our history.
The proceeds from the issue were used to redeem the $500 million of 4.5% issue that would have matured in 2025.
And you'll see the debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption included in our net income this quarter.
Importantly, this transaction enabled us to extend the duration of our debt stack and reduce the overall coupon on our outstanding debt.
With the issuance and the redemption completed in the second quarter, our leverage ratio currently is 26.2%, providing additional financial flexibility.
An important industry development recently was the finalization of the C1 factor changes, which have been under consideration by the NAIC for the past several years.
At our outlook meeting this past December, we indicated that our capital plan for 2021 -- in our capital plan for 2021, we assumed a negative impact of approximately $225 million from the adoption of the factor changes.
As you are likely aware, the NAIC concluded by adopting a recommendation from Moody's analytics, which are not as impactful to our capital plan as we previously had assumed.
We now estimate the impact to our capital position to be less than $70 million rather than the $225 million we had previously projected, a very good outcome for us, which provides upside to our capital expectations for year-end 2021.
I'll close my comments with an update to our outlook for 2021.
Previously, we expected a modest decline of 5% to 6% for full year 2021 after-tax adjusted operating income per share relative to the 2020 level of $4.93 per diluted common share.
Given the strong second quarter results and our updated view on COVID trends, we are revising our outlook upward and now look for 2021 after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share to decline by a range of approximately 1% to 3% relative to 2020.
Our underlying performance is expected to remain quite healthy, but COVID and the Delta variant will continue to be an important driver of results.
As you'll hear from the rest of the team, we continue to be very pleased with the operational performance of this company through what has been an extraordinary environment.
We believe we are well positioned to benefit from today's improving business conditions, and we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues.
So let me ask the operator to be open up the session.
","Unum Group reported a solid second quarter, with a 13% year-over-year increase in after-tax adjusted operating income to $1.39 per share, driven by a decline in COVID-related mortality and strong investment performance. The company revised its outlook for 2021, expecting a decline of approximately 1% to 3% in after-tax adjusted operating income per share, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. However, underlying performance is expected to remain strong, with positive growth in premium income and solid earnings in core business segments. The company's investment portfolio continues to perform well, with strong returns from alternative investments and a successful 30-year debt offering. Unum's capital position remains robust, with risk-based capital ratios well above target levels. While the Delta variant poses some uncertainty, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, with a focus on investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders."
KWR_q1_2020.txt,"Joining me virtually today, as we are all working from home, are Mary Hall, our CFO; Robert Traub, our General Counsel; and Shane Hostetter, our Head of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer.
We have slides for our conference call.
You can find them in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.
A great deal has changed in the world with the COVID-19 pandemic since our last quarter's conference call.
For us, our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers' needs.
All of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are meeting our customers' needs.
I am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continuing servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration, which has not missed a beat.
In our last conference call, we knew China was being impacted by COVID-19, which really started impacting us in February.
But in the second half of March, we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world.
And toward the end of March, many of our customers had significantly reduced production or shut down altogether, especially in the automotive sector.
Overall, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted our sales by about 4% in the first quarter.
We were also impacted by Boeing temporary halting the 737 MAX production, which impacted sales by approximately 1%.
These were the two main drivers of our volume decline in our pro forma comparisons.
We have gone through a customer-by-customer analysis to see what our gains and losses and market share were at the customer and product levels.
This analysis continues to show that we took share in the marketplace as we estimate total organic volume growth due to net share gains was approximately 2% in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year.
Concerning gross margins, you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker.
In the first quarter comparison, you can see this difference is only 0.5 percentage point.
This is indicative of our raw material savings from our integration starting to come through.
While crude was also decreasing during this period, we do not see any material benefits from this as of yet, as our raw material costs were relatively stable.
So overall, the first quarter results were somewhat better than expected when considering the COVID-19 impact.
Our first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to our integration savings, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition last quarter, and the additional cost control measures we put in place to combat the global effect of COVID-19 on our volumes.
This event has been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008.
Just like then, we took fast action to save cost in numerous ways.
Essentially, all discretionary expenses have been eliminated.
We stopped new hires, executive pay cuts were implemented, some positions were furloughed, and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30%.
And very importantly, we reviewed our integration's synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible.
We have now increased our guidance on synergy achievement.
For 2020, our new estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our previous estimate of $35 million.
And the total synergies that we estimate will be achieved by 2022 have been raised from $60 million to $75 million.
One question we have been asked about is if this pandemic has impacted our integration.
And the answer is that it really hasn't negatively impacted our integration in any way, especially in the timing.
I give our people a tremendous amount of credit for being able to do plant shutdowns, product manufacturing site transfers, and ERP implementations during these challenging work conditions that we're currently operating under.
For instance, we successfully implemented our [Indecipherable] at two sites recently and has done such all remotely due to the current working conditions.
Our two years of planning are paying off and we're fortunate that we had this integration execution ongoing during this period of time to help us offset the volume impacts that we're experiencing.
Even with these additional cost synergies, we have not done anything that will impact our business execution or strategic initiatives, including our ability to service our customers well, continue to grow above the market into the future, and further develop and execute on our strategic platform.
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the second quarter to be the most challenging quarter.
Many of our customers has significantly reduced production or shut down.
For example, our April revenues were down in the order of 30%.
We do anticipate that in the second half of the year, we will begin to see a gradual sequential improvement in business through the rest of the year.
However, we do not expect our business to return to the levels expected pre-COVID-19 by the end of the year.
Given how clouded the economic environment is to the COVID- 19, we will not be providing specific guidance at this time.
However, in order to try to give some direction for the remainder of the year, I can say that we're currently see that the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA could be down by nearly half of the first quarter's adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be more than $200 million.
And we do not expect to have any liquidity or bank covenant issues.
Overall, our higher expected synergies, additional cost saving actions, the improvement in our gross margins, and the expected release in cash via working capital reductions are expected to continue to help us during this period of time when our volumes are down.
And if we look forward to 2021 and 2022, I continue to be optimistic in our future, and I do expect us to achieve significant increases in our adjusted EBITDA, as we complete our integration cost synergies, continue to take share in the marketplace, and benefit from a projected gradual rebound in demand in our end markets over this period of time.
I am so proud of how our team has performed in servicing our customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continuing on with our execution of our integration, which is so critical for us this year.
People are everything in our business and by far our most valuable asset, and ensuring their safety and well-being is and will continue to be a priority for us.
I'm very happy with our Quaker Houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers, both now and going forward.
I will now hand it over to Mary so that she can review some of the key financials for you for the quarter.
These are available on our website.
Please also note that we updated the risk factors in yesterday's first quarter 10-Q to address COVID-19-related issues and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 Form 10-K.
Reconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor deck.
We followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used for our last couple of calls post Combination, where our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted EBITDA as if we've been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.
So please see Slides 6 and 7 and also the chart on Slide 8, while I review some highlights.
When we had our Q4 earnings call in early March, we noted that we continued to face strong headwinds from global automotive and general industrial weakness that surfaced the latter half of 2019, as well as a stronger U.S. dollar.
COVID-19 at that point was generally considered a China issue.
As March unfolded, COVID-19 became a global pandemic as Mike noted, significantly exacerbating the auto and industrial weakness already seen.
So, while our actual sales are up significantly to $378.6 million in Q1, this is due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.
On a pro forma basis, as if Houghton was also in Q1 of 2019, net sales were down 3%, which reflects negative impacts from lower volumes and foreign exchange, partially offset by additional sales from Norman Hay.
Despite the challenges we faced in Q1, the Company generated good cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, which was up 10% on a pro forma basis and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 was well above consensus of $1.
Gross margin of 35.4% for Q1 was down from 35.9% Q1 of last year, which is in line with our expectations and communication.
We previously noted that somewhat lower gross margins in the legacy Houghton business due in part to the accounting treatment for Fluidcare, the chemical management business.
If Houghton was included in the prior year, we estimate that our prior year gross margin would have been approximately 1% lower.
This indicates improvement in the current quarter's gross margin, which largely reflects the procurement savings related to the combination that Mike mentioned.
In the table on Slide 8, you can see a reported operating loss of $12.4 million in the GAAP section but in non-GAAP operating income of $36 million in the middle section.
The main non-GAAP adjustments are combination and restructuring charges totaling about $10 million and a $38 million non-cash impairment charge in Q1 to reflect the writedown of our Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value.
These were recorded at fair value at close of the Combination on August 1, 2019 and tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019.
However, given the recent changes in business conditions as a result of COVID-19, we determined that these assets needed to be tested again and confirm their carrying value exceeded their current estimated fair value by approximately $38 million.
As we noted in our 10-Q, as business conditions evolve, we will continue to reevaluate all our long-lived assets as necessary.
In non-operating items, we reported a non-cash charge of $22.7 million for final settlement and termination of legacy Quaker's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, a process we previously disclosed.
The offset is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss account in the equity section of the balance sheet.
Concurrent with this termination, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million, subject to final adjustment.
Our reported effective tax rate was a benefit of 31.1% in Q1 2020 versus an expense of 26.8% in Q1 of last year.
Adjusting for all one-time charges and benefits, we estimate our ETR would have been 22% this Q1 and 24% in Q1 last year.
We currently expect our full-year ETR, excluding all one-time charges and benefits, to be between 22% and 24%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, due primarily to the additional shares issued in the Combination, partially offset by the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.
Sequentially, non-GAAP earnings per share is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019, which included Houghton and Norman Hay and the additional shares.
On Slide 9, we show the trend in pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which reached $239 million as of Q1, up from $234 million at the end of 2019.
This increase reflects the strong adjusted EBITDA performance in Q1 of $60 million, up 10% from pro forma Q1 last year of $55 million due to the inclusion of Norman Hay and the benefits of cost savings realized in the quarter from the Combination.
On Slide 10, we provide an update on our leverage and liquidity.
Please note that we drew down most of the available liquidity on our revolving credit facility in March in an abundance of caution as COVID-19 went global and created significant uncertainty and volatility in all global markets.
This drop was leverage neutral as the additional cash in our balance sheet is a direct offset to our debt.
In fact, our reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 3.40 times from our year-end level of 3.47 times as a result of good cash flow and the cost savings mentioned earlier.
Our bank covenant ratio also improved from about 2.94 at year-end to 2.76 at the end of this quarter per the definitions in our borrowing agreement.
We expect to continue to be in compliance with our bank covenants and we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times.
Our capital allocation decisions reflect these priorities, including an approximately 30% reduction in previously planned capex.
As you know, we have a very asset-light business model and we also expect a release of working capital at sales decline to generate good cash flow similar to the global crisis in 2008/2009.
Our cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates and was estimated at approximately 2.4% at March 31 versus about 3% at year-end.
As Mike mentioned, we're encouraged by the additional cost synergies realized to date and expected to be achieved overall.
The increase in expected realized synergies this year from $35 million to $53 million in addition to the cost reduction actions we have taken to address the global crisis and our history of generating good cash flow in downturn all give us confidence in our ability to weather this storm.
","Quaker Houghton's Q1 results showed resilience amid COVID-19 challenges. Pro forma sales declined 3% due to volume impacts from Boeing's 737 MAX production halt and COVID-19, but organic volume growth was 2%. Gross margins improved, reflecting integration-related procurement savings. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA rose 10% due to integration savings, the Norman Hay acquisition, and cost control measures. The company has increased its synergy achievement guidance, expecting $53 million in 2020 (up from $35 million) and a total of $75 million by 2022 (increased from $60 million). Despite April revenues being down 30%, Quaker Houghton expects a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. The company anticipates its 2020 adjusted EBITDA to exceed $200 million and remains optimistic about future growth through share gains and a rebound in demand."
CLX_q1_2021.txt,"We certainly hope you and your family continue to remain safe and healthy, in what remains a challenging environment.
As usual, we have a few reminders before we go into results.
These statements are based on management's current expectation, but may differ from actual results or outcomes.
In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Turning to today's discussion of our results.
I'll start by covering our usual top line commentary, with highlights in each of our segments.
Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY '21 outlook.
Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we'll close with Q&A.
For the total company, Q1 sales increased 27%, reflecting about a point of benefit from the acquisition of majority interest in our joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and about a point of headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
This quarter's 27% organic sales growth is supported by double digit sales growth in eight of our 10 businesses.
I'll now go through our results by segment.
In our Health and Wellness segment, Q1 sales were up 28%, reflecting double digit growth in all three businesses.
Our Cleaning business had another quarter of double digit growth behind continued strong demand, for our disinfecting products.
While we continue to make progress expanding supply, we're still not at a point where we can fully meet ongoing elevated demand.
Despite those constraints, our Clorox brand continues to see increases in both household penetration and repeat rates.
We've been investing behind this momentum to convert new users to loyal consumers, and we've been seeing very strong return on our investment.
On the innovation front, our bleach complexion effort is now complete.
The Clorox fabric sanitizer platform and Clorox disinfecting wet mopping cloth, both continue to show strong growth.
On a related note, our wet mopping cloth, along with our Clorox and Clorox Scentiva branded disinfecting wipes and Pine-Sol multi-surface cleaner, all recently received approval from the EPA, for kill claims against the virus that causes COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces.
Our professional products business also had double-digit sales growth behind strong shipments across all of our disinfecting product lines.
A key driver of growth this quarter was the total Clorox Total 360 system, which uses an electrostatic technology to deliver disinfectants to large, hard to reach areas.
To support sales and continued momentum in this business, we're bringing online, new production capacity this month, for the disinfectant used in these devices.
In addition, we've created a dedicated out of home team, that focuses on growth opportunities in new channels and spaces, to further build on strategic alliances with already established, with Uber Technologies, United Airlines, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic.
Lastly, within this segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business grew sales by double digits this quarter.
This strong growth was driven by shipments to replenish retail inventories, following the recent supply disruptions, and by shipments in support of our RenewLife brand relaunch.
Our priorities this year are, to continue to improve service levels, in order to capture the strong consumption trend; execute the RenewLife brand relaunch with excellence; and deliver consumer meaningful innovation.
Turning to the Household segment; Q1 sales were up 39% with growth in all three businesses.
Grilling sales more than doubled this quarter, due mainly to strong consumption behind the grilling occasions and increased household penetration.
Sales growth this quarter was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory.
We've been very pleased to see the strong turnaround of this business, reflected in our continued share growth, strong collaboration with the retailers, and successful entry into the pellet category, with our Kingsford pellets continuing to build distribution and share.
With recent increases in grilling occasions and new households, including millennials, we're optimistic about the prospects of this business, and will invest behind this momentum to drive long-term profitable category growth.
Glad sales were up by double-digits in Q1, behind ongoing strong demand for our products, as consumers continue to spend more time at home.
We're building on this momentum with a consistent stream of innovation, including our new Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags, which launched in September.
This product eliminates Food and bacterial odors throughout the trash bags, and has already earned more than 1,000 five star ratings online from consumers.
Our Glad ForceFlex trash bags with unique fragrances and colors, which launched in Q3, also continue to perform well, and are among top selling new items at major retailers.
Cat Litter sales grew in Q1, driven mainly by strong online shipments in innovation, supported by higher advertising investments.
We're encouraged by our return to share growth in Fresh Step, behind the continued strong performance of Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform and the strong start of Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze.
In our Lifestyle segment, Q1 sales increased 17% with double-digit growth in two of three businesses.
Brita sales were up by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter.
The growth is driven by -- mainly by continued strong consumption, especially in larger sized systems and long last systems and filters.
Sales growth was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory, an effort our team has been very focused on.
Household penetration for Brita continues to grow, which gives us more reason to invest further.
We'll be introducing a new and improved LongLast Plus filter, that allows water to flow faster and captures more contaminants, along with a new pitcher.
The Food business also saw double-digit sales growth, behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, which continues to benefit from more at-home eating occasions.
This is another business where we're seeing household penetration growth.
We will continue to invest in innovation, and are encouraged to see a strong start to our new Hidden Valley Ranch secret sauce dressing.
Finally Burt's Bees sales decreased this quarter.
As the business continued to be impacted by lower store traffic, especially in parts of the store, where Burt's Bees products are typically found.
We've since accelerated our online strategy and strengthened our presence in the fast growing cough and cold category, with the launch of a new line of Rescue Balm with turmeric.
While we expect the categorywide challenges to persist in the short term, we have strong confidence in the Burt's Bees brand and its long-term growth prospects, supported by a robust innovation platform.
Now turning to International; Q1 sales grew 18%, driven by ongoing elevated demand for our products, disinfecting products, and essential household products across nearly every geography.
Organic sales grew 17%, reflecting about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about 8 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds.
Our international business has very strong momentum and we're looking to build on that through investments that accelerate our IGNITE Strategy.
Increasing the stake in our Saudi JV is just an example of that.
Another example is the international expansion of our Clorox disinfecting wipes, which are now being supported by a dedicated supply chain, separate from that in the U.S.
This will allow us to better meet ongoing elevated demand in our existing international markets where we currently offer wipes, and to launch this consumer preferred form into new geographies.
I sincerely hope you and your families are well.
I'm pleased with our very strong start to the fiscal year, reflecting broad based strength across our portfolio, with double-digit volume, sales and profit growth in each of our reporting segments.
Additionally, each reporting segment delivered gross margin expansion, contributing to our eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion for the company.
Turning to our first quarter results; first quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 22 points of organic volume growth and 5 points of favorable price mix.
Sales results also included one point of growth from acquiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of FX headwinds.
On an organic basis, sales grew 27%.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 400 basis points to 48% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter.
First quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 170 basis points of cost savings and 150 basis points of favorable mix.
These factors were partially offset by 300 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 12% compared to 14% in the year ago quarter.
Primarily from increased operating leverage.
advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales, came in at about 9%, equal to the year ago quarter.
We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales.
Importantly, this represented about a 30% increase in advertising support this quarter, compared to the year ago period, reflecting stronger investments to support our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth.
Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, compared to 22% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the impact of our increased ownership of our Saudi joint venture.
Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $3.22 versus $1.59 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 103%.
Excluding the contribution from our Saudi joint venture acquisition, Q1 diluted earnings per share grew 66%.
Our strong cash flow, was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter, which were related to our fiscal year '20 performance.
Turning to our fiscal year outlook; we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 5% to 9%, reflecting our strong Q1 results, as well as our raised expectations for the balance of the fiscal year, including double-digit growth in Q2.
And as we noted last quarter, we continue to anticipate deceleration in the back half of fiscal year '21, as we lap double-digit growth in the same period in fiscal year '20, when we saw the initial spike in COVID-19.
Importantly we continue to assume or back half sales results will be significantly stronger relative to pre-pandemic sales levels.
We also continue to anticipate about one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds.
On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 5% to 9% growth.
We expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat, reflecting the benefit of strong cost savings and higher sales, offset by rising commodity and transportation costs, as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19.
For perspective, we expect gross margin expansion in the front half, followed by a contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, as we lap gross margin expansion of 250 basis points delivered in the back half of fiscal year '20, driven by strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic.
We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives.
Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, spending closer to 10% in the front half of the year and 12% in the back half, in support of our robust innovation program.
We now expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%.
Net of these factors, we now expect fiscal year '21 diluted earnings per share to increase between 5% to 8% or $7.70 to $7.95 reflecting our assumption for stronger top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment.
As we shared last quarter, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share outlook continues to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain.
Excluding the impact of the Saudi acquisition, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share reflects strong investments behind the robust momentum we're seeing broadly in our portfolio.
We're engaging new consumers, supporting back half innovation plans and expanding our portfolio into new channels and markets, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth.
In closing, I'm pleased with our very strong start to fiscal year '21, [Indecipherable] both top and bottom line performance across our reporting segments.
This provides a strong foundation for a continued momentum, which we plan to drive through aggressive investments in our IGNITE Strategy, in support of creating long-term shareholder value.
I hope you are well and in good spirits, as we continue to navigate this pandemic.
It's great to be joining you on my first call as CEO, especially after the tremendous first quarter we delivered.
Our results show what Clorox does best.
We serve people who count on our brands, especially during a time when they need to feel safe, and when their home is the center of their world.
This reinforces my first message; our outstanding results are a reflection of our team's dedication to serving consumers and communities.
I am incredibly proud to see the broad based strength in our portfolio, with double-digit sales and profit growth in all reporting segments.
In the last eight months, all eyes have been on Clorox disinfecting products, and our brands delivered once again this quarter, with double-digit sales growth in our Cleaning and Professional Products businesses, reflecting continued higher usage of products in homes, businesses and healthcare settings.
And now, we're also shining a brighter light on the terrific performance delivered by other parts of our portfolio, with double-digit sales growth in eight of 10 businesses, demonstrating the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs.
It's particularly gratifying to see great results from our Grilling and Glad businesses, as the team has been relentless in driving progress on our business plans, including meaningful innovation.
Based on double-digit top line increases and significant margin expansion in our first quarter, we delivered very strong earnings growth for our shareholders and I'm happy we were able to raise our fiscal year outlook.
These results would not be possible without the passion and commitment of our Clorox teammates around the world.
While I feel good about our financial performance for the quarter, there is one thing that continues to keep me up at night.
Our ongoing focus to meet unprecedented demand for much of our portfolio.
We're certainly encouraged by the progress we're making in a number of businesses, including having Clorox Bleach mostly back on store shelves, but there is more work to be done.
I can assure you that our teams are leaving no stone unturned across all businesses experiencing elevated demand.
We're continuing to focus on products that can be made faster, and investing significantly in third party supply sources in an efforts to expedite our products to retailers.
Our consumers, retail partners and communities are counting on us, and I want people to know that maximizing supply continues to be top priority.
Next the Clorox team and I will play 1% offense behind our strong portfolio of leading brands consumers love, in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth.
I feel privileged to be CEO of this special company and I have my sights set on extending our momentum longer term.
In this uncertain environment, people are turning to brands they trust, and we're proud to have trusted brands in our categories.
We're seeing this play out in strong helpful penetration, not just in our disinfecting products, but in many parts of our portfolio.
For perspective, the percentage of our total portfolio was stable or growing household penetration has more than doubled year-over-year, and as I look beyond the pandemic and try to answer the question of whether or not we can sustain our strong results, I'm encouraged by the trends we're seeing, particularly consumer behaviors formed during the last seven months.
They are good indicators our brands will continue to play a meaningful role in people's daily life.
For example, people are prioritizing Health and Wellness, drinking more water and taking vitamins and supplements.
Focusing on safety and hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting, in and out of their homes.
Staying home more, including cooking, grilling, spending time with family and adopting a pet.
Spending more time online with about 90% of people saying they've shopped online since the pandemic.
There are strong signs these behaviors will stick over the long term, as people have been building these habits for three times longer than it normally takes routines to form.
And while early, we're encouraged by the strong repeat rates we're seeing across our portfolio, among core and new consumers.
This is the time for 100% offense and that means investing significantly behind our global portfolio, including through advertising and market leading innovation.
Increasing capital spending to expand production capacity in the near and long term and partnering with retailers, to enhance shopping experiences and grow our categories.
With the strength of our global portfolio, the sustained consumer behaviors we're seeing and our significant investments to drive growth, Clorox is in a great position to keep winning with consumers.
And finally the defining opportunity for Clorox is simple, to serve even more people around the world, with the strategy that helps us make the most of who we are and where we have strategic advantage.
Our IGNITE Strategy puts people at the center of everything we do, and fundamentally we will address consumer needs and follow them in the most meaningful ways we can.
Here's what I would highlight; Clorox is a Health and Wellness company at heart.
With the strength of our brands and capabilities in disinfecting, we're in a great position to extend our role in public health.
We'll continue to lean into the strategic alliances we've established with leading brands to keep their customers safe, and we'll certainly pursue more of these types of relationships with other organizations, to increase our support for people outside of their homes.
I'm also excited about expanding Clorox disinfecting wipes in International, supported by a dedicated supply chain that will allow us to scale this business in our existing markets and enter new geographies.
More than ever, people are online and we believe digital behavior is here to stay.
Clorox has leaned into e-commerce and digital marketing early, so that people can engage with our brands, in a more personal and relevant way.
As people navigate a tough economy with pressures from unemployment and less discretionary spending, they'll continue to turn to brands they trust, and we'll continue to earn their trust and loyalty by focusing on superior value.
And what's also important to me, is that we continue to be committed to growing the right way, guided by our values and with ESG embedded into our business.
It's how we help our people, our communities and our planet thrive, now and in the future.
","Clorox reported a strong start to fiscal year 2021, with a 27% increase in sales driven by double-digit organic growth across most business segments. Notably, the Health and Wellness segment saw a 28% increase due to continued high demand for disinfecting products. The Household segment also performed well, with 39% growth driven by grilling sales and increased sales of Glad products, including the successful launch of Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags. Internationally, sales grew 18% due to ongoing demand for disinfecting products and other household essentials. Gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 48%, driven by cost savings and favorable mix. The company raised its fiscal year 2021 sales growth outlook to 5-9% and now expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.70 to $7.95, reflecting continued momentum and investments in long-term growth initiatives. However, the company continues to face ongoing challenges in meeting unprecedented demand for certain products, which remains a focus area for management."
NI_q3_2021.txt,"Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.
Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.
Strong execution of NiSource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth and we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024, growth driven by our commitments to safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability.
As we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 Integrated Resource Plan identifies additional investment opportunities, while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 and it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways.
We are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings or NOEPS.
We are also initiating guidance for 2022 of a $1.42 to a $1.48 and that is consistent with our 5% to 7% near term growth commitment.
Our long-term diluted NOEPS guidance of 7% to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range and we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 as we shift to lower cost, clean and reliable generation.
Investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation.
The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals we solicited associated with the IRP.
Our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in Pennsylvania, a settlement filed in Kentucky and a proposed order in Maryland.
In addition, we filed a gas rate case in Indiana in September.
We achieved non-GAAP diluted NOEPS of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020.
Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the third quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9.
Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress.
Net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million.
Pending its decision next year from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, new rates would be effective in mid 2022.
NIPSCO filed a gas rate case on September 29th requesting a revenue increase of $115 million annually.
The case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service, while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements.
In Pennsylvania, an Administrative Law Judge issued a proposed order recommending that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the settlement in our rate case.
The settlement would increased revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective December 29th of this year.
The adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability and maintenance enhancements.
We expect the Commission's final order by mid-December.
In Kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case.
The settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure.
Columbia Gas of Maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on Friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to our request of approximately $4.8 million.
We expect a final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission in December.
Before we move on, I'd like to note the Columbia Gas of Ohio, our largest LDC, is ranked number 1 in the Midwest region in J.D. Power's 2021 Gas Utility Business Customer Satisfaction Study.
Also congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the Columbia Gas and NIPSCO mobile apps.
They are an important step forward in building our connected digital customer experience.
Let's now turn to our electric operations on Slide 10.
NIPSCO's electric TDSIC plan is pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC.
This is a five-year $1.6 billion proposal that would replace the previous plan, which NIPSCO filed in April to terminate.
The pending plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects.
The selection of the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation toward cleaner and reliable forms of generation, all of which are expected to save NIPSCO customers' approximately $4 billion over the long term.
The preferred path from the 2021 IRP refines the timeline to retire coal-fired generation at the Michigan City Generating Station to between 2026 and 2028.
It also calls for retirement of two vintage gas peaking units 16A and 16B, which are both located at the Schahfer Generating Station site.
The most viable replacement option calls for our portfolio of resources, including incremental solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas peaking resources.
We estimate that investments of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirements of these units.
We expect to be able to quantify the NIPSCO portion of this investment opportunity in the first half of next year after further evaluating bids and the request for proposals and completing due diligence on projects, which align with the preferred path.
Meanwhile, we continue to execute on the plan for retirement of remaining coal-fired generation at Schahfer.
Units 14 and 15 retired as of October 1st and units 17 and 18 are on track to retire by 2023.
We are making steady progress on the renewables project build out, informed by the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP.
Our partners on these projects are some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space and we remain in close contact regarding the progress of these projects.
We continue to expect to invest approximately $2 billion in renewable generation by 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at Schahfer.
As part of the execution of this plan, construction continues on the Indiana Crossroads I wind project, which is on track to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year.
Construction has also started on a pair of solar projects Dunns Bridge Solar I is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources under a build transfer agreement.
EDP Renewables North America is building the Indiana Crossroads Solar project, which will be operated as a joint venture.
Both are expected to enter service next year.
The IURC provided regulatory approval of the Indiana Crossroads II wind project on September 1st and with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of Schahfer Generating Station, have now received approval.
In addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen in emerging storage technologies.
It's important for us to gain a risk informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further decarbonization.
Before getting into the specific results, I'd just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of a $1.32 to a $1.36.
This new 2021 expectation also serves as the starting point for both our near-term and long-term commitment.
We have also initiated 2022 guidance of a $1.42 to a $1.48, which at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.
Turning to our third quarter 2021 results on Slide 4.
We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020.
The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments, offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment three-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year.
Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of CMA.
Operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the CMA sale, offset slightly by higher employee-related costs and outside services spending.
In our Electric segment, three-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020.
Net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased TDSIC revenues.
Operating expenses net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile.
Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.6 billion of which about $9.2 billion was long-term debt.
The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs.
As we know, last quarter, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021.
Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
As you can see on Slide 7, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.
Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan.
There are no changes to our plan since April's equity unit issuance.
I would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments.
as I mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments.
I would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an Investor Day during the first half of next year.
So please stay tuned.
","NiSource's strong execution of renewable energy investments remains a key growth driver, with plans to invest approximately $2 billion by 2023. The company expects to achieve the top end of its 2021 non-GAAP earnings guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36 per share and has initiated guidance for 2022 of $1.42 to $1.48, representing 6.6% growth. To meet growing demand, Columbia Gas of Ohio has filed a rate case requesting an annual revenue increase of $221 million, while NIPSCO has filed for a $115 million increase. In Pennsylvania, a settlement has been proposed with a revenue increase of $58.5 million, and in Kentucky, a settlement is expected with an $18.6 million increase. NiSource plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation at Michigan City Generating Station between 2026 and 2028, with investments of up to $750 million required to replace retiring units. The company also announced plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies for further decarbonization."
SYK_q3_2021.txt,"For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter.
Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.
For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19.
A slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter.
While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako product technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio.
In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular.
International organic growth of 12%, again, outpaced growth in the US, representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.
Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%.
And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as healthcare staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019.
Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery.
Our adjusted earnings per share grew 15% versus 2019, and we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%.
The earnings per share growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on.
Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance, which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities.
While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances.
We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States.
We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals.
We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18th.
My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter.
In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined trauma and extremities business.
During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID-19 Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that require higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures.
In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter.
This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time.
However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed.
The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States.
Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter.
Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets.
During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019.
COVID related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards toward the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at beginning of September.
At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October.
As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first few weeks of October.
However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by discontinued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID related volatility.
Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter.
As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter.
Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies.
In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses.
The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology.
Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less.
This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients.
Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions.
United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies.
The teams have also developed long term product pipeline strategy.
Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities, including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions.
Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year.
Including Wright Medical, the combined US Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date.
The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses, reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States.
Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson and Trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process.
Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid single digits for the full year.
Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers.
As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020.
Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter.
The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020.
Compared to 2019, the two year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%.
Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable.
Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales.
Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum of the second quarter with double digit growth in both segments.
Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the US as a result of the Delta variant.
The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopedics and Spine implant businesses.
For the quarter, US organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, instruments, medical and neurovascular products.
International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.
Our adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition.
Our third quarter earnings per share was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04.
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance.
Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the US.
This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses.
Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the US, reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures.
Our US trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio.
Other ortho grew 19.8% in the US, primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement.
Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan.
For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Writer Medical delivered 3.2% growth on a comparable basis.
In the US, comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double digital growth in our upper extremities business.
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%,,which included 12% US organic growth as well.
Instruments had US organic sales growth of 15.9%, led by double digit growth in their orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products.
Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video and general surgery products and strong double digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses.
The Medical division had US organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses.
Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia.
Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%.
This growth reflects double digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses.
Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment.
Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps and Bone Mill.
Our US Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic.
Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%.
This performance was driven by strong neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia.
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter.
Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019.
Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price.
Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation.
Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019.
This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition.
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019.
This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical.
Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition.
Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of US, non-US income and favorable discrete items during the quarter.
Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%.
For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%.
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion.
year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt.
In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion.
Turning to cash flow.
Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion.
This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management.
Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%.
As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the mid single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019.
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%.
Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year and this is included in our revised guidance range.
Based on our performance in the first nine months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15.
And now I will open the call for Q&A.
","During Q3, the company reported organic sales growth of 8.4% driven by strong performances in MedSurg and Neurotechnology, offset by a slowdown in elective procedures affecting hip, knee, and spine sales due to the resurgence of COVID-19. International organic growth of 12% outpaced US growth, with strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada, and emerging markets. Despite the headwinds, the company's MedSurg and Neurotechnology segments continued to perform well, with double-digit growth in both. The Trauma and Extremities business, including Wright Medical, delivered 3.2% comparable growth, with double-digit growth in upper extremities. Due to ongoing COVID-related volatility and hospital staffing shortages, the company updated its full-year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to $9.08 to $9.15. Despite these challenges, the company remains confident in its long-term prospects as the pandemic recedes and expects its strategies and strong fundamentals to drive future growth."
HXL_q1_2021.txt,"Before beginning, let me cover the formalities.
Such factors are detailed in the company's SEC filings and last night's news release.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without our express permission.
The purpose of the call is to review our First Quarter 2020 results detailed in our news release issued yesterday.
These numbers reflect the beginning of what we expect will be a gradual and steady recovery over the coming quarters as the world emerges from the economic effects of the pandemic and regains its confidence in air travel once again.
The results we reported in our news release, last night, represent a solid start to the year and were largely consistent with our expectations.
And we were more than pleased with how well we performed in controlling costs and delivering stronger margins.
Our Hexcel team has transformed this downturn in demand into an upturn in productivity, cash management, inventory control, and efficiency.
While we have a few more months of restructuring ahead of us, especially in Europe, which is on track, we are already realizing meaningful results from our rapid and robust response to the pandemic and its unprecedented effects on our business.
As we have previously communicated, we expect to reduce overhead costs by the middle of this year on an annual basis by approximately $150 million.
And I'm pleased to report a significant portion of those savings are reflected in our first-quarter results.
We expected that second half of 2020 and our first for this year would represent the troughs or the low point of the demand cycle resulting from COVID-19.
Now, with Q1 behind us and a clearer view ahead, we're even more convinced that our expectations were correct, which we continue to validate via regular customer interactions, including customer site visits where this can now be accomplished safely.
Keep in mind, however, the pandemic has triggered many challenges that the world has not yet fully overcome, and therefore, any substantial increases in build rates, air passenger demand, and even consumer spending remain uncertain.
For example, we anticipate that 2021 will continue to be impacted by pandemic headwinds, including inventory destocking, which we expect will wind down as we move through the second quarter and to be largely behind us as we move into the second half of the year.
Some tightness in our supply chain is always a risk, and even more so with the ever-present threat of pandemic-related slowdowns, shutdowns, and shortages.
The rollout of vaccines is encouraging in some countries, yet, unfortunately, slow in others.
Domestic travel in the US is showing signs of improvement and may boom by year-end.
While other countries are entering their second, third, or fourth lockdowns with minimal domestic flights.
International travel is still showing little sign of recovery.
So, for the aerospace industry, 2021 remains a transition period between the dramatic decline triggered by the pandemic and a return to strong growth in 2022.
We remain cautiously optimistic by both our demonstrated performance and the momentum we see building in the global economy as the air travel begins a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels.
Now, let me highlight some of the results.
First-quarter sales of $310 million were in line with our expectations.
Adjusted first-quarter earnings per share was a negative $0.10 compared to a positive $0.64 last year.
Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained a strong focus on cash, and in the first quarter, our free cash flow was a use of $6 million compared to a use of $19 million in Q1, 2020.
Despite significantly lower sales, we continue to tightly manage cash by controlling spending, which includes capital expenditures.
Liquidity at the end of the quarter was strong and included $82 million of cash and $536 million of revolver borrowing availability.
Overall, our balance sheet remains robust.
Turning to our three markets.
Aerospace sales of $147 million were down more than 59% compared to the first quarter of last year, which included sales before the effects of the pandemic began to dramatically impact Commercial Aerospace.
Sales were down significantly across all major platforms, which reflects pandemic induced build rate reductions by the aircraft OEMs and continued supply chain destocking.
While one quarter does not make a trend, we did see sequential sales growth in the first quarter for narrow bodies.
Admittedly, Boeing 737 MAX sales continue to be at a low level as the supply chain works through channel inventory.
This may take some time and will be uneven as inventory levels vary across the supply chain.
Sales to other Commercial Aerospace, which include regional and business aircraft, were down 48% compared to 2020.
Business Jets is the largest portion of this sector and while most business jet programs were down significantly year-over-year, there were a few select programs that increased modestly.
While not getting into program specifics, we are confident business jet demand will return over time, likely led by the small and mid-sized classes.
Space and Defense sales were basically flat year-over-year at $112 million.
We have content on over 100 space and defense programs and they fluctuate by quarter.
Our space business has been growing nicely over time, yet, paused in the first quarter with softer sales which was not usual.
We are -- not unusual.
We are beginning to benefit from the ramp in the CH-53K and we are pleased to see the growing international demand for this composite rich, heavy-lift helicopter.
We are encouraged with the initial outlook through proposed US defense spending, particularly as composite lightweighting [phonetic] supports the US military focus on longer-range aircraft and rotorcraft.
We expect to benefit from growth in Space and Defense throughout the year.
Total Industrial sales of $51 million in the first quarter were down more than 23% and 27% in constant currency.
Lower wind energy sales drove the decrease, yet were partially offset by stronger automotive sales, which may be an indication that consumer confidence is improving.
Wind energy sales, which is the largest submarket in Industrial, were down more than 40% compared to last year.
And reflects a previously reported softening in customer demand, as well as the closure of our wind blade prepreg production facility in North America, last November.
Wind energy remains a good business for Hexcel and Vestas continues to be a great customer.
Material manufacturing continues at our plants in Neumarkt, Austria; and Tianjin, China, as well as our continuing commitment to innovation in the wind energy market.
During the quarter, we announced our new HexPly XF Surface Treatment Technology that significantly reduces show manufacturing time during the wind blade production process.
It's a product that has had a successful track record in prepreg blades and now is adapted for infusion processes.
We also received type approval certification for our HexPly M9 [Phonetic] prepreg materials, which adds to our growing portfolio of prepreg processing options for marine applications.
To finish, I'd like to provide a slightly longer-term perspective.
As sales recover in 2022 and beyond, we expect to deliver strong incremental margins as utilization of existing capacity increases.
While we do not guide to incremental margins, what may be helpful is to review past sales levels and operating margin performance before the A350 reached peak rates.
Specifically, in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe Hexcel sales were in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with operating margins in the range of 17%.
And what is noteworthy is that the A350 production rate was ramping to five per month during these years.
We believe that we can return to these margin levels when we attain similar sales levels.
While our depreciation expense is now higher than during that prior time period, our focus is to more than offset this by efficiency improvements and our overhead cost reductions.
Our cost base will expand with growth, but what is incumbent on our management team is to be extremely disciplined in managing cost growth and ensuring the depreciation headwinds is more than off overcome.
To state this succinctly, we expect to achieve strong, mid-teens plus operating margins, with sales of approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, and we are targeting to exceed prior peak margins when we return to previous peak sales levels.
As a reminder, the year-over-year comparison will be in constant currency.
The majority of our sales are denominated in dollars.
However, our cost base is a mix of dollars, euros, and British pounds, as we have a significant manufacturing presence in Europe.
As a result, when the dollar strengthens against the euro and the pound, our sales translate lower while our costs also translate lower leading to a net benefit through our margin.
Accordingly, a weak dollar, as we are currently facing, is a headwind to our financial results.
We hedge this currency exposure over a 10-quarter horizon to protect our operating income.
Quarterly sales totaled $310.3 million.
The sales decrease year-over-year reflects production rate decreases by our Commercial Aerospace customers in response to the pandemic, combined with the continued Commercial Aerospace supply chain destocking.
Turning to our three markets.
Commercial Aerospace represented approximately 48% of the total first-quarter sales.
Commercial Aerospace sales of a $147.6 million, decreased 59.7% compared to the third quarter of 2020 as destocking continues to impact our sales.
We continue to expect destocking to wind down during the second quarter of 2021, consistent with what we have communicated during our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.
We don't expect to generally be aligned with OEM production levels entering the second half of 2021, with destocking largely behind us and recognizing the beneficial impact of the cost takeout actions that we have implemented.
Space and Defense represented 36% of first-quarter sales and totaled $111.7 million, basically unchanged from the same period in 2020.
We remain bullish for the outlook for our Space and Defense business globally.
Industrial comprised 16% for first quarter 2021 sales.
Industrial sales totaled $51 million, decreasing 27.1% compared to the third quarter of 2020 on weaker wins and recreation market, partially offset by stronger automotive.
Wind energy represented approximately 50% for first quarter Industrial sales.
On a consolidated basis, gross margin for the first quarter was 17.1% compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2020.
The sequential gross margin improvement from the fourth quarter of 2020 had three drivers, including greater impact from our cost reduction actions, improved sales mix, and a few more carbon fiber lines coming back online as our production levels and inventory becomes appropriately realigned with demand.
We continue to temporarily idle select carbon fiber assets.
And as we bring further lines back into production over time to support this expected gradual and steady sales growth in future periods, this should help generate strong incremental margins.
First-quarter selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 17% or $8 million in constant currency, year-over-year, as a result of headcount reductions and continued tight controls on discretionary spending.
Research and Technology expenses decreased 19.7% in constant currency.
The other expense category consisted primarily of severance costs in Europe.
We continue to target approximately $150 million of annualized overhead cost savings, including indirect labor.
As Nick said, a significant portion of these savings have been achieved and were reflected in our Q1 2021 results.
We expect that most of the remainder of this cost and take-outs will be achieved by the end of the second quarter of 2021.
Adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.9 million, which is the first positive operating income since the destocking began in earnest during the third quarter of 2020.
The year-over-year impact of exchange rates was negative by approximately 10 basis points.
Now turning to our two segments.
The Constant Materials segment represented 76% of total sales and generated a 3% operating margin or an adjusted operating margin of 8% compared to 19.9% adjusted operating margin in the prior-year period.
The Engineered Products segment, which is comprised of our structures and engineered core businesses represented 24% of total sales and generated a 6.4% operating margin or a 5.4% adjusted operating margin compared to 6.6% adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of 2020.
The tax benefit for the first quarter of 2021 was $7.5 million, which included a discrete tax benefit of $3.2 million from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to a favorable US state tax law change.
The pandemic and consequent mix of results across the countries in which we operate is expected to continue to have an impact on the Company's overall effective tax rate throughout 2021.
Net cash used by operating activities was $1.2 million for the first quarter.
Working capital was a use of cash of $26.2 million in the quarter, primarily related to increased receivables as first-quarter sales were weighted toward the end of the quarter.
Capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $4 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $21.9 million for the prior-year period in 2020.
Capital expenditures continue to be tightly managed with a focus on improving existing asset efficiency and new technology flexibility.
Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2021 was negative $6.1 million compared to negative $18.6 million in the prior-year period, which reflects tight spending control on significantly lower sales.
In late January 2021, we announced the second amendment to our revolver, which we've structured to accommodate the temporary economic impact of the pandemic.
The amendment temporarily replaces the leverage covenant with a minimum liquidity covenant.
The minimum required liquidity is $250 million, which includes unrestricted cash, plus unutilized revolver-based [Phonetic] availability.
This minimum liquidity requirement is through and including March 31, 2022.
The facility terms then revert to the prior leverage covenant, effective April 1, with the first measurement of leverage to occur as of June 30, 2022.
Additionally, the amount of the revolver is reduced to $750 million from $1 billion, previously.
This amendment preserves our access to liquidity during this period of market transition and reinforces our strong relationship with our bank's indication.
We remain within all covenant conditions.
Our total liquidity at the end of the first quarter of 2021 was $618 million, consisting of $82 million of cash and an undrawn revolver balance of $536 million [Phonetic].
Our revolver matures in 2024 and our two senior notes mature in 2025 and [Technical Issues] purchase program remains suspended and is also restricted by the previously referenced revolver amendment.
Our Board continues to regularly evaluate capital allocation priorities.
As our earning release states, we are not providing financial guidance at this time, but I would like to reinforce and expand upon the information shared during our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.
We continue to expect 2021 annual sales to be lower than 2020, in fact, largely in line with the current market consensus.
We expect the aerospace supply chain destocking to largely come to an end during the second quarter 2021.
While some destocking may continue into the second half in select instances, it should be offset by strengthening narrow-body sales.
Some additional restructuring costs are anticipated in the remaining quarters of 2021 but below the first-quarter level.
We expect the fiscal year 2021 adjusted operating margin percentage to be in the low single digits.
Capital expenditure in 2021 will continue to be managed very tightly and is expected to be at a similar level to 2020.
We expect to generate free cash flow in 2021 and further reduce debt levels.
The tax assumption is more contrary to normal, but we expect the underlying effective rate to be approximately 25% in 2021.
This change from prior rates was due to a change in the mix of jurisdictions where we generate income.
Over time, we expect the tax rates to return to pre-pandemic levels assuming no changes to existing tax rates in the major jurisdictions where we operate.
Our first-quarter results give us confidence in our outlook for a steady recovery throughout 2021.
We believe that the aerospace industry will realize some upticks in demand beginning in the second half.
And as it does, Hexcel is well-positioned to benefit from our leadership and much sought-after advanced lightweight composites from our strong customer relationships that have grown stronger throughout the pandemic, and from our continuous focus on continuous improvement through operational excellence.
This also is not the time to be shy about investment in R&T and we are continuing to realize a strong pull from our customers to further drive advancements in existing and new innovations that position us to win next-generation platforms.
Despite all the turmoil and challenges that arose in 2020, the great strengths and values of Hexcel remain as robust as ever.
We still have leading positions on the world's largest aerospace programs with our advanced composite materials and the broadest technology portfolio in our industry.
The great job our team has done puts us in a position to return to substantial growth once this pandemic is behind us.
Few companies are as efficient or as good at execution, or as committed to excellence as Hexcel.
Our people are the most resilient and talented group that I've ever known and I'm always proud to share with you their accomplishments every quarter.
For several years, Hexcel has been building capacity to meet extraordinary ramp-ups in demand.
So the chance to pause with our customers, over the past few months, has afforded us a unique opportunity to ensure that we are aligned with them and in the strongest position possible to meet the growing demand at hand.
Hexcel has never been more focused on its customers, innovation, and operational excellence.
We expect to emerge from these challenges as a leaner and stronger company and even better positioned for strong growth and return to shareholders.
","In Q1 2021, Hexcel reported $310 million in sales, in line with expectations. Adjusted EPS was negative $0.10, reflecting lower sales. Despite the challenges, Hexcel's team has optimized operations, resulting in significant cost savings and an 8% adjusted operating margin in the Constant Materials segment. Destocking in Commercial Aerospace is expected to wind down by Q2, aligning with OEM production levels. The Space and Defense segment remains stable, with expected growth throughout the year. Industrial sales declined due to weak wind energy demand, but Hexcel is optimistic about recovery. Strong incremental margins are anticipated as sales recover, and the company aims to exceed prior peak margins when sales reach $1.8-$1.9 billion. Overall, Hexcel's financial results demonstrate resilience and a focus on operational excellence, positioning them for growth when the industry recovers."
