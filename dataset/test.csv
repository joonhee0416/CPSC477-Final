Earnings Call Transcript:
 Hope everyone is having a safe and good day.
This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO.
And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is our President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan.
Now as we normally do, before we start, we need to read our cautionary statement.
Now on to our report.
I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric.
Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income.
This was by far our most successful quarter ever.
Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter.
Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points.
Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million.
And operating margins, this is a big one, operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%.
Now these results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns.
Now we have two new companies in our family, TEC and Acme.
They performed very well, and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an important part of Watsco.
They have a rich and successful history and we will help them any way we can.
Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market.
Again, this is a $50 billion North American market.
And we hope to find more great companies to join us.
Greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities.
Also Watsco's industry-leading technologies continues to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share.
Here are a few important highlights to mention.
First, growth rates among active users of our technologies continues to outpace the growth rates of nonusers.
Customers using our technology are simply growing faster.
Next, attrition among customers using our technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers.
The technology enables us to create stickier customer relationships.
Also, more customers are using our digital selling platforms that are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort.
They help and modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners.
These tools have also benefited the sale of higher efficiency systems, which we think is an important contributor to the climate chain discussion.
As older systems are replaced, our technology can play an important role in helping consumers choose more energy-efficient solutions.
Our progress is very encouraging, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments.
Our focus remains in the long term.
I think you've heard me say that over and over again.
We are long-term players in the industry.
Please feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its impact.
Finally, but very important, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt.
We have plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow our company both organically and through acquisitions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Our unique investment strategy of clustering assets or our newest defense installation supporting national security activities continues to generate strong high-quality earnings.
Second quarter FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 exceeded the high end of guidance by a $0.01.
It was driven primarily by same property results.
Additionally, NOI from real estate operations in the quarter was up 8% and AFFO increased 17% from a year ago.
Through the second quarter, we completed total leasing of 1.7 million square feet, which included 815,000 square feet of renewals, 205,000 square feet of vacancy leasing and 641,000 square feet of development leasing.
So far in the third quarter we've executed 53,000 square feet of development leasing and we are in advanced negotiations on another 250,000 square feet that should close this quarter.
Based on this activity we're highly confident we will achieve our 1 million square foot growth for the year.
Regarding our large renewal at DC-6, we have not finalized the lease yet.
We reached agreement on business terms in June and expected documentation would follow quickly.
The tenant is controlling the pace and progress of the actual lease document preparation and that process continues to labor.
Based on their deployment, power usage and the nature of other activities, we are conducting with them we have every confidence they will remain in our building.
During the quarter, we placed 197,000 square feet of development projects in the service including Project EL, 107,000 square foot specialized facility we built for a defense contractor in San Antonio.
We completed this project full quarter earlier than forecasted and we expect to deliver two additional projects ahead of schedule later in the year thereby accelerating lease commencements.
We expect to deliver NoVA C in 610 Guardian Way earlier than planned, which combined with Project EL are adding nearly $0.03 to this year's FFO per share.
Stronger same property operations and accelerated development completions drivers that once again increased the midpoint of our full year guidance for FFO per share as adjusted for comparability.
The $2.26 midpoint of updated 2021 guidance is $0.07 above our original midpoint and 6.6% higher than 2020 results.
Metrics and trends in our Defense IT Locations exhibit strength and we continue to capture strong demand as shown in our lease accomplishment to-date.
In the second quarter, we leased 1.4 million square feet including 661,000 square feet of renewals for a very strong retention rate of 89%.
Cash rents on renewals rolled up 0.1% and annual escalations averaged 2.6%.
For the 6-month period, we completed 815,000 square feet of renewal leasing with a 78% retention rate and average lease term of 4.3 years and cash rents rolling down 0.2%.
Late in the quarter, we learned that a tenant at Redstone Gateway did not win the recompete of a large contract and at the end of the year will vacate RG 1200, a 121,000 square feet building.
This will be our first opportunity in 10 years to demonstrate the strength of demand for second-generation space at the park.
We already have strong interest from multiple defense contractors looking to move to Redstone Gateway, including two that have 2022 occupancy requirements and want to gain control of the full building.
The strength of demand we continue to see demonstrates Redstone Gateway's position in the market as the essential location for serving government customers on Redstone Arsenal.
In terms of vacancy leasing, we completed 111,000 square feet in the quarter, representing 10% of our available space at the beginning of the period.
For the first half of the year, we completed 205,000 square feet of vacancy leasing.
Our leasing activity ratio is 105%, the highest level since well before the pandemic demonstrating continued growth in demand across our portfolio.
As such, we expect to accomplish healthy volumes of vacancy leasing in the remainder of this year.
...
...ur development leasing pipeline, we are highly confident we will meet our 2021 development leasing goal.
Second quarter FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 exceeded the high end of guidance by $0.01 driven primarily by stronger same property results.
Lower operating costs due to effective expense management and the timing of R&M projects boosted second quarter same property cash NOI by nearly $0.02 above our second quarter forecast.
We expect to complete these R&M projects in the third and fourth quarters, which will impact quarterly same property cash NOI and FFO per share as shown on page 18 of the results deck.
That being said, for the second consecutive quarter, operating savings and better than expected leasing outcomes are pushing our same property cash NOI forecast higher.
We now expect same property cash NOI for the year to either be flat or increase as much as 1%, which at the midpoint is a 150 basis point increase relative to our original guidance.
We are maintaining our full year occupancy guidance of 90% to 92%, which continues to incorporate the negative impact of joint venturing fully occupied wholly owned datacenter shells to raise equity as well as the unexpected vacancy of the 121,000 square foot contractor building at Redstone Gateway in December.
In early June, we sold two data center shells to a new 90%/10% joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate, which generated proceeds of $107 million.
The assets were valued at $119 million, which represented a 48% profit and demonstrated the value we create through development.
Including three properties under development, we wholly own 10 data center shells that we estimate represent more than $750 million of equity value we can monetize to fund the equity component of future development.
Lastly, and for reasons already discussed, we are increasing our full year guidance from a previously elevated range of $2.19 to $2.25 to a new range of $2.24 to $2.28.
Our updated guidance range implies 5.7% to 7.5% growth over 2020 results and 6.6% at the midpoint.
It is important to note that early development deliveries are driving most of the increase to guidance and that the NOI from these developments expected in 2022 remains unchanged.
For the third and fourth quarters we are establishing ranges for FFO per share guidance as adjusted for comparability of $0.54 to $0.56 and $0.56 to $0.58 respectively.
The $0.55 midpoint in the third quarter reflects a full quarter's dilution from the two data center shells we joint ventured in June and executing additional R&M projects.
At mid-year, our FFO achievement has outperformed our business plan significantly.
This quarter's FFO result is the fifth time in the past six quarters that we exceeded our plan and the third time in which we elevated full-year FFO guidance.
Our key performance metrics such as vacancy leasing and development leasing are tracking at or above plan.
Clearly our strategy of concentrating investments adjacent to priority Department of Defense missions and creating value through low risk developments at these locations is delivering FFO growth and lowering our cost of capital.
Our strategy continues to provide over a million square feet of new development opportunities annually and by expansion, high value Defense IT assets that benefit our shareholders long term.
This year, our development capability excellence is not only delivering projects on budget and on time, in several instances we're completing projects ahead of schedule and accelerating our bottom line results.
Our property operations excellence is ringing out additional performance from our portfolio and improving our same property results.
Our highly durable operating portfolio, strong balance sheet and reliable, low-risk development program combined to create the very visible growth we are delivering.
We have a strong set of development and leasing opportunities before us and the balance sheet and access to capital to seize upon them.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Please read the forward looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
Linde employees delivered another solid quarter, continuing Q2's record earnings per share performance, despite increasingly challenging market conditions.
Operating cash flow and return on capital reached record levels, and our project backlog nearly doubled, providing a strong foundation for high quality, long term growth.
We also stepped up our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gases emissions footprint, and Sanjiv will share that road map with you.
But frankly, this isn't something new.
It's what we committed to our shareholders since the merger and had been delivering on ever since, irrespective of the macro environment.
Most of you know this, but I think it bears repeating: our operating culture runs deep at Linde, our people take great pride in demonstrating continuous improvement across the key operating metrics in their business.
The best day of the month for our management team is when we review the operating performance of each of our regional business units.
This is what we do for fun in Danbury, among other things.
While I'm sure you've seen the announcement earlier this week where I will become the Chairman of the Board, and Sanjiv will become CEO effective March first.
His appointment is the culmination of a diligent three year succession planning process, in which Sanjiv clearly demonstrated he was the right choice to lead this company going forward.
I will continue to provide guidance, both from the perspective of a Director and a significant shareholder.
But my primary responsibility shifts to chairing the Board of Directors, while Sanjiv takes over day to day management of the company.
Supporting Sanjiv is a highly capable and experienced leadership team.
I have been CEO for 15 years, and I have never felt better about how the company is positioned.
Obviously, our strategy is working well and the team is executing at a high level.
Some say we are a well oiled machine.
We are a company for all seasons, and I'm confident Linde's best days lie ahead.
I'll now hand the call over to Sanjiv.
I'm honored to be given the opportunity to lead this outstanding company into the future.
I appreciate your confidence and support over the years.
Before I jump into the slides, I wanted to build on Steve's comment of a seamless leadership transition.
Here at Linde, we are proud of our industry leading performance, which starts with living our core values while maintaining a disciplined execution culture.
As CEO, I fully intend to build upon our foundation.
My focus will be on areas that are aligned with the interest of our shareholders: profitable growth, optimize the business, cash generation and, of course, the truth serum for our industry, ROC.
Linde will remain focused on the things that create value for Linde owners such as strong pricing and productivity culture, an active commitment to sustainability, a disciplined investment philosophy, a shareholder friendly capital policy, and of course, pursuing high quality and sustainable growth initiatives with emphasis on ROC.
Ultimately, it's about being the best performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world.
Stated differently, you can expect a seamless transition with minimal change.
Now with that said, let's move on to slide three for an update on our growth initiatives.
Last quarter, I mentioned some key growth drivers, including the secured project backlog, accretive base capex investments and the strength of our growth in low capital intensity areas such as healthcare, food and beverage, engineering and our packaged gas business.
Today, I'm happy to report that our project backlog has increased from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion or up 81% sequentially from the last quarter.
You will recall, this backlog only includes contractually secured incremental growth with fixed payments to ensure targeted ...
...adwind sequentially, as most currencies have recently devalued against the U.S. dollar.
Excluding these items, underlying sales grew 11% over prior year and 1% sequentially.
The 8% volume increase over last year was broad based across all geographies and end markets, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic.
Sequentially, volumes are flat as contribution from project start-ups were mostly offset by lower volumes in China.
Pricing levels are up 3% from last year and 1% from the second quarter, as we continue to adjust merchant and packaged gas product pricing in line with local inflation.
Note that some of these contracts have lagging recovery mechanisms, which may not take effect for two to six months, depending upon the terms and conditions.
Operating margin of 23.6% is 150 basis points above 2020, but 60 basis points below the high mark set in the second quarter.
Excluding the impact of cost pass-through, operating margin would have increased 220 basis points above last year and had a negligible decline sequentially.
As mentioned, merchant and package cost recovery can lag one to two quarters.
So going forward, I expect continued pricing momentum.
EPS of $2.73 is up 27% over last year from higher volumes and price over a relatively stable cost base.
As both Steve and Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth, irrespective of the economic climate.
This is also evident in the 16.7% return on capital, which represents another record as profit continues to grow double digit percent over a flat capital base.
The reason we've been able to maintain such a steady capital base is due to a combination of disciplined capital management and healthy cash generation, which I'll cover on slide eight.
You can see to the left, our operating cash progression resulting in a record level of $2.6 billion in the third quarter.
The three main drivers are stronger earnings, timing benefits from last quarter and engineering contract prepayments.
In light of the record sale of plant backlog, I anticipate further project repayments into the next few quarters.
As far as how we allocated year to date cash, the pie chart to the right shows $2.3 billion invested into the business and $4.8 billion distributed back to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
Note that investments exclude sale of plant since we are paid in advance for engineering projects, which means that we are committing much larger amounts toward contractually secured growth than what's shown on this chart.
In addition to generating significant surplus cash we have access to very attractive capital through the debt markets.
In September, we issued almost EUR two billion at five, 12 and 30 year maturities, with all-in coupons of 0%, 0.38% and 1%, respectively.
Overall, the combination of excess cash generation and low cost incremental debt gives us a high degree of confidence to maintain shareholder friendly allocation policies over the long term.
I'll wrap things up with guidance on slide nine.
The fourth quarter earnings per share guidance range of $2.60 to $2.70 is 13% to 17% above last year and 38% to 43% above 2019.
Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's important to distinguish true multiyear growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions.
Versus the third quarter, this range represents a sequential decrease due to normal seasonal declines plus an estimated 1% foreign currency headwind.
Underlying volumes are assumed to be roughly in line with the third quarter, but if current conditions hold, I'd expect to be at the upper end of this range.
This quarterly update results in a new full year guidance of $10.52 to $10.62, which represents a growth rate of 28% to 29% over 2020 and 43% to 45% over 2019.
In summary, another solid quarter despite some challenging conditions.
And regardless of the macro, we remain confident in Linde's ability to continue delivering industry-leading performance.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change.
Additionally, please mark your calendars for our upcoming 2022 guidance meeting to be held on December 10.
We will invite sell-side analysts to participate in person in New York, and ask others to participate virtually.
Brent Layton has a conflict that could not be avoided, but you can expect him to join us on future calls.
First, on the quarter, we were pleased with the results and the fact that the matrix was straightforward with minimum noise.
In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion and HBR of 88.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26.
Drew, provide additional context.
Overall, the numbers reflect a return to a normal utilization while still covering reasonable amounts of COVID costs which seem to have peaked in August.
Importantly, our performance provides a strong foundation for our value creation plan and we remain committed to our margin goals.
Further supporting our strategic progress during the quarter, we announced a series of organizational changes including a point Sarah London as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Brent Layton as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer.
We do not plan to replace his position, as we continue to work on refreshing and streamline the Board to a size of 9 to 13 members.
Turning to the current landscape.
Overall, the portfolio is performing well.
We delivered a strong membership increase in Medicaid are positioned for continued growth in Medicare and we continue to stay the course in marketplace.
Sarah, will provide further detail.
We are working closely with states and the timing redetermination, which has so far been extended until January with the opportunity for additional extensions three months at a time.
In addition, we look forward to offer members who will no longer qualify for Medicaid, the opportunity to enroll in our marketplace for us.
We expect that advanced premium tax credits will keep costs in line for these members, and we value the opportunity support continuity of care and preserve, provide relationships which in the long-term leads to higher quality care, which is much more cost effective.
Looking ahead of 2022, there are several additional factors we continue to monitor and evaluate.
These include the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in marketplace license, as well as the COVID landscape overall.
We will provide full details on these factors and their potential impacts, as headwinds and tailwinds at our Investor Day in December.
In addition, we are committed to achieving an investment grade rating and a disciplined capital allocation framework that takes into consideration our priorities including investing in our business debt management and share repurchases.
Before I close, I would like to highlight the importance of vaccine mandates in stopping the transmission of COVID and protecting those who cannot yet safely receive inoculations, particularly the immunologically compromised, and young children for whom vaccine access is getting closer, but still pending.
Centene has been a leader on this critical issue mandating vaccinations, as an additional employment.
We also continue to support our members in assessing the vaccine to a national outreach and campaigns and creative participation such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame NESCO.
In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results and has the same momentum across the enterprise.
We remain focused on executing across the value creation playbook, we have in place.
As always, we intend and continue to provide transparent updates, as we progress through our initiatives and I look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day.
I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan.
During the quarter we continue to build o...
...ak, as measured in authorizations compared to January 2021, it peaked and fell rather quickly.
With our diversified enterprise we were able to manage through this given our steady performance in Medicaid and Medicare.
Accordingly, we are maintaining the midpoint of our consolidated HBR range for 2021 just shrinking the width of the range since we're three quarters through the year.
Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter with higher short term variable incentive compensation costs compared to Q2 given the positive trajectory of the business.
While we are getting some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there is a lot more to come over the next few years, as we execute on the value creation plan.
One item to point out from a mix standpoint circle, a well positioned ASC like hospital enterprise and England has an SG&A rate in the '30s on service fee revenue of approximately $1.4 billion.
This has an approximate 30 basis point mathematical impact on our consolidated SG&A rate for Q3 2021 and going forward.
Continuing on the highlights of the quarter, cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $1.8 billion.
With respect to unregulated cash we had $2.7 billion at quarter end, which includes the $1.8 billion we borrowed to partially fund the Magellan transaction.
We expect to need approximately $2.3 billion of unregulated cash to close Magellan in the fourth quarter.
Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion, our debt to cap ratio was 41.2% inclusive of Magellan financing and excluding our non-recourse debt.
Our medical claims liability totaled $14.1 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 48 in Q2.
This three-day increase was driven by the timing of state-directed payments, claims payments and state fee schedule changes.
You will see a couple of items in our GAAP to adjusted earnings per share reconciliation, a $309 million one-time gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 60% of circle in early July 2021 and a write-down of our investment in RxAdvance of $229 million in the quarter, as we are simplifying our pharmacy operations, both of these are non-cash items.
Before we get to updated 2021 guidance I wanted to comment on the recently announced rating year 2022 star scores.
This will drive 2023 Medicare revenue.
We are certainly pleased with over 50% of membership in 4-star contracts and our first 5-star contract, rating year 2022 benefited from the continuation of disaster provisions due to COVID with an expectation of those provisions sunsetting and upon reviewing the in-process results of our quality program we expect rating year 2023 scores to drop, followed by a subsequent jump in rating year 2024 scores.
This essentially has the effect of providing some fungible investment dollars for calendar year 2023.
We've updated our full-year 2021 outlook including a narrowed adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.15.
This outlook incorporates revenues within a range of $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion increased by the inclusion of Circle and expected state-related pass through payments of $500 million.
It includes an expected HBR of 87.6% to 88% and then SG&A ratio of 8.2% to 8.6% 20 basis points higher than the prior guidance with the largest driver being the mix math on Circle as we just discussed.
While we still have a quarter to go to finish 2021, the strength of our diversified enterprise has enabled us to manage through the volatility of COVID, pent-up demand and resulting 2021 marketplace pressure.
This enterprise strength will only improve, as we execute on the value creation plan over the next few years.
With regards to 2022, consistent with our public comments in September, we continue to expect modest adjusted earnings per share growth next year.
We look forward to providing more details around 2022 expectations and going more in-depth into the long-term value creation drivers during our December 10 Investor Day.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors.
We direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations, or FFO; core FFO, same-center net operating income, and adjusted EBITDA.
As such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, May 6, 2021.
[Operator Instructions] On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We are encouraged by a greater macro outlook over the past 90 days as vaccination rollout continues and an improving retail environment, as evidenced by the Consumer Confidence Index in late April, reaching its highest level since the onset of the pandemic.
The improvement we are starting to see in some of our operating metrics reflects the excellent value proposition that our open-air centers provide for both retailers and shoppers.
We are confident that, by continuing to make progress executing on our strategy, we'll position the company to return to sustained growth over time.
We're pleased to share that traffic to our domestic open-air centers in the first quarter nearly returned to 2019 levels and exceeded 2019 levels in April.
We continued to make progress on our core priorities for the business: leasing, operating and marketing our outlet centers.
We are focused on rebuilding our occupancy, driving leasing, and curating our merchandise mix to maximize shopper frequency and dwell time, and to bring new customers to Tanger Centers.
Consolidated portfolio occupancy was 91.7% at the end of the quarter, up only 20 basis points from the end of 2020.
This reflects the anticipated 61,000 square feet of space recaptured during the quarter related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.
Blended average rental rates decreased 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis for all renewals and retenanted leases that commenced during the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021.
However, this reflects a 300 basis-point improvement on a cash basis, a 390 basis-point improvement on a straight-line basis compared to our reported Q4 2020 spreads.
We believe we will continue to see improvement longer-term as positive traffic and sales trends will support driving better rents.
However, in the near term, we anticipate that we will continue to see pressure on retenanting spreads this year as we fill recaptured space that was at rental rates above the portfolio average.
Collections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%.
Through April 30, 2021, we collected 96% of the deferred 2020 rents due to be repaid in the first quarter and had collected 83% of all deferred 2020 rents, leaving a balance of only $3.7 million.
Given this run rate, we're comfortable with our outlook for future collections.
Meaningful rebound in traffic that we discussed last quarter has been sustained.
For the first quarter, domestic traffic returned to 97% of the 2019 level even as February traffic was impacted by severe winter weather, and we were still operating at 20% fewer hours.
We believe a comparison to 2019 is more relevant as we started to feel the impacts of the pandemic during March of last year.
Our strong and sustained traffic levels clearly reflects the attraction of our open-air shopping centers, their dominant market locations, and the value proposition that we offer to both our retailer partners and shoppers.
Note that in Canada, where we have two unconsolidated JV properties, stores had been closed under government mandate through mid-February and are again closed under mandate.

...ing impact of the pandemic, recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.
First quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.40 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Core FFO for the first quarter of 2021 excludes general and administrative expense of $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share for compensation costs related to a voluntary retirement plan and other executive severance costs.
Same-center NOI for the consolidated portfolio decreased 8% for the quarter.
This reflects the rent modifications and store closings from recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings, partially offset by the reversal of approximately $1.6 million in reserves related to rents previously deferred or under negotiation.
Collections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%.
We also continue to collect rent bill for prior periods, including amounts related to 2020 that we allowed our tenants to defer to 2021.
As of March 31, 2021, remaining rental revenue reserves for 2020 rents deferred or under negotiation totaled $2.6 million.
Since implementing our ATM program, in March we opportunistically raised capital to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet.
During the first quarter, we issued 6.9 million common shares that generated $128.7 million in net proceeds at a weighted average price of $19.02 per share.
We used the proceeds to reduce $25 million of borrowings under our $350 million unsecured term loan on March 11, 2021; and, on April 30, completed the partial early redemption of $150 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% senior notes due December 2023 for $163 million in cash.
Subsequent to the redemption, $100 million remains outstanding.
We have no significant debt maturities until December 2023.
As previously disclosed, we expect to take a charge in the second quarter of 2021 currently estimated to be approximately $14.1 million, or $0.14 per share, including an approximately $13 million make-whole premium to be paid for the early redemption of the notes and $1.1 million in unamortized debt discount and loan costs.
The charge will impact our second quarter net income and FFO but will have no impact on core FFO.
We expect the 2021 net dilutive impact per share to be approximately $0.12 for net income, $0.18 for FFO, and $0.04 for core FFO.
This reduction in debt improves our leverage ratio and enhances our balance sheet flexibility.
We have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position.
We will continue our disciplined and prudent approach to capital allocation.
In addition to dividend distributions sufficient to maintain REIT status, our priority uses of capital include investing in our portfolio to grow NOI, reducing leverage to pre-COVID levels over time, and evaluating selective growth opportunities over the longer term.
Our outlook for 2021 remains unchanged.
While we are encouraged by the pace of our progress, we continue to anticipate pressure from current vacancies, additional potential store closures and rent modifications.
As mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect store closures during 2021 related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings to total approximately 200,000 square feet during 2021, including the 61,000 square feet we recaptured during the first quarter.
Most of the recapture should occur during the first half of the year.
Additionally, our guidance assumes there are no further domestic government-mandated shutdowns and assumed lease termination fees decrease by $9 million to $10 million, or $0.09 to $0.10 per share from the elevated level we recognized in 2020.
Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect core FFO per share for 2021 to be between $1.47 and $1.57.
We are maintaining this guidance despite the $0.04 dilutive impact previously discussed.
For additional details on our key assumptions, please see our release issued last night.
Operator, can we take our first question?

[/INST] # Tanger Outlets reported a Q1 core FFO per share of $0.40, as traffic to open-air centers nearly returned to 2019 levels in the quarter. Same-center NOI decreased 8% due to rent modifications and store closures resulting from bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, let me remind you that the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter and David, Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.
Operating during a pandemic has been exceptionally challenging for both of our business segments.
Fortunately, VITAS and Roto-Rooter have shown incredible speed, flexibility, and focus to remain completely open and operate safely for the benefit of our patients, customers and employees.
I believe Chemed's operational and financial performance this past year is a testament to the success of these efforts.
Our VITAS Healthcare segment continues to be directly impacted by the pandemic.
Fortunately, the federal government, specifically HHS and CMS have been very supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our entire patient census.
The most complex issue facing VITAS over the past nine months has been the disruptive impact the pandemic has had on traditional hospice referral sources, which in turn has impacted our patient census patterns.
Fortunately, the portions of the healthcare continuum have not -- certain portions have normalized and hospital referral admissions have significantly improved from low-admission rates experienced early in the pandemic.
This is reflected in our second half of 2020 admission and census activity.
Our third and fourth quarter 2020 admissions increased 4.7% and 2.8% respectively.
Normally, two sequential quarters of solid admissions growth would result in an increase in average daily census.
However, despite the admissions growth, our average daily census declined 2.8% in the fourth quarter.
This decline in census is a direct result of disruption in senior housing, which includes nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.
Senior housing is an important referral network for the hospice industry, given the fact that over 90% of all half of those patients are over the age of 65.
Senior housing has seen a severe reduction in occupancy levels and continues to struggle even as hospitals and other key hospice referral sources have significantly recovered.
Hospice referred admissions typically account for 50% of VITAS' total admissions and a significant portion of these referrals have very short length of stays.
VITAS hospital referrals are returning to pre-pandemic levels.
This is reflected in hospital generated admissions increasing 6.2% and 7.4% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.
Nursing home hospice patients represented 14.7% of our fourth quarter 2020 census, a decline of 310 basis points when compared to the prior year.
VITAS nursing home admissions decreased 22.6% in the third quarter of 2020 and declined 19.3% in the fourth quarter when compared to the equivalent prior year quarter.
Nursing home base patients are -- referred to hospice earlier into a terminal prognosis and statistically have a much greater probability of being in hospice more than 90 days.
This decline in nursing home admissions is a direct result of continued disruption in the senior housing occupancy.
According to data provided by the National Investment Center for Senior Housing & Care, COVID-19 continues to adversely affect senior housing occupancy, which reached another record low in October of 2020.
Median length of stay in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 14 days, two days less than the prior year.
This unusual decline in median length of stay is a result of a 7.4% increase in hospital referred admissions and a 19.3% decrease in nursing home admissions.
The combination of which has had a material impact on our median length of stay.
We anticipate improv...
...ecord low in October of 2020.
This reduced occupancy in senior housing has had a corresponding reduction in VITAS nursing home admissions.
Nursing home patients represented 14.7% of the VITAS fourth quarter 2020 patient census, which is our 310 basis point reduction when compared to the prior-year quarter.
VITAS anticipates continued weak occupancy and corresponding weak referrals from senior housing for the first half of 2021.
This guidance anticipates senior housing will begin to normalize to pre-pandemic occupancy starting in the second half of the calendar year 2021.
Based upon the above discussion, VITAS' 2021 revenue prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to decline approximately 4% when compared to the prior year.
VITAS' average daily census in 2021 is estimated to decline approximately 5% and full-year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 19.4%.
And we are currently estimating $10 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations in calendar year 2021.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6% and Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 is estimated to be 26%.
Based upon this discussion, the full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock option exercises, cost related to litigation and other discrete items is estimated to be in the range of $17 to $17.50.
This 2021 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate and adjusted earnings of 24.7%.
And this compares to Chemed's 2020 reported adjusted earnings per diluted shares of $18.08.
In the fourth quarter, our average daily census was 18,718 patients, a decline of 2.8% over the prior year.
As Kevin discussed earlier, this decline in average daily census is a direct result of the disruptions across the entire healthcare system that impacted traditional admission patterns in the hospice since March.
While certain healthcare sectors have shown improvement in the admission patterns, referrals from senior housing, specifically nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, continue to be negatively impacted.
It is important to note, in the fourth quarter, we saw the sequential decline of senior housing segments, specifically nursing homes and ALFs moderate to actually show a slight improvement as compared to the 2020 third quarter total admissions for the senior housing segment.
ADC growth is expected to normalize in the second half of 2021 as we return to pre-pandemic referral patterns across all sectors of the healthcare industry.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, total admissions were 17,960, this is a 2.8% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter, our home-based pre-admit admissions increased 9.2%.
Hospital-directed admissions expanded 7.4%.
Nursing home admins declined 19.3% and assisted-living facility admissions declined 14.7% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Average length of stay in the quarter was 97.2 days, this compares to 95.2 days in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 97.1 days in the third quarter of 2020.
Our median length of stay was 14 days in the quarter, which is two days less than the 16-day median in the fourth quarter of 2019 and equal to the third quarter of 2020.
Needless to say, 2020 was an unprecedented year where our organizational flexibility, leadership and commitment to our patients, their families, our referring healthcare partners, and one another was tested unlike anything we've ever experienced.
I couldn't be more proud of every VITAS team member who stepped up to these challenges to help provide access and incredible care, while producing these results for our shareholders.
Our entire team will continue to be out in the communities we serve, collaborating safely with our local healthcare partners to successfully identify and navigate patients and their families onto the hospice benefit during this unprecedented time.
I will now open this teleconference to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 After the market closed yesterday, we issued and posted several items on our websites, including our financial results, 10-K, quarterly operating supplements, and statutory financial statements for both MBIA Insurance Corporation and National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation.
We also posted updates to the listings of our insurance portfolios.
Regarding today's call, please note that anything said on the call is qualified by the information provided in the company's 10-K and other SEC filings as our company's definitive disclosures are incorporated in those documents.
We urge investors to read our 10-K as it contains our most current disclosures about the company and its financial and operating results.
The definitions and reconciliations of the non-GAAP terms included in our remarks today are also included in our 10-K as well as our financial results report and our quarterly operating supplements.
Now, I'll read our safe harbor disclosure statement.
Risk factors are detailed in our 10-K, which is available on our website at mbia.com.
For our call today, Bill Fallon and Anthony McKiernan will provide some introductory comments and then a question-and-answer session will follow.
Now, here is Bill Fallon.
Remediating our Puerto Rico credits continues to be our main priority.
During the 2019, we were able to resolve and then fully extinguish our Puerto Rico sales tax bond or COFINA exposure.
Our COFINA exposure accounted for approximately one half of our total insured Puerto Rico debt service.
As a result of the restructuring and the extinguishment of our COFINA exposure, along with claims payments that we have made on our other insured Puerto Rico exposure, our total insured debt service on Puerto Rico bonds has declined from $7.9 billion at year-end 2018 to $3.3 billion at the end of 2019.
Our remaining Puerto Rico exposure is largely comprised of three Puerto Rico credits: the Commonwealth pre-2011 General Obligation PBA bonds; the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or PREPA; and the Puerto Rico Highways & Transportation Authority or HTA.
At year-end 2019, our exposure to the General Obligation and PBA bonds was about $655 million of gross par or about $833 million of total debt service.
Our PREPA exposure was just under $1 billion of gross par or $1.3 billion of total debt service.
And our HTA exposure was about $600 million of gross par or $1 billion of total debt service.
At this time, there is a restructuring support agreement for the PREPA bonds that has been approved by the Federal Oversight Management Board in over 90% of the PREPA creditors.
The court hearing for the related 9019 motion is scheduled for June.
Governor Vazquez and the Puerto Rico Legislature have stated publicly that they do not support the agreement.
There is also a planned support agreement between the Oversight Board and a group of Commonwealth bondholders, representing approximately 54% of the par amount.
We and the other monolines do not support the proposed agreement and neither does the Commonwealth government.
As yet, there are no specific agreements related to the HTA debt.
The GO plan of adjustment does include some proposed payments to the credit, such as HTA, that have callback rights against the Commonwealth but we believe that the amount allocated for these rights understates what HTA is entitled to.
We'll pursue these rights through the court process.
The other credit in National's insurance portfolio continue to perform in line with our expectations, and the outstanding par of the insured portfolio continues to reduce each quarter.
National's insured portfolio declined to $49 billion of gross par outstanding, down $9 billion or 15% from year-end 2018.
National's leverage ratio of gross par to statutory capital declined to 21 to one, down from 23 to one at year-end 2018.
During the fourth quarter, National purchased 800,000 shares of MBIA common shares at an average price of $9.25 per share.
common stock at an average price of $9.12 ...
... of December 31, 2018, primarily due to the net loss for the year, partially offset by unrealized gains on investments and 10 million fewer net shares outstanding due to share repurchases.
I will now spend a few minutes on the corporate segment balance sheet and the insurance companies.
The corporate segment, which primarily includes the activity of the holding company, MBIA Inc., had total assets of approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Within this total are the following material items: unencumbered cash and liquid assets held by MBIA Inc. totaled $375 million as of year-end 2019 versus $457 million at December 31, 2018.
The decrease year-over-year was primarily due to the voluntary call at par in August of $150 million of MBIA Inc.'s 6.4% notes due in 2022.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, MBIA Inc. received as-of-right dividends from National totaling $134 million, with $110 million paid in October and another $24 million paid in November.
The additional $24 million resulted from excess as-of-right dividend capacity under regulatory guidelines, measuring a three-year look back of dividends paid versus investment income.
Due to the November 5th filing of our Q3 2019 financials versus the three-year look back start date of November 8, 2016, we were able to dividend an additional quarter of investment income.
We do not expect this scenario to recur for the foreseeable future and the 2020 as-of-right dividend will now be paid in November.
There were approximately $490 million of assets at market value pledged to the GICs and the interest rate swaps supporting the GIC book.
And as of December 31, 2019, there were $61 million of cumulative front contributions remaining in the tax escrow account, which represented National's 2018 and year-to-date 2019 tax payments.
In January of 2020, due to a full-year 2019 tax loss at National, MBIA Inc. returned National's 2019 tax deposits of $7 million and $26 million of National's 2018 tax year deposits.
Following the returns, $28 million remained in the tax escrow account.
The holding company is not expected to receive meaningful liquidity from any future distributions.
Turning to the insurance company's statutory results, National reported statutory net income of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to net income of $9 million for the prior year's comparable quarter.
The unfavorable result was primarily due to higher loss in LAE, somewhat offset by a tax benefit generated in December of 2019 when National elected to prepay our remaining insurance obligation with respect to our COFINA exposure in the amount of $66 million, thus reducing the trust obligations to 0.
In fiscal year 2019, in addition to the prepayment of our COFINA exposure, National paid $393 million of Puerto Rico-related insurance claims on a gross basis related to the January and July scheduled debt service payments.
In January of 2020, National paid $59 million in gross Puerto Rico-related claims, which brings inception-to-date gross claims to $1.2 billion.
As of December 31, 2019, National's total fixed income investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, had a book adjusted carrying value of $2.5 billion.
Statutory capital was $2.4 billion and claims paying resources totaled $3.5 billion.
Insured gross par outstanding reduced by $2.3 billion during the quarter, and now stands at $48.9 billion.
Turning to MBIA Insurance Corp.
, the statutory net loss was $73 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to statutory net income of $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2018.
The unfavorable result was primarily due to higher loss in LAE related to the Zohar credits in the current-year quarter.
As of December 31, 2019, the statutory capital of MBIA Insurance Corp.
was $476 million versus $555 million as of December 31, 2018.
Claims paying resources totaled $1.2 billion and cash and liquid assets totaled $124 million.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I am Patrick Suehnholz, Greenhill's Head of Investor Relations.
Joining me on the call today is Scott Bok, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
These statements are based on our current expectations regarding future events that, by their nature, are outside of the firm's control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
We reported fourth quarter revenue of $140.7 million, which was our best quarterly performance ever, an operating margin of 57% and net income of $2.71 per share.
For the year, we had revenue of $311.7 million, an operating margin of 18% and net income of $1.36 per share.
Our quarterly revenue was up 32% and earnings per share was up 158% from the same period last year.
For the full year, our revenue was up 4% and earnings per share was up 202% from the prior year.
In sum, we had a very strong finish to the year, resulting in very respectable pandemic year results on the top and bottom line, all consistent with our commentary on the past couple of quarterly investor calls.
Clearly, quarterly revenue, of the scale we achieved requires a lot of things to go right.
We generated multiple, very significant M&A completion fees, multiple very significant restructuring completion fees and a long list of smaller fees to go with them.
We also benefited more than usual from accounting rules in relation to revenue recognition that came into effect a few years ago and sometimes require revenue from completion fees to be booked before the transaction triggering that fee is fully completed.
But just to make clear that our very strong quarter was not simply a matter of transaction timing, our earnings per share for the quarter was greater than the analyst consensus forecast for the fourth quarter and the next four quarters ahead combined.
In other words, our profit in one quarter exceeded what was expected for five quarters.
Looking at our full year results.
We benefited from particularly strong results from our European M&A business and our U.S. restructuring business.
We also benefited from an expanding array of financing advisory roles that are neither traditional M&A nor traditional restructuring.
Our private capital advisory business made a meaningful contribution as well, albeit considerably less so than in the prior year.
Our revenue for the year was highly concentrated in a few busy areas, as many regions and sectors were heavily impacted by the pandemic and related constraints in economic activity and thus produced only modest revenue.
Importantly, we see nearly all of those areas has poised for significant improvement in 2021, given current market conditions and what we can see in our pipeline of assignments.
Turning to our costs.
Our compensation ratio for the year was 62%, moderately above our target level as we invested much of our non-compensation savings in rewarding our strong performers in what was the challenging year for all.
For the quarter, the compensation ratio was unusually low, as we work to achieve a reasonable full-year cost level.
We did similarly in last year's fourth quarter.
As noted in the past, we will have some quarterly volatility, but aim to manage annual compensation cost to a target level.
Our non-compensation costs were down 18% from the prior year, despite the fact that we incurred rent expense on two New York headquarters locations for much of the year as we built out new space.
Some of those cost savings flowed from reduced travel due to pandemic-related restrictions, and we believe those cost savings will continue for much of this year.
Even after that, we expect to have considerably lower travel expense than we had historically.
Separate from travel, our cost savings resulted from a...
...2021 in what feels like a favorable environment for our business.
With respect to M&A, a positive economic outlook, driven by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, combined with high stock prices, low borrowing costs, very substantial dry powder of private equity funds, a plethora of special-purpose acquisition companies looking for deals, and a variety of other factors should drive increased deal activity.
In particular, we expect increased M&A revenue in most of our international offices as well as in the certain sectors like industrials, where activity was low in 2020.
At the same time, while restructuring activity has cooled considerably from 2020's frenetic pace, more debt restructuring should be needed for the many industries and companies adversely affected by the continuing pandemic.
In addition, we are seeing significant opportunity to advise on various kinds of debt and equity financings and expect those assignments to provide a meaningful part of our near-term revenue.
In sum, we would be very disappointed if we fail to generate meaningful revenue growth in 2021.
And given our expectations of lower cost, higher revenue should result in margin expansion and increased earnings.
I will now make a few comments on our strategy.
Our overarching objective is to increase the scale, diversity and consistency of our revenue sources, while maintaining appropriate discipline on expenses.
As always, we will look to recruit M&A bankers who bring us incremental industry sector expertise or regional capabilities.
We have an active pipeline of good prospects in that regard.
With respect to restructuring advice, we see our strategic initiative of the past few years to significantly expand our team as a major success but we believe, there remains the potential to expand even further.
In particular, we want to play more advisory roles on debt and equity financing transactions.
We've had increasing success in broadening the range of transactions on which we advice and we see this as an opportunity that will continue even in periods where there's much less bankruptcy-related activity than we have seen off-late.
In our private capital advisory business, we have strong teams in Europe and Asia, and are in the process of rebuilding in the U.S., with an increased focus on higher value-added transactions.
In terms of strategic initiatives, we are aiming to enhance our focus on advising financial sponsors on a wide variety of transactions.
Historically, we focused heavily on serving public companies and we've enjoyed great success with that constituency, However, over time, we came to realize though we've had increasing interaction with financial sponsors across our M&A, restructuring and private capital advisory businesses.
We are now aiming to organize those efforts in a more systematic way designed to generate more revenue and we have already put significant resources into this initiative.
We are hopeful that it will be at least as successful as the restructuring advisory team expansion, that was our primary strategic focus over the last couple of years.
In closing, I want to mention two landmark events in the life of our firm.
First, this week, we are opening our new headquarters in the newly renovated Rockefeller Center building on Sixth Avenue, that is known to many as the old Time Life Building.
We look forward to welcoming clients there once the pandemic is subsided.
Second, a couple of weeks ago, we passed the 25-year mark in the life of our firm.
It is obviously not the time for celebrations of any kind, but it is worth noting the fact that our firm has proven resilient through numerous challenges over that quarter of a century, the dot com bubble bursting, the September 11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis of 2008 and now a major pandemic.
Our strong culture is the source of our resilience and both our global team and our brand will emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm pleased to report that Korn Ferry once again achieved all-time financial performance highs.
Revenue was up 47% and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.38 and $1.53, respectively.
And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%.
I think our performance over recent quarters has reached a new level of scale and it speaks to the resili6ency and agility of our colleagues, as well as our operational excellence, amid a time of enormous transition and secular change.
And this aligns with our businesses.
Today, wherever and whenever strategy meets talent, Korn Ferry is at that cross section, enabling agility in a world that will undoubtedly be in transition for the next several years.
Our strategy in the New Year will be to continue to innovate, replicate, and scale, allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world.
Elements of our strategy will include driving a top-down go-to-market strategy, through our Marquee and Regional Accounts, which represent about 36% of our portfolio and that not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
For example, in the quarter, about 30% of our revenue was driven by cross referrals within our firm, demonstrating the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.
Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market.
It's one of the reasons we acquired the Lucas Group during the quarter, a move that adds breadth and depth to Korn Ferry's search portfolio.
Looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we will continue to innovate, marrying Korn Ferry's capabilities with tomorrow's opportunities.
From ESG to DE&I to M&A services and we're also going to further push the monetization of our IP and move more of our digital business to a subscription offering.
We're going to also scale our learning development outsourcing or LDO capabilities, leveraging our Korn Ferry Advance platform, in which we now have completed 50,000 development and coaching sessions.
And lastly, we're going to deploy a balanced capital allocation strategy, including a disciplined approach to M&A.
Looking ahead, I truly feel we have the strategy, the people, the diversity of solutions and expertise to help our clients drive performance in this new world and our results clearly reflect this reality.
We look forward to keeping up the momentum in the New Year ahead.
And with that, I am joined by Bob Rozek and Gregg Kvochak.
Let me start with a few comments before I jump into the second quarter results.
So, I've always felt that the best way to measure success is through performance and if you look at our performance coming out of the COVID recession, it's really been and continued to be exceptional and that's reflected in our Q2 results.
There's no doubt that the world we live in has changed for good.
Today, more than ever, our clients are facing unprecedented organizational and human capital challenges as workforces are transformed and digitized, as corporations are called upon to have greater environmental, social and governance responsibilities, as organization strive to have work environments that are inclusive and free from bias, so even as companies are challenged to grow in a post-COVID environment.
These are real secular changes, creating real and challenging business issues for companies across the globe and it's a fact that no business issue has ever been solved without the involvement of people and that's really where Korn Ferry comes in.
I mean that's our sweet spot, right.
Our core and integrated solutions line up perfectly with the secular changes that companies across the globe are wrestling with today, whether it's finding the right talent in a dislocated labor market to accelerating the top line growth or to even ...
... all-time highs.
Professional Search new business was up 13% sequentially and RPO was awarded a record $136 million of new contracts, consisting of $28 million of renewals and extensions and $108 million of new logo work.
Adjusted EBITDA for RPO and Professional Search continued to scale with revenue improving to $36.3 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%.
Finally, in the second quarter, global fee revenue for Executive Search reached another new all-time high of $235 million, which was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially.
Growth was also broad-based and led by North America, which grew 74% year-over-year and over 14% sequentially.
Fee revenue in our international regions remained steady in the second quarter.
EMEA and APAC were up approximately 34% and 36%, respectively, measured year-over-year, and essentially flat sequentially.
We continue to invest in expanding our team of consultants in the second quarter.
The total number of dedicated Executive Search consultants worldwide at the end of the second quarter was 570, up 58% year-over-year and up 5%, sequentially.
Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the second quarter improved to a record $1.66 million and the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the second quarter was up 37% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to a new all-time high of 1,830.
In the second quarter, global Executive Search adjusted EBITDA grew to approximately $66 million, which was up $38 million year-over-year and up $4.5 million or 7% sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 28.1%.
As I mentioned earlier, new business in the second quarter grew to a new all-time high and it actually accelerated each consecutive month in the quarter and that positions us with a very strong backlog entering our third fiscal quarter.
In fact, as we ended the quarter, October and September were our first and second highest new business months ever.
While our third quarter is usually our most seasonal quarter as both our clients and colleagues take time off during the year and holiday seasons.
However, November was also an excellent month for new business, actually eclipsing September as the second highest month ever, and that was up 37% year-over-year.
Now if monthly trends in each of our lines of business are consistent with our historical patterns and the market conditions remain strong, we would expect December to be seasonally slower than November with demand accelerating and peaking at a quarter high in January.
Additionally, we will continue to make investments in consultants and execution staff to fuel future growth, and we expect employee productivity to remain strong and G&A spend to remain at current levels in the third quarter, keeping both earnings and profitability strong.
Now assuming no new major pandemic-related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets, and foreign exchange rates, and including fee from the Lucas Group, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to range from $640 million to $660 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from $1.42 to $1.58 while our GAAP diluted earnings per share should range from $1.38 to $1.56.
As we look ahead to the New Year, we see a great opportunity to continue to build on our strong financial performance.
Based on the strength or I should say the continuing strength of our new business trends, it is evident to us that our portfolio of solutions will have a continuing relevance as companies address the secular changes I previously discussed.
We will continue to execute at a high level and there is little doubt that we are well positioned to take more than our fair share of the growing market.
Korn Ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies; colleagues, clients, candidates and shareholders for years to come.
With that, we would be glad to answer any questions you may have.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On Slide 2 is our safe harbor statement.
These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts.
During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS.
The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19.
This pandemic has made clear the importance of global healthcare and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times.
Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today.
We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines.
Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders.
West has two priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic.
First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe.
Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset, implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams.
It seems nearly every day, I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients while looking out for the safety of one another.
These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team, and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission.
In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, unique skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts.
Turning to Slide 4.
Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers.
The strong tenets of our market-led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West's business in today's climate.
I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout 2019 have continued in the first quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive.
Despite the current challenges, so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity.
For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand.
Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analyses daily and make adjustments as they are required.
These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network.
Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain, including our close partner, Daikyo, and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers.
As the pandemic has intensified, as expected, we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks.
We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products.
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first-quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well-positioned.
We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales.
This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter.
As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers, as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions.
Each day seems to bring new challe...
...ss profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019.
The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products.
Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, contract manufacturing's first-quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180-basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business.
On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase.
Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents.
Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program.
Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong.
Slide 11 provides a high-level summary.
Full-year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion.
This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%.
We expect our full-year 2020 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62, compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55.
Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance.
Estimated FX headwind on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to prior guidance of $0.04.
The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 earnings per share impact from our first-quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
Our company is financially strong.
Today, more than ever, the pursuit of our mission is priority and not taken for granted.
West products are needed by patients across the globe and in many cases, for the administration of life-saving medicines.
As the market leader, we are committed to ensure continuity of supply to our customers around the globe.
In addition, we are supporting our many customers that are developing potential solutions to address COVID-19 with components for diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.
We are confident in our long-term growth strategy.
Although these are trying times, we are optimistic and dedicated to doing what is necessary supporting the healthcare industry as it works to resolve this global pandemic.
We will emerge from this experience collectively stronger.
And on behalf of all of the team members at West, it is our wish that you stay healthy and safe in the days ahead.
Andrew, we're ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We ended the year with a record of more than $1.5 billion of premium now in force.
Unfortunately, the industry, markets we served had a record-setting frequency of weather events during the 2020 winter season which impacted our 4th quarter and full year results.
We were impacted by Hurricane Sally, PCS, Zeta and Eta in 2020 and to a much lesser extent Hurricane delta.
In addition, we had exposure to a series of other 2020 PCS weather events and minimal exposure to the Midwest Derecho.
All told, we had a bit over 10,000 claims in the fourth quarter from named 2020 storms and other PCS events.
We did not have any exposure to hurricane Laura or any other weather in Texas or Louisiana including the recent winter storms.
We also had no exposure to the West Coast wildfires as we do not write business in those markets.
Despite the weather in 2020, we continued our focus on underwriting increasing our primary rates in Florida, close to 20% for the full year, including 7% in the 4th quarter for 2020 reinsurance costs as well as increases in some of our other states.
We continue to implement new binding guidelines to address emerging loss trends.
We have continued to maintain a resilient balance sheet that has self funded our risk bearing entities capital requirements in addition to enhancing our reserves.
We continue to be backed by our great reinsurance program and partners with close to 75% of our first event reinsurance capacity for June 1, 2021 secured already.
We continued our geographic expansion efforts in 2020 and implemented our catastrophe rapid response teams during the COVID-19 pandemic which accelerated our use of digital technology for adjusting claims.
We also continue to develop adaptive adjusting approaches to address claims loss cost trends.
We look forward to 2021 as we continue to focus on resiliency and taking the necessary steps to provide reliability to consumers and reduce uncertainty for shareholders.
As a reminder, discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments, an extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
Adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense.
We ended 2020 with total revenue up 14.2% to $1.1 billion, driven primarily by growth in net premiums earned, realized gains on investments and increases in service revenue, partially offset by decreases in net investment income and increased reinsurance costs.
EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.57 on a GAAP basis and a loss of $0.84 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
For the year, we generated earnings per share of $0.60 on a GAAP basis and a loss of $0.90 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
These results were impacted predominantly by weather events in 2020 and related social dynamics and increased reinsurance costs.
Our direct premiums written grew by 21.9% in Q4 compared to the prior year's quarter led by the impact of rate increases in Florida and other states taking effect as well as strong direct premium growth in Q4 of 18.9% in states outside of Florida.
For the full year, direct premiums written were up 7% led by rate increases and increased volume as well as strong direct premium written growth of 17.7% in other states and slightly improve policy retention.
On the expense side, the combined ratio decreased 18.9 points for the quarter to 124% but increased 9.7 points for the full year to 113.6%.
The full year increases were driven primarily by an increase of 13 points for increased weather in 2020.
In addition, increases were also attributable to an increase in our core loss pick when compared to the full prior year and the effect on the ratio from increased reinsurance costs.
The increases were partially offset by a lower level of prior years reserve development on prior year's losses in LAE reserves, which accounted for 4.1 loss ratio points.
A benefit from our claims adjusting business and a 90 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, net investment income decreased 62.7% for the quarter and 33.7% for the full year primarily due to lower yields on cash and fixed income investments during 2020 when compared to 2019.
Realized gains for the quarter and for the full year resulted primarily from taking advantage of increased market prices on our available for sale debt investment for portfolio and to a lesser extent aided by the sale of equity securities.
Unrealized gains were driven by market fluctuations in equity securities resulting in a favorable outcome for the quarter and the full year.
In regards to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 193,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $2.4 million, for the full year, the company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of 28.9 million.
For 2021 guidance, we expect a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share range of between $2.75 and $3 assuming no extraordinary weather events in 2021 and a return on average equity of between 17% to 19%.
The guidance assumes no extraordinary weather events in 2021.
It also assumes a flat equity market for GAAP earnings per share if weather events exceed plan, we expect to see both a benefit from our claims adjusting business and increased loss cost.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Given our strong start to the year, we're pleased to announce an increase in our guidance for 2021 core FFO by approximately 6% from a range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
Kevin will have more details on this increase in his remarks.
Turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial results.
Our portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform exceedingly well.
Occupancy was 98.3% at the end of the quarter, which remains above our long-term average of 98% and while our occupancy rate ticked down 20 basis points from December 31, we're seeing impressive activity in our leasing department including interest by a number of strong national tenants in some of our vacancies.
We also announced collection of 97% of rents due for the first quarter as well as collection of 98% of rents due for the month of April.
Our impressive collection results continue to compare very favorably to other retail real estate companies, including those with a significantly higher percentage of investment-grade tenants.
The majority of the remaining uncollected rent in the first quarter was simply deferred rent that we expect to collect when the tenant's repayment obligation kicks in later this year.
Notably, we only forgave 0.1% of our first quarter rents.
Recently, our two largest bankruptcies were resolved in favorable fashion.
Chuck E. Cheese's affirmed all 53 of our leases, in exchange for a 25% temporary base rent reduction that will expire at the end of this year and Ruby Tuesday's affirmed 26 of our 34 leases, accounting for over 80% of our annual rent from Ruby Tuesday, again in exchange for a comparable temporary base rent reduction.
These impressive post-pandemic occupancy, leasing and rent collection outcomes have once again validated our consistent long-term strategy of acquiring well-located parcels, lease to strong regional and national operators at reasonable rents, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet.
Although we continue to be prudent in our underwriting, we acquired 29 new properties in the quarter for just under $106 million, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with an average lease duration of 17.5 years.
Almost all of our acquisitions were from relationship tenants with which we do repeat programmatic business.
In an unsettled post-pandemic environment, where cap rates remain at all-time lows, we will continue to be very thoughtful in our underwriting and primarily pursue sale-leaseback transactions with our relationship tenants.
We also reported that during the first quarter, we sold 11 properties, raising $17.6 million of proceeds to be reinvested into new acquisitions and our balance sheet remains rock solid.
During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured 30-year interest-only bonds at a rate of 3.5%.
Kudos to Kevin and his team for once again raising well-priced capital when it's available.
A portion of those bond proceeds were used to redeem our 2023 debt maturities.
So we ended the first quarter with $311 million of cash in the bank, a 0 balance on our $900 million line of credit, no material debt maturities until 2024 and an average debt duration of over 13 years.
Thus, we're well-positioned to fund all of our 2021 acquisition guidance with the available capital on hand.
That's up $0.06 from the preceding fourth quarter $0.63 and down $0.01 from the prior year's $0.70 per share.
Results for the first quarter included two nonrecurring type items totaling $5 million.
First, we collected $2.2 million of receivables from cash basis tenants that relate to prior quarters.
And second, we received $2.8 million of lease termination fee income, which is more than typical.
For context, full year 2020 was $2 million of lease termination fee income.
So these two items, totaling approximately $5 million, added just under $0.03 per share to our results.
Today, we also reported that AFFO per share was $0.76 per share for the first quarter, which is $0.07 per share higher than the preceding fourth quarter $0.69.
We did footnote this amount included $9.4 million of deferred rent repayment and our accrued rental income adjustment in the first quarter AFFO number.
Rent collections continue to drift higher.
As Jay mentioned, we reported today rent collections of approximately 97% for the first quarter, 98% for April rent collection.
Most notable collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent approximately $50 million or 7% of our annual base rent, improved to approximately 80% for the first quarter.
Previously, we projected these cash basis tenants would pay at their historical payment rate of about 50% of rent.
So improving to 80% added about $4 million of revenues in the first quarter versus our prior guidance.
As Jay mentioned today, we increased our 2021 core FFO per share guidance from the range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
This incorporates the better-than-expected rent collections and the results from Q1.
The driver for the increase in full year guidance is the $5 million of first quarter nonrecurring items I previously mentioned and the assumed higher rent collection rates more in line with current collection rates.
So while we previously assumed 50% rent collections from the $50 million of cash basis tenant annual base rent, we are now assuming 80% rent collection.
So that incremental 30% amounts to $15 million for the full year and for the remainder of our tenants, we previously assumed 2% potential rent loss, and we now assume 1% rent of potential rent loss, which equates to approximately $6 million of improvement for the year.
So compared to prior guidance, current guidance incorporates approximately a total of $21 million in improved rent collection, plus $5 million of onetime items in Q1 or a total of $26 million, and that all equates to about $0.15 per share.
As Jay noted, we ended the fourth quarter with $311 million of cash on hand.
Nothing outstanding on our $900 million bank line.
We did execute a $450 million 30-year debt offering, with a 3.5% coupon on March 1, and used a large portion of those proceeds to pay off our $350 million of 3.3% notes due in 2023.
While time will tell, given where we are in the 40-year declining interest rate cycle, it felt like it was a good time to continue to push out debt maturities at these rates.
Our weighted average debt maturity is now 13.3 years, with a 3.7% weighted average fixed income interest rate.
Our next debt maturity is $350 million, with a 3.9% coupon in mid-2024.
So on very good liquidity and leverage position, I have no need to raise any additional capital to meet our 2021 acquisition guidance.
Net debt to gross book assets was 34.7% at quarter end.
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.0 times at March 31.
Interest coverage was 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage 4.1 times for the first quarter of 2021.
Only five of our 3,161 properties are encumbered by mortgages totaling about $11 million.
So 2021 is off to a good start as the economy and retailers seem to be catching wind in their sales from the several trillion-dollar stimulus injected by the government, which feels like it will continue into 2022.
Our focus remains on the long term as we continue to endeavor to give NNN the best opportunity to succeed in the coming years.
And Melinda, with that, we will open it up to any questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, let me remind you that the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
Kevin McNamara, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed Corporation; Dave Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chemed; and Nick Westfall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed's VITAS Healthcare Corporation subsidiary.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter, and Dave and Nick will follow-up with additional operating detail.
When we reported our second quarter 2020 operating results, I noted that the pandemic and related economic lockdown severely impacted our April 2020 operating results.
Since April, both VITAS and Roto-Rooter have reengineered their operating procedures to safely care for our patients and customers during the pandemic.
These operational changes have allowed Chemed to generate sequential operational improvement starting in May 2020, and this improvement has continued and has, in fact, accelerated throughout the third quarter and continued into October.
David will provide updated earning guidance later in the call.
Our hospice segment operations continued to be impacted by the pandemic.
Fortunately, the federal government, specifically HHS and CMS have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 patient census.
The severe initial disruption within our patient referral and admission patterns we noted in the second quarter has noticeably dissipated throughout the third quarter.
This improvement is reflected in our third quarter admissions.
Our July 2020 admissions increased 4.3%, August increased 5.9% and September admissions expanded 4%.
Overall, our third quarter 2020 admissions increased 4.7%.
Our average daily census did decline two-tenths of 1 percentage point in the quarter.
The slight decline in census is a result of soft admissions from the second quarter as well as supressed referrals from nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.
We anticipate admissions to normalize when these types of facilities return to their pre-COVID occupancy levels.
As I discussed last quarter, we made the strategic decision for Roto-Rooter to maintain full staffing and operating capacity early in the pandemic.
This strategic decision to maintain full capacity was designed to capitalize on any snapback in commercial and residential demand, both to protect existing market share as well as to maximize on opportunities to grow market share.
I believe this has proven to be the correct strategic course.
Roto-Rooter services demand began to show weekly improvement beginning in the later part of April and has strengthened unabated throughout the second and third quarters of 2020.
This is reflected in our monthly performance.
Roto-Rooter unit-for-unit commercial revenue declining 38.6% in April, improving to a 31.8% decline in May and a decline of 19.7% in June.
Third quarter 2020 unit-for-unit commercial demand did decline 11.6% when compared to the prior year quarter.
This third quarter commercial demand is a significant improvement when compared to the 29.1% decline in the second quarter 2020 commercial revenue.
On a sequential basis, third quarter 2020 unit-for-unit commercial revenue totaled $39.5 million, an increase of 26.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Our residential services have proven to be exceptionally resilient with our unit-for-unit residential revenue declining a modest 1.6% in April, increasing 11.7% in May and 18.7% in June.
The third quarter residential demand set all-time records with July 2020 unit-for-unit residential revenue expanding 22.8%, August revenue incr...
...and general economy to such an extent that future rules, regulations and government mandates could have an immediate and material impact upon our ability to achieve this guidance.
Within this context, revenue growth for VITAS in 2020 prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 4%.
Our average daily census in 2020 is estimated to expand approximately 1.3%.
And VITAS' full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 21%.
We are currently estimating $8.6 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations for calendar year 2020.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve full year 2020 revenue growth of 12.5% to 13%.
This full year revenue growth assumes 2.7% of seasonal sequential revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Over the past 5 years, excluding water restoration and the impact from acquisitions, this Q3 to Q4 seasonal sequential revenue growth has averaged between 4% to 11%.
Based upon the above, Chemed's full year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits for stock options, costs related to litigation and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of $18 to $18.15.
This compares to our previous guidance of $16.20 to $16.40.
This 2020 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate of 25.8%.
And for comparison purposes, Chemed's 2019 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share was $13.95.
In the third quarter, our average daily census was 19,045 patients, a slight decline of 0.2% over the prior year.
This decline in average daily census is a direct result of the disruptions across the entire healthcare system, which started in March that impacted traditional admission patterns into hospice.
While certain healthcare sectors have shown improvement in admission patterns in the third quarter, the long-term care market, specifically nursing homes and assisted-living facilities continue to be impacted as they work to safely navigate serving their residents during the pandemic.
ADC growth is expected to normalize over the coming quarters as we return to pre-pandemic referral patterns across all sectors of the healthcare industry.
In the third quarter of 2020, total admissions were 17,943.
This is a 4.7% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2019.
In the third quarter, our admissions increased 18.3% for our home-based pre-admit patients.
Hospital directed admissions expanded a positive 6.2%, nursing home admits declined 22.6% and assisted-living facility admissions declined 13.5% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Our average length of stay in the quarter was 97.1 days.
This compares to 92.6 days in the third quarter of 2019 and 90.9 days in the second quarter of 2020.
Our median length of stay was 14 days in the quarter, which is 3 days less than the 17 day median in the third quarter of 2019 and equal to the second quarter of 2020.
Median length of stay continues to be a key indicator of our penetration into the high acuity sector of the market.
As we sit here today, we're confident in our ability to support all of our team members and their ability to deliver care by prioritizing their safety with sufficient PPE inventory, education and clinical protocols.
Additionally, we'll continue to utilize the resources and testing supplies we've acquired to comply with federal, state and local requirements to safely access the health facilities in our markets.
Lastly, our entire team will continue to be out in the communities we serve, collaborating safely with our local healthcare partners to successfully identify and navigate patients and their families onto the hospice benefit during this unprecedented time.
As we've internally discussed throughout the pandemic, we'll get through this by continuing to support one another and the patients and families we serve, all while focused on continuing to deliver the results we have thus far throughout the pandemic.
I will now open this teleconference to questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 This is Matt Eichmann.
I'm joined by Pete Watson, Greif's president and chief executive officer, Larry Hilsheimer, Greif's chief financial officer, and Ole Rosgaard, Greif's chief operating officer.
We will take questions at the end of today's call.
In accordance with regulation fair disclosure, please ask questions regarding issues you consider important because we're prohibited from discussing material, non-public information with you on an individual basis.
Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up before returning to the queue.
Actual results could differ materially from those discussed.
We appreciate your interest in Greif, and hope that you and your families are staying both safe and healthy during the pandemic.
Greif delivered robust third-quarter results.
We executed with discipline to deliver record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93, fueled by strong volumes and ongoing strategic pricing actions as we continue to experience strong demand across our global portfolio.
Our leverage ratio fell at 2.8 times, and our board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to our class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively, payable on October 1.
We're also increasing our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance, reflecting our strong year-to-date results and positive outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Finally, in late June, we announced a planned executive leadership transition that will occur next year.
Upon my retirement on February 1, 2022, Ole Rosgaard will assume responsibility for Greif's next chief executive officer.
Until that time, Ole will serve as chief operating officer and work closely with me and our executive leadership team on his transition.
Ole is a servant leader and a proven team builder with demonstrated commitment to customer service excellence and disciplined operational execution.
Those attributes, along with his extensive manufacturing and industrial packaging experience, makes him the ideal leader to take Greif forward.
Ole, I'd like to ask you to say a few words.
It's great to be with you.
As Pete mentioned, my name is Ole Rosgaard, and I'm excited and humbled to be named as Greif's next CEO.
I look forward to joining these calls in the quarters ahead and to working more closely with all of you in the future.
As head of global industrial packaging, my focus was on driving and delivering the operating and business results that our customers and shareholders expect.
As COO, that focus continues across the wider Greif portfolio.
And as Pete said, I'm working closely with the executive leadership team on our fiscal 2022 business plan and will share more about my priorities for the future after I assume my new role.
On slide four, global industrial packaging business delivered outstanding third-quarter results.
Our global steel drum volume increased by 8% per day.
Our global rigid IBCs and large plastic drum volumes both rose by more than 25% per day.
We also saw mid-teens improvement in our filling volumes versus the prior-year quarter, with demand accelerating specifically in APAC.
Third-quarter average selling prices were up across all key global substrates year over year due to raw material pass-through arrangements and strategic pricing actions.
In Latin America, steel drum volumes rose by 15% on a per day basis versus the prior year and benefited from improved industrial trends and a strong agricultural and citrus season.
In EMEA, third-quarter steel drum and rigid IBC volumes increased by roughly 5% and 28% per day, respectively, with strong improvement across most key end markets.
And finally, in APAC, steel drum volumes rose by 7% per day versus the prior year.
Demand was solid in China, but a little softer in Southeast Asia due to COVID-19-related lockdowns that we continue to monitor across parts of that region.
Across GIP, we see little indication of customers rebuilding inventory.
Supply c...
...impact to our paper packaging results in Q4.
Big picture, it was an outstanding quarter.
Third-quarter net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 34% versus the prior-year quarter due to stronger volumes and higher selling prices and were a record.
Adjusted EBITDA rose by $78 million and was also a record.
As Pete mentioned, EBITDA results include a $9 million Brazilian tax refund from overpayment of revenue-based taxes to the government that occurred in prior periods and were wrongly levied.
That refund reduced SG&A.
Keep in mind, our adjusted EBITDA result overcame more than $50 million of combined OCC and incentive headwinds versus the prior year, making our performance that much more impressive.
Interest expense fell by roughly $6 million versus the prior-year quarter due to lower debt balances, lower interest rates and a lower interest rate tier on our credit facility as a result of our substantial debt repayment.
Our third-quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate were both 22% and were flat to prior year.
Third-quarter adjusted class A earnings per share more than doubled to $1.93 per share.
Finally, third-quarter adjusted cash flow fell by roughly $43 million versus the prior year.
While profitability improved significantly, working capital was a substantial cash use compared to a source in the prior year due to the run-up in raw material prices and corresponding cost increases.
That said, our team is executing with discipline and controlling what it can with superb results as trailing fourth-quarter working capital as a percentage of sales improved by 190 basis points year over year to 10.7%.
As Pete mentioned, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date results and positive trajectory for the remainder of fiscal '21.
At the midpoint, we anticipate generating Class A earnings per share of $5.20, which is $0.50 per share more than our guide at Q2.
This improvement is largely due to stronger volumes and favorable pricing more than offsetting the additional OCC headwinds we expect to incur for the remainder of fiscal '21.
With our anticipated fiscal '21 result, we will more -- have more than doubled earnings per share since 2015 despite COVID-19's negative impact, the closure and/or divestiture of nearly 90 non-core or suboptimal plants and without any share repurchase benefit.
Also keep in mind that we currently have 600,000 more shares outstanding now versus the end of 2015.
We now anticipate generating between $335 million and $365 million in adjusted free cash flow, with a bias to the upside of that range.
At the midpoint, adjusted free cash flow has improved by $45 million relative to our Q2 guide due to improved earnings, slightly lower capital expenditures and cash tax savings, partially offset by higher working capital usage commensurate with our announced price increases to offset cost inflation.
To employ a consistent, three-pronged capital deployment strategy focused on business reinvestment, debt reduction and capital returns.
We have executed on an aggressive deleveraging plan and repaid $370 million in total debt since Q3 2020.
Our compliance leverage ratio improved by nearly a full turn over that time period, and we now anticipate reaching the high end of our targeted leverage ratio range by the fiscal year-end.
Given the dramatic improvement in our leverage profile and confidence in strong future cash generation, the Board approved a 4.5% increase to our quarterly dividend effective this year.
This is a first step toward a practice of steadily increasing our dividend as we discussed in prior earnings calls.
Looking ahead, we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends in our key end markets.
Our extensive global portfolio, differentiated service capability and sharp focus on operational execution enable us to best serve our customer needs while generating significant shareholder value.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Both of these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at applied.com.
A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks.
These are available at the Investor Relations section of applied.com.
We appreciate you joining us.
I'll begin with some brief thoughts, and then Dave will follow to review our financial results in more detail.
Our second quarter was characterized by cost discipline, margin control and solid cash generation within a persistent soft end market backdrop.
Execution in these areas is providing a path to deliver our earnings and cash commitments for the year and should support accretive growth once demand rebounds as well as capital deployment opportunities going forward.
We also remain highly focused on accelerating our company-specific out growth potential regardless of the industrial cycle.
As highlighted in recent quarters, our leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control and now automation puts us in a unique position to capture greater share organically as our customers outsource their technical MRO and production infrastructure needs.
As well as through M&A, a smaller players look to partner with a leading technical platform, given increasing service, operational and capital requirements.
This trend should supplement a strong cross-selling opportunity here at Applied that remains in the early innings, and is focused on expanding the reach of our fluid power, flow control, consumables and automation solutions across our embedded service center network customer base.
We also entered our second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post our acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to our stated target of 2.5 times.
Combined with our cash generation trajectory, we have notable flexibility for additional deleveraging, acquisitions and pursuing other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns in the back half of our fiscal year.
As it relates to the broader end market backdrop, as discussed in recent quarters and consistent with macroeconomic industrial reports, demand remains weak across our top industry verticals.
After seeing some stabilization during October and November, customer activity was unusually weak during December and remained subdued with organic sales trending down in the mid-single digits year-over-year, so far in January.
While softness remains broad-based declines were most notable within metals, mining, oil and gas, machinery and process-related industries.
We also saw greater weakness across our international operations during the quarter within Canada and Mexico.
Some of the recent softness likely reflects demand abnormalities that occurred this time a year, given seasonality, plant shutdowns and customer budget resets, in turn making it difficult to fully gauge the underlying direction of current demand.
We are also cognizant of potential positive momentum that could arise if a trade resolution can stay on track, which has the potential to positively influence trends for the balance of our fiscal 2020 and into fiscal 2021.
That said, uncertainty remains, and we believe that sensible approach to our outlook remains prudent at this time.
Regardless of the direction of the cycle near term, we know how to operate to it, as our industry and recent results highlight.
At the same time, there is a great understanding and commitment on the opportunity Applied has long-term as the leading technical MRO distribution and solutions provider.
Our strategy is deeply focused on this opportunity and moving the company toward its long-term financial goals, providing the framework for significant earnings growth and value creation in the coming years.
Before I begin, another reminder that a supplemental investor deck recapping key financial and performance talking points is available on our investors site.
To summarize, we...
...cused on managing costs in the second half of our fiscal 2020 given the current environment.
As a reminder, our SD&A expense will increase on an absolute basis sequentially into our third quarter, reflecting seasonality as well as the impact of annual merit increases and two extra selling days versus the second quarter.
That said, we still expect SD&A to decline as a percent of sales into our second half relative to first half levels.
EBITDA in the quarter was $74.5 million compared to $76 million in the prior year quarter, while EBITDA margin was 8.9% or 9.2% excluding non-cash LIFO expense in the quarter.
Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.97 per share compared to $0.99 per share in the prior year.
Cash generated from operating activities was $34.9 million, while free cash flow was $47.9 million or approximately 126% of net income.
Year-to-date free cash flow of $93 million represents 119% of adjusted net income and is up nearly 60% from the prior year.
We are continuing to make good progress on our working capital initiatives in a slower demand environment.
This includes ongoing traction from our shared services and other collection initiatives.
We expect additional tailwinds into the second half of fiscal 2020, as inventory levels declined from the second quarter ending position.
We remain confident in our free cash flow potential for the full year, which will support our capital allocation strategy, focused on reducing outstanding debt, funding M&A opportunities, and opportunistically buying back shares.
We paid down $5 million of outstanding debt during the quarter.
Our debt is down nearly $115 million since financing the acquisition of FCX with net leverage at 2.5 times EBITDA at quarter end below the prior year period of 2.8 times.
This represents the 11th dividend increase since 2010 and underscores our strong cash generation and commitment to delivering shareholder value.
Transitioning now to our outlook.
We are narrowing our previous guidance ranges and now expect sales of down 2% to flat year-over-year or down 5% to down 3% on an organic day per day basis as well as earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share.
Previously, our guidance assumes sales down 5% to down 1% organically and earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.50 per share.
Our updated guidance assumes end market weakness seen during December and January continues in coming months with seasonal Q3 sales step up at the lower end of historical trends.
At the midpoint, this implies mid-single digit organic sales declines will persist in the third quarter, with the declines easing to the low-single digits in the fourth quarter on easier comparisons.
By segment, our guidance assumes mid-to low-single digit organic declines year-over-year in our service center segment during the second half and low-single digit organic declines in our Fluid Power and Flow Control segment.
Our guidance also assumes gross margins are flat to up 10 basis points for the full year, slightly below our prior guidance of up 10 basis points to 20 basis points.
We continue to view 10 basis points to 20 basis points of gross margin expansion as the appropriate annual target over time, given our internal initiatives.
Lastly, we reaffirm our free cash flow outlook of $200 million to $220 million, which represents a 30% increase of our fiscal 2019 at the midpoint.
Overall, while we are executing largely to plan year-to-date, we remain prudent with our outlook, given the backdrop of uncertainty in near term industrial demand.
We remained highly focused on our internal growth and margin initiatives, which in addition to potential benefits from trade resolution and ongoing cost opportunities, we see several levers that should support our earnings momentum in coming quarters if the current environment does not weaken further.
Combined with our cash generation potential, we believe our position is strong and we are eagerly moving forward to realize our full potential.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.
Revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion in last year's first quarter.
During this year's first quarter, we reported net income of $0.75 per share.
Adjusted net income on a non-GAAP measure was $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Adjusted net income for 2021 excludes $6 million of pre-tax special charges, $0.02 per share after tax related to the 2020 restructuring plan, and $15 million of pre-tax gain on the sale of TRU Canada, $0.07 per share after tax.
Segment profit in the quarter was $256 million, up from $156 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $71 million, up $501 million from last year's first quarter.
Overall, the first quarter was a strong quarter for Textron.
Segment margins were up 330 basis points in the quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our segments.
At Bell, revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues.
On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 17 helicopters up from 15 in the last year's first quarter.
We saw solid order activity in the quarter across our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility, and emergency medical services.
On future vertical lift, that was awarded a contract modification of $293 million for the second phase of the competitive demonstration and reduction program for FLRAA.
As we conclude final flight activity on the V-280, I think it's important to highlight the impressive performance milestones that the aircraft has demonstrated in over 215 flight hours over the past three-plus years.
This included 305 knots of demonstrated true airspeed, level 1 handling qualities, and autonomous flight.
On FLRAA, Bell is continuing with its build of the Invictus 360 prototype, where we are about a third of the way through the manufacturing process in anticipation of first flight in Q4 of next year.
Moving to Textron Systems.
Revenues were flat in the quarter while the business continued to execute well with improved operating margins.
In the quarter, Systems was awarded a contract to up to $607 million from the U.S. Army for the sustainment and modernization of existing shadow systems to the upgraded Block III configuration.
Also in the quarter, Systems successfully participated in the U.S. Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems rodeo at Fort Benning and completed direct soldier flight demonstrations of our platform, the Aerosonde HQ.
Systems is currently responding to the FTUAS RFI, which will help inform the next phase of that program.
Systems also delivered the first RCV medium prototype to the Army customer as they look to test these vehicles and define requirements for the future of robotic combat vehicle programs.
At ATAC, we are continuing to ramp F1 flight hours at the operating sites related to the three awards of the U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program.
At the end of the quarter, we had 16 F1 aircraft certified for operation and deployed across our customer sites.
In Aviation, revenues were up -- I'm sorry, revenues were eventually flat in the quarter with slightly lower volume, reflecting lower aftermarket revenues, partially offset by higher pricing.
We delivered 28 jets, up from 23 last year and 14 commercial turboprops, down from 16 in last year's first quarter.
Order activity was strong in the quarter, resulting in backlog growth of $450 million to $2.1 billion at quarter-end.
In the quarter, we delivered our 1,560 XL-based Citation jet.
This milestone delivery is a testament to the value and performance of this platform, as well as Textron Aviation's commitment to the ongoing support of the fleet.
We also announced the new CJ4 Gen2 and delivered five aircraft in the quarter.
This model upgrade is another example of our continued investment in our existing portfolio of aircraft.
On the new product front, the Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program continues to progress well as we work toward entering to service targeted toward the second half of this year.
Revenues were up from last year's first quarter, primarily driven by higher volume and price in our specialized vehicle product line.
At specialized vehicles, we continue to see strong retail demand across our customer end markets.
At Kautex, we saw our volume of fuel systems for hybrid electric vehicles more than double to about 9% of our total production volume in the quarter, the start-up of four new models.
While the retail demand in industrial-owned markets has been improving, channel inventory remains below targeted levels as we work through supply shortages and disruptions, which we expect will improve throughout the course of the year.
In summary, it was a great start to the year.
We've seen improving customer demand in our end markets, increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, and continued solid execution in our military businesses with strong cash generation in the quarter.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues at Textron Aviation of $865 million were down $7 million from a year ago largely due to lower aftermarket volume, partially offset by higher pricing.
Segment profit was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $3 million of profit last year primarily due to a favorable impact from performance and the mix of products sold.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion.
Revenues were $846 million, up $23 million from last year on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues.
Segment profit of $105 million was down $10 million primarily due to higher research and development in the quarter, largely related to future vertical lift programs.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $328 million, flat with a year ago.
Segment profit of $51 million was up $25 million due to a $27 million favorable impact from performance and other.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 As always, we will also post a replay of this conference call on the website.
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Stephan.
I hope that you are doing well.
Starting on slide three, you will find a few highlights from the quarter.
We serve patients and consumers across a variety of end market.
And this makes after a resilient business through economic cycles.
In the most recent period is no exception.
We have the industry's widest range of dispensing systems, active material science solutions and drug delivery technologies and services that we leverage across our reporting segments.
Our customers benefit from our commitment to research and development, and the new innovations that allow us to help them grow their own businesses.
It has also maintained our strong focus on sustainability, and Aptar was recently named among the Top 10 companies for reducing environmental impact by JUST capital, alongside Dell, IBM, Microsoft, MasterCard, and several other large companies.
This is of course, compared to the first quarter of 2020 and COVID-19 was not yet the major factor in our quarterly results.
We also achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin comparable to the prior year, while absorbing the mix shift within our pharma segment and the relative mix across our three segments.
Our food and beverage segment deliver a stellar performance this quarter as consumers continue to cook at home during the pandemic, driving strong demand for our innovative food dispensing closures.
Price increases also contributed to our top line growth that we are passing on increased resin costs to our customers.
Demand from the beverage market was below the prior year.
Though sales grew modestly on the resin price adjustments.
In pharma the increased demand for our injectable components including supplying some of the COVID-19 vaccine distributions, and increased demand for our active material science solution, including those for COVID-19 test kits, offset declines in the prescription drug and consumer healthcare markets.
As we had mentioned when giving guidance for the quarter, fewer non-critical doctor visits and the lower incidence of cold and flu illnesses have resulted in certain pharma customers drawing down inventory levels of allergy and other respiratory treatment delivery devices.
We continue to be well positioned to niche healthcare sectors and receive these pandemic related supply chain adjustments as transitory.
In beauty and home, sales to the personal care and home care markets increase, while sales to the beauty market declined due to the continued low level of retail beauty activity related to the ongoing pandemic related lockdowns.
We are cautiously optimistic that the second half of the year will show a recovery in the beauty market.
We are also maintaining initiatives to contain costs and manage inflation that includes raising prices to offset increases in raw material and other costs, while investing in key growth areas including adding capacity to supply the beauty market in China.
Many of our customers remain optimistic that consumers are harboring pent-up demand for the beauty products that will help bring a feeling of normalcy to the lives post pandemic.
Turning to slide four, and new product launches, I would like to briefly comment on several product introductions that will highlight the breadth of our offerings.
In pharma, our active material science technology was selected to protect two new at-home COVID-19 tests that recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.
These tests provide convenient access to testing without the need to visit the doctor's office.
Our technology is integrated into these diagnostic kits to protect against moisture and other environmental conditions that would otherwise impact test accuracy.
In the prescription drug market, our unidose powder device is being used in a pivotal trial of intranasal powder-based Naloxone by Nasus Pharma.
Also landmark's new nasal spray treatment whi...
...he consumer healthcare market decreased 1% for the reasons that Stephan mentioned earlier.
Core sales to the injectables market increased 14% with higher demand for our vaccine components.
Price accounted for approximately 2% of the total growth and about one-third of the remaining growth is from COVID related sales, mostly to supply vaccine distributions.
Core sales of our active material science solutions increased 5% primarily due to increase sales of our active containers used for probiotics.
Turning to our beauty and home segment, core sales decreased 3% and the segment's adjusted EBITDA margin was 10% in the quarter and was negatively impacted by increased resin and other raw material costs, which are passed through where possible, albeit through a process that has typically been on a 60 to 90-day lag.
With unit sales growth by market on a core basis, core sales to the beauty market decrease 10% due to continued localized lockdowns, especially in Europe, and global travel restrictions, which have caused a significant reduction in traditional retail, the duty free sales.
Core sales to the personal care market increased 2% due to continued strong demand for our hand sanitizer and liquid soap dispensers.
Wholesale to the homecare market increased 13% and strong demand for our cleaners and disinfectants, and some automotive products.
Turning to our food and beverage segment, which had a solid performance, core sales increased 14% in the segment achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% primarily due to the ongoing strength in the food market.
Looking at each market, core sales to the food market increased 19% as consumers continue to dine at home trend because of the pandemic.
Core sale for the beverage market increased 2%, primarily due to the pass-through of higher resin prices.
Moving to slide seven, which summarizes our outlook for the second quarter.
Current underlying demand conditions in most of our markets are not expected to change dramatically from what we experienced in the first quarter.
The anticipated demand for our prescription drug and consumer healthcare devices will remain under pressure compared to the prior year as customers continue to work off existing inventories.
However, in some of our other markets, including beauty, we will have easier comparisons to the prior year second quarter, which was the most difficult period when you consider the impact of pandemic lockdowns.
We expect a second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding restructuring and any change in the fair value of equity investments to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.99 per share.
The estimated tax rate range for the second quarter is 26% to 28%.
In closing, we continued to have a strong balance sheet with a leverage ratio of 1.4.
On a gross basis that the capital was approximately 37%.
On the net basis, it was approximately 31%.
In addition, we continue to invest in innovative growth projects, and we are confirming our forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million.
At this time, Stephan will provide a few closing comments before we move to Q&A.
In closing, on slide eight, I'd like to mention that the broad range of end markets that we serve makes Aptar a very resilient company through economic cycles, and the most recent period was no exception.
The wide variety of technologies and solutions that we provide, combined with our commitment to R&D, and new innovative solutions will further build upon our solid customer pipeline.
We have a profound respect for the environment that drives lower energy consumption, landfill free facilities, and sustainable product designs, we will continue to advocate for a circular economy in which packaging is reused and recycled.
Therefore, our positive mid and long term view is unchanged.
And when we look past this global pandemic induced crisis, the future is quite promising.
We look forward to going after for the long term benefit of all stakeholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I am Alexandra Deignan, the company's Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Sustainability.
Today's discussion also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the company's performance.
Hosting our call today are Kenneth Jacobs, Lazard's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Evan Russo, Chief Financial Officer.
Evan will start the discussion with an overview of our financial results, then Ken will provide his perspective on the outlook for our business.
After that, we'll open the call to questions.
Today, we reported record operating revenue for the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by strong results across the firm.
Second quarter revenue was a record $821 million, up 51% from a year ago, and first half revenue was a record $1.5 billion, up 33% from a year ago.
Revenue for the last 12 months was a record $2.9 billion.
This high performance underscores the strength of our franchise and the breadth and depth of our business.
In financial advisory, record second quarter revenue of $471 million increased 61% from last year's period, reflecting broad based activity across sectors, market cap and regions.
M&A completions in the second quarter increased substantially in the Americas, Europe and Asia as did private equity transactions.
Our advisory revenue reflects a growing percentage of financial sponsor activity.
Our Global Private Capital Advisory franchise also had a strong quarter serving financial sponsors with new fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions.
Our second quarter restructuring revenue was down from last year's elevated level, and we expect lower levels of restructuring to continue in the second half of the year, given the strong liquidity across markets.
Our sovereign and capital markets businesses continue to be active, advising governments and corporations on financing strategy and capital raising.
Overall, our advisory business is experiencing unprecedented activity levels.
Assuming current macroeconomic conditions, as we said last quarter, we expect that our Financial Advisory revenue in the second half of 2021 will be higher than the first half.
Asset Management operating revenue reached an all time high for the quarter and first half of the year with second quarter revenue of $343 million, up 40% from a year ago.
This reflected management fees on a larger base of assets under management, as well as strong incentive fees, primarily from European equity strategies.
Average AUM for the second quarter reached a record high of $276 billion, 32% higher than a year ago and 6% higher on a sequential basis.
As of June 30th, we reported AUM at a quarter end record level of $277 billion, 29% higher than last year's period and 5% higher on a sequential basis.
The increase was primarily driven by market appreciation and positive foreign exchange movement with $0.8 billion of net outflows.
The quarter's net outflows were limited to our equity platform, particularly in emerging markets.
These were partly offset by net inflows in our fixed income and alternatives platforms.
Gross inflows continue to be healthy across our platforms.
As of July 23rd, AUM increased to approximately $278 billion driven primarily by market appreciation of $2.5 billion, partly offset by negative foreign exchange movement of $1.3 billion and net outflows of approximately $1 billion.
We continue to see demand for global and international equities as well as our quantitative and fixed income strategies.
We are investing for growth across the firm.
In Asset Management, we continue to invest in people, technology and our distribution effort, as well as the development of new and existing funds and the scaling up of our platforms.
In the second quarter, we launched an investment grade convertible bond fund, our fifth long only strategy in the convertible space, an area where we are gaining significant traction.
In addition, this week we announced the senior hire to build an...
...talented investment teams adding strategies that are complementary to our existing platforms.
In financial advisory, we are driving growth with an elevated pace of strategic recruiting.
Year to date, we have made more than a dozen senior hires, including several high level senior advisors to increase the firm's breadth of revenue sources and connectivity.
Now turning to expenses, even as we invest for growth, we are maintaining our cost discipline.
Our adjusted non-compensation ratio for the second quarter was 14.5%, compared to 18.3% in last year's second quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were 19% higher than the same period last year, reflecting increased business activity over the last year's depressed levels.
We continue to accrue compensation expense at a 59.5% adjusted compensation ratio in the second quarter.
Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25.2%.
For the first half of the year, it was 26.7%.
We continue to expect this year's annual effective tax rate to be in the mid 20% range.
Lazard continues to generate strong cash flow, which supports return of capital to shareholders.
In the second quarter, we returned $161 million, which included $111 million in share repurchases.
We expect to continue our share repurchase program utilizing our cash flow from operations.
Our total outstanding share repurchase authorization is now approximately $339 million.
Ken will now provide perspective on our outlook.
The global macroeconomic environment continues to strengthen and market conditions remain excellent for both our businesses.
Even if the course of the pandemic remains uncertain, business conditions in most of the developed world are normalizing.
Economic recovery continues to be underpinned by unprecedented support from central banks and fiscal policy.
As CEOs, Boards and investors look past the short-term uncertainties, they are increasingly confident in the longer-term outlook.
The forces driving global strategic activity remain in place.
Technology driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for M&A across industries.
The global push to lower carbon emissions is an emerging catalyst.
The pandemic is driving structural changes in the real economy.
Shareholder activism continues to evolve globally and there is an abundance of private capital being put to work alongside strategic capital and specs.
Our advisory business is in high demand in this environment.
We are serving clients with the most sophisticated capabilities and deep insights into local markets, reinforced by expertise from global sector and specialty teams.
In Asset Management, we entered the second half of the year with a record level of assets under management.
Low interest rates continue to drive demand for risk assets including equities and corporate and emerging market debt as well as alternative investments.
Institutional investors continue to seek sources of differentiated alpha.
Our Asset Management business is especially well positioned in this environment with a diverse array of innovative strategies and solutions for a sophisticated client base.
We see significant opportunities for productive growth across our businesses, and we continue to invest in people, capabilities, technology infrastructure to enhance our competitive edge.
We remain focused on serving our clients well, while managing the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long-term.

Even as we hope for a continued lifting of quarantines and travel restrictions, we have proven our ability to serve clients in both fully remote and hybrid environments.
They are serving our clients with outstanding financial advice and solutions and they continue to be remarkably productive.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These risks include, but are not limited to, the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions and the level of consumer spending, the company's ability to capitalize on opportunity, or grow its market share and numerous other factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We have worked hard over the years to build the most experienced, industry-leading team, and I am very proud of their results.
Today, I would like to start by reviewing a few of our first quarter highlights.
Then, I will touch on how we are strategically approaching the important peak selling season, as well as discussing the meaningful opportunities in front of us to create growth and long-term shareholder value.
And finally, Mike will review the financial results in greater detail and provide some color on the balance of the year.
Let me start by reviewing the first quarter.
Our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our team, customers and community as we serve our customers boating needs.
We are pleased that our first quarter results greatly exceeded the very impressive results last year.
A year ago, we had very strong growth in the December quarter and set a record for revenue and earnings.
The MarineMax team significantly outperformed those results and raised the bar yet again.
We further strengthened our financial position during the quarter, while completing the very strategic acquisition of SkipperBud's, the largest acquisition for the company to date.
As we indicated on our last earnings call in October, we finished fiscal 2020 with the highest revenue and earnings in the company's history.
That momentum and industry demand has continued as shown by our results.
Our record results continue to demonstrate our team's ability to evaluate customers' needs, act quickly and implement the right changes in how we operate our business.
For the quarter we are particularly pleased with our continued solid performance in same-store sales, which increased over 20% which is on top of 24% same-store sales growth a year ago.
Importantly, our new unit growth was even stronger at 35%.
Furthermore in the quarter, we had meaningful growth across essentially all brand, categories and geographic region.
The marine industry continues to experience a significant acceleration in new customers.
This new foundational layer of customers to the boating lifestyle is comprised of the combination of new first-time buyers and people that decided to get back into boating, which should help support future growth as they migrate to larger or different types of products in the coming years.
Our team remains energized by the shift, and given our scale, we should continue to significantly benefit from this resurgence.
During the quarter we also leveraged our investments in technology, driving leads in marketing analytics, which is converting into sales.
We continue to make investments in world-class customer engagement tools that improve our teams' efficiency and effectiveness and help us to take share and lead the industry.
In the quarter, we added SkipperBud's and its affiliate Silver Seas Yacht to our family.
The acquisition added 20 locations, including 11 marina and storage operations.
We have successfully integrated the business and believe many opportunities exists to share best practices, brands and resources to drive even greater growth in the years to come.
From a profitability perspective, one of the best elements of the quarter was strong gross margin.
We benefited from increases in product margins, growth in our storage and service businesses, our asset light Fraser and Northrop & Johnson global charter businesses and our finance and insurance businesses.
Expanding our margins has been a long-term strategic focus and recent acquisitions have contributed to that strategy.
The combination of gross margin expansion and focused expense management resulted in considerable leverage and a record $1...
... despite added borrowings for Skipper's inventory, short-term borrowings decreased $171 million due largely to a reduction in inventories and increase in cash generation with the contribution from the roughly $53 million of mortgages that are outstanding.
Customer deposits, while not the best predictor of near-term sales because they can be lumpy, due to the size of deposits and whether a trade is involved or not, nearly tripled in size due to the timing of large yacht orders and more robust sales along with the contribution from Skipper's for future sales.
Our current ratio stands at 1.74 and our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is 1.42, both of these are very impressive balance sheet metrics.
Our tangible net worth was $339 million or about $14.92 per share.
Our balance sheet has always been a formidable strategic advantage, and today more than ever, it continues to protect us in uncertain times, while providing the capital for expansion as opportunities arise.
Turning to guidance, the December quarter exceeded expectations and the industry trends remained strong.
The industry estimates for 2021 retail units are beginning to rise from the low-single digits to the mid-single digits.
Since we usually outperform the industry and grow our AUP on an annual basis, we now expect our annual same-store sales growth to be in the high single digits.
This is up from the mid-to-high single digits we guided to earlier in the year.
Given the strength in earnings in December, our guidance also assumes modest operating leverage improvement above our previous guidance.
This expectations assumes we reached the low end of our historical targeted leverage of 12% to 17% given we have the bulk of the year still in front of us along with continued uncertainty.
Accordingly, we are raising our earnings per share guidance to the range of $4 to $4.20 for 2021 from our earlier guidance of $3.70 to $3.90.
Our guidance excludes the impact from any potential acquisitions that we may complete.
As we progress through the year, we will provide updates as needed to our guidance.
Looking at the remainder of 2021, remember that our March quarter is the easiest comparison with our toughest comparisons in the more meaningful summer quarters of June and September.
Our guidance uses the share count of about 22.8 million shares and an effective tax rate of 26%.
Our tax rate for the December quarter was meaningfully better than this, due primarily to equity compensation deductions which are hard to predict and are not typically forecasted when we give guidance.
Turning to current trends, January will close with positive same-store sales and our backlog is meaningfully higher than last year.
As we have said, industry trends remain strong and we are generally outperforming these elevated levels.
We continue to feel good as we enter the important summer selling season that's early in the year and a lot of work remains.
MarineMax continues to benefit and capitalize on the surge in demand and the desire of consumers to find a safe recreational activity.
Our team's performance to start the fiscal year has shown continued excellent execution, even on top of very impressive same-store sales a year ago.
We are creating exceptional customer experiences through our team's services, products and technology.
Most exciting is that we see significant opportunity in our brand expansion and also our higher margin businesses.
With about 30 locations globally, we believe our superyacht services business have considerable upside including their charter business, which should contribute in a much larger manner.
We remain committed to the long-term financial strength of the company by driving cash flow growth.
Importantly, our acquisitions are integrated and contributing immediately to our business.
Looking forward, we are focused on building our strong team culture, we are focused on executing on our growth strategy and we are focused on creating long-term shareholder value.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These are important to review and contemplate.
As everyone on the call today is aware, business environment uncertainty remains heightened due to COVID-19.
These items include shutdown impacts for many areas of the economy, changes to consumer purchasing habits potential for a disruptive supply chain and various other economic factors.
This means that results could change at any time and the forecasted impact of risk consideration to the best estimate based on information available as of today's date.
Additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available on our most recent SEC filings and the most recent Company 10-K.
I'll now hand it over to our CEO, Ron Lombardi.
And let's start on Slide 5.
Our proven business model continues to set us up for long-term success and the strong earnings performance and a stable topline year-to-date results is continued evidence of this as we have raised our full year revenue and earnings targets.
The business strategy we have in place is a highly adaptable one, which positions us to create value during the pandemic.
Our strategy of offering consumers a wide range of easily accessible brands they know and trust continues to work.
The ongoing objective is to grow categories while connecting with consumers over the long term.
We'll share one example of this long-term strategy, Compound W on the next slide.
Despite the long-term nature of these investments, we are also quick to target near-term opportunities.
This important nuance allows us to adjust our brand-building strategy in real time finding additional ways to deliver brand growth.
For example, as discussed the last two quarters, we have focused on prioritization on where consumers are shopping.
A result of this is that we are winning big in e-commerce where we've seen triple-digit growth and many of our brands actually have a higher share in the channel compared to brick and mortar.
Meanwhile, our nimble business continuity efforts continue to do well during COVID-19.
We continue to work strategically with our manufacturing partners to ensure consistent service levels in this dynamic supply environment.
Finally, our consistent operating model and disciplined capital strategy continue to reward shareholders.
We anticipate solid earnings and free cash flow growth for the full fiscal year, which continues to increase our capital allocation optionality.
So, to recap, our business positioning remain solid and our strategy of delivering consistent results as we close out our fiscal year.
Utilizing our brand-building toolkit and taking time to understand consumer insights, the goal is to drive long-term growth for our leading brands.
Shown on the page we have Compound W, which is a great example of this objective.
It's a brand with a long history with consumers and we've invested steadily behind it through a wide range of tools over time.
One tool used is innovation.
All of our brands operate with a multi-year pipeline of product development concepts to ensure we continue to match the needs of consumers.
Compound W NitroFreeze is a great recent example with its extreme freezing technology that is not found in other OTC treatments.
We are also connecting with consumers, as they think about treatment with content that helps explain their wart treatment options.
For example, during the pandemic, we've reminded consumers of the ability to treat warts effectively at home and the solutions Compound W offers.
The result of our investment behind Compound W is clear.
We have a trusted source for retailers for insights into the wart category and how to drive long-term category growth.
This has enabled our brand to continue to gain shelf space and share.
Our results have been solid.
Over the last five years, Compound W has grown at a double-digit compound annual rate.
That's free outpacing category growth and solidifying its number one market position with consumers as a preferred brand for wart treatment.
With that, I'll now...
....
Our diverse portfolio has enabled a stable revenue performance with strength in many brands in our portfolio, helping to offset COVID-19 impacted categories.
Our broad channel diversity continues to help drive revenue performance as we experienced strong triple-digit consumption growth in the e-commerce channel year-to-date, as consumers continue to shift to online purchasing.
Total company gross margin of 58.2% in the first nine months was largely flat to last year's adjusted gross margin of 57.9% and has been stable across quarters.
This was in-line with our expectations and we continue to anticipate a gross margin of about 58% for the remainder of the year.
Advertising and marketing came in at 15.9% of revenue in Q3 and 14.8% for the first nine months.
We still expect A&M for the full year to be you just under 15% as a percent of sales as we continue at a normalized rate of spend in the fourth quarter.
G&A expenses were flat in Q3 down for the first nine months of Fiscal 2021 versus the prior year [Indecipherable] largely to disciplined cost management.
For the full year, we anticipate G&A expenses to approximate 9% of sales and remain below prior year in absolute dollars.
Lastly, we realized strong 15% earnings per share growth for the first nine months of Fiscal 2021 versus the prior year.
Lower operating costs, lower interest expense and lower share count were all factors to the growth.
In the quarter, we generated $43.5 million in free cash flow, which, as expected, was lower than last year due to both timing of working capital and CapEx investments.
For the first nine months of Fiscal 2021, free cash flow of $159.2 million grew over 3% versus the prior year.
We continue to anticipate full year 2021 free cash flow at or above prior year levels.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $1.5 billion of net debt, which equated to a leverage ratio of 4.2x.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $9 million in shares opportunistically leaving the remainder of our cash generation on the balance sheet in anticipation of a potential bond refinancing event in Q4 to opportunistically capitalize on the attractive debt rate environment.
The cash accumulation was temporary to the quarter.
There has been no change to our strategy of prioritizing debt pay down as our primary use of free cash flow.
With less than two months to go, in our fiscal year, we are confident with our business performance and objectives and are increasing our outlook for both sales and EPS.
For the full year Fiscal 2021, we now anticipate revenues of approximately $935 million.
For Q4, we anticipate consistent trends to what we have realized over the past few quarters.
However, the period will face a unique comparison to the prior year as we experienced a significant lift in March of 2020 as consumers stocked up on items as a result of COVID-19.
We now anticipate adjusted earnings per share of approximately $3.22 for Fiscal 2021.
Disciplined cost management and the benefit of our capital allocation strategy and debt reduction continue to drive a solid earnings growth.
These attributes to translate into free cash flow as well and we continue to anticipate free cash flow of $207 million or more, which is at or above the prior year's level.
We continue to prioritize debt reduction while balancing other disciplined capital allocation efforts to drive shareholder value.
Looking ahead, we continue to have confidence that our business is well-positioned heading into Fiscal 2022.
We will begin to lap the effects of COVID-19 that began in the spring of last year, while our long-term brand building strategy continues to set us up for long-term success.
We continue to target 2% to 3% long-term organic sales growth, which translates into mid to high single-digit earnings growth driven by our stable and solid financial profile and disciplined capital allocation strategy.
It's a proven strategy and we remain confident in its ability to drive value for stakeholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Actual results may differ.
Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures.
I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe.
Sales of $2.3 billion for the quarter were slightly higher than 2020.
Diluted earnings per share was $3.68 for the quarter and pension adjusted earnings per share was $3.56, up from $2.43 in 2020.
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of approximately $49 billion, of which approximately $25 billion is funded.
Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks.
Shifting to activities in Washington.
We were pleased that the recently released summary of the fiscal year 2022 President's budget request affirm that maintaining U.S. naval power is critical to reassuring allies and signaling U.S. resolved to potential adversaries.
Of note, the budget summary cited continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet, investment in remotely operated and autonomous systems and funding for the next-generation attack submarine program.
And we look forward to understanding budget details for these and other national security priorities when that information becomes available as well as funding levels requested for the Department of Energy and the Department of Homeland Security.
We also look forward to working closely with the Congress as the FY '22 President's budget request is considered during the current legislative cycle.
Regarding portfolio shaping actions during the quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of our oil and gas business and also completed the contribution of the San Diego Shipyard to Titan Acquisition Holdings in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in this leading provider of ship repair and fleet sustainment services.
Completion of these transactions sharpens the focus of our Technical Solutions business into areas where we believe our unique capabilities and close customer relationships will drive strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion.
And as I prepare to close, I'm very pleased with the operating rhythm the team is achieving, which led to the third consecutive quarter of solid program execution and financial results.
And I am very confident that our strength, agility and positive momentum resulting from enduring the impacts of COVID-19 will serve as key catalyst to help us leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and employees.
After serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and with more than 40 years of service, Brian Cuccias retired on April 1.
Brian's career at Ingalls has been remarkable, and HII has truly benefited from his leadership.
Effective April 1, Kari Wilkinson succeeded Brian as the new President of Ingalls and will report to Chris.
Kari has proven herself to be a strategic and visionary leader that is focused on operational excellence, and I am extremely confident that Ingalls is in very capable hands.
Operationally, we had a solid quarter, making consistent progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs.
With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter.
At Ingalls, the team was awarded a life-cycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million.
The scope of work includes engineering change management, supply chain management, training for new shipboard systems and the execution of post-delivery availabilities.
Regarding program status, LHA eight Bougainville achieved a 25% complete milestone during the quarter, and the team remains focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of their planned production milestones.
On the DDG program, the team remains focused on preparations for launch of DDG 125...
... to the divestiture of our oil and gas business as well as the recognition of R&D tax credits for the current year and prior periods.
Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations was $43 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $16 million.
This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan were $72 million in the quarter, of which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.
During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million.
As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of approximately $50 million.
Moving on to pension.
With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the five-year pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most appropriate view.
Due to the limited nature of our projected contributions and the impact of lower cash sensitivity with safe harbor implementation, the passage of the legislation does not have a meaningful impact on our outlook.
We plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call, consistent with our prior cadence.
Ingalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20 million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program.
Ingalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier.
Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to $66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction as well as fleet support services.
Newport News operating income of $93 million and margin 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk retirement on VCS Block IV boats.
Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February one of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compares to a loss in the first quarter of 2020.
This was driven primarily by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business.
Turning to Slide nine.
We continue to expect we will finish the year with strict building operating margin in the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted toward the end of the year.
In addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our annual guidance range.
We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Ted Geisler, CFO; Daniel Froetscher, APS' President and COO; and Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy are also here with us.
First, I need to cover a few details with you.
Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.
It will also be available by telephone through February 28.
Before I review our 2019 achievements and provide operating and regulatory updates, I want to look forward to the future and share more information about our focus areas and priorities.
Our strategy is anchored by four concepts that align with industry trends and shape the way we do business.
Those concepts can most simply be stated as clean, affordable, reliable and customer-focused.
Let me talk briefly about each one.
Clean is about decarbonizing our generation mix with our new goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050.
Affordable is planning and operating our business to maintain reasonable electricity prices for the people, businesses and communities we serve.
Reliable means serving our customers with dependable power safely and efficiently.
And customer-focused is about developing new solutions, products and services to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers.
With these in mind, we created a long-term plan and targets to track our progress along the way.
First, we recently announced our goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050.
This goal includes a near-term target of 65% clean energy with 45% coming from renewables by 2030 and a commitment to exit coal by 2031.
Importantly, our plan includes flexibility to ensure that we're able to execute in a way that maintains affordability for customers.
As Jim will discuss, we expect this plan will require considerable capital investment.
We believe a carbon-free future as possible while keeping customer rates over time at or below the rate of inflation with timely recovery of clean energy investments.
To support the affordability of our transition to a carbon-free resource mix, we will have a sharp focus on economic development in Arizona.
Growing our customer base, allocates these costs across more customers, which helps keep rates affordable and increase the shareholder value by growing our Company.
Supporting an internal culture focused on reducing costs and maintaining a financially strong company to access low cost capital are also key in delivering a 100% clean energy future affordably.
In the area of reliability, we believe putting the responsibility on the utility to maintain high-performing well-run resources is important.
In pursuit of our clean energy plan, we will acquire resources that appropriately balance reliability, cost and flexibility for our customers.
This includes both owning new resources and considering supplemental generation from purchase power as appropriate.
Our fourth concept reinforces that customers are at the core of what we do every day.
We're committed to providing options that make it easier to do business with us.
We plan to continue developing innovative programs that connect customers with advanced technologies to help manage their bill.
In addition, we'll be convening an advisory panel of customers to gain a deeper understanding of the customer experience through individual perspective, so a little design basis thinking.
As we work to execute in all these strategic areas, we'll focus on strengthening our relationships with stakeholders.
Going forward, we plan to continue working collaboratively with those who have vested interest in Arizona's future and our Company's role as the state's largest electricity provider.
For our regulators, we are committed to maintaining an open dialog, listening and ensuring transparency.
We have a lot of important work ahead of us, and we'll be sharing information about our progress as we advance through the year.
And while I'm excited about our future opportunities, I also want to recognize our team and the hard work c...
...ur clean energy future, we would expect that we will issue equity sometime after 2020.
While the exact amount has not yet been determined, we would expect the amount to be in the $300 million to $400 million range.
The timing of the offering around the next rate case minimizes dilution and is ultimately accretive for our shareholders.
Our financial health, including a solid equity layer, will continue to provide our customers the benefits of low-cost access to capital and competitive returns to our shareholders.
In 2020, we expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million that Pinnacle West.
Overall liquidity remain strong.
In the fourth quarter, APS issued $300 million of new 30-year unsecured debt at 3.5%.
We used the proceeds to repay commercial paper and to fund a $100 million of our $250 million par value 2.2% notes which matured in mid-January.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had a $115 million of short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term debt outstanding.
Due to the tax benefits associated with both the TEAM Phase II and Phase III and optimized use of income tax incentives, our effective tax rate for 2019 was a negative 2.9%.
We anticipate an effective tax rate in 2020 of 14%.
Continued use of income tax incentives, including tax credits associated with clean generation investments, will reduce cash taxes in the year projects -- our projects are placed in service.
A quick note on pension.
The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 97% as of year-end 2019.
This is due to strong portfolio returns during 2019, continued contributions and the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy, which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status.
2019 was a great year for economic development in our service territory.
We saw high-profile data centers and manufacturing plants break ground in the West Valley.
We successfully connected two new data centers to our power grid included in the Microsoft data center and begin prep work to add an additional six data center feeds in 2020.
In addition to growth from the commercial sector, Arizona is benefiting from residential population growth.
According to a December 2019 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, Arizona ranked third in population growth behind Texas and Florida.
Arizona's population grew by approximately 120,000 people between July 2018 and July 2019.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
We expect that this growth rate will continue in response to the economic trends in our service territory.
The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average.
In 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.9% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 9.6% and manufacturing employment increased by 5.2%.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Arizona's job growth ranked second in the nation in 2019.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend.
In 2020, we expect a total of 31,100 housing permits, driven by both single-family and multifamily permits.
We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated earnings for 2020 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance can be found on Slide 6 and 7.
In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains intact at 6% to 7% and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% in 2020.
The new year is off to a great start with the announcement of our bold clean energy plan, coupled with organic growth in our service territory.
We are excited to embark on a path that will help create a healthy and prosperous Arizona that benefits our customers, communities and shareholders.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties.
Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year.
Operating earnings are up $4 million, and net earnings are up $2 million.
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million, and aerospace is up $196 million.
The operating earnings on the defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus.
I will have more to say about this a bit later.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.
This was driven by a 250-basis-point lower margin rate at aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense.
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share.
We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $50 million more in operating earnings.
So it's a pure operations beat.
I must confess that we also beat our own expectations rather handsomely.
This is, in almost all respects, a very solid quarter.
It's hard to find something not to like about it.
It's a very good start to the year.
Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million with an 11.7% operating margin.
Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side.
Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year-ago quarter.
The difference is almost exclusively more G500 and G600 deliveries than the year-ago quarter.
The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year-ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell-side expectations.
Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventory.
Without the charge, from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb.
Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1.
Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34:1.
In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last two years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700.
The sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the quarter.
The momentum developed in the quarter appears to be rolling over into the second quarter as well.
We are experiencing a high level of interest and activity.
It is constructive to see this accelerated activity level without the benefit of the removal of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in many countries outside the U.S. Demand should improve even further when these restrictions are ultimately removed.
Gulfstream experienced a 5.7% increase in service revenue.
On the other hand, Jet Aviation's FBOs and certain of its maintenance facilities are recovering more slowly.
Jet Aviation service revenue is down around $31 million, coupled with a modest increase in service operating earnings.
The FBOs and MRO sites will do much better as business travel accelerate.
The G500 and G600 continued to perform well.
Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is superb.
As of the end of last week, we have delivered 104 of these aircraft to customers.
The G700 has over 1,400 test hours on the five test aircraft, and the first fully outfitted G700 is flying.
Its interior is absolutely beautiful.
We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Looking forward, we expect the second quarter to be our most challenging from a delivery perspective.
However, we also expect rapid improvement in the third and fourth quarters as we had planned for an increase in production and more delivery.
Combat systems has revenue of $1.8 billion, up 6.6% over the year-ago q...
...e end of the second quarter, as is our custom.
I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter.
From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter.
Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million.
For those of you who followed us for some time, you know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years.
This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international combat systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier.
So the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range.
Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales.
That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full-year capex to be roughly 2.5% of sales.
We also paid $315 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share.
And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share.
After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020.
The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes.
We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital, but this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond.
During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act.
As you may be aware, it contains two provisions that affect our business.
First, it extends the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who are prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures.
This will continue to benefit our technologies business, although it does not provide for fee on those costs.
So that will have an ongoing dilutive impact on the segment's margins.
Second, the act provides pension funding relief by reducing the amount of required contribution to our pension plans this year by a couple of hundred million dollars.
However, this same provision reduces the amount of pension costs we are reimbursed on our U.S. government contracts.
As a result, when coupled with the lower tax benefit from the reduced pension contributions, the impact on our 2021 cash flow is immaterial.
We expect the cash benefit from the act to increase modestly over the next couple of years, reinforcing our expectation that free cash flow can exceed 100% of net income over that period.
The tax rate in the quarter, at 16.2%, is consistent with our full-year expectation, so no change to our outlook on that front.
Finally, order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole, even as we grew by more than 7% in the quarter.
As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the aerospace and technologies groups led the way with a 1.3 times and 1.1 times book-to-bill, respectively.
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.6 billion.
That's up 4.5% over this time last year.
And total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts, was $131.4 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter.
Howard, that concludes my remarks.
As a reminder, we asked participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has chance to participate.
Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?

Notably, aerospace revenue surpassed expectations by $200 million due to increased deliveries of G500 and G600 aircraft. However, the operating margin for aerospace declined due to lower margins and higher corporate expenses.

Mining cash cost of sales was $151 million or 68% of mining revenues in the first quarter compared to $182 million or 49% of mining revenues in the first quarter of 2019.
Cash cost of sales per short ton, FOB port, was approximately $83 in the first quarter compared to $87 in the same period of 2019.
The decrease is primarily due to lower price-sensitive costs such as transportation and royalties that vary with met coal pricing, offset partially by 13% lower sales volumes.
SG&A expenses were about $8 million or 4% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $9 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower corporate expenses.
Depreciation and depletion expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were $29 million compared to $22 million in 2019.
The increase quarter over quarter was primarily due to the high level of capital spending during 2019.
Net interest expense was about $8 million in the first quarter and included interest on our outstanding debt plus amortization of our debt issuance costs associated with our credit facilities, partially offset by interest income.
This amount was $1 million lower compared to the same period last year primarily due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt in last year's first quarter.
We recorded noncash income tax expense of $3 million during the first quarter of 2020 and $28 million in the same period last year.
These results primarily reflect the utilization of our net operating losses, or NOLs, with a corresponding decrease in the balance sheet account deferred income taxes.
We paid no cash taxes in the first quarter of 2020 or 2019.
We continue to expect the utilization of our NOLs will reduce our federal and state income tax liability to 0 until the NOLs are fully utilized or expired.
We expect this will continue to drive significant free cash flow conversion over the next several years.
Turning to cash flow.
During the first quarter of 2020, we used $5 million of free cash flow, which was the result of cash flows provided by operating activities of $21 million, less cash used for capital expenditures and mine development costs of $26 million.
Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2020 was negatively impacted by an increase in net working capital.
The increase in net working capital was primarily due to higher accounts...
...under our ABL facility, net of borrowings of $70 million and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $9 million.
As I mentioned earlier, we drew $70 million on our ABL facility as a precautionary measure to increase liquidity and reduce risk during these unprecedented times.
We intend on retaining the funds and cash to preserve liquidity amid the growing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak.
In summary, the first quarter results for production and sales volumes turned out as expected and previously disclosed.
The overall financial results were primarily driven by lower net selling prices and slightly lower sales volumes compared to last year's first quarter.
Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year.
In light of the uncertainties regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its overall impact on the global economy and the company's operations, we are withdrawing our full year 2020 guidance issued on February 19 at this time.
We're also appropriately adjusting operational needs, including managing expenses, capital expenditures, working capital, liquidity and cash flows.
For example, as precautionary measures, we have delayed the $25 million budgeted for the development of the Blue Creek project until at least July 1, 2020, and have temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program.
We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business for the remainder of the fiscal year and expect to provide further updates to our financial outlook and the development of the Blue Creek project during our second quarter earnings call to be held in late July.
We're continuing to pay our quarterly dividend at this time, but we'll continue to monitor liquidity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to make a few more comments.
While we were pleased with our first quarter results, the rest of the year is less certain.
We are clearly seeing the impact of COVID-19 on global steel production and overall met coal pricing in light of reduced automobile manufacturing and a slowdown of construction projects.
Although we did experience some reduction in sales orders toward the end of the first quarter, it is now apparent that the full impact of COVID-19 on met coal demand erosion may not materialize until the second quarter of 2020 and possibly beyond.
And as a result, the unprecedented level of uncertainty in our customers' markets has made the job of forecasting, which was already challenging, even more difficult.
We continue to regularly update our business continuity planning on global steel production and met coal demand for various potential developments related to COVID-19 and will continue to take precautionary measures as necessary or advisable.
We've kept and will continue to keep close contact with our customers during this period in order to optimize our sales orders and capitalize on opportunities if and when they appear in the marketplace.
Regarding met coal pricing, we expect all indices to remain under pressure as long as the supply and-demand balance remains stressed by the uncertainty of current events.
Despite the unknowns, there are a few important reasons that our business is well positioned to weather any prolonged economic challenge: one, we have a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity; two, our low and variable cost structure enables us to drive high margins and free cash flow across most business environments; three, we've made significant investments in our operations over the past three years, allowing us to now reduce capital expenditures as needed without impacting operations; four, we maintain one of the world's highest quality met coal portfolios, and we have strong long-term customer relationships; and five, our highly talented workforce is committed to safely and efficiently driving results.
As a result of these factors, I'm confident we will emerge from this health crisis ready to achieve our long-term growth potential.

[/INST] # For Q1 2020, Warrior Met Coal reported a GAAP net income of $22 million, or $0.42 per share, down from $110 million, or $2.14 per share, in Q1 2019. Adjusted net income was $20 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to $2.30 per share last year. These declines were primarily attributed to a 31% decrease in net selling prices and a 13% reduction in sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA also dropped significantly, from $181 million in Q1 2019 to $62 million in Q1 2020. Despite these challenges, the company's low and variable cost structure still resulted in high margins. Due to the uncertainties brought by COVID-19, Warrior Met Coal has withdrawn its 2020 guidance and implemented cost-saving measures such as delaying the Blue Creek project and suspending stock repurchases. Nevertheless, the company maintains a strong balance sheet and liquidity and is confident in its long-term growth potential.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, I'd like to review the Safe Harbor statements.
During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
Additionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call.
We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information.
I will now turn the conference over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Lambiase.
I'd like to start by saying that all the employees at Chimera are healthy and working remotely from home.
We implemented our contingency work plan in early March, and have not experienced any significant technology issues.
We all hope view and your family stay safe and healthy as well.
In the month of March, the COVID-19 pandemic created an environment of fear and extreme uncertainty resulting in near catastrophic conditions for the fixed income markets.
Many investors felt that the government mandated lockdowns would likely bring an economic recession and they sold their credit investments while reinvesting into safer risk-off assets such as T-Bills, U.S. Treasury notes and cash.
Credit-focused bond funds and ETFs saw record outflows forcing fund managers to sell their holdings into thin markets creating heightened volatility and market dislocations.
All sectors of the fixed income market, apart from U.S. treasuries, experienced sharp downward price movements.
So investors who use leverage as part of their strategies we're also forced to sell assets as they attempted to meet margin calls from their repo lenders.
Market conditions witnessed in March of 2020 were very similar to that experienced in the the 2008 crisis.
Yet, price movements were swift and occurred over a much shorter timeframe.
The Federal Reserve was quick to respond and on March 15, a Sunday night, they announced many initiatives to combat the worsening economic conditions.
The Federal funds rate was cut to 0%, new purchase plans for treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities were implemented and funding programs like the TELS and commercial paper facility were revived from the 2008 Federal Reserve playbook.
The Fed's actions were largely helpful bringing order to many areas of fixed income market including agency mortgage-backed securities.
Liquidity programs for residential credit securities were not offered by the Federal Reserve and they continue to trade in a challenged fashion in the secondary markets.
Like the Fed, Congress also did its part by passing the CARES Act with the intent to help individuals most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The U.S. economy is vastly different today than where it was prior to the COVID-19 crisis.
The abrupt shutdown in the U.S. economy has swiftly created some of the worst economic problems since the Great Depression.
In these past six weeks, 30 million people have applied for unemployment benefits, a sharp contrast to the 3.5% unemployment rate that we had in February.
Many U.S. homeowners have decided to take advantage of newly created mortgage forbearance programs.
In the near term, the government initiatives, coupled with mortgage forbearance, will soften the immediate blow to the U.S. economy.
But these may have lasting negative impact on the housing and mortgage market, should they persist for an extended period.
Over the past several years, Chimera has taken a number of balance sheet initiatives that helped it in this difficult period to protect our book value to meet all the margin calls from our repo lenders and to pay our dividends.
Our agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio has always served dual purposes, primarily as a source of spread income, and secondarily as a source of liquidity rather than selling our higher yielding legacy assets.
This quarter, we sold our agency pass-through securities to pay down debt and further deleverage our overall portfolio.
We ended the first quarter at 2.2 times recourse leverage,...
...The average loan size in the R2 deal was $219,000 and had an average FICO of 690.
We sold $352 million senior securities with a 2.55% cost of debt.
In response to the significant drop in interest rates, increased price volatility and repo margin calls, this quarter, we sold our entire portfolio of $5.7 billion residential agency pass-throughs.
These pass-throughs were the most liquid and lowest yielding assets in our portfolio and have always been part of our strategy to meet our liquidity needs.
We also terminated all our agency hedge positions comprised of U.S. Treasury note futures and $4.1 billion notional balance on interest rate swaps.
The agency CMBS portfolio, which has taken us many years to accumulate, was retained.
As of the quarter end, this portfolio totaled $2.5 billion.
We continue to like the spread income generated by this portfolio and the superior convexity profile of Ginnie Mae project loans relative to residential agency pass-throughs.
These securities finance well in the repo markets and have some more rates and haircuts as traditional agency pass-throughs.
The unique [Indecipherable] explicit prepayment lockout and penalties are valuable security trades as interest rates fall.
After quarter end, spreads on agency CMBS began to tighten when the Fed began purchasing these assets as part of their quantitative easing program.
Portfolio activity this quarter has significantly reduced the company's risk exposure as measured by recourse leverage.
We ended the quarter at 2.2 times recourse leverage down from 3.4 times at year-end and 3.8 times at the end of the third quarter of 2019.
This represents a 35% reduction of recourse leverage over the last three months and 42% over the past six months.
It is important to note, due to current market conditions, our high-yield credit assets, which is the largest component of our portfolio, have been marked down in book value -- have been marked down in value, which has contributed to Chimera's lower book value this quarter.
Our ability to retain this portfolio enables the opportunity for security value increases over time as economy restarts and the country works its way through the current pandemic.
As we move forward to the current economic crisis, we remain cautiously optimistic.
We will continue to space out the repo maturities and seek longer tenure for our credit repo.
And as we get more visibility into the housing and mortgage economics resulting from the crisis, we will seek to deploy cash into new investment opportunities as we have for the past decade.
I'll review Chimera's financial highlights for the first quarter.
GAAP book value at the end of the first quarter was $12.45 per share.
Our GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $389 million or $2.08 per share.
On a core basis, net income for the first quarter was $106 million or $0.57 per share.
Economic net interest income for the first quarter was $151 million.
For the first quarter, the yield on average interest earning assets was 5.3%.
Our average cost of funds was 3% and our net interest spread was 2.3%.
Total leverage for the first quarter was 4.7 to 1, while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 2.2 to 1.
Expenses for the first quarter, excluding servicing fees and transaction expenses were $18.6 million, consistent with last quarter.
Given the current market environment, we wanted to provide additional information about liquidity.
We currently have approximately $650 million in cash and unencumbered assets.
This is after we paid both our preferred and common stock dividends totaling $111 million.
Also, in April, we closed a public convertible bond offering that raised $374 million.
We believe it's important to have ample liquidity in this market and we're happy that the capital markets were open for us to achieve this goal.
We will continue to monitor our liquidity and assess opportunities to increase liquidity and balance, supporting our current portfolio and finding new opportunities in the market.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm joined today by Mike Renna, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Cocchi, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as additional members of our senior management team.
Throughout today's call, we'll be making references to future expectations, plans and opportunities for SJI.
Reconciliations of economic earnings to the comparable GAAP measures appear in both documents.
Our CFO, Steve Cocchi, will then review our third quarter and year-to-date operational performance and financial outlook.
Mike will conclude by offering some closing remarks.
I am pleased to report that SJI, notwithstanding the continuing challenges of COVID, again delivered solid performance in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2021, and we remain on-track to achieve our strategic and financial goals for the year.
Through the first nine months, we have seen economic earnings increase by 12% or approximately $12 million, reflecting solid performance in both our utility and nonutility businesses.
Consistent with our strategy, our utilities, South Jersey Gas and Elizabethtown Gas represent the bulk of our earnings.
Utility margin growth remained strong, reflecting above-average customer growth, positive rate case outcomes, infrastructure modernization programs and effective O&M management.
Natural gas remains in strong demand across New Jersey with our utilities adding more than 12,000 new customers over the last 12 months.
And while we are seeing increased new construction across the state, most of our growth continues to come from customers converting from heating oil and propane.
Our infrastructure modernization and energy efficiency investments, critical to assuring safe and reliable service to our customers, remain on-track and have the added benefit of significantly reducing methane emissions.
On October 1, in keeping with the cadence approved by the BPU, we began recovery of these investments made over the last 12 months.
I am also pleased to report that our regulatory initiatives continue to advance.
In August, the BPU approved South Jersey Gas' engineering and route proposal to construct needed system upgrades in support of a planned 2 Bcf liquefied natural gas facility.
As you know, the BPU has called utilities in New Jersey to evaluate preparedness for potential gas supply interruptions.
This investment is critical to ensuring service is not interrupted in the event of a significant outage, either behind our city gate or in one of the two interstate pipelines that serve the South Jersey Gas system.
Preliminary engineering and design of the project has commenced.
Regarding pending initiatives, we have requested $742 million in Phase 3 infrastructure modernization investments at South Jersey Gas.
This next phase of system modernization targets coated steel and vintage Aldyl-A plastic pipe, supporting the Murphy administration's safety and reliability, job creation and environmental goals.
The retirement of Rate Counsel in September and the leapfrogging of approval of our LNG redundancy proposal has extended our anticipated time line a bit.
But settlement discussions continue to progress, and we remain optimistic for a positive resolution soon.
With regard to pending legislation, the potential for rate base in RNG and hydrogen investments in New Jersey continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support that aligns with Governor Murphy's clean energy goals and is expected to be a priority item during the upcoming lame duck period.
As previously communicated, we believe this legislation will encourage innovation and accelerate New Jersey's decarbonization efforts.
Turning now to our nonutility operations.
Both our energy management and energy production segments delivered solid quarterly and year-to-date results.
Energy Management results reflect strong performance in both wholesale marketing and fuel management, while Energy Production reflects positive results from fuel cell and solar investments over the past 12 months, particula...
...rbonization investments through our 35% equity ownership in REV.
Midstream contributed a loss in third quarter earnings of $300,000 compared to earnings of $1.2 million last year, reflecting the absence of AFUDC related to the cessation of development activity for the PennEast Pipeline project.
Our other segment contributed a loss in economic earnings of $9.6 million compared to a loss of $9.2 million last year, reflecting higher interest and bank fees partially offset by lower outstanding debt.
For the nine months year-to-date, economic earnings were $112.1 million compared with $100 million last year.
Improved utility results and consistent nonutility results largely reflect the same factors as previously discussed, that impacted third quarter results.
Our capital expenditures and clean energy investments for the year-to-date were approximately $434 million with more than 80% of this amount allocated for regulated utility investments in support of utility infrastructure upgrades, system maintenance and customer growth.
Our balance sheet, debt and credit metrics have all improved over the past year and support our growth plans.
And as always, we remain committed to a capital structure that supports our regulated, focused capital spending plan while maintaining a balanced equity to total capitalization, ample liquidity and a solid investment-grade credit rating.
Our GAAP equity to total capitalization improved to 35% as of September 30, compared with 32.2% on December 31, 2020, reflecting debt and equity financing and repayment of debt using proceeds from asset sales.
Our non-GAAP equity to total cap, which adjusts for mandatory convertible units and other long-duration debt, improved to 43.4% at September 30 compared with 39.7% at December 31, 2020.
We continue to have ample liquidity at both SJI and our utilities with approximately $1.3 billion in total cash credit capacity and available through our equity forward and approximately $1.1 billion available as of September 30.
In addition, with the proactive refinancing efforts we've undertaken over the past year, as well as repayment of debt from our transactions and the remarketing of our prior mandatory convertible units, SJI has no significant debt maturities due in the near term.
Turning now to guidance.
Based on solid operational performance through the first nine months of the year, we are reaffirming our expectation for 2021 economic earnings of $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share.
Our long-term economic earnings-per-share growth target remains 5% to 8%, with significant step-ups expected in 2023 and 2025, driven by timing associated with utility rate cases and clean energy investments.
We're also affirming our five-year capital expenditures outlook through 2025 of approximately $3.5 billion.
As you know, PennEast capex in our five-year plan was relatively small, approximately $100 million, and we've identified a variety of utility and clean energy investments that match our current strategic growth requisites to take its place.
We are excited by the progress we've made in 2021 and remain highly confident in our ability to execute on our plan to safely and reliably deliver the clean decarbonized energy of the future through a fully modernized 21st century system.
But before opening up for Q&A, let me address a question that may be on your minds.
With regard to the recent rise in gas commodity prices, let me remind you that SJI has a prescriptive hedging plan in place approved by the BPU and designed to minimize the kind of pricing volatility our sector has witnessed in recent months.
Based on this program, any impact to customer bills would largely be resolved in our next BGSS discussions with the regulators with new rates effective next October.
I know many of you have gotten to know and engaged with Dave over the years.
He has served our company admirably and with great distinction for many years, including most recently with the responsibility of leading our utilities.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 These statements are based on management's expectations, plans and estimates of our prospects.
Today's statements may be time-sensitive and accurate only as of today's date, Thursday, February 11th, 2021.
We assume no obligation to update our statements or the other information we provide.
Also on the call today are Jojo Yap, our Chief Investment Officer; Peter Schultz, Executive Vice President; Chris Schneider, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Bob Walter, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Asset Management.
We hope you're doing well and staying healthy.
2020 was a year unlike any other and one which we would each like to put in our very distant memory.
Notwithstanding the turmoil, fear and uncertain operating environment, the FR team remain focused, executed the plan and performed admirably generating outstanding results for shareholders.
Our portfolio performance was strong.
We maintained high occupancy levels, grew cash rents and collected over 99% of build rents, more on that in a moment.
We capped off 2020 with an excellent fourth quarter.
We delivered year-end occupancy of 95.7%, up 70 basis points from the guidance midpoint provided on our third quarter call.
This was driven primarily by leasing at our developments and one of our replacement tenants in Southern California taking occupancy earlier than anticipated.
For the full year, we grew cash rental rates 13.5%, which is the second highest in our company's history, just behind the 13.9% growth we achieved in 2019.
These metrics reflect consistently strong tenant demand for high-quality logistics space.
In our markets, we're seeing well located and highly functional space being absorbed by e-commerce and other traditional users and their efforts to optimize supply chain.
The positive fourth quarter leasing statistics nationally are consistent with our own experience as CBRE's preliminary figure for net absorption is 104 million square feet, the highest quarterly result in the last four years and exceeding the 69 million square feet of 4Q completions.
For the full year, net absorption was 224 million square feet, 15% higher than 2019.
Completions were 265 million square feet, an increase of 10% over 2019.
In 2021, we expect to capitalize on our current land holdings as well as new acquisitions to generate more growth and value creation.
We're also focused on making progress in realizing the three-year cash flow growth opportunity we laid out for you at our Investor Day this past November.
I'm pleased to say we're off to a strong start as we've signed leases for approximately 54% of our 2021 rollovers and a cash rental rate increase of approximately 13%.
This early performance is consistent with the 10% to 14% increase we expect on our new and renewal leasing for the full year 2021.
Our expirations for the balance of 2021 are fairly granular with our largest remaining rollover now a 400,000 square footer where the tenant is expected to vacate in May.
I'd like to highlight several big leasing wins and some of our developments.
As evidence of the strength of the South Florida market, we're pleased to announce we have signed a long-term lease for 100% of the three-building First Cypress Creek Commerce Center with a single e-commerce tenant.
This project totals 377,000 square feet and the lease commenced right at completion on February 1st.
Our total investment is $37.1 million and our first year stabilized cash yield is 6.6%.
In the Inland Empire at our First Redwood project, we signed and commenced leases for both the 358,000 and the 72,000 square foot facilities in the fourth quarter.
And just this week, we fully leased the remaining 44,000 square foot building.
Given our own experience and the strong market dynamics reflected in CBRE's fourth quarter update report, which shows the Inland Empire vacancy rate at 1.9%.
We're excited to be readying our next start in that market, which I will discuss shortly.
Also in the fourth quarter in Dallas, we signed ...
... closure on one of our last tenants on the watchlist that we discussed in our last call.
This tenant occupied a 137,000 square foot building in the Chino submarket of the Inland Empire West and vacated on December 31st.
Due to the great work of our Southern California team, we were able to lease 100% of the building on a long-term basis with only one month of downtime at a cash rental rate increase of 28%.
In the fourth quarter, we also wrote off the $1.1 million of cash in straight-line rent receivable related to this tenant.
In doing so, we have taken care of the last material accounts receivable exposure related to our COVID-related watchlist.
Summarizing our outstanding leasing volume during the quarter, we commenced approximately 4.4 million square feet of leases.
Of these, 700,000 square feet were new, 1.6 million square feet were renewals and 2.1 million square feet were for developments and acquisitions with lease up.
Tenant retention by square footage was 80.6%.
For the quarter, same-store NOI growth on a cash basis, excluding termination fees, was 1.3% helped by an increase in rental rates on new and renewal leasing and rental rate bumps embedded in our leases, partially offset by lower average occupancy and an increase in free rent.
For the full year 2020, cash same-store NOI growth before lease termination fees was 4.4%.
Cash rental rates for the quarter were up 10.4% overall with renewals up 8.6% and new leasing 12.8%.
On a straight-line basis, overall rental rates were up 25.5% with renewals increasing 25.9% and new leasing up 25.1%.
For the year, cash rental rates were up 13.5%, which as Peter mentioned is the second highest in the company's history.
On a straight-line basis, they were up 29.7%.
Now on to a few balance sheet metrics.
At December 31st, our net debt plus preferred stock to adjusted EBITDA is 4.8 times and the weighted average maturity of our unsecured notes, term loans and secured financings was 6.3 years with a weighted average interest rate at 3.7%.
Our guidance range for NAREIT FFO is $1.85 to $1.95 per share with a midpoint of $1.90.
Key assumptions for guidance are as follows; quarter end average in-service occupancy for the year of 95.5% to 96.5%; our cash bad debt expense assumption for 2021 is $2 million, consistent with last year's pre-pandemic assumption.
Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3% to 4%.
We expect our G&A expense to approximate $33 million to $34 million.
In total, for the full year 2021, we expect to capitalize about $0.05 per share of interest related to these developments.
Guidance reflects the impact from the $42 million sale in Houston, expected to close in the first quarter that Peter discussed, which could be as much as $0.02 per share of FFO impact in 2021 depending on redeployment of the anticipated proceeds.
The guidance also reflects the expected pay off of $58 million of secured debt in the third quarter with an interest rate of 4.85%.
Other than previously discussed, our guidance does not reflect the impact of any other future sales, acquisitions or new development starts, the impact of any future debt issuances, debt repurchases or repayments and guidance also excludes the potential issuance of equity.
Before we open it up to questions, let me congratulate our team for their outstanding performance in 2020.
It was the kind of year that is impossible to prepare for.
There is no training for how to manage the business through a pandemic, especially one accompanied by social and political unrest not seen in decades.
The true leaders emerged during a crisis and when they have managed well and the crisis has passed, to most it may not have felt like a crisis at all.
This is what we experienced within our company across every role in every region.
I couldn't be more proud to work with such a talented group of people nor more excited about the opportunities ahead.
With that, we will now move to the question-and-answer portion of our call.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.
Revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, down from $3.7 billion in last year's fourth quarter.
During this year's fourth quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $0.93 per share.
In the quarter, we recorded $5 million in pre-tax special charges related to our 2020 restructuring plan or $0.01 per share after tax.
Excluding these special charges, adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2020.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $298 million in the quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $12.4 billion, up $731 million from last year.
Adjusted income from continuing operations was $3.30 per share compared to $2.07 per share in 2020.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $1.1 billion, up from $596 million in 2020.
Our business has closed out the year with another solid quarter.
At aviation, we continue to see favorable market conditions, including improved aircraft utilization, low preowned inventory levels and strong customer demand.
Order activity remained very strong with backlog growth of $655 million in the quarter and $2.5 billion for the full year, resulting in a $4.1 billion backlog at year-end.
As a result, we delivered aircraft on a more linear trend through the year, which improved manufacturing efficiency and cash flow generation.
Reflecting this improved operating environment and strong execution of our teams, aviation achieved a segment margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter.
For the year, we delivered 167 jets, up from 132 last year and 125 commercial turboprops, up from 113 in 2020.
Also in the year, we saw sequentially higher aftermarket revenue on a quarterly basis driven by increased aircraft utilization.
Moving to defense, aviation was awarded a $143 million contract for eight AT-6 aircraft, ground support equipment, spare parts and training from the Royal Thai Air Force.
This contract establishes Thailand as the international launch customer for the U.S. Air Force's latest light attack aircraft.
On the new product front, the Beechcraft Denali completed its first plate in November, launching the start of the flight test program.
Total revenues were down slightly in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues as expected, reflecting the continued wind down of the H-1 production program, partially offset by higher commercial revenues.
In December, Bell completed the first assault improvement modifications of an Air Force CV-22 Osprey.
This effort is part of an ongoing process to upgrade the Air Force Osprey fleet.
On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 156 helicopters in 2021, up from 140 in 2020.
We also saw solid commercial order activity for the year, reflecting broad-based demand.
Moving to Textron Systems.
We saw another strong quarter of execution that contributed to a full year margin of 14.8%, up 320 basis points from 2020.
During the quarter, we delivered the fourth Ship-to-Shore Connector to the U.S. Navy after its successful completion of acceptance trials.
On the Shadow program, systems was awarded an $82 million logistics support contract for 2022.
On our common unmanned surface vessel platform, we completed file testing related to the unmanned influenced sweep system program, setting up potential for a production contract award in the first quarter of 2022.
Revenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience supply chain challenges, including order disruptions in Kautex related to global auto OEM production schedules.
At Textron specialized vehicles, we continue to ...
...ar's fourth quarter, largely due to favorable pricing net of inflation of $21 million and improved manufacturing performance.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion.
Revenues were $858 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower military revenues, partially offset by higher commercial revenues.
Segment profit was $88 million -- of $88 million was down $22 million, primarily due to lower military volume and mix.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.9 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $313 million, down $44 million from last year's fourth quarter due to lower volume, which included the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on the segment's fee-for-service contracts.
Segment profit of $45 million was down $4 million from a year ago, largely due to the lower volume.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion.
Industrial revenues were $781 million, down $85 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $133 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line, reflecting order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, partially offset by a favorable impact of $50 million for pricing largely in the specialized vehicles product line.
Segment profit of $38 million was down $17 million from the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower volume and mix, partially offset by favorable impact from performance.
Finance segment revenues were $11 million, and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses, and interest expense were each $29 million.
Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $298 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year.
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares, returning $335 million in cash to shareholders.
For the full year, we repurchased approximately 13.5 million shares, returning $921 million of cash to shareholders.
Turning now to our 2022 outlook.
At Textron aviation, we're expecting revenues of about $5.5 billion, reflecting higher deliveries across all our product lines and increased aftermarket volume.
Segment margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 10% to 11%, reflecting higher volume, favorable pricing and increased operating leverage.
Looking to Bell, we expect revenues of about $3 billion, reflecting lower military volume, primarily related to lower H-1 production.
We're forecasting a margin in the range of about 10% to 11%, largely due to the lower military volumes and continuing high levels of R&D investment.
At systems, we're estimating revenues of about $1.3 billion with a margin in the range of about 13.5% to 14.5%.
At industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.5 billion on higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles.
We're estimating industrial margins to be in the range of about 5.5% to 6.5%.
At finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $15 million.
Moving to slide nine.
On a consolidated basis, we're expecting earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $4 per share.
We're also expecting manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to be about $700 million to $800 million, which includes an approximately $300 million impact from a change in the R&D tax law beginning in 2022.
Looking to slide 10.
We're projecting about $150 million of corporate expense, which includes $30 million of investment in eAviation.
We're also projecting about $120 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 On Slide 2 is the safe harbor statement.
These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and forecasts.
The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company.
During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS.
Before we dive into our Q3 results and raised 2020 guidance, I like to make clear the importance of our mission at West and the values that formed the pillars in which we operate.
In today's uncertain environment and what seems like a new set of challenges each day, we remain focused on two key priorities: keeping our team members safe and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we currently serve.
Moving to Slide 5, West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation of scale and our resources.
Our team recognized at the outset of the pandemic that need to increase production capacity.
We were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics meant that we needed to act quickly and very decisively.
To address the increase in demand, we brought forward planned capital investments and production capacity.
So, earlier this month we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HVP sites to prepare for the future demand of FluroTec and NovaPure.
As of this week, that capacity is operational and we have additional equipment being installed at a second HVP site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites.
The strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market led strategy and also One West team approach to satisfy market demand.
And now turning to Slide 6, the disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business in our daily lives.
West is no exception.
Customers can come to West for a scientific and technical expertise, and this differentiates us in the market.
We have been investing in digital technology and automation with two objectives in mind, bringing new connected products to market, as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization.
While we're early in our digital journey, I would like to share a few examples of the recent success, starting with our manufacturing automation strategy.
We made great strides over the past year and helping us to achieve continuous improvements and quality, safety, service and cost.
Petersburg, Florida site has developed an automation process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses.
This has considerably reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency.
Our Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, rinsing processes, which will drive higher quality and final product and greater efficiency gains.
And I'm especially pleased with the team's agility in bringing forward the production capacity expansion, I mentioned earlier.
A great deal of planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements.
On the digital front, we have just introduced the West virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience.
We expect this tool to be a primary customer interface, even beyond the current pandemic.
So, turning now to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter, our financial results remain strong.
I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters continued in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive.
And we've had over 18% organic sales...
...partially offset by increased overhead costs.
Contract Manufacturing third-quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019.
This is a result of improved efficiencies and the plan utilization.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash.
On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million, compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase.
Our year-to-date capital spending was also $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020 was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Accounts Receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory, mainly as a result of increasing safety stock.
Our cash balance at September 30 of the $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results.
Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong.
Turning to guidance, slide 13 provides a high-level summary.
Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion.
This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of also approximately $85 million.
There is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%.
This compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%.
We expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55, compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25.
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at the existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand.
Capex guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review this revised guidance.
Estimated FX headwinds on earnings per share has had an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates.
The revised guidance also includes $0.18 earnings per share impact from tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So just to summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow.
Our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct or approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
Before I close, I'm pleased to share that last evening we received FDA clearance for West to market our 20 millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product.
The team is excited to bring this innovative product to the healthcare professionals.
To conclude, there are many challenges ahead of this, but we're resolute in our mission focus systems and most importantly, the team to address these challenges.
We see strengths in our core business and we're confident in our long-term growth strategy.
Our market led strategies delivering unique value propositions to our customers.
Our global operations network is able to flex and respond to the demand, while driving our market leading service and quality.
And our investments in digital technology and automation will continue to keep us on the forefront of the industry.
We remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a very sustainable basis and doing our part to support the healthcare industry as it works to resolve this global pandemic.
On behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you well in the days ahead.
Gila, we're now ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm standing in for Tracy today.
The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under investor relations.
These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.
And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.
Tom, will you please begin?
The fourth quarter closed out a year of record-setting activity across our business.
Core FFO was $1.12 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.05.
For the full year, core FFO was $4.15 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.06.
Excluding promotes, core FFO grew 14% year over year.
Net effective rent change on rollover accelerated to 33%, up 510 basis points sequentially and was led by the U.S. at over 37%.
Average occupancy was 97.4%, up 80 basis points sequentially.
Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year.
I want to point out that we're modifying our in-place to market rent disclosure to standardize this metric among logistics REITs.
This collaboration is an extension of the work we've done to harmonize other property operating metrics.
We have collectively defined net effective lease mark-to-market of our operating portfolio as the growth rate from in-place rents to market rents.
This now aligns with how rent change on rollover is expressed.
Using this new definition consistently applied, our net effective lease mark-to-market at year-end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36%.
This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rent growth.
Turning to strategic capital.
This business continues to drive tremendous growth in value.
In Q4, we completed the early wind up of our highly successful UKLV venture.
UKLV's $1.7 billion of operating assets were contributed to our PELF and PELP Ventures, we earned net promote income of $0.05 in connection with the closeout of this venture and our percentage of infinite life vehicles has consequently grown to 95% of our $66 billion of third-party assets under management.
For the year, our team raised $4.4 billion of third-party equity.
After drawing down $1.9 billion in our open-ended funds for acquisitions during the year, equity Qs stood at a record $4 billion at yearend.
On the deployment front, we had a very productive and profitable year.
Development starts totaled $3.6 billion with margins of 32%.
We continue to maintain a long development runway with a land portfolio able to support $26 billion of future starts.
Stabilizations totaled $2.5 billion with estimated value creation of $1.3 billion and average margin of 53%, both all-time highs.
Realized development gains were $817 million for the year, also an all-time high.
These results are the product of our highly disciplined team and an incredibly strong operating environment.
For our customers, the importance of the health of their supply chain and the real estate that underpins it has never been so critical.
We believe the current global supply chain challenges will continue well beyond this year.
Fortunately, the scale of our 1 billion square foot portfolio puts us in a unique position to help our customers address these current supply chain challenges.
This includes shortening construction delivery times by navigating raw material shortages and leveraging our Essentials platform to procure warehouse equipment and services, so our customers can focus on their core operations.
We're also investing in technology and talent to support our industry-leading sustainability objectives, including our efforts around renewable energy.
Market dynamics today are highly favorable and demand has never been stronger.
During the quarter, we signed 62 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 90 million square feet.
Demand is diverse across a r...
...record rent and value growth.
In the fourth quarter, rents in our portfolio grew 5.7% globally and 6.5% in the U.S., bringing full year growth to records 18% and 20%, respectively, far exceeding our initial forecast.
This growth, paired with continued compression in cap rates, is translating to record valuation increases.
Our portfolio posted its highest quarterly value increase, rising more than 12.5% globally, bringing the full year increase to a remarkable 39%.
Now moving to guidance for 2022, here are the components on an our share basis.
We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 6% and 7% and average occupancy to range between 96.5% to 97.5%.
We are forecasting rent growth in our markets to be 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally.
For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $540 million and $560 million.
We expect net promote income of $0.55 per share for the year, almost all of which will occur in the third quarter and is driven by our PELF venture.
While a record, given the significant increase in rents and valuations, we would expect to see similar or higher promote levels in 2023.
In response to continued strong demand, we are forecasting development starts of $4.5 billion to $5 billion, with approximately 35% build-to-suits.
Dispositions will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, two-thirds of which we expect to close this quarter.
We're forecasting net deployment uses of $2.3 billion at the midpoint, which we plan to fund with $1.6 billion of free cash flow after dividends and a modest increase in leverage.
We project core FFO, including the $0.55 of net promote income, to range between $5 and $5.10 per share, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.45 and $4.55 per share or year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint.
Since our Investor Forum in 2019, our three-year earnings CAGR has been 13%, excluding promotes, well ahead of the 8% to 9% CAGR forecast we originally provided.
Before closing out, I want to spend a minute on the quality of our earnings drivers and differentiators, which set Prologis apart from other real estate companies.
We continue to drive strong organic growth and aren't reliant upon external growth to achieve sector-leading results.
In fact, approximately 75% of the increase to our core FFO for 2022, excluding promotes, is derived from organic growth, principally same-store NOI and strategic capital fee-related earnings.
It's important to point out that in 2022, our strategic capital revenue, including promotes, will be over $1 billion, a new milestone.
This high-margin business generates very durable fee streams with asset management fees marked to fair values each quarter, all while requiring minimal capital.
In addition, we see growing earnings from our Essentials business, which allows us to expand our services and solutions beyond rent.
When we introduced this business back in 2018, we set a target of $300 million from procurement savings and Essentials revenue.
We will hit that target this year with more than $225 million from procurement and $75 million from Essentials.
In light of our success with procurement and the fact that we have embedded this initiative into our platform, we will not provide specific procurement reporting going forward, instead focusing on Essentials.
We also have a long development runway of $26 billion, much of which comes from our international opportunity set, positioning us for continued strong value creation well into the future.
Lastly, these differentiators are all underpinned by the lowest cost of capital among REITs and unmatched scale that minimizes operating costs.
In closing, while 2021 was a year of many records, the bulk of the benefit from the current environment will be realized in the future, providing a clear tangible runway for sector-leading growth for many years to come.
We are confident our best years are still ahead of us.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, Chief Executive Officer and Csaba Sverha, Chief Financial Officer.
We had another record quarter with Q2 results that exceeded our guidance and support our longer-term optimism.
In fact, based on our current outlook, we are positioned to deliver another record quarter in Q3 with strength across all key areas of our business.
Revenue in the second quarter was a record $453.8 million, representing year-over-year as well as sequential growth.
We remain focused on driving efficiencies, which helped generate margins that were at their highest levels in over a year.
As a result, earnings per share also increased year-over-year and sequentially to a record $1.10.
Our second quarter played out largely as anticipated combined with an unexpected positive surprise from automotive programs, which represented the most significant driver of upside in the quarter.
In fact, automotive revenue grew more than 30% from the first quarter and more than doubled from a year ago.
We continued to see a recovery from traditional automotive customers and even stronger growth from new automotive programs such as LIDAR, which are beginning to contribute to our growth in a more meaningful way.
We are optimistic that this momentum in the automotive space will continue into the third quarter revenue.
Revenue from industrial lasers was approximately flat and was slightly better than expected.
We expect industrial laser revenue to improve in the third quarter and we remain optimistic about the longer-term potential for increased outsourcing from this market.
In optical communications, we had anticipated that continued telecom strength would offset continuing softness from datacom products that are deployed inside the data center.
In fact, we saw modest growth in optical communications revenue in the second quarter.
Datacom revenue did moderate as we anticipated.
However, this was more than offset by stronger telecom revenue.
We are optimistic that datacom revenue will show an improvement in the third quarter and that both datacom and telecom revenue should increase sequentially.
Part of our telecom growth was driven by our optical transport systems program at Cisco, which we have discussed on past calls.
This transfer has been progressing very well and is ahead of plan.
We had been anticipating that the transfer would be largely complete by the end of our fourth quarter and we now believe we are nearly a full quarter ahead of expectations.
This faster ramp will also contribute to our anticipated growth in optical communications revenue in the third quarter.
Due to the combination of the earlier Cisco ramp, growth from new automotive customers, and continuing optimism as we execute on our strategy, we are advancing our plans to expand our manufacturing footprint.
We recently broke ground on a new 1 million square foot building at our campus in Chonburi, Thailand.
This is twice the size of our originally contemplated expansion reflecting confidence in our ability to further scale our business over the longer-term.
This expansion will roughly triple our footprint in Chonburi and will increase our global footprint by approximately 50% to 3 million square feet, providing us with considerable capacity to serve our anticipated growth.
We expect construction to take approximately 1.5 years, which means we could start to see revenue from this facility in approximately two years.
To summarize, we are very pleased that our second quarter represented record revenue and earnings with results that once again exceeded our guidance.
Our continual focus on efficiency helped produce improvements in gross margin and operating margin in the quarter.
As we continue to expand on our market leadership, we are optimistic that Q3 will be another record-breaking quarter for the company and we believe that growth from new products and programs will continue to demonstrate the success of our growth strategy as we look ahead.
We were excited to ...
...gig products saw a decline as faster data rate products saw very significant growth.
100-gig revenue of $128.2 million was down 50% from Q1 while revenue from 400-gig and faster was $104.2 million, up 50% from last quarter and more than doubled from a year ago.
Looking at our non-optical communications business, automotive has grown to become the largest category with record revenue of $47 million in the second quarter, up 34% sequentially and more than 100% from a year ago.
As Seamus mentioned, new automotive programs which include LIDAR saw strong growth and we continue to be optimistic in this market.
Industrial laser revenue was $33.7 million, down about 1 percentage point from Q1.
Sensor revenue was stable at $2.8 million and other non-optical communications revenue was up 5% to $22.5 million.
Now turning to the details of our P&L.
Gross margin was 12.1%, up from 12% in the prior quarter.
This improvement was the result of our ongoing focus on manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $12.8 million or 2.8% of revenue.
This produced record operating income of $41.9 million or 9.2% of revenue.
Taxes in the second quarter were $1 million and our normalized effective tax rate was 3%.
Due to tax incentives at our Chonburi facility, which represents a growing portion of our profit, we now expect our effective tax rate to be about 4% for the year.
Non-GAAP net income was also a record at $41.5 million or $1.10 per share.
On a GAAP basis, net income was $35.4 million or $0.94 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
At the end of the second quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $488.6 million.
Operating cash flow was an inflow of $6.8 million, a decrease from the prior quarter primarily due to increased working capital in support of our strong revenue growth.
With capex of $10.1 million, free cash flow was an outflow of $3.3 million in the second quarter.
As Seamus mentioned, we have already broken ground on a new building at our Chonburi campus.
We expect incremental capex of approximately $50 million over an estimated 1.5-year construction period.
This investment is in alignment with our capital allocation strategy to invest in our longer-term growth.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 102,000 shares at an average price of $69.64 for a total cash outlay of $7.1 million.
These repurchases are also consistent with our capital allocation strategy.
At the end of the quarter, we had 93 [Phonetic] million remaining in our share repurchase program.
I would now like to turn to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.
We are optimistic that the positive trends we have been experiencing will continue in the third quarter and we expect revenue growth across all key categories.
We expect optical communication to grow sequentially.
Telecom growth is being driven by continued demand at higher data rate products combined with the earlier than expected ramping of our Cisco transfer program.
We also believe that datacom trends are becoming more positive and we anticipate modest growth in this area.
In non-optical communications, we also anticipate sequential growth.
We expect trends we have seen with new automotive programs will continue in the third quarter.
We also anticipate industrial laser revenue to increase sequentially as well.
We expect total revenue in the third quarter to be between $455 million and $475 million and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.17 per diluted share.
In summary, we are pleased to deliver a record second quarter result and are optimistic that the third quarter will produce another record performance.
We are excited with the growth from new programs in multiple areas coupled with our ability to expand margins.
We continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities that will further our position and driving growing revenue and profitability and enhance long-term shareholder value.

[/INST] # In Q2, the company achieved record revenue of $453.8 million, exceeding guidance and sequential growth. Automotive programs, particularly LIDAR, were the key growth drivers, with revenue doubling from a year ago. Industrial laser revenue remained steady, while optical communications experienced modest growth due to ongoing telecom strength offsetting datacom softness. Gross and operating margins improved, leading to record earnings per share of $1.10. Looking ahead to Q3, the company anticipates continued growth across all key areas, with total revenue estimated between $455 million and $475 million and non-GAAP earnings per share expected to range from $1.10 to $1.17.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Investors are urged to carefully review various disclosures made by NHI and its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors and other information disclosed in NHI's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
sec.gov or on NHI's website at www.
First and foremost, we are deeply grateful to all the front-line heroes that are tirelessly combating COVID-19 every day, despite the great risk to themselves and their families.
At NHI, we have long admired the senior housing and skilled nursing organizations and their staff that go to great lengths to keep our senior population safe and smiling.
Never has this been truer than today.
As a tribute, we have published some of our favorite caregiver and resident photos on the cover of our supplemental.
I hope you'll take a look.
Reputations are made during a crisis and I see operators making good decisions and taking action based on the principles they value, selflessly caring for their residents, nurturing a company culture that appreciates employees, and providing leadership and comfort to the employees and families of their residents.
I believe that when history reflects back on our industry and its practices during this time, there will be operators that are hailed as heroes.
That said, the challenges posed to our operators and our business by this pandemic are very real and it is difficult to say with any degree of accuracy, when we will return to a more normal operating environment.
Our operators have done an admirable job in limiting the spread of COVID-19.
As of May 5th, we had 192 active resident cases in 37 buildings.
To put that in some perspective, NHI has over 20,000 residents being cared for in all of our properties; so, less than 1%.
As our operators have implemented their protocols and taken appropriate actions to prevent or limit the spread of the virus, the result has been a significant downturn in inquiries, tours and move-ins.
This is having a negative impact on occupancy.
Kevin will give details on that later.
On the cost side of the equation, it should not surprise anyone that our operators are spending more, particularly for labor and PPE suppliers.
This is obviously pressuring our operators' margins and we are prepared to help them weather this storm, where and when necessary.
In April, NHI received 99.7% of its contractual rent, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which is in line with our expectations as we typically see a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on underlying lease terms.
As this pandemic unfolds, NHI is committed to transparency with the investment community.
To that end, we have enhanced occupancy disclosure on Bickford, Holiday and Senior Living Communities, which Kevin will touch on in more detail.
We were the first to detail the incident of COVID-19 in our communities and we will continue to provide weekly updates to our website as long as it is material.
But given that the scope and spread of COVID-19 is so uncertain, NHI has limited visibility to the financial impact it could cause.
And as a result, we are withdrawing our previously issued 2020 guidance.
Regarding the dividend, our Board is committed to our dividend policy and we will consider the August dividend in mid-June.
Beginning with our net income per diluted common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 we achieved $1.37 per share in earnings, inclusive of the gain on sale, compared to $0.83 per share for the same period in 2019.
Turning to our three FFO performance metrics for the first quarter, NAREIT FFO increased 3.1% to $1.35, normalized FFO increased 3.8% to $1.36 and adjusted FFO or AFFO increased 5.7% to $1.29.
Cash NOI is the metric we use to measure our performance.
We define cash NOI as GAAP revenue excluding straight-line rent, excluding escrow funds received from tenants, and excluding lease incentive and commitment fee amortizations.
For the quarter ending March 31, ...
...than five cases per community.
Bickford, which represents 17% of our annualized cash revenue, has seen a slight downtick in their move-out rates, but like much of the industry, their lead volume and tours were down more than 40%, which impacts the rate of new move-ins and occupancy.
Bickford's average occupancy on a same community basis was 87.3% in the first quarter and 86.6% for March.
Occupancy further declined in April by 130 basis points to 85.3%.
Our entrance fee communities have fared somewhat better as the resident turnover is much lower and the residents tend to be younger and healthier relative to other property types.
But they are not immune to the impact of COVID-19 and we have had four entrance fee communities with active resident cases as of our last weekly update, though like assisted living, the number of cases per community is limited.
Senior living communities, which represents 16% of our revenue had first quarter average occupancy of 80.4%, which ticked up slightly to 80.6% in March, but dropped to 79% in April as multiple entrance fee sales have been delayed due to the pandemic.
Our independent living communities have experienced a similar decline in leads, tours and move-ins as our assisted living operators.
The incidence of COVID-19 is relatively low in independent living and we had only two properties with active resident cases as of the last update.
Holiday Retirement, which represents 11% of our annualized cash revenue, had an average occupancy of 87.3% in the first quarter and 86.7% in March.
The April average occupancy declined by 170 basis points to 85%.
Bickford, SLC and Holiday represent approximately 56% of our senior housing units.
On a combined basis, those three saw average occupancy decline by 150 basis points from March to April, which is a good proxy for the rest of the senior housing portfolio.
The skilled nursing portfolio, which represents 26% of our annualized cash revenue is anchored by two excellent credits in NHC and The Ensign Group.
As of our last weekly update, 17 of our 78 SNFs had active resident cases.
We have seen more instances of outbreaks in some of our SNFs, which is expected given the higher acuity patient population and the more frequent contact caregivers have with the patients and residents.
Given the short average length of stay for Medicare patients and the temporary stay on elective procedures, SNF occupancies have generally declined by more than what we are seeing in senior housing.
However, there is more government financial support for the SNF industry.
NHC, which accounts for 12% of annualized cash revenue, has received funds from the Provider Relief Fund.
The company also expects to gain liquidity through the Medicare Accelerated Payment Program, the Medicare sequestration suspension, the payroll tax deferral and supplemental Medicaid payments.
Overall, we feel very comfortable with the credit in our SNF portfolio.
The pace of deals have stalled and everything indicates that this will continue for the next several months as true price discovery is near impossible to determine right now.
Our focus for the more immediate future is to continue funding existing commitments and extreme asset management by creatively providing guidance and assistance to our operators, if needed.
For the longer term, we continue to have conversations with existing and new operators and expect that our pipeline will be ready to support significant external growth when some normalcy returns to the market.
I do want to express my gratitude and admiration for all of our operators and the front-line heroes that accomplished truly amazing acts of courage and their residents and patients every day.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Eric.
Looking internally, you should know that NHI's management team and Board have deep experience managing during times of crisis.
I believe our balance sheet and liquidity, together with strong lender and market relationships, puts us on firm footing.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Earlier today, we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics.
Organic revenue is up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about three points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations.
This should be the last quarter of tough compares due to the pandemic, which our team has managed incredibly well, and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead.
Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9%, resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets.
Free cash flow was $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program, with a balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March.
Before handing over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and L3Harris as CEO.
It's been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees.
Harris grew from a small, niche, defense company to a leading mission solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion.
I'm especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders.
The performance culture and the work environment we created is really special, and we recently were recognized for it by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021 and earlier this year as a world's most admired company.
As you know, I'll continue as exec Chair of the Board for another year, working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO.
Last week, the independent directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement, indicating their confidence and mind in Chris' ability to lead this company going forward.
The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future.
And I'm excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris' leadership.
As you heard at our investor briefing last month, we're excited about the potential for the company and the value creation opportunities in front of us.
The strategic priorities we develop together, as shown on Slide three, are the foundations on which we'll deliver sustainable top line growth, steady margin expansion and robust free cash flow with industry-leading capital returns.
All areas where we showed great progress in the first quarter.
In terms of the top line, our Q1 results, coupled with the Biden administration's announcement that the defense budget will continue to grow in FY '22, about 1.5 points versus FY '21, reinforces our optimism for growth.
We are encouraged by the continued focus on National Security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments.
This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains.
We're watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies and international expansion, which stem from our R&D investment.
In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double digits, driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and Tactical radios.
Turning to revenue synergies.
We received eight new awards, maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million.
We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards ...
...nd Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.1%.
From responsive programs, including SDA tracking in HBTSS, driving high single-digit growth in space, as well as growth from the F-35 platform in mission avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel and cyber.
The strength was partially offset by program timing and electronic warfare.
Operating income was up 8.6%, and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management including R&D timing, operational excellence and higher pension income.
Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our Space and Electronic Warfare businesses.
Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single-digit growth in Tactical Communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization.
That also drove integrated vision solutions and global communication solutions up double digits.
Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments.
And within public safety, due to anticipated COVID-related impacts, they are now showing signs of stabilization.
Operating income was up 12%, and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost of management and integration benefits.
Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter.
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID-related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training.
High single-digit growth in mission networks from higher FAA volume paired with fusing and ordinates growth in defense aviation helped to offset these effects.
As we move past the first quarter, we're anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow.
Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses.
Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% is operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing and integration benefits more than offset COVID-related headwinds.
Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter.
Let's shift over to 2021 guidance.
We're off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance, and we're confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our top line growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter.
This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full year earnings per share guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts.
We'll provide a more comprehensive update later in the year.
In the interim, I'll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping and capital returns.
On margins, this strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%.
We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D, and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins.
Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance, and will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength.
On portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures net of buybacks from proceeds.
And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divestiture process, which could have a modest incremental earnings per share impact for the year.
Lastly, as highlighted at our investor briefing.
We have another significant year planned for capital returns.
Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion in net divestiture proceeds.
So overall, for 2021, we're confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Moreover, this quarter was once again included in certain disclosure prompted by COVID 19 business changes, which we will maintain as business operations further normalize.
They will be joined by other senior management during the Q&A portion of the call.
As we sit today, more than 18 months into the pandemic, the advantages of our focus on top tier tech and media markets on building and reinvesting in a state-of-the-art portfolio and are maintaining a strong balance sheet, have never been more evident.
In the 3rd quarter, we had a robust same property NOI growth as our office and studio tenants continue to pay rent and repay deferred rent.
We had another solid quarter of leasing activity on positive rent spreads.
Our stabilized lease percentage remains over 92% for making good progress on our remaining 2021 and our 2022 expirations.
We also successfully executed on multiple city related acquisitions all in spite of the pandemic headwinds.
There is definitely growing momentum around our tenants return to the office.
Some have already reiterated at least a portion of their employees over the last few months, while others are working toward either a year-end or early 2022 return.
The combination of record funding and fundraising by VCs, media can be spending of over $100 billion on content and significant national health and research spending has led to continued growth in hiring within the industries that drive demand for our assets, primarily tech media gaming and life science.
Across our markets, office leasing activity was notably elevated or showed healthy indicators such as a shift away from short-term renewals to new and expansion deals.
Sublease space contracted almost without exception as a result of tenants, both pulling listings or backfilling space.
We also saw a positive absorption around many of our metro areas in submarkets, and in most cases, for the first time since the pandemics onset.
We're obviously very focused on maintaining our leasing momentum as the office market recovers, which Mark is going to discuss further in a moment.
We also made several major announcements around the successful growth of our studio platform in the 3rd quarter.
We unveiled plans for Sunset Glenoaks, which will be the first purpose-built studio in Los Angeles area in more than 20 years growing our studio footprint in that market to a 1.5 million square feet in two stages.
We purchase a major site north of London to build Sunset Waltham Cross which will be a large scale purpose-built facility with 15 to 25 new stages and we expanded our services platform with the purchase of the transportation and logistics companies, Star Waggons and Zio Studio Services, enhancing our existing clients experience, while capturing significant additional production-related revenue.
Our combined expertise with Blackstone, across transactions operations and development, is second to none and we're poised to deliver and operate purpose-built next-generation studios that will attract premium productions for years to come and create exceptional value for our shareholders.
Finally earlier this month we received our GRESB 2021 real estate assessment results.
In addition to earning GRESB Green Star, the highest 5-star ratings for the 3rd year in a row, Hudson Pacific was named an office sector leader for the America's ranking first among the 22 companies in that category in terms of our development program.
In addition, we earned an A and ranked first among our US office peers in terms of public disclosure.
I'm incredibly proud of these results as it showcases both the dedication and the ingenuity of our team as well as the commitment to being a leader on ESG issues.
Our rent collections remained strong at 99% for our portfolio overall and 100% for office and studio tenants.
We've collected 100% of contractually deferred rents due to date and 57% of all contractual deferrals physical occupancy at our properties has stayed consistent over the last several mont...
...Palmas of $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to transaction related expenses of $0.2 million or $0.00 per diluted share and one-time debt extinguishment costs of $2.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share a year ago.
Third quarter NOI at our 45 consolidated same-store office properties increased 5.1% on a GAAP basis and increased 10.8% on a cash basis.
For our three same-store studio properties, NOI increased 49.8% on a GAAP basis and 45.5% on a cash basis.
Adjusting for the one-time prior period property tax reimbursement, the NOI would have increased by 27.9% on a GAAP basis and 22.8% on a cash basis.
Turning to the balance sheet.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $0.6 billion in liquidity with no material maturities until 2023 and average loan term of 4.6 years.
In August we refinanced the mortgage loan secured by our Hollywood media portfolio, accessing additional principal, while lowering the interest rate and extending the term, we replaced the prior $900 million loan bearing LIBOR plus 2.15% per annum, with a $1.1 billion loan bearing LIBOR plus 1.17% per annum.
The new loan has a 2-year term with 3 one-year extension options and is non-recourse except as to customary carve outs.
We also purchased $209.8 million of the new loan which bears interest at a weighted average rate of LIBOR plus 1.55% per annum.
Our Pro Rata net debt after this refinancing remained unchanged at $351 million.
In terms of our three studio related acquisitions completed during the quarter the Sunset Waltham Cross site in the U.K and Star Waggons and Zio Studio Services operating businesses.
we funded each with a combination of cash on hand and draws from our revolving credit facility.
On account of these three transactions and other corporate activity at the end of the third quarter, we have drawn $300 million under our revolving credit facility, leaving 300 million of undrawn capacity.
Third quarter AFFO grew significantly compared to the prior year, increasing by $10.1 million or over 21%.
By comparison, FFO increased by 9% or $6 million during the same period.
Again, this positive AFFO trend reflects the significant impact of normalizing lease costs and cash rent commencements on major leases, following the burn off of free rent.
Now I'll turn to guidance.
As always, our guidance excludes the impact of unannounced or speculative acquisitions, dispositions financings and capital market activity.
In addition, I'll remind everyone of potential COVID related impacts to our guidance including variance and evolving governmental mandates.
Clearly, uncertainty surrounding the pandemic makes projecting the remainder of the year difficult and we assume our guidance will be treated with a high degree of caution.
As noted many companies are still determining return to work requirements and the impact on space needs, because of this, for example, our guidance does not assume a material increase in parking and other related variable income.
Overall, we assume full occupancy and related revenues will not return to pre-COVID condition levels in 2021.
That said, we are narrowing full year and providing fourth quarter 2021 guidance in the range of $1.95 to $1.99 per diluted share, excluding specified items.
And $0.48 to $0.50 per diluted share excluding specified items respectively.
There are no specified items in connection with the fourth quarter guidance.
I'll point out that we incurred $1.4 million of prior period supplemental property tax expenses, as noted in the first and second quarter SEC filings.
Nearly all of which was offset by the prior period supplemental property tax reimbursement of $1.3 million received during the third quarter.
So we're not identifying as specified item related to prior period taxes for the purposes of 2021 full-year guidance.
We appreciate your continued support.
Stay healthy and safe and look forward to updating you next quarter.
And operator, with that, let's open the line for any questions.

 Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC.
At Labcorp, we continue to leverage innovation, science and technology to accelerate our strategy as we work to improve health and improve lives around the world.
We serve as a trusted source of health information that helps customers advance healthcare and guide medical decisions.
At the same time, we've remained focused on helping the world through the pandemic.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong results.
Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.82, and free cash flow was $650 million.
As a result of our strong performance and our improved outlook, we're raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.
Glenn will cover those in more detail in a few minutes.
The Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well with 10% and 22% growth, respectively.
We saw consistent recovery across both businesses.
In Diagnostics, we experienced broad geographic recovery in our Base Business and across our testing portfolio.
Esoteric and routine testing demonstrated solid year-over-year growth for the quarter.
The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill for Drug Development remains strong at 1.34.
Drug Development continues to recover with nearly 85% of sites now open.
The business also saw decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year.
Now I'd like to turn to our ongoing role in the pandemic response.
Labcorp continues to support the fight against the pandemic in every way possible through both our diagnostic and our drug development capabilities.
We experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year.
Time to results for COVID test remains an average of one to two days, with results typically available within one day.
PCR testing volume averaged 85,000 per day in the quarter, up from 54,000 per day in the second quarter.
We averaged 114,000 tests per day in September, with volumes declining week-over-week since that time.
We will continue to break out COVID testing from Base Business revenue and volume as it remains difficult to forecast.
We will also continue to maintain high capacity levels to be prepared for potential future scenarios.
We also had another successful quarter of bringing new innovations to market.
Notably, we recently received Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit.
With flu season upon us, the kit offers a convenient way to test for both viruses.
This new offering will be available for adults and children ages two and over and no upfront cost for those who meet clinical guidelines.
In addition, we collaborated with AstraZeneca on both a COVID prevention and treatment trial of its new long-acting antibody combination.
In the trial, the investigational antibody combination demonstrated statistically significant benefit in preventing symptomatic COVID and in reducing severe COVID or death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID, promising milestones in the development of new treatments.
Also earlier this month, Merck filed for FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID in at-risk adults, a treatment that we supported through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials.
I'll now discuss progress on our strategy, and I'll start with oncology.
The OmniSeq integration is going as planned, and their leading pan-cancer diagnostic capabilities extend our portfolio of solutions in this area.
Additionally, we launched clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer.
As part of our efforts to address healthy equity -- health equity issues, we recently partnered with the Community Clinical Oncology Research...
... 19.9%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points.
This was partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its central lab business of 3.5% and divestitures of 0.3%.
Drug Development's Base Business benefited from broad-based growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic work.
Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 11.4% primarily driven by organic growth.
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $226 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $210 million or 16.9% last year.
The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings partially offset by lower COVID testing and higher personnel costs.
The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to lower COVID testing.
Excluding the impact from COVID testing, operating margins would have been up compared to last year.
For comparability to peers, Drug Development earnings exclude $36 million of expense related to the enterprise component of its bonus, which is included in unallocated corporate expense.
We expect full year margins to be up over 2020, which were up over 2019.
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.8 billion and 1.34, respectively.
During the quarter, orders were negatively impacted by approximately $150 million due to a significant scope change, which decreased the book-to-bill.
Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.4 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to last year.
We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2021, for the remainder of the year.
We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong third quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year.
We expect enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14% from prior guidance of 6.5% to 9%.
This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points.
This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 18.5% to 19.5%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 11% to down 6%.
We are raising our expectations for revenue to grow in Diagnostics by 8% to 10% from prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 2%.
This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 16% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is expected to be down 11% to down 6%.
We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 19.5% to 20.5% from prior guidance of 17% to 19%.
Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 170 basis points.
This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 21.5% to 22.5%.
Given the improved top line growth expectations, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $26 to $28, up from prior guidance of $21.5 to $25.
Free cash flow is now expected to be between $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion.
For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 third quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results.
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance.
We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our Base Business.
We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the remainder of the year.
We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs.
Operator, we will now take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'll now discuss the financial results.
We reported revenue of $230.1 million during the first quarter of 2021, which represents an increase of 17.1%, compared to $196.6 million during the first quarter of 2020.
The increase was primarily the result of increased demand for our products across all product lines and operating segments.
We reported net income of $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the three months ended January 31, 2021, compared to $10,000 or $0.00 per diluted share during the three months ended January 31, 2020.
The increase in net income was somewhat offset by a $6.7 million increase in SG&A during the quarter, $4.6 million of which was related to the valuation of our stock-based comp awards, mainly due to an increase in our stock price, and $1.6 million of which was due to higher medical claims.
On an adjusted basis, net income increased to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.2 million or $0.04 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2020.
The adjustments being made to earnings per share are for restructuring charges, certain executive severance charges, loss on the sale of plant, accelerated D&A, foreign currency transaction impacts and transaction and advisory fees.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter increased by 55.4% to $24.3 million, compared to $15.7 million during the same period of last year.
The increase is largely due to operating leverage from higher volumes.
From a margin standpoint, this increase represents adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Cash used for operating activities was $3.4 million during the three months ended January 31, 2021, and compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2020.
While our free cash flow was negative, this is typical for the first quarter of each year, and we did show improvement compared to last year.
In fact, we did not need to borrow on our revolver during the quarter and still managed to both repay $5 million in bank debt and repurchase approximately $1.9 million of our stock.
Our balance sheet is strong, our liquidity position is solid, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA is unchanged at 0.6 times as of January 31, 2021.
We will remain focused on managing working capital and generating cash as the year progresses.
We will also continue to be opportunistic with respect to repurchasing our stock.
Based on our strong first-quarter results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year and now expect approximately 12% sales growth in our North American fenestration segment, approximately 5% sales growth in our North American cabinet components segment and approximately 22% sales growth in our European fenestration segment.
We're now comfortable providing the following full-year 2021 guidance: Net sales of $945 million to $965 million; adjusted EBITDA of $112 million to $122 million; depreciation of approximately $33 million; amortization of approximately $14 million; SG&A of approximately $105 million.
Note that this is higher than previously expected due to an increase in stock-based comp expense and more normalized medical costs; interest expense of $3 million to $4 million; a tax rate of 26% to 27%; capex of about $30 million; and then free cash flow of approximately $60 million.
If you adjust for the expected increase in SG&A, the implied incremental adjusted EBITDA margin is in the mid-20% range.
So we feel it would be necessary to provide some direction on a quarterly basis.
From a cadence perspective for Q2, on a consolidated basis, we expect net sales to be up approximately 25% year over year.
We believe the strongest revenue growth and margin expansion in Q2 will likely come from our European fenestration segment, since our plants in the U.K. were shut down in March of last year and didn't come back online comp...
...often a lag depending on the contract, anywhere from 30 to 90 days.
We do not have these contractual pass-throughs in Europe and the U.K. So our ability to pass on any increases through price becomes more important.
And for the most part, we've been very successful in doing just that.
Another current headwind is the availability of labor.
Company wide, we have approximately 400 open positions, which equates to roughly 10% of our global workforce.
This is an issue that is not unique to Quanex, and it's impacting manufacturing operations in many different markets and industries.
In some of our plants, this issue has resulted in high levels of overtime, extended lead times and even customer allocations in some limited circumstances.
I will now provide my comments on performance by segment for our fiscal first quarter.
And as a general statement, results were outstanding in each of these operating segments.
Our North American fenestration segment generated revenue of $128.1 million in Q1, which was $17.7 million or approximately 16% higher than prior-year Q1.
Strong demand across all product lines, share gains in our screens business and increased capacity utilization on our vinyl extrusion assets, all contributed to the above market performance.
Adjusted EBITDA of $16.4 million in this segment was $7.7 million or approximately 88% higher than prior-year Q1.
Volume-related operating leverage, the implementation of annual pricing adjustments, operational improvements and lower SG&A, all contributed to the improved performance year over year.
Our European fenestration segment generated revenue of $49.1 million in the first quarter, which is $12.3 million or approximately 34% higher than prior year.
Excluding foreign exchange impact, this would equate to an increase of approximately 28%.
and Continental Europe remains strong.
Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million, resulted in margin expansion of approximately 660 basis points year over year.
Volume-related impacts, timing of pricing actions and operational improvements more than offset inflationary pressure toward the end of the quarter.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $54 million in Q1, which was $4 million or approximately 8% better than prior year.
Demand for our cabinet components products was solid throughout the quarter as the market continued to see strength in new construction and R&R.
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 million in this segment which represents margin expansion of approximately 330 basis points compared to prior year.
Increased volume and benefits realized from new assets put into service last year were the primary drivers of improvements in the quarter.
Unallocated corporate and other costs were $6 million for the quarter, which is $5.4 million higher than prior year.
As Scott mentioned, the primary drivers of this increase were stock-based compensation expense related to share price appreciation, along with higher medical expenses, as our employees have started to feel more comfortable going back to their doctors.
It is also worth noting that we realized the benefit for medical cost in Q1 of last year.
As I mentioned earlier, we remain focused on operational excellence, cash flow optimization and improving return on invested capital throughout all segments of our business.
Our continued progress on these fronts is driving results and has allowed us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down debt further during a quarter where we have historically been a net borrower.
In summary, macro data points for our business are positive.
We are executing on our plan and performing well from an operational standpoint, and our orders remain strong.
As such, on a consolidated basis, we are confident in our ability to deliver low double-digit revenue growth this year while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 12% range, despite the increasing inflationary pressures.
And with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Actual results may differ materially from those made or implied in such statements, which speak only as the date they are made and which we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise.
Our Chairman and CEO, Clarence Smith, will now give you an update on our results, and then our President, Steve Burdette, will provide additional commentary about our business.
We're very pleased with the results of the first quarter and I'm encouraged with the continuing momentum that we're seeing with increased written sales, higher traffic and higher closing rates and average tickets.
Even though our undelivered backlog is up almost 4 times last year, our current incoming orders are continuing at the elevated pace we have seen since January.
We have not seen a slowing of orders or significantly higher cancellation rates even with the longer wait times for furniture.
While we do not know how long we will see these dramatic increases in incoming orders, we believe that the importance and the value of the home has risen dramatically in the past year.
We believe this trend will continue for 2021 because of the large backlog of orders, the very strong housing market, the government cash subsidies and the increased demand for furniture and other home related products.
We also believe that the elevated importance of home is a longer-term sustainable trend in America.
Our supply merchandising and distribution teams have been tirelessly working with our suppliers and shippers to bring in the product to fill orders and reduce our record backlog.
The delays in shipping challenges are well-known now, but they are well beyond anything that our industry has experienced.
We're planning to increase our inventories as the production and product flow improves and are investing in additional warehouse capacities in our distribution network.
We opened a new store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina this past quarter.
And are excited to open a design-oriented store in the villages in Central Florida this summer.
We expect to open a third store in Northeast Austin, Texas later this year.
We believe there are a number of good additional markets that we can serve within our distribution footprint and are actively investigating and pursuing new store opportunities.
We're very excited about the rollout of a major new multimedia marketing campaign in May, which we believe will more clearly separate Havertys from our competitors and raise the bar on service, quality furniture and design.
We'll be sharing more on the campaign early next month.
I'd like to provide an update on our operations during the quarter, specifically, our supply chain efforts as well as our distribution, home delivery and service areas.
Our supply chain team faced many headwinds during the first quarter, which included availability of container capacity as we approach Chinese New Year was difficult.
Container freight costs were unreliable as we face pricing surcharges due to scarcity.
We experienced port delays, especially at LA on some of our inbound product of up to three weeks.
February's winter storm impact to our Dallas distribution center caused us to close receiving operations for one week.
The same storm impacted two of the main chemical manufacturers for our foam suppliers, which caused our upholstery and bedding vendors to see further delays in their production.
And finally, the Suez Canal situation caused some additional delays for products arriving in the early part of the second quarter.
Even with all these headwinds, we were able to receive approximately 10% more product in Q1 versus Q4.
We expect that we will be able to match or exceed the same flow of product in Q2.
We are still experiencing some delays with container availability in the early part of Q2.
However, we have been able to secure our new contracts with our freight carriers, which will bring stability to our freight cost.
Also, the flow of foam should resume back to normal production by the middle of May, which will ...
...ndustries in this economy.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the results of our operations in the first quarter of this year.
I appreciate the efforts of the entire Havertys team as well as our vendor partners that made it happen.
And looking at our financial results for the quarter.
In the first quarter of 2021, delivered sales were $236.5 million, a 31.8% increase over the prior year quarter.
If you recall, our retail operations were closed in the last two weeks of the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total written sales for the first quarter of 2020 were up 54.5% over the prior year period.
Comparable store sales were up 11.5% over the prior year period.
This includes stores that were open for a full month in both periods, so March is excluded.
Our gross profit margin increased 160 basis points from 55.5% to 57.1% due to better merchandising, price and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.
These improvements were partially offset by an increase in our LIFO reserve as we continue to see increased freight and product costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.2 million or 12.5% to $109.8 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.
However, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined 800 basis points to 46.4% from 54.4%.
As demonstrated in the past two quarters, our financial model has substantial operating leverage at these sales levels.
Income before income tax has increased $23.1 million to $25.4 million.
Our tax expense was $6 million in the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.5%.
The primary difference in the effective rate and the statutory rate is due to the state income taxes and the tax benefit from vested stock awards.
Net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $19.4 million or $1.04 per diluted share on our common stock compared to net income of $1.8 million or $0.09 per share in the comparable quarter of last year.
Now looking at our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, our inventories were $103.6 million, which was up $13.7 million over the December 31, 2020 balance and down $6.9 million versus the first quarter of last year's balance.
At the end of the first quarter, our customer deposits were $104.7 million, which was up $18.5 million from the December 31, 2020 balance, and up $78.6 million versus the Q1 2020 balance.
We ended the quarter with $210 million of cash and cash equivalents, and we have no funded debt on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of 2021.
Looking at some of the uses of our cash flow.
capex for the quarter was $4.7 million.
And we also paid $4 million of dividends during the first quarter of 2021.
During the first quarter, we did not purchase any common shares in our buyback program.
We currently have $16.8 million remaining under authorization for this program.
We expect our gross margins for 2021 to be between 56.5% and 57%.
We anticipate gross profit margins will be impacted by our current estimate of product and freight costs and changes in our LIFO reserve.
Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $265 million to $268 million range, a slight increase over our previous 2021 estimate due to rising benefit costs.
The variable type costs within SG&A for 2020 are expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 17.8%, a slight increase over the most recent quarter based on potential increases in selling and delivery costs.
Our planned capex for 2021 remains at $23 million, anticipated new replacement stores remodels and expansions account for $12.9 million, investments in our distribution network are expected to be $6.4 million, and investments in our information technology are expected to be approximately $3.7 million.
Our anticipated effective tax rate in 2021 is expected to be 24%.
This projection excludes the impact from vesting of stock awards and any potential new tax legislation.
This completes our commentary on the first quarter.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 results.
Our positive momentum continued with another quarter of solid results, despite the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compared to the prior year period, sales were up 14% from $401 million to 405 -- $455 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 206% from $0.17 per share to $0.52 per share.
Our sales to commercial customers increased 52% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%.
We are particularly pleased that our sequential growth from Q4, Q1 was 4%, notwithstanding the fact that our first quarter typically declines from our fourth quarter as a result of seasonality in our business.
Sequential growth in our commercial activities was 17%.
This improvement was driven by our parts businesses, which is an encouraging indicator of returning demand.
The strong performance in the quarter was also due to the robust demand for our airframe MRO services.
Notably, the significant majority of our MRO volume has been on standard maintenance work as opposed to catch-up work.
Our operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter on an adjusted basis up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.
For context, our margin this quarter was actually higher than 2 years ago prior to the pandemic even though our revenue was down $86 million or 16%.
This performance demonstrates the operating leverage that we have created over the last 18 months by optimizing our MRO operations, exiting underperforming activities and reducing indirect and overhead costs.
It was another strong quarter, as we generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations.
We also continue to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program.
Excluding the impact of that AR program, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operation was $26 million.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced several new business wins.
First, we announced an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation product.
This award reflects the power of our independent distribution offering to component OEMs as well as the strength of our balance sheet.
Second, we announced a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes.
Like our prior C40 aircraft delivery contract with the U.S. Marine Corps, this contract demonstrates the significant cost savings available to government customers by procuring in the aftermarket.
Finally, we announced an extension of our component support program with Volotea, a growing low cost Spanish carrier which reflects the market's continued demand for this offering and our ability to drive, lower operating costs with superior operating performance.
Before turning it over to Sean, I would like to comment on the critical role that AAR in the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
We had over a 150 people station in country primarily in support of our WASS program.
Over a 36 hour period, our WASS team transported approximately 2,000 U.S. embassy personnel to Kabul International Airport to support their evacuation from the country.
All of our employees subsequently departed the country safely as well and I'm exceptionally proud of our team support of state department personnel under very difficult circumstances.
Our sales in the quarter of $455.1 million were up 14% or $54.3 million year-over-year.
Sales inour Aviation Services segment were up 19.8% driven by recovery in our commercial markets.
Sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down $17.7 million, reflecting the divestiture of our Composites business and strong performance of the U.S. Air Force pallet contract in the prior year quarter.
Gross profit margin in the quarter was 14.2% versus 12.1% in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 16.1% versus 13% in the prior year quarter.
The significant improvement reflects the cost take out and efficiency initiatives we have implemented.
As the commercial market recovers, we would expect to continue to generate higher gross margins, given the fixed nature of some of our cost of sales and the higher margin nature of our parts business, which is not yet participated in the market recovery to the same degree as our maintenance business.
As we indicated during last quarter's call, one of our commercial programs contracts was terminated during the quarter.
We recognized $10 million of charges primarily related to this termination and an asset impairment.
SG&A expenses in the quarter were $49.3 million or 10.8% of sales excluding severance of about $1 million, this would have been closer to 10.6% of sales.
This is down from 11.3% in the year ago quarter and 11.2% in Q4.
As a reminder, last year's results had contemporary cost savings due to salary and benefit reductions that were in place through Q2 of last year.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.7 million compared to $1.6 million last year, driven by lower borrowings.
Average diluted share count for the quarter was $35.7 million versus $35 million for the prior year quarter.
With respect to Afghanistan, as we discussed on last quarter's call, we had in-country activity on 2 programs, our WASS program supporting the State Department and our C130 program supporting four Afghan Airforce aircraft.
In conjunction with the state department's exit from Afghanistan, we are winding down related activities and expect that to be completed later this quarter.
The C130 program is currently continuing with support of 2 of the 4 aircraft based in the UAE.
In total, our FY'21 sales in Afghanistan were $67 million, the margins on these activities were consistent with the overall WASS program, which we have described in the past as being high single-digit operating margin.
As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $17.5 million as we continue to reduce our rotables and inventory balances.
In addition, we reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $8.4 million in the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $80.2 million and net leverage of only 0.6 times.
Looking forward, we expect that demand for our MRO activities will remain strong as airlines continue to focus both on readiness to support the recovery in air travel and on preserving a healthy maintenance supply chain.
With respect to part supply, while we saw increasing levels of activity during the quarter, we expect stable performance in the near term as a result of the uncertainty created by the Delta variant.
On the government side, the exit from Afghanistan as well as the programs nearing natural completion points will have a near-term impact on our business.
However, our Department of Energy contract is an offsetting award that demonstrates the fundamental value proposition of our commercial best practices business model.
In addition, we continue to build a solid past performance history.
As such, we believe that over time, we remain in an excellent position to grow our government business through additional program wins and expansions of our current positions.
Based on these near term dynamics, we currently expect overall Q2 performance to be similar to Q1.
While there remains uncertainty over the timing of the recovery.
We are confident that a recovery will occur and we believe, we are exceptionally well positioned.
We have emerged from the crisis with an even stronger balance sheet, our government and commercial pipelines are full and the operating leverage we have created positions us to continue to drive further margin expansion.

An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings.
With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our strong quarter and outstanding results.
First off, the team delivered $400 million of core operating income on roughly $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%.
These results were primarily driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and of course, mobility, as customary for our first fiscal quarter.
And finally, it's worth noting that our team was able to accomplish all of this in spite of the chaotic global supply chain environment.
In summary, we delivered strong results, grew in key end markets, and successfully navigated a dynamic global supply chain, clearly demonstrating the power of Jabil by way of our scale, tools, team, and relationships.
In a few moments, both Mike and Mark will provide more details on the quarter, while also addressing our improved outlook for the year.
But before I hand it over, I'll pass along some thoughts from Jabil's procurement and supply chain team, as you may find it helpful when modeling our year.
In short, demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, an issue that has persisted since 2019.
That said, Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize our allocation and keep the factories in production to the best of our ability.
So far, we have been extremely successful.
As we move ahead, we anticipate continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated in our guidance similar to previous quarters.
We do expect some relief toward the back half of the fiscal year, but the general consensus is that demand will remain ahead of supply for the next six months.
As Adam just highlighted, Q1 was an exceptional quarter.
The team delivered strong results on three fronts: revenue, core operating income, and core diluted earnings per share.
Our results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end-market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team, along with lower tax and interest expense.
Net revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter.
GAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63.
Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%.
Core diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior-year quarter.
Now turning to our first quarter segment results on the next slide.
Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.7 billion, an increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis.
The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based, with strength across our healthcare, automotive, and mobility businesses.
Core margin for the segment came in at 5.4%.
Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.
The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad-based, with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi cap, and 5G wireless and cloud businesses.
Core margin for the segment was 3.8%, 40 basis points higher than the prior year, reflecting solid execution by the team.
Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.
In Q1, inventory days came in at 66 days, a decline of five days sequentially.
The management team continues to be fully...
...each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday.
I'd also like to recognize their hard work and tireless commitment, which drove solid results for our first fiscal quarter.
Not only did our team deliver a favorable first quarter, but the diversification of our business was fundamental to the results, with each sector having a material contribution in the solutions we offer our customers and with each sector having a material contribution to our financial results.
Specifically, the four sectors in our DMS segment focus on margins while offering reliable cash flows, while the four sectors in our EMS segment focus on cash flows, while offering reliable margins, a perfect complement as the well-diversified construct of Jabil continues to drive our execution.
If we dig a little deeper, we find secular trends embedded within certain sectors, secular markets where we now play and have a substantial presence.
We believe these markets will drive our growth, with the overwhelming majority of such growth occurring organically as we place our attention on secular opportunities, opportunities such as 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.
Furthermore, our commercial portfolio is intentional, and we think quite special.
Each slice of this pie harbors domain expertise, affording us an essential collection of valuable capabilities.
Although what's most impactful is the way in which we merge these capabilities with precision and speed as we serve our customers.
Our approach is further enhanced by seamless collaboration across the organization, combined with our unique Jabil structure.
And when done correctly, we simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands.
And we do so as we lean into a massive market, where things need to be built and supply chains need to be optimized.
One of the key outcomes of our approach is the fact that with each passing year, our results become less dependent on any single product or product family, which improves our resiliency, especially during times of macro disruption and cyclical demand.
I'll now take you through an update to our fiscal '22 financial plan where you'll see the continued earnings power of the company.
We've increased core earnings per share to $6.55 for the year, up $0.20 from our September outlook.
We've also increased revenue to $31.8 billion, up from our initial guide of $31.5 billion.
In addition, we're committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million, while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year as we navigate this challenging environment.
In concert with these strong numbers, please note that our path forward is well understood throughout the company and what needs to be done remains crystal clear.
Quite simply, what we're doing is working a positive testament on how our team is managing the business.
Moving on from the financials, I'd like to talk about purpose.
At Jabil, purpose serves as our guidepost.
When we think about purpose, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and giving back to the many communities where we live.
Please note that these behaviors, as displayed by our team, are exceptional.
In closing, our improvement is steady and our strategy is consistent.
And as a team, we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to those we serve.
All in all, I feel good about where we've been, but I feel even better about where we're going.
In simple terms, at Jabil, we build stuff, and we do so really, really well.
We also solve problems over and over again.
I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety as you care for one another.
To everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday.
Before we begin our Q&A session, I'd like to remind everyone on our call that we cannot address customer or product-specific questions.
Otherwise, we're now ready for your Q&A.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.
I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.
First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business.
We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year.
Second, we saw strong growth in all three technologies during the quarter.
In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment and video security and access control revenue was up 26%, driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings.
And in Command Center Software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing installed base and win new customers.
And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS.
Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion, up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates.
GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 26.3% of sales, up from 24.8%, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter.
The increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments.
Opex in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow.
Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year, while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year.
The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital, inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings.
Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, up $225 million compared with last year, and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year.
The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year.
Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of capex.
Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution.
And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envysion, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash.
Moving next to our segment results.
Q3 Products and System...
...ernational Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software.
We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries.
Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year, driven primarily by growth in North America.
Sequentially, backlog was up $144 million, also driven primarily by growth in North America.
Software and Services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year, driven by a $479 million increase in multiyear services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN over the last year.
Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America.
Products and SI backlog was up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning next to our outlook.
We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to prior guide of 9.5% to 10%.
And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share.
This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%.
It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5%, along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares.
And finally, we now expect full year opex to be $1.95 billion, inclusive of our two latest acquisitions, Openpath, and Envysion, and we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate.
First, our results for the quarter were outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment.
We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and earnings per share and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog.
Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the two segments.
In Products and SI, demand for both our LMR and video security remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog.
Supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business and in particularly, our PCR business as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3, and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4.
In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improved profitability.
In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment.
Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services.
And in software, while we now expect Command Center Software revenue growth to be low double digits, our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio.
Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned.
Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility.
We're expanding our relationships within our existing installed base to provide more software and services.
The customer funding is as good as I've seen it.
And our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions.
And while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in 2022.
[Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to our fiscal 2019 results.
Our performance was strong across all of our brands, particularly in our direct-to-consumer channels of distribution.
While we are benefiting from some favorable market conditions, the numbers that we delivered are the direct result of our team's ongoing efforts to navigate through the short-term challenges posed by the pandemic, while staying focused on our long-term strategic objective of delivering happiness to our customers.
Our excellent results are attributable to the strength of our brand portfolio and how we communicate our aspirational upbeat brand messages through beautiful inventory, differentiated products and exceptional customer experiences.
To deliver superior customer experience in today's market, we need to stay focused on our long-term North Star Objective of continuing to improve our customer centric, digitally driven, seamless, cross channel shopping experience, with an emphasis on mobile.
We continue to invest heavily in further improving the customer experience, with enhancements to our mobile apps, search engine optimization, customer data and insights, customer service and much more.
The boundaries between our retail and e-commerce businesses are becoming increasingly blurry.
We recognize that an ever-growing number of customer journeys to purchase, include both physical and digital elements.
Most consumers no longer distinguish between the relationship with the digital aspect of the brand and their physical relationship with our brands, they simply think of their relationship with our brands.
They want and expect to be able to mix and match digital and physical elements at will.
We are determined to fulfill this desire and continue to invest in the people, processes and technology, that will allow us to do so.
We have talked many times about our ability to ship from store, as an example of the blending of these two channels.
We have also routed capabilities, such as drive-to-store digital marketing; buy online, pickup in store; reserve online, pickup in store; virtual shopping appointments; and cross-channel customer service, to better meet the needs of our customers.
The better we are at providing a truly seamless omnichannel experience, the better our customers' overall experience will be, which will ultimately result in increased brand loyalty, and a stronger business over the long term.
Our team's relentless focus on improving our customer experience is evident in our numbers, which exceeded 2019 levels.
During the second quarter, our combine to direct-to-consumer, full price store and e-commerce comp grew by an impressive 22% compared to 2019 with 15% growth in our biggest brand, Tommy Bahama and a remarkable 31% growth in Lilly Pulitzer.
Growth in our direct-to-consumer channel was led by our highly profitable e-commerce business, which grew by 49% over the second quarter of 2019.
In addition to the impressive top line growth, we were able to simultaneously expand our e-commerce gross margin.
Our e-commerce business has been enhanced by our ship from store capability, which allows us to leverage inventories located in stores, to serve the e-commerce demand, as well as demand from other stores.
For the year, we expect our total e-commerce business to be roughly a third of consolidated sales, compared to 23% in fiscal 2019.
While e-commerce is our fastest growing channel, physical stores remain an incredibly important part of our direct-to-consumer business.
In certain instances, there is no substitute for the personal interaction and high level of service that we are able to provide in stores.
Our retail stores grew top line during the quarter, modestly over 2019 levels, despite lower traffic with sequential improvement through the second quarter across all regions of the country.
As we did in e-commerce, we were also able to expand retail store gross margins during t...
...l operating groups.
Our business is well supported by our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow from operations.
Our liquidity position is strong with $180 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at the end of the second quarter.
Cash flow remains very strong.
In the first half of 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $149 million compared to $24 million in the first half of 2020.
On a FIFO basis, inventory decreased 34% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding Lanier Apparel, which we are exiting, FIFO inventory decreased 26% as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each lowered inventory levels year-over-year, conservative purchases of seasonal inventory and higher than expected first half sales.
Ongoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems were also contributing to a more efficient use of inventory.
On a LIFO basis, inventory decreased 48%, and excluding Lanier Apparel, decreased 39% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Our outlook for the back half of the year reflects our expectation of strength in our full price direct-to-consumer business.
We expect full price direct-to-consumer sales growth and consolidated gross margin expansion over 2019.
While we have raised our outlook for the second half, year-over-year improvement in our full price direct business is expected to be partially offset by a handful of specific headwinds in the back half of the fiscal year.
The strong first half full price sales has left us with less inventory for our second half clearance events, including an expected $15 million reduction in Lilly Pulitzer's third quarter flash clearance sale, compared to 2019.
In addition, initial spring wholesale shipments, which have historically shipped in the fourth quarter, are likely to ship in the first quarter of 2022, due to supply chain delays.
Finally, the exit of Lanier Apparel is expected to impact revenue in both the third and fourth quarters.
We expect sales from Lanier Apparel to be approximately $25 million lower than 2019's third quarter, and $20 million lower than 2019's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we now expect sales in a range of $1.085 billion to $1.105 billion, as compared to sales of $1.12 billion in 2019.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $6.45 and $6.70, a significant increase from our previous guidance.
This compares to earnings of $4.32 per share on an adjusted basis in 2019.
For the full year, sales from Lanier Apparel are expected to be $25 million in 2021 compared to $95 million in 2019.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be between $220 million and $230 million, compared to sales of $241 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect earnings of $0.20 to $0.30 per share on an adjusted basis compared to earnings of $0.10 per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2019.
Our outlook includes strong quarter-to-date results, with August as the most impactful month of the quarter in 2021.
The company's effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 23%.
We continue to support our business in fiscal 2021 with investments for future growth.
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $40 million in fiscal 2021, as we focus on technology related to digital marketing, customer service, mobile enhancements and improve distribution.
In addition, we will be investing in additional brick-and-mortar locations with our newest Marlin Bar at Town Square in Las Vegas slated to open tomorrow.
This Marlin Bar is replacing the recently closed full service restaurant in the same center.
Finally, we are proud of our long history of returning value to our shareholders through dividends, which we have paid every quarter since going public in 1960.
This quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share.

You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR.
We concluded 2020 with the best earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history.
Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%.
Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%.
For the full year 2020, GAAP operating margin increased slightly.
Free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million.
It is worth emphasizing that full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of our businesses.
In fact, we received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog.
Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14 times sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion.
While it's still early in 2021, we're expecting continuing recovery in our commercial businesses as well as growth in our government businesses.
In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment.
Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021.
Of course, the largely pre-COVID comparison in the first quarter will be the most difficult with revenue relatively flat.
Finally, I want to comment on the FLIR acquisition.
We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging.
We believed then and we believe now that our infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary.
As both companies evolved, we've grown to be even more complementary.
For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business.
Perhaps more importantly, each company exited unattractive businesses, Teledyne in 2011 and FLIR in 2018.
While our respective sensing technologies and market segments are different, the fundamental desire of our end customers is an image or even better, information.
This is true for extra imaging, infrared imaging, industrial machine vision and even our underwater marine sonar imaging and software businesses.
In other words, there is similarity and synergy in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning and other related technologies across each of our organizations.
I will conclude by noting that for 21 years, Teledyne has consistently and predictably compounded earnings and cash flow, and 2020 was no different.
Nevertheless, I have never been more excited about Teledyne's future than I am today with the pending acquisition of FLIR.
Al will now comment on the performance of our four business segments.
In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales decreased 6.2% when compared with last year.
Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year.
However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter.
Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as wastewater samplers increased.
However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines and sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million.
Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019.
In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%.
Now turning to the Digital Imaging segment.
Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications.
GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record.
Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb.
The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges.
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services.
Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year.
I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter, not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook.
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared with cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019.
Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019.
Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019.
We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%.
Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019.
Turning to our outlook.
Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share.
And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45.
In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs.
The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%.
In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.
I will now pass the call back to Robert.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Also on the call are Brian McDade, chief financial officer; and Adam Reuille, chief accounting officer.
For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect that request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone the opportunity to ask question and the opportunity to participate.
I'm pleased to report that our business has significantly improved after having addressed the impacts from COVID-19, including the restrictive governmental orders that have forced us to shut down, as well as reduce our operating capacity.
I'm pleased to report our continued improvement in our profitability and cash flow generated for the first quarter.
First-quarter funds from operation was $934 million or $2.48 per share.
FFO increased approximately $150 million or $0.31 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Our international operations continued to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions.
And in fact, the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $0.08 per share compared to our expectations given the closures that have occurred internationally.
We also recorded additional COVID impacts in the first quarter of approximately $0.07 per share from -- based upon basically domestic rent abatements and uncollectible rents.
We generated $875 million in cash from operations in the quarter, which was an increase of 18% compared to the prior-year period.
We collected over 95% of our net billed rents for the first quarter and our in-line tenant collections are back to pre-COVID levels in the approximate 98% range.
Our operating metrics in the period were as follows: mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 90.8%, down 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
This 50-basis-point decline for the quarter is approximately 75% -- 75 basis points less than the average historical seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.
Average base rents was $56.07, up 60 basis points year over year.
Leasing spreads declined for the 12 -- trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals that have fallen out, the spread calculation that have resulted in an increase to the average closing rate by approximately $8 per square foot for the trailing 12 months.
Pricing continues to improve with the average opening rate per square foot for the trailing 12 months of approximately $60 per foot.
And as you can see in the lease expiration schedule included in our supplemental, our expiring rents for the next few years are less than $60 per square foot.
Keep in mind that the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for variable lease income based on sales.
In certain circumstances in addressing tenant COVID negotiations last year, we, in certain cases, agreed to lower our initial base rent in exchange for lower unnatural sales breakpoints, allowing us to participate in the improved sales performance as the economy recovers.
Now we think that will end up being a very smart move on our behalf.
Those deals are included in the average opening rate at the lower base minimum rent and does not include our estimation of what the percentage rent could be, and we'll, obviously, believe those contributions in time will add to our cash flow.
Leasing momentum has continued across our portfolio.
We signed 1,100 leases for approximately 4.4 million square feet, and we have significant number of leases in our pipeline, our leasing volume in both number of leases in square feet was greater than the volume in each of the first quarter of 2020 and 2019.
The improving domestic economic environment, shopper sentiment, have increased shopper foot traffic and sales across our portfolio.
As I mentioned, increased in traffic for our open air and suburban centers has been very encouraging and retail sales continue to improve across the portfolio with higher sales volumes in March compared to 2019 levels.
We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, our second outlet in the United Kingdom in early April.
This was behind schedule, was supposed to open in the fall of 2020 but was delayed due to COVID restrictions.
We're pleased that this has now been lifted and we're now able to open and serve the shoppers.
During the first quarter, we started construction of our fifth premium outlet in South Korea.
We're excited about that opportunity.
And hopefully by now, with respect to our brand and retailer investments, you've seen that we've been able to add significant value there.
Our global brands within SPARC outperformed their plans in March and April on both sales and gross margin, led by Forever 21 and Aéropostale.
For the two months combined, SPARC outperformed the sales plan by more than $135 million and our gross margin plan by more than $75 million.
And we're also very pleased with the JCPenney early results.
They continue to be above our plan.
Our company's liquidity position at Penney is strong at $1.2 billion, and balance sheet is in very good shape with leverage of less than 1.2 times net debt to projected EBITDA.
We continue to add new brands to the JCPenney portfolio, and we expect growth to be our focus going forward.
Just a quick update on Taubman, we're very pleased with our partnership and the results in the first quarter.
Our teams have collectively shared and implemented many best practices and are adding value to the assets.
We expect to step up redevelopment plans with mixed-use opportunities throughout their TRG portfolio.
Capital markets, very similar to what we always do.
We completed $1.5 billion senior note offering at 1.96%, weighted average term of 8.4 years.
We also completed a EUR 750 million note, shouldn't say dollar, at one and one-eighths percent coupon at a term of 12 years.
We used those proceeds to completely repay the $2 billion unsecured term facility associated with the Taubman deal, as well as pay off our $550 million senior notes.
We've also refinanced six mortgages for $1.3 billion, our share of which is $589 million at an average interest rate of 3.36%.
That market is continuing to improve.
And at the end of the quarter, with all this activity, we have $8.4 billion of liquidity, consisting of $6.9 billion available on our credit facility; $1.5 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash.
And reminder, that is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper outstanding at quarter end.
We paid $1.30 per share in cash, in terms of our dividend on April 23.
And then, finally, as you've seen, given our first-quarter results, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance from $9.50 to $9.75 per share to $9.70 to $9.80 per.
This is an increase of $0.20 per share at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top end of the range or a 13% -- or a $0.13 increase at midpoint and that represents a 6.5% to 7.6% growth rate compared to our 2020 results.
So in conclusion, pleased with the results, encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of sales, traffic, retail demand.
And we continue to continue to increase our performance and our Profitability.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Graham's Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Results.
We also have slides associated with the commentary that we are providing here today.
If you do not have the release or the slides, you can find them on the company's website at www.
We will then open the lines for Q&A.
These documents can be found on our website or at www.
I also want to point out that during today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance.
As Chris mentioned, we're starting on slide four.
It was very nice to operate in Q2 a normal capacity after running at approximately 50% capacity in Q1 due to COVID-19.
Q2 sales were $28 million, up from $21.6 million in Q2 of last year.
Sales in the defense, the Navy market were $9.4 million in the quarter.
In the quarter, we had a quick turn material order, which made up approximately half -- a little over half of the revenue in the Navy.
We expected this to occur in the quarter.
While it is not a repeatable type sale, it was not a surprise.
Year-to-date, defense sales were $12.9 million or 29% of sales.
This is slightly higher than we expect for the full year.
We would expect around 25% of our sales to be for the Navy for the full fiscal year.
The quarter also benefited from an acceleration of some work at one of our Asian subcontractors.
They had available capacity and pulled some work from Q3 into Q2.
Q2 net income was $2.7 million or $0.27 per share, up from $1.2 million or $0.12 per share last year.
Stronger revenue and margins drove the improvement.
Cash is still good at nearly $68 million.
Finally, orders in the quarter were $35 million, driven by strong international refining awards in Asia and defense in the United States.
Our backlog improved to $114.9 million.
The conversion of a portion of our backlog provides the foundation for our improved guidance for the fiscal year.
Moving on to slide five.
I discussed the sale detail on the last slide with the quarter at $28 million.
Sales in the second quarter was 62% domestic, 38% in international.
Last year's second quarter was 73% domestic, 27% international.
Gross profit in the quarter was -- increased to $7.7 million, up from $4.9 million last year, primarily due to volume.
Gross margins were 27.5%, up from 22.9%.
EBITDA margins were 14.2%, up from 7.8% in last year's second quarter.
And finally, net income was $2.7 million, up from $1.2 million last year.
On to slide six.
For the first half of fiscal 2021, sales were $44.7 million compared with $42.2 million in the first half of last year.
This increase was despite the challenging Q1 when our production capacity was at 50% due to COVID-19.
Year-to-date sales are 60% domestic, 40% international compared with 71% domestic and 29% international last year.
Gross profit was $9.3 million, slightly off the $9.7 million last year, and gross margins were down 20.7% versus 22.9% last year, again, impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter.
Year-to-date EBITDA margins were 4.9% versus 4.5% in the first half of last year, and net income was $900,000 or $0.09 per share, down from $1.3 million or $0.13 per share last year.
Again, the first quarter loss due to COVID-19 was substantial, but we have more than recovered that in the second quarter.
Finally, moving on to slide seven.
Cash is at $67.9 million, down from $73 million at the end of fiscal 2020, but this is simply timing of working capital namely accounts receivable and accounts payable.
We are expecting this to come back in the third quarter.
Our quarterly dividend remains firm at $0.11 a share.
Capital spending has been light in the first half of the year at $800,000 compared to $700,000 last year.
As we have seen in the last few years, our capital spending will increase in the second half of the year, and we still expect the total spend for the year to be between $2 million and $2.5 million.
Finally, as we continue to work on our acquisition pipeline and act...
...d and move from early stage activity to procurement stage.
We expect the next few quarters to be about building the pipeline.
We are seeing COVID having an impact in Asia as one large project in the bid pipeline that was teed up to be placed, in order to be placed, had to be postponed due to workforce impact from the disease.
We believe it will be activated again once the country has the spread of the disease back under control.
Our team in India, our team in China and those overseeing Southeast Asia point to COVID is on the rise again, resulting in slowing of activity along with heightened uncertainty.
In the Americas, it was quite slow for both revamp retrofit and also routine spare parts.
Refiners, they are focused on preserving cash right now and are postponing MRO or capital projects.
We don't see this picking up until demand recovers following having COVID under control.
Those projects that may proceed, we are carefully following.
On a positive note, an engineering-only order for a large crude oil refinery revamp was secured, that we hope proceeds within the next 12 months.
For that case, the refiner could fund only upfront engineering at this stage so that detailed layout is done, enabling the project to proceed quickly once it is ultimately released for fabrication.
If and when it proceeds into fabrication, we anticipate that a change order will exceed $5 million.
Crude oil below $40 a barrel and pandemic-driven global disruption have resulted in activity being pulled in by most national integrated and independent oil refiners.
Moving over to U.S. Navy.
Navy in particular and defense overall is active.
We have a solid pipeline of activity.
Some of it is for new components that we have not done before, while others are repeat components for upcoming vessels.
Submarine programs are vital for national defense and other strategic missions for our country.
There's terrific visibility into multiple year new vessel requirements that underpin this segment continuing to be strong.
We have identified and are pursuing $40 million to $60 million of opportunities for the Navy, and they should be placed with a selected vendor over the next nine months.
We have M&A target identification and development concentrated in the defense segment due to its strong long-term fundamentals.
As Jeff noted, relationships in certain cases were established prior to COVID, and we continue to nurture them with a combination of remote interactions along with selective visits.
Short cycle work is off 20% to 30%.
Crude oil refining and petrochemical markets are where the majority of spares revenue -- spare parts revenue was derived.
These markets, as I mentioned, are in cash preservation mode until the global economy is back on its feet and demand subsequently recovers.
On an upbeat note, there is step-up in short-cycle inquiries.
However, that has not translated into an improved order level just yet.
Chemicals and petrochemicals are also down.
Projects have been shelved or delayed.
The pandemic sent a demand shock that is not yet fully abated.
Getting COVID behind in most regions throughout the world is the catalyst for demand returning.
Let's now move on to slide 14.
Backlog is a healthy $115 million, split evenly between commercial and defense.
The staging of backlog or work in process already provides an ability to state guidance at this extraordinary time when many companies cannot.
60% to 65% of backlog is planned to convert during the next four quarters with approaching 40% of backlog planned to convert during the next two fiscal quarters.
Please go on to the next page.
As Jeff and Alan mentioned, we are updating our guidance.
We've increased the revenue range to between $93 million and $97 million, implying the second half should be between $48 million and $52 million for revenue.
Gross margin is expected to be between 21% and 23%.
SG&A spend between $17 million and $17.5 million.
And we're projecting the effective tax rate is approximately 22%.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 We have Scott Lauber, who's now our president and chief executive; Xia Liu, our chief financial officer; and Beth Straka, senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations.
This exceeded the upper end of our most recent guidance, which was $4.07 a share.
Our positive results were driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery in our region and our continued focus on operating efficiency.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong.
And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity.
I would also note that the earnings we're reporting today are quality earnings with no adjustments.
As you know, we've been very active in shaping the future of clean energy.
Looking back on 2021, we set some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions.
Across our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, all from a 2005 baseline.
In fact, by the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial and our plan calls for a complete exit from coal by the year 2035.
Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on achieving net-zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050.
Now we all recognize that advances in technology will be needed to decarbonize the economy by 2050.
And hydrogen, of course, could be a key player, a key part of the solution in the decades ahead.
To that end, we announced last week one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States.
We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our newer natural gas-powered units located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The project will be carried out this year, and the results will be shared across the industry to demonstrate how the use of hydrogen could materially reduce carbon emissions.
Switching gears now, we're driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest five-year plan in the company's history.
The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth.
One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2,400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next five years.
These renewable projects will serve the customers of our regulated utilities here in Wisconsin.
Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.
In summary, we believe we're poised to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer.
And now, let's take a brief look at the regional economy.
We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021 despite the prolonged pandemic.
The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate down at 2.8%; folks, that's a record low and more than a full percentage point below the national average.
Importantly, jobs in the manufacturing sectors across Wisconsin have returned to pre-pandemic levels.
And major economic development projects are moving full steam ahead.
HARIBO, the gummy bear company is now recruiting workers at its brand new campus in Pleasant Prairie.
Komatsu has begun relocating employees to its new state-of-the-art Milwaukee campus.
Milwaukee Tool's downtown office tower is set to begin operations this month, and we see more growth ahead.
For example, ABB, a global industrial and technology company; and Saputo, a leading dairy products company have announced plans for major expansions in our region.
And finally, you've heard the phrase: a rising tide lift all boats.
Well, I'm pleased to report that one of the most celebrated luxury boat makers in the world, Grand Craft Boats, is relocating its operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region.
You know, J. Lo, George Clooney, Robert Redford, they're among the high-profile clients of Grand Craft.
So it will be interesting t...
...0.10 compared to 2020.
First, weather added $0.04, mostly driven by colder winter weather conditions compared to 2020.
Second, continued economic recovery drove a $0.09 increase in earnings.
This reflected stronger weather-normalized electric sales, as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges.
Let me give you some highlights on our weather-normalized retail sales.
Overall, retail delivery of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% compared to 2020.
We saw a continued economic rebound in 2021 in our service territories.
Small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 4.4% from 2020, and large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 5.1%.
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat excluding gas used for power generation.
Lastly, rate relief and additional capital investment contributed $0.14 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M drove a $0.03 improvement.
These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.17 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a net $0.03 reduction from fuel costs and other items.
Overall, we added $0.10 year over year from utility operations.
Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company decreased $0.02 per share year over year.
The positive impact of additional capital investment was more than offset by two factors: a 2020 fourth quarter that benefited 2020 earnings and an impairment that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 on an investment outside of the ATC service territory.
This substantially wrote off all of the goodwill on the project.
Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in 2021.
This was mostly related to production tax credit from the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge wind farms.
Finally, we saw an $0.18 improvement in the corporate and other segment.
Lower interest expense contributed $0.07 year over year.
Also, we recognized a $0.04 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development.
The remaining positive variance related to improved rabbi trust performance and some favorable tax and other items.
In summary, we improved on our 2020 earnings by $0.32 per share.
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163 million.
The increase in cash earnings was more than offset by working capital requirements, mostly related to higher natural gas prices.
As we resume normal collection practices in the spring, we expect working capital to improve throughout the year.
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.4 billion in 2021.
This represents a $471 million decrease compared to 2020, due primarily to the timing of the in-service date of Thunderhead Wind Farm.
Turning now to financing activities.
We opportunistically refinanced over $450 million of holding company debt during the fourth quarter.
This reduced the average interest rate of these notes from 4.5% to 2.2%.
We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality.
Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contribution and the year-over-year increase in working capital, our FFO to debt was 15.7% in 2021.
Finally, let's look at our guidance for sales and earnings.
For weather-normalized sales in Wisconsin, we're expecting 0.5% growth this year in both our electric and natural gas businesses, continued growth after a very strong year.
In terms of 2022 earnings guidance, last year, we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter.
We project first quarter 2022 earnings to be in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.70 per share.
This forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
And as Gale stated, for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.29 to $4.33 per share.
Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.
Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America.
And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief -- Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share.
Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share.
Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019.
Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.
Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs.
In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share.
Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019.
Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019.
Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020.
These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.
Looking at the Packaging business.
EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin.
For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.
Demand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all-time records.
Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder mill and utilizing the Jackson mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand.
As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end.
The machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December.
Although as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost, we were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality.
In order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard...
...ges at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020.
The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020.
The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.
As they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company, not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction.
Without question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year.
However, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed.
Our manufacturing and sales organizations continued to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes.
Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company.
I'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years.
Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter.
This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.
As Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and we expect average export prices to move higher as well.
However, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year.
Seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs.
And we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber.
Finally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower although inflation-related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit.
Shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country.
And with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve.
There continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments.
This is true not only for the operation of our facilities but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers.
As a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter.
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions.
These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.
And with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Joining me virtually today, as we are all working from home, are Mary Hall, our CFO; Robert Traub, our General Counsel; and Shane Hostetter, our Head of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer.
We have slides for our conference call.
You can find them in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.
A great deal has changed in the world with the COVID-19 pandemic since our last quarter's conference call.
For us, our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers' needs.
All of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are meeting our customers' needs.
I am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continuing servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration, which has not missed a beat.
In our last conference call, we knew China was being impacted by COVID-19, which really started impacting us in February.
But in the second half of March, we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world.
And toward the end of March, many of our customers had significantly reduced production or shut down altogether, especially in the automotive sector.
Overall, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted our sales by about 4% in the first quarter.
We were also impacted by Boeing temporary halting the 737 MAX production, which impacted sales by approximately 1%.
These were the two main drivers of our volume decline in our pro forma comparisons.
We have gone through a customer-by-customer analysis to see what our gains and losses and market share were at the customer and product levels.
This analysis continues to show that we took share in the marketplace as we estimate total organic volume growth due to net share gains was approximately 2% in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year.
Concerning gross margins, you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker.
In the first quarter comparison, you can see this difference is only 0.5 percentage point.
This is indicative of our raw material savings from our integration starting to come through.
While crude was also decreasing during this period, we do not see any material benefits from this as of yet, as our raw material costs were relatively stable.
So overall, the first quarter results were somewhat better than expected when considering the COVID-19 impact.
Our first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to our integration savings, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition last quarter, and the additional cost control measures we put in place to combat the global effect of COVID-19 on our volumes.
This event has been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008.
Just like then, we took fast action to save cost in numerous ways.
Essentially, all discretionary expenses have been eliminated.
We stopped new hires, executive pay cuts were implemented, some positions were furloughed, and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30%.
And very importantly, we reviewed our integration's synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible.
We have now increased our guidance on synergy achievement.
For 2020, our new estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our previous estimate of $35 million.
And the total synergies that we estimate will be achieved by 2022 have been raised from $60 million to $75 million.
One question we have been asked about is if this pandemic has impacted our integration.
And the answer is that it really hasn't negatively impacted our integration in any way, especially in the timing.
I give our people a tremendous amount of credit for being able to do plant shutdowns, product manufacturing site transfers, and ERP implementations during these challenging work conditions that we...
...restructuring charges totaling about $10 million and a $38 million non-cash impairment charge in Q1 to reflect the writedown of our Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value.
These were recorded at fair value at close of the Combination on August 1, 2019 and tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019.
However, given the recent changes in business conditions as a result of COVID-19, we determined that these assets needed to be tested again and confirm their carrying value exceeded their current estimated fair value by approximately $38 million.
As we noted in our 10-Q, as business conditions evolve, we will continue to reevaluate all our long-lived assets as necessary.
In non-operating items, we reported a non-cash charge of $22.7 million for final settlement and termination of legacy Quaker's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, a process we previously disclosed.
The offset is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss account in the equity section of the balance sheet.
Concurrent with this termination, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million, subject to final adjustment.
Our reported effective tax rate was a benefit of 31.1% in Q1 2020 versus an expense of 26.8% in Q1 of last year.
Adjusting for all one-time charges and benefits, we estimate our ETR would have been 22% this Q1 and 24% in Q1 last year.
We currently expect our full-year ETR, excluding all one-time charges and benefits, to be between 22% and 24%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, due primarily to the additional shares issued in the Combination, partially offset by the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.
Sequentially, non-GAAP earnings per share is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019, which included Houghton and Norman Hay and the additional shares.
On Slide 9, we show the trend in pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which reached $239 million as of Q1, up from $234 million at the end of 2019.
This increase reflects the strong adjusted EBITDA performance in Q1 of $60 million, up 10% from pro forma Q1 last year of $55 million due to the inclusion of Norman Hay and the benefits of cost savings realized in the quarter from the Combination.
On Slide 10, we provide an update on our leverage and liquidity.
Please note that we drew down most of the available liquidity on our revolving credit facility in March in an abundance of caution as COVID-19 went global and created significant uncertainty and volatility in all global markets.
This drop was leverage neutral as the additional cash in our balance sheet is a direct offset to our debt.
In fact, our reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 3.40 times from our year-end level of 3.47 times as a result of good cash flow and the cost savings mentioned earlier.
Our bank covenant ratio also improved from about 2.94 at year-end to 2.76 at the end of this quarter per the definitions in our borrowing agreement.
We expect to continue to be in compliance with our bank covenants and we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times.
Our capital allocation decisions reflect these priorities, including an approximately 30% reduction in previously planned capex.
As you know, we have a very asset-light business model and we also expect a release of working capital at sales decline to generate good cash flow similar to the global crisis in 2008/2009.
Our cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates and was estimated at approximately 2.4% at March 31 versus about 3% at year-end.
As Mike mentioned, we're encouraged by the additional cost synergies realized to date and expected to be achieved overall.
The increase in expected realized synergies this year from $35 million to $53 million in addition to the cost reduction actions we have taken to address the global crisis and our history of generating good cash flow in downturn all give us confidence in our ability to weather this storm.

The company experienced a 4% sales decline from COVID-19 and a 1% decline due to Boeing's 737 MAX production halt, offset by a 2% organic volume growth due to gained market share. Despite a $38 million non-cash impairment charge, the company increased its estimated synergy achievement for 2020 to $53 million and for 2022 to $75 million. Quaker Chemical also reduced non-essential expenses, paused hiring, implemented pay cuts, and furloughed some positions to combat lower volumes. Additionally, the company reported a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38, impacted by additional shares issued in the combination, but up sequentially from $1.34 in Q4 2019. Despite the pandemic, Quaker Chemical's pro forma trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA increased to $239 million, and its net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio improved. The company remains optimistic about its ability to navigate the crisis due to realized cost synergies and a history of generating strong cash flow during downturns.</s>"

Earnings Call Transcript:
 Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.
Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.
Strong execution of NiSource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth and we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024, growth driven by our commitments to safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability.
As we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 Integrated Resource Plan identifies additional investment opportunities, while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 and it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways.
We are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings or NOEPS.
We are also initiating guidance for 2022 of a $1.42 to a $1.48 and that is consistent with our 5% to 7% near term growth commitment.
Our long-term diluted NOEPS guidance of 7% to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range and we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 as we shift to lower cost, clean and reliable generation.
Investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation.
The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals we solicited associated with the IRP.
Our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in Pennsylvania, a settlement filed in Kentucky and a proposed order in Maryland.
In addition, we filed a gas rate case in Indiana in September.
We achieved non-GAAP diluted NOEPS of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020.
Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the third quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9.
Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress.
Net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million.
Pending its decision next year from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, new rates would be effective in mid 2022.
NIPSCO filed a gas rate case on September 29th requesting a revenue increase of $115 million annually.
The case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service, while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements.
In Pennsylvania, an Administrative Law Judge issued a proposed order recommending that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the settlement in our rate case.
The settlement would increased revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective December 29th of this year.
The adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability and maintenance enhancements.
We expect the Commission's final order by mid-December.
In Kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case.
The settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure.
Columbia Gas of Maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on Friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to our request of approximately $4.8 million.
We expect a final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission in December.
Before we move on, I'd like to note the Co...
....
The IURC provided regulatory approval of the Indiana Crossroads II wind project on September 1st and with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of Schahfer Generating Station, have now received approval.
In addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen in emerging storage technologies.
It's important for us to gain a risk informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further decarbonization.
Before getting into the specific results, I'd just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of a $1.32 to a $1.36.
This new 2021 expectation also serves as the starting point for both our near-term and long-term commitment.
We have also initiated 2022 guidance of a $1.42 to a $1.48, which at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.
Turning to our third quarter 2021 results on Slide 4.
We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020.
The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments, offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment three-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year.
Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of CMA.
Operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the CMA sale, offset slightly by higher employee-related costs and outside services spending.
In our Electric segment, three-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020.
Net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased TDSIC revenues.
Operating expenses net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile.
Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.6 billion of which about $9.2 billion was long-term debt.
The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs.
As we know, last quarter, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021.
Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
As you can see on Slide 7, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.
Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan.
There are no changes to our plan since April's equity unit issuance.
I would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments.
as I mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments.
I would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an Investor Day during the first half of next year.
So please stay tuned.

Earnings Call Transcript:
 That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.
Let me start with the headlines for the quarter.
Organic sales increased 3% with good underlying momentum and benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19.
We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions.
We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders.
And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook.
Now let's look at the details of our results, starting with sales.
Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion.
That's up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates.
Volumes were up 2% and the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1%.
By segment, organic sales rose 10% in Consumer Tissue and 5% in Personal Care, but declined 15% in K-C Professional.
Mike will talk more about our top-line and our market share performance in just a few minutes.
Moving on to profitability.
Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.2%, up 40 basis points year-on-year.
Adjusted gross profit increased 2%.
We had excellent cost savings performance in the quarter.
Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs totaled $140 million, including continued strong productivity improvements.
Commodities were a benefit of $25 million in the quarter driven by pulp and other raw materials.
Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year that included incremental costs related to COVID-19.
Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a high single digit rate in the quarter.
Moving further down the P&L.
Between the lines spending was 18.9% of sales.
That's up 180 basis points and driven by a big step up in digital advertising.
G&A also increased including capability-building investments and higher incentive compensation expenses.
We expect between the lines spending will rise further sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Our SG&A spending is typically high in the fourth quarter and this year we'll also have project activities that were temporarily delayed because of COVID-19.
All in all, for the fourth quarter-for the third quarter, sorry, adjusted operating profit was down 6% and operating margin was 17.2%, down 130 basis points versus year ago.
By segment, operating margins were up in Consumer Tissue and Healthy and Personal Care.
K-C Professional margins were down significantly, including an approximate 600 basis-point drag from fixed costs under absorption.
On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 in the quarter, compared to $1.84 in the year-ago period.
Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency.
Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $559 million compared to $886 million in the year-ago quarter.
The decrease was as expected and driven by the timing of tax payments and higher working capital.
We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.
Third quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $560 million.
And for the full year, we expect the total will be $2.15 billion.
So let me now turn to the full year.
The overall headline is that we're raising our top and bottom-line outlook.
On the top-line, we now expect organic sales growth of 5% compared to our prior target of 4% to 5%.
Through nine months, organic sales are up nearly 6% and we expect a solid fourth quarter.
On average, we expect slightly less headwinds from currency rates than previously anticipated.
In addition, we'll begin consolidating the Softex Indonesia business into our results on November 1 on a one-month lag.
All in all, we expect net sales will grow 2% to 3% this year.
That's one point better than our previous estimate.
On the bottom-line, our new outlook is for adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.65.
That represents year-on-year growth of 9% to 11%.
Our prior outlook was ...
...on.
And New Leaf is off to a very good start.
In North American consumer tissue, organic sales increased to 11% and that reflects strong demand due to the COVID-19 work from home environment and strong momentum on Kleenex facial tissue.
Bathroom tissue shipments benefited from our efforts to restore customer inventory levels.
In the fourth quarter, we expect more benefit from those efforts and from people continuing to spend more time at home.
Our market share performance in North American consumer products was strong in the third quarter; shares were upper even in six of eight categories.
Turning to K-C Professional North America, organic sales declined 15%.
Sales were down about 35% in washroom products.
And as you'd expect, the category has been significantly impacted.
There are fewer people working in offices and lower levels of business activity, including in travel and lodging.
Sales were a bit better in September, but we're planning for only a modest near-term improvement in the environment.
On the other hand, KCP sales were up double digits in wipers, safety and other products.
Our efforts to expand our face mask business by leveraging our superior non-wovens technology is off to a good start.
We're also expanding our wipers line-up with Scott 24-Hour, which delivers long-lasting surface protection from bacteria.
Moving to D&E markets, organic sales were up 2% that was driven by 7% growth in Personal Care.
In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China, mid-single digits in both Latin America and Eastern Europe and strong double-digits in India.
Organic sales were down mid-single digits in ASEAN.
We also improved our market shares in many countries in the quarter.
And that includes Brazil, China, throughout Eastern Europe, India, and Peru.
While category conditions remain difficult in many D&E countries, government restrictions on social mobility and store operations have eased somewhat since the last quarter.
Finally, in developed markets, organic sales were up 3% driven by strong growth in consumer tissue.
Looking ahead, we're launching Kleenex Proactive Care in the UK and other markets in EMEA.
This lineup includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel, and face masks.
Now in terms of market share performance, we continue to make good progress.
We're on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track.
This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions.
Our capabilities are driving our results and our investments are working hard for us.
Through nine months, I'm very encouraged with our performance, how we're navigating this environment and how our teams are taking care of each other and our customers.
Before closing, I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition of Softex.
This transaction is a strong strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care in D&E markets.
Softex expands our presence in a high-growth market where we had limited exposure.
The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world, and that's projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade.
Our Softex team has built a strong business with deep local market knowledge, excellent brands and market positions and strong profitability.
This transaction improves our underlying growth prospects, and we're looking forward to leveraging our combined strengths in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market.
In conclusion, we're managing through the COVID environment safely and effectively.
We remain optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value.
We're investing in our brands and improving our market positions.
We are raising our full-year outlook and are on track to achieve excellent financial results.
And we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach as we execute K-C strategy 2022.

 We'll begin with a brief strategic overview from Randy, Mike will review the Title business, Chris will review F&G, and Tony will finish with a review of the financial highlights.
There is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of this pandemic.
Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.
It will also be available through phone replay beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today through November 12.
It is our goal to ensure the health and safety of our employees while maintaining the continuity and efficiency of our operations as we strive to meet our customers needs day in and day out.
We were able to accomplish these goals and achieve superior results in the third quarter while approximately 60% of our workforce continue to work remotely.
For the third quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million compared with $407 million in the year ago quarter and a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with an 18.6% in the third quarter of 2019, and our best since the third quarter of 2003.
While our financial results were robust, we also made strong gains advancing our technology initiatives, which are focused on improving the security, transparency and overall closing experience for FNF's customers.
Mike will go into this in more detail, but we believe that our unmatched national footprint and strong local market relationships provide FNF with a significant competitive advantage that we can further leverage with technology.
Turning to our acquisition of FGL Holdings, F&G continues to execute on its growth strategy, producing excellent sales results in the quarter while maintaining pricing discipline.
F&G's recent entrance into the bank and broker-dealer channel has surpassed expectations, and we continue to see strong momentum into the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, F&G's investment portfolio continues to perform well in the current environment.
Chris and his team also had success during the third quarter, streamlining F&G's operations as they entered into an agreement to sell F&G Reinsurance to a Aspida Holdings, a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation.
The rationale for this divestiture was largely tied to the tax advantage of this third-party offshore reinsurance platform, which was no longer available upon FNF's acquisition of F&G.
In connection with the transaction, F&G also entered into a mutually beneficial annuity flow reinsurance partnership.
The sale of F&G Reinsurance represents a terrific outcome for F&G, its clients, employees and FNF shareholders.
The transaction is expected to close prior to year-end.
Chris will go into more detail on F&G's third quarter results shortly.
Looking forward, we continue to be committed to creating meaningful long-term value for our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy.
Most recently, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, which reflects a fourth quarter dividend increase of 9%.
In conjunction with this announcement, we announced our plans for targeting $500 million in share repurchases based on market conditions over the course of the next 12 months.
As Randy mentioned, the third quarter was a record quarter for adjusted pre-tax title earnings and produced our best quarterly adjusted pre-tax title margin since the third quarter of 2003, as we benefited from the delayed spring selling season and sustained momentum in refinance.
For the third quarter, we generated adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million, a 30% increase over the third quarter of 2019.
Our adjusted pre-tax title margin was 21.2%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year quarter.
We had a 40% increase in direct orders closed, driven by an 87% increase in daily refinance orders closed and 8% increase in daily purchase orders closed offset by a 16% decrease in total commercial ...
... losses of only $17 million or six basis points of the total portfolio.
This is well below our product pricing assumption and demonstrates the portfolio is performing as expected.
We also remain confident in our capital position.
We came into the pandemic with a strong balance sheet, allowing us to effectively weather economic impacts while continuing to grow the business.
Year-to-date credit impairments have resulted in a modest 5-point decrease in our RBC ratio.
Additionally, rating downgrades have resulted in a manageable 14-point decline year-to-date and we would expect this ratings migration to reverse as markets recover over the long term.
Even with the anticipated cumulative effect of credit migrations and potential rating downgrades, we expect to end the year with a strong RBC ratio at or above our 400% target.
So in summary, our sales engine is firing on all cylinders.
We continue to consistently generate and manage stable net investment spread and earnings, and we're confident in our investment portfolio and capital position.
We generated $3 billion in total revenue in the third quarter.
With the Title segment producing approximately $2.5 billion, F&G producing $442 million and the Corporate segment generating $50 million.
Third quarter net earnings were $378 million, which include net recognized gains of $73 million versus net recognized gains of $4 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of equity and preferred stock securities, whether these securities were disposed of in the quarter or continue to be held in our investment portfolio.
Excluding net recognized gains, our total revenue was $2.9 billion as compared with $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $435 million or $1.48 per diluted share.
The Title segment contributed $391 million, F&G contributed $74 million, and the Corporate and Other segment had an adjusted net loss of $30 million.
Excluding net recognized losses of $3 million, our Title segment generated $2.5 billion in total revenue for the third quarter compared with $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019.
Direct premiums increased by 11% versus the third quarter of 2019.
Agency revenue grew by 19%, and escrow title related and other fees increased by 14% versus the prior year.
Personnel costs increased by 7% and other operating expenses decreased by 2%.
All in, the Title business generated a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin, a 260 basis point increase versus the third quarter of 2019.
Interest income in the Title and Corporate segments of $31 million declined $26 million as compared with the prior year quarter due to the reduction of short-term interest rates on our corporate cash balances in our 1031 exchange business.
In September, we closed an issuance of $600 million of 2.45% senior notes due March 15, 2031.
The net proceeds have been used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the one-year term loan agreement that we signed in April, which allowed us to secure the additional financing needed to close the acquisition of F&G.
F&F debt outstanding was $2.7 billion on September 30 for a debt-to-total capital ratio of 27.1%.
Our title claims paid of $50 million were $27 million lower than our provision of $77 million for the quarter.
The carried title reserve for claim losses is currently $55 million or 3.7% above the external actuary central estimate.
We continue to provide for title claims at 4.5% of total title premiums.
Finally, our title investment portfolio totaled $5.3 billion at September 30.
Included in the $5.3 billion are fixed maturity and preferred securities of $2.5 billion with an average duration of three years and an average rating of A2.
Equity securities of $600 million, short-term and other investments of $300 million and cash of $1.9 billion.
