PSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, marking a 4.6% increase year-over-year. This increase was primarily attributed to higher transmission revenues, a strong performance by PSEG Power, and stable margins in both electric and gas businesses. Total electric sales declined by 2% while gas sales rose by 1%, with residential usage offsetting declines in commercial and industrial sales. Despite milder weather, solid contributions from PSE&G and PSEG Power drove the company's overall performance. PSE&G invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, while PSEG Power continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA. PSE&G Nuclear's application for the extension of zero-emission certificates was under consideration by the BPU, with the final decision expected on April 27th. The company expects an influx of investments in decarbonization, energy transition, and methane reduction projects in the coming years. For 2021, PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance is $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with regulated operations expected to contribute over 80% of consolidated results.
