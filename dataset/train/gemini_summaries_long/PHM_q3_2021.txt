PulteGroup reported strong third-quarter earnings, with home sale revenues up 18% to $3.3 billion, driven by higher closings and average sales prices. Earnings per share increased 36% to $1.82, exceeding the previous year's adjusted earnings of $1.34. However, the company's production environment has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, leading to delays in deliveries and higher construction costs. Despite these challenges, PulteGroup has taken proactive steps to increase spec home availability and better align sales with production, with spec homes in production increasing by 900. The company remains confident in the housing market and is investing heavily in land acquisition and development, with $2.9 billion spent so far this year and a target of approximately $4 billion for the full year. As the supply chain improves and lumber costs decline in 2022, PulteGroup expects further gross margin expansion and financial growth.
