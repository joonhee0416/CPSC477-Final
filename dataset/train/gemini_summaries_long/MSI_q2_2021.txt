Motorola Solutions reported a strong Q2 with outstanding revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth. Revenue surged 22% to $2 billion, driven by strong demand for LMR and video security technologies in both the Products and Systems Integration (up 24%) and Software and Services (up 19%) segments. Operating margins expanded significantly by 220 basis points overall, with both segments experiencing notable improvements. The company expanded its backlog to a record Q2 level of $11.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Due to strong demand and momentum, Motorola Solutions raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings per share. The company also invested in the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions, expanding its video security capabilities. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, Motorola Solutions expressed optimism for the second half of the year, citing continued execution across its businesses and growing demand for mission-critical solutions.
