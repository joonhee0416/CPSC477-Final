RPM International reported strong financial performance in Q4, with consolidated sales increasing 19.6% to $1.74 billion and adjusted earnings per share rising 13.3% to $1.28, exceeding analyst estimates. However, the company faces challenges in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Raw material costs have increased to high teens, resulting in an estimated $100 million revenue loss in Q4 and anticipation of more in Q1. Limited raw material availability is also impacting production, with the consumer group facing particular difficulties due to margin compression and plant shutdowns. Despite these challenges, RPM expects three segments (construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products) to continue their momentum with strong revenue growth in Q1. However, consolidated adjusted EBIT is projected to decrease by 25% to 30% in Q1, with the consumer group experiencing a significant decline.
