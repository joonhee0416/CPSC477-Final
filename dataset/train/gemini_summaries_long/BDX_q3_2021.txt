BD reported strong Q3 results, with revenue of $4.9 billion, a 26.9% increase on a reported basis and a 22% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues grew 17.6% driven by strength across all business segments. The growth was particularly impressive considering the tough comparison to the prior year quarter, when elective procedures were halted due to the initial COVID wave. Excluding COVID testing, base business revenues increased 3.9% relative to pre-pandemic Q3 2019 on a currency-neutral basis. The company also reported a strong adjusted earnings per share of $2.74, ahead of expectations. For the full year, BD has raised its base revenue growth assumption to approximately 7.5% to 8% on a foreign exchange (FX)-neutral basis, higher than the previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. The company also announced a higher adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance in the range of $12.85 to $12.95, enabled by strong base business momentum and a lower tax rate.
