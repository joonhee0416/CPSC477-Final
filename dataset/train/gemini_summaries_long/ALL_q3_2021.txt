In the third quarter, Allstate's total revenues grew by 16.9% year-over-year to $12.5 billion. Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%, and Protection Plans saw a 12.5% growth. Net income, however, decreased from the previous year's quarter due to higher auto insurance loss costs, which were partly offset by increased investment income and reinsurance recoveries. The company implemented price increases to address the rising loss costs and continues to focus on expense reduction through its Transformative Growth initiative. Allstate Protection Services experienced revenue and profit growth, and net investment income was significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to strong performance-based income. The company's balance sheet remained strong, allowing for significant cash returns to shareholders and the acquisition of SafeAuto to further increase market share. Allstate is committed to sustainable value creation through execution, innovation, and capital management, with a history of attractive dividend payments and share repurchases.
