Despite the challenges of a robust manufacturing landscape and supply chain disruptions, Wabash National (WAB) reported solid Q1 performance with operating profit and EPS exceeding expectations. Demand for their products remains high, particularly for their molded structural composite (MSC) technology, leading to plans for additional MSC capacity expansion in 2022.
