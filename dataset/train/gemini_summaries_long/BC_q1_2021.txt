Brunswick Corporation's Q1 2021 earnings report showcased a robust performance driven by strong market demand and operational excellence. Propulsion, Parts & Accessories, and Boat segments all experienced significant growth, with the Boat segment reaching double-digit adjusted operating margins for the first time in over 20 years. Freedom Boat Club continues to expand rapidly, with over 40,000 memberships and plans for further acquisition and organic growth in 2021. Despite supply chain and labor challenges, Brunswick's teams have successfully mitigated these issues and maintained production plans. The company remains confident in its ability to meet the projected demand, having increased its 2021 guidance to a net sales range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, adjusted operating margin growth between 130 and 170 basis points, and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.60. Brunswick is also accelerating its ACES strategy (Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared Access) to capitalize on future growth opportunities and invest in new product introductions and capacity expansion plans.
