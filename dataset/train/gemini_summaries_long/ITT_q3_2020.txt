In Q3 2020, ITT's revenue decreased 17% to $591 million, primarily due to lower volumes and COVID-19 impacts. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 44% sequentially to $0.82, driven by productivity and cost actions. ITT reported an exceptional 15.4% operating income margin, the highest in its history, resulting in its highest-ever free cash flow of $271 million. Notably, the company recorded a $1.20 noncash expense related to its asbestos liability, leading to a $0.55 EPS loss on continuing operations. ITT's Motion Technologies segment delivered strong margins of 18.5%, while Industrial Process posted its highest Q3 margin ever at 14.1%, reflecting improvements in productivity and cost control. Despite challenges in the commercial aviation market, CCT showed signs of improvement, with its margin expanding to 14%. ITT expects continued sequential improvement in Q4 but anticipates year-over-year revenue declines in the high single digits to low teens range. The company remains focused on cost reduction and operational efficiency, aiming for segment decremental margins of 21-24% for the full year and a free cash flow margin of 13-15%.
