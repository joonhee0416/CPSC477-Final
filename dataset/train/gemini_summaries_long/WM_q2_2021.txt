Waste Management's second quarter performance was exceptional, driven by strong volume growth (9.6%), yield (3.7%), and pricing that offset inflationary pressures. The company's collection and disposal business led the way, with 24% EBITDA growth, while the recycling business set records. Integration of the Advanced Disposal acquisition is progressing well, with $30 million of annual synergies captured so far. WM raised its full-year guidance once again, projecting revenue growth of 15.5%-16%, adjusted operating EBITDA of $5 billion to $5.1 billion (an increase of $225 million), and free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Despite elevated cost inflation, the company expects to overcome these pressures through increased operating efficiencies and pricing programs. WM also remains committed to its sustainability journey, creating a centralized structure for sustainable solutions and ESG efforts. The company is investing heavily in technology to improve customer experience, reduce costs, and optimize operational efficiency, which will provide long-term benefits.
