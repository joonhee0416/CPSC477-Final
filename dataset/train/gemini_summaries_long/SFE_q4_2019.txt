Safeguard Scientifics reported a strong 2019, with a net income of $54.6 million ($2.64 per share) despite a Q4 net loss of $0.7 million ($0.03 per share). The company attributed these results to successful exits, such as Propeller and Transactis, and a reduction in general and administrative expenses. Safeguard continues to monitor its portfolio, which has an aggregate value of approximately $230 million across 15 tech-enabled companies. The portfolio is performing well, with six companies having annual revenue run rates between $5 million and $10 million and another six with run rates over $10 million. The average growth rate of non-digital media companies is 54%. To enhance shareholder value, Safeguard plans to return excess cash via share repurchases or dividends and is exploring various exit opportunities for its portfolio companies. Despite a $25 million cash reserve, Safeguard expects additional deployments between $5 million and $10 million in 2020 to support existing ownership interests. The company remains optimistic about its portfolio and believes its current value significantly exceeds its share price.
