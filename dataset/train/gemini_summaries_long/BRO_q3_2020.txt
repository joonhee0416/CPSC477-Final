Brown & Brown delivered a strong quarter with 8.9% total revenue growth and 4.3% organic growth, totaling $674 million in revenue. The company's EBITDAC margin expanded 130 basis points to 32.8%. Net income per share increased 14.6% on a reported basis and an impressive 33.3% on an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition earn-out adjustments. The company's solid performance was supported by strong organic growth across all segments except Services, which was impacted by COVID-19 and other sector-specific headwinds. Despite these challenges, Brown & Brown has maintained strong liquidity and recently issued $700 million of 10.5-year bonds at a favorable rate of 2.375%. The company completed six acquisitions during the quarter, totaling $31 million in annual revenue, and expects continued M&A activity in the industry.
