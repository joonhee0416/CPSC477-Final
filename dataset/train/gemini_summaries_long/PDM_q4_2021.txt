Piedmont reported in-line fourth-quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.51. Portfolio metrics remained solid, with a 5.8% increase in same-store NOI on a cash basis and a 3% increase in second-generation cash rents. Leasing activity was robust, with 400,000 square feet leased and half of the fourth quarter's leasing related to new tenants. The leasing pipeline stands at over 500,000 square feet, positioning Piedmont for space absorption in 2022. Boston, Dallas, and Atlanta remain Piedmont's most active leasing markets. Net effective rents are approximately 2%-5% lower than pre-pandemic levels, but a flight to quality is underway, leading to wider rent disparities. The company's core FFO for 2021 was $1.97 per diluted share, a 4% increase over 2020. The office investment sales market is gradually recovering, with Piedmont discussing a pipeline of over $1 billion of high-quality assets. Cap rates remain steady for high-quality assets. Construction starts have slowed due to the pandemic, with a 15%-20% increase in new construction costs. Piedmont acquired 999 Peachtree Street in Atlanta, marking its entry into the Midtown Atlanta submarket. The company also completed two non-core asset disposals and plans for more in 2022. Piedmont's pro forma lease percentage as of December 31 would have been 87%, with a goal of 70%-75% of annualized lease revenue generated by Sunbelt markets by the end of 2023. The company is also introducing 2022 annual financial guidance for core FFO in the range of $1.97 to $2.07 per diluted share, assuming gradual physical utilization of buildings, neutral asset recycling, and a dividend adjustment around midyear.
