ProAssurance reported a solid quarter, with net income of $92.1 million or $1.70 per share, driven by a $74.4 million gain on bargain purchase related to the NORCAL acquisition. Excluding one-time items, non-GAAP operating income was $26.6 million or $0.49 per share, boosted by strong performance from the investment portfolio and improved underwriting results. All segments contributed to profitability, with Specialty P&C showing significant improvement due to reunderwriting efforts, rate strengthening, and favorable reserve development. Workers' Compensation Insurance saw higher claim activity in small business units but maintained profitability, while Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance delivered a solid result in a competitive market. Lloyd's also improved its results despite reduced participation. Despite uncertain economic conditions, ProAssurance remains confident in its team and the integration of NORCAL, which is expected to enhance performance through all economic cycles.
