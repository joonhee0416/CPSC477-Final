Extra Space experienced an exceptional first quarter with accelerated growth in key metrics. Same-store occupancy reached an all-time high, driving revenue growth of 4.6% despite lower late fees. Strong expense control contributed to a significant 6.5% increase in same-store NOI, leading to a 21% rise in year-over-year core FFO. External growth initiatives included $300 million in acquisitions, primarily lease-up properties, and expansion of the third-party management platform. The company raised its 2021 guidance to reflect the improved same-store performance, expecting revenue growth of 5% to 6% and core FFO per share of $5.95 to $6.10, an increase of $7.5 at the midpoint. Despite operational challenges and a tight labor market, the company remains optimistic due to strong fundamentals and its ability to optimize performance.
