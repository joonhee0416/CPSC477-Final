Despite pandemic challenges, UniFirst reported revenue of $1.826 billion for fiscal 2021, exceeding its previous year's total. Contributing to this growth were modest customer reopenings and increased PPE sales. The Specialty Garments segment also performed strongly, achieving record results in both revenue and profitability. Earnings per share improved to $7.94, driven by lower pandemic-related impacts in the second half of the year. However, the company anticipates margin pressure in fiscal 2022 due to rising costs and investments in technology and infrastructure. Organic growth is projected to exceed recent trends, while diluted earnings per share are estimated to range between $5.70 and $6.10, excluding transitionary costs related to major initiatives. To mitigate margin pressures, UniFirst is implementing cost-sharing measures with customers. Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic due to the essential nature of its services and ongoing capital allocation initiatives, including a 20% dividend increase and a new $100 million share repurchase authorization.
