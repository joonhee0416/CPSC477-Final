FTI Consulting reported solid third-quarter results despite COVID-19's ongoing impact. Revenue reached $622.2 million, driven by strong performance in Corporate Finance & Restructuring (CFR). CFR revenues increased 23.4% due to higher demand for restructuring services and acquisitions. However, FLC revenues declined 16.5% due to lower demand for investigations and disputes. Despite this, FLC saw an impressive rebound in EBITDA in Q3. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.54, slightly below the previous guidance range of $5.50 to $6. However, the company revised its FY2020 guidance to $5.25 to $5.75 due to expectations of a slower pace of bankruptcy filings and slower recovery in FLC in the fourth quarter. Despite these adjustments, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, citing its leading market position in restructuring, diversification of offerings, and continued investment in growth. FTI Consulting continues to attract top talent and generate strong free cash flow, enabling it to invest and return capital to shareholders.
