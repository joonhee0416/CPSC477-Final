In the third quarter, the company reported an 11.4% increase in FFO per share to $0.57 due to office acquisitions, real estate tax refunds, reduced bad debt expense, and seasonality in hospitality. Key highlights include strong same-store cash NOI in office and retail segments, the 86% leased acquisition of Corporate Campus East III in Bellevue, and increased leasing activity across all asset classes. The company maintains a solid liquidity position of $522 million. For the full year 2021, the company projects FFO per share between $1.91 and $1.93, with a slight decrease in Q4 FFO per share due to non-recurring items, seasonality, and increased expenses. The company will provide 2022 guidance in February 2022. Office leasing activity remains strong, with comparable new and renewal leases reflecting rent increases of over 9% and 14% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. The company continues to invest in portfolio improvements and developments, including redevelopments in Portland and San Diego, to enhance occupancy and drive rent growth.
