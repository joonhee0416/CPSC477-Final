CTS's second-quarter performance was marked by a 54% surge in sales to $129.6 million, with organic growth reaching 52%. Despite supply chain challenges impacting automotive sales, customer demand remained strong. Gross margin improved significantly to 36.8%, driven by operational efficiencies and a higher mix of sales from non-transportation markets. EBITDA margin also rose to 21.5% from 16.7% a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share reached $0.52, a 225% increase from the prior year. New business awards grew to $174 million. The company continues to progress with its strategic initiatives, including diversification, expansion, and operational enhancements. However, supply chain disruptions and some customer shutdowns are expected to persist during the second half. The company remains optimistic about the demand outlook and has updated its guidance for full-year sales and adjusted earnings.
