Skechers reported a record first quarter with sales of $1.43 billion, reflecting a 15% increase from the previous year and an 11.9% surge from 2019. This growth was driven by a 20.2% increase in international sales, which now account for 57.8% of total sales. Domestic sales also improved by 8.5%, despite challenges in logistics. Notable drivers of sales growth included Women's Sport, Kids, Work, and Men's Performance categories. Direct-to-consumer sales increased by 18.1% overall, with a 28.4% rise in domestic sales and a 143% growth in domestic e-commerce. The company remains cautious due to ongoing pandemic-related challenges, but is optimistic about its recovery as demand for comfort technology footwear remains strong in open markets. For the full year, Skechers anticipates achieving sales between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, with earnings per share between $1.80 and $2.00.
