Avista's financial performance showcased a decline in earnings for the second quarter of 2021, with earnings per share at $0.20 compared to $0.26 in the same period last year. Despite the decline, year-to-date earnings remain strong, with $1.18 per share in 2021 compared to $0.98 in 2020. The company's business segments performed variably, with Avista Utilities facing challenges due to increased power supply costs and lower hydroelectric generation, while AEL&P met expectations and other businesses exceeded forecasts. Avista confirmed its 2021 consolidated earnings guidance range of $1.96 to $2.16 per share while adjusting segment ranges to lower Avista Utilities by $0.10 and raise other businesses by $0.10. For 2022, consolidated earnings guidance has been lowered by $0.15 to a range of $2.03 to $2.23, reflecting regulatory lag. However, the company remains confident in meeting its 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.42 to $2.62.
