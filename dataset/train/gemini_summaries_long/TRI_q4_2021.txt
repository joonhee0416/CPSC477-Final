Thomson Reuters reported a 6% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, maintaining its strong organic revenue growth at 5% for 2021. Despite a 14% decline in adjusted EBITDA, the company exceeded its guidance targets due to cost savings from its Change program and other initiatives. The Big 3 businesses (Legal, Corporates, and Reuters News) drove organic revenue growth, with Legal outperforming at 6% and Reuters News continuing its recovery with 12% growth. Corporates' organic revenue also grew by 7%, reflecting increasing demand for its legal, tax, and risk products. The Change program achieved over $200 million in savings, surpassing its initial target of $600 million. The company remains confident in its transformation to a content-driven technology company and expects to achieve its 2023 revenue growth target of 5.5% to 6%. It anticipates further growth in 2022 and 2023, supported by strategic investments and acquisitions. The company also announced a 10% increase in its annual dividend, reflecting its strong free cash flow generation.
