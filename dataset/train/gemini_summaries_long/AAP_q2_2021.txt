Advance Auto Parts reported strong financial performance in Q2, driven by industry factors and operational improvements. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40, surpassing analyst expectations. Sales grew 5.9% to $2.6 billion, with comparable store sales increasing 5.8%. The professional business outperformed the DIY omnichannel business, contributing to double-digit growth. Strategic initiatives in category management, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing, and own-brand expansion, led to gross margin expansion of 239 basis points. SG&A expenses increased due to higher incentive compensation, wage inflation, and normalized delivery expenses. However, these were partially offset by decreased COVID-19 expenses. Adjusted operating income grew to $302 million, resulting in an 11 basis point increase in operating income margin to 11.4%. Advance Auto Parts remains optimistic about the long-term outlook and has increased its guidance for full-year 2021, including net sales, comparable store sales, and free cash flow. The company plans to continue investing in strategic initiatives and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
