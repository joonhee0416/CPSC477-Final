In the third quarter, the company experienced strong demand with home sales revenue of $2.23 billion, a 37% increase year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin rose to 25.6%, leading to a pre-tax income of $303.4 million and earnings per share of $1.87. Net contracts signed increased by 11% in units and 35% in dollars, setting third quarter records. The average selling price reached $945,000, a significant increase from the previous quarter and year. Demand has remained strong in the fourth quarter, with non-binding deposits averaging over 300 per week in the first three weeks of August. Despite anticipated order declines in the fourth quarter due to last year's surge in demand, the company remains bullish on the long-term housing market, citing factors such as supply-demand imbalance, low interest rates, and increasing demand from millennials and baby boomers. The company's backlog remains strong at $9.4 billion, up 55% year-over-year. Capital efficiency initiatives, including a shift to more optioned land, are contributing to improved margins. The company expects a return on beginning equity exceeding 15.9% in fiscal year 2021 and significantly above 20% in fiscal year 2022.
