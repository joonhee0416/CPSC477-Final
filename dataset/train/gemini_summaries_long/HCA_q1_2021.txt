HCA Healthcare reported strong first-quarter results, driven by higher revenue and improved margins. Revenue surged 8.7% to $1.1 billion, primarily due to increased inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient procedures. Inpatient revenue saw a 12% boost, with a higher case mix index and commercial admits representing 29% of total admissions. Outpatient revenue also increased 4.7%, driven by a 30% surge in March, despite declines in January and February. The adjusted EBITDA margin grew year-over-year, and diluted earnings per share jumped 78% to $4.14. The company announced the acquisition of Brookdale Senior Living's home health and hospitals business, which will enhance its local provider systems and provide more enterprise capabilities. Two new hospitals were opened in Denver and Orlando, and acquisitions of two small hospitals in Nashville and Savannah are expected to close in the second quarter. The company increased its annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and macro factors, with revenue projected between $54 billion and $55.5 billion, EBITDA between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion, and diluted earnings per share between $13.30 and $14.30.
