We Energies posted impressive third-quarter results, driven by factors such as warmer weather, economic recovery, and operational efficiency. Their balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, enabling them to fund a substantial $17.7 billion ESG Progress Plan from 2022-2026. This plan aims to support 7% annual growth in their asset base, with a focus on sustainability, grid reliability, customer growth, and infrastructure modernization. Significantly, the company announced its intention to eliminate coal as an energy source by 2035, relying on their highly efficient Oak Creek coal-fired units as a key part of their fleet in the meantime. Despite higher natural gas prices, We Energies' earnings guidance for 2021 has been revised upward to a range of $4.05 to $4.07 per share, reflecting their strong performance and long-term investment strategy.
