Whirlpool Corporation's Q2 financial performance was impressive, exhibiting strong revenue growth of 32% year-over-year. The company's ongoing diluted earnings per share surged to $6.64, a significant improvement of $4.57 year-over-year. This remarkable result reflects robust consumer demand, effective pricing actions, structural cost reductions, and volume growth. Despite persistent pandemic disruptions and supply chain constraints, Whirlpool's ongoing EBIT margin expanded by 640 basis points to 11.4%, overcoming 400 basis points of cost inflation. The company generated strong free cash flow of $769 million, driven by earnings and successful divestitures. As a result of these exceptional outcomes, Whirlpool raised its guidance to approximately $26 per share and anticipates reaching 10.5% global EBIT margin. The company remains committed to innovation, investing over $1 billion in capital expenditures and R&D, and to shareholder value through increased share repurchases in the second half of 2021.
