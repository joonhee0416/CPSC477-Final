Worthington Industries reported a third-quarter earnings per share of $1.11, down from $1.27 in the previous year, amidst inventory holding losses estimated at $25 million. Despite this, adjusted earnings per share reached $1.13, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. Consolidated net sales surged to $1.4 billion, driven by higher steel prices, acquisitions, and average selling prices in consumer and building products. Steel processing faced headwinds, with inventory holding losses contributing to a decline in adjusted EBIT to $7 million. Nevertheless, consumer products and building products saw growth, with ClarkDietrich performing exceptionally. The company remains optimistic about future prospects, particularly in sustainable energy solutions and products that enable emissions reductions. Management highlighted challenges, including labor availability, supply chain disruptions, and volatile steel pricing, but expressed confidence in the team's ability to navigate these hurdles.
