Eagle Materials delivered a strong second quarter with a 14% increase in revenue to a record $510 million and a 14% increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.46. Adjusted earnings per share surged 26% to $2.73. The company's favorable outlook stems from strong job growth, consumer spending, and a robust housing market, primarily in the Southern U.S., where most of its plants are located. While supply chain disruptions have led to delays in home construction, Eagle anticipates increased demand once these issues ease. The company's Cement business remains at high capacity utilization, and while some volume growth is possible, acquisitions could be explored for further expansion. Notably, Eagle has partnered with Chart Industries on a carbon capture project at its Sugar Creek cement plant, a significant step towards its carbon neutrality goal.
