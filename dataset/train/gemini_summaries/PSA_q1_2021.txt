Public Storage executives reported favorable first-quarter results, noting consistent and elevated customer demand. Same-store revenue increased by 3.4%, driven by higher move-in rates and improving in-place rents. Expenses were effectively controlled, leading to a 13% decline in property payroll due to efficiency improvements. The company's acquisition activity remains robust, with the recent EZStorage portfolio purchase adding approximately 10% to its square footage over the next two years. The balance sheet remains strong, with a weighted average cost of 1.6% on its recently issued bonds, providing flexibility for further growth initiatives. The outlook for 2021 remains positive, with core FFO per share guidance of $11.35 to $11.75, supported by continued customer demand and cost control measures.
