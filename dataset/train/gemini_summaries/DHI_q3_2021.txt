D.R. Horton reported a strong third quarter, with a 78% surge in earnings per share to $3.06, fueled by a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion. The company's pre-tax income rose 81% to reach $19.4% margin, while its return on inventory and equity for the trailing 12-month period stood at 34.9% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite robust market conditions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have impacted construction timelines, leading the company to slow its sales pace to align with production levels. With a solid balance sheet and liquidity, D.R. Horton plans to continue its growth trajectory, aiming to close between 83,000 and 84,500 homes in fiscal 2021. The company remains committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reducing its outstanding share count by 2% since the start of the year.
