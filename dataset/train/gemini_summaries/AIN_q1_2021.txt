The company had a strong start to 2021 with $222 million in revenue, resulting in $0.85 GAAP earnings per share and $0.87 adjusted earnings per share. The Machine Clothing segment had its strongest quarterly performance since 2015 with revenues up $12 million, and remains positive despite minor isolated supply constraints. The Aerospace segment is experiencing a planned destocking of excess inventory in Engineered Composites, which is expected to improve as commercial air transport recovers. Notably, Engineered Composites is actively developing new advanced composite materials for industries including unmanned hypersonic and electric aircraft. The company's healthy balance sheet and good free cash flow generation, with a net leverage ratio of 0.65, positions it well for future growth opportunities. The company maintains its previously issued guidance ranges for overall performance, with the exception of GAAP earnings per share which has been updated to between $2.38 and $2.78 due to non-GAAP adjustments in Q1.
