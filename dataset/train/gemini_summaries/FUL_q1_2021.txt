H.B. Fuller's Q1 organic revenue surged by 10.5%, adjusted EBITDA increased by 30%, and adjusted EPS nearly doubled to $0.66 compared to the same period last year. The company's exceptional performance was driven by market innovation and share gains, with strong growth in engineering adhesive sales. Positive incremental margins were achieved through product mix, reduced expenses, and operational efficiencies. Raw material costs are expected to rise faster than anticipated due to increased demand and supply constraints, but the company is strategically managing pricing to offset these costs. The company anticipates high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth and EBITDA between $455 million and $475 million for fiscal 2021, despite supply chain challenges. H.B. Fuller remains focused on volume growth, pricing management, and capacity expansion through operational excellence programs.
