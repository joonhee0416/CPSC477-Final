MAA ended 2020 with strong performance, driven by a 6% increase in move-ins, positive lease-over-lease rent growth, and average physical occupancy remaining high at 95.7%. Despite seasonal holiday slowdown, MAA captured 5.2% renewal lease pricing in Q4. The company expects continued outperformance in the spring and summer leasing season due to improving employment conditions and migration trends. MAA's Sun Belt markets, which have experienced favorable job growth and migration trends, are expected to continue to drive demand for apartment housing. The company's initiatives to implement new technology and processes will drive margin expansion, while its redevelopment operation continues to capture attractive rent growth. With a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, MAA is well-positioned to support its redevelopment and growth initiatives. For 2021, MAA projects core FFO per share between $6.30 and $6.60, primarily driven by same-store revenue growth of around 2%.
