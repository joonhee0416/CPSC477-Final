Sensient Technologies delivered solid results in its third quarter, with adjusted local currency revenue increasing 6.1% in flavors and extracts and profit growth of 24%. The flavors and extracts group has maintained consistent growth in revenue and profits, driven by sales execution, customer retention, and a decline in attrition. The Asia Pacific group also posted solid profit growth, up 15% in the quarter. Despite adverse impacts from COVID-19, the company is maintaining its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.80 and low-to-mid single-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA. Sensient's ongoing restructuring initiatives and focus on core customer markets are expected to support future growth and margin improvement.
