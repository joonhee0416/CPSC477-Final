During Q1 2022, guest cruise operations resumed with 60% of fleet capacity, reaching 75% as of today. Despite the impact of the Omicron variant on bookings, revenue per passenger day increased by approximately 7.5% compared to 2019, while occupancy was 54%, carrying over one million guests. Recent booking trends have shown improvement, particularly since mid-January, with increased volume and higher prices for bookings in the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023. While adjusted EBITDA has been impacted by restart-related expenses, it is expected to improve and turn positive at the beginning of the summer season. The company expects a net loss for Q2 2022 but anticipates a profit in Q3 2022. For the full year, a net loss is expected, but in 2023, with the full fleet in service, the company anticipates generating potentially greater adjusted EBITDA than in 2019.
