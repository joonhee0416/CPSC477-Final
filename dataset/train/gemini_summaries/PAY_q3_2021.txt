Paymentus reported strong Q3 financial results, with a 37% year-over-year increase in contribution profit to $40.7 million. Sales were exceptionally strong, driven by large enterprise business deals that could potentially add 400 basis points to their revenue run rate. The company signed over 140 billers to date, representing less than 2% of the domestic bill payment market, indicating a significant growth opportunity. Paymentus's non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 was $0.01, while revenue is expected to grow 30% for the full year to between $391 million and $393 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $26.5 million to $28 million, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 17% to 18%. Despite strong transaction volumes, the company views itself as a startup and believes it has the necessary resources to drive future growth.
