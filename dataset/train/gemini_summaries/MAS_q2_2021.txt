Masco Corporation achieved a strong second quarter with 24% sales growth, showcasing the resilience of its diversified repair and remodel product portfolio. Sales increased across all segments, led by a 48% growth in plumbing, driven by strong demand for North American and international faucets and showers. Decorative architectural sales declined 5% due to supply chain constraints. Despite rising inflation, the company secured price increases and implemented productivity measures, targeting price/cost neutrality by year-end. Notably, the company repurchased 13.1 million shares for $750 million to date, with plans to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the second half of the year. Based on robust demand, Masco has increased its full-year sales growth expectations to 14-16%, with earnings per share estimated to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75, representing a 19% growth. The company's strong brands, innovation pipeline, and its well-positioned business indicate long-term growth potential, especially considering the correlation between home price appreciation and remodeling expenditures.
