In Q2, the company had a strong financial performance with FFO of $0.49 per diluted share, primarily driven by the reversal of rent reserves and operating expense savings. Same-store office NOI decreased 2.1% on a GAAP basis, while studio NOI increased 17% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the return of production activities. The company has announced major expansions of its Sunset Studios platform, including the largest purpose-built studio in Los Angeles in over 20 years and its first international expansion into the U.K. These investments aim to meet the growing demand for studio space driven by the flourishing tech and media industries. While uncertainty regarding the pandemic's impact remains, the company projects full-year FFO per share in the range of $1.90 to $1.96, excluding specified items.
