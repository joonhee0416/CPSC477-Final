Safeguard Scientifics reported a successful 2019 with the completion of its return of capital strategy, resulting in $187 million returned to the balance sheet. The company now holds a portfolio of 15 tech-enabled companies valued at approximately $230 million. Safeguard's portfolio companies continue to grow, with non-digital media companies experiencing an average growth rate of 54%. The company's annual revenue increased by 8% to $357 million, with a 41% growth excluding digital media companies. Safeguard's focus remains on prudently managing its portfolio, supporting its companies, and efficiently monetizing and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends. The company's quarterly results included $2.2 million of other income, primarily due to the removal of liabilities from the former CEO's commitment, and $2 million of interest income. Safeguard's follow-on funding requirements for 2020 are forecasted to be between $5 and $10 million.
