In Q1 2021, Terex reported robust results driven by increased customer demand. Despite supply chain challenges, both Aerial Work Platforms (AWP) and Materials Processing (MP) segments delivered improved margins year-over-year. The company's focus on cost management, including the SG&A reduction initiative, resulted in positive free cash flow of $40 million. Terex updated its full-year outlook, raising its earnings per share range to $2.35 to $2.55, driven by outperformance, operating profit contributions from additional revenue, pricing and manufacturing efficiency partially offsetting supply chain headwinds, and reduced interest expense. The company's commitment to ESG is evident in its progress on sustainability initiatives, including publishing its first annual ESG report. Terex's ample liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion supports its capital allocation strategy, which includes investments in innovation and growth plans.
