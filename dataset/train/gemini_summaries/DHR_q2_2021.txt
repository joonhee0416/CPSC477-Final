In Q2, Danaher reported impressive results with core revenue growth of 31.5%, driven by strong contributions from all segments. Notably, gross profit margin increased by 710 basis points to 60.9%, primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable product mix. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share surged by 71% to $2.46, reflecting a 775 basis point expansion in core operating margin. Despite lower operating expenses due to reduced travel costs, the company generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, up over 40%. Importantly, Danaher announced its pending acquisition of Aldevron, which will expand its presence in genomic medicine, a fast-growing and promising area. Looking ahead, the company expects to deliver third-quarter core revenue growth in the mid to high teens range and full-year core revenue growth of approximately 20%.
