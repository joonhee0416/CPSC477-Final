Despite pandemic disruptions, Roto-Rooter and VITAS, subsidiaries of Chemed, have demonstrated remarkable resilience. Roto-Rooter experienced a surge in residential demand starting in May 2020, which has continued into 2021. The company anticipates this trend and increased commercial demand to support continued growth. VITAS faced challenges in senior housing occupancy and hospital referrals due to the pandemic, but recent data suggests a gradual recovery in these areas. The company projects a decline in full-year 2021 revenue of approximately 4.5% compared to 2020, while expecting an average daily census decrease of 5%. VITAS' adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 18.3%, with Medicare Cap billing limitations estimated at $7.5 million, an improvement from the initial estimate of $10 million. Chemed's adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding certain expenses are projected to be between $18.20 and $18.50 for the full year, exceeding the initial guidance of $17 to $17.50.
