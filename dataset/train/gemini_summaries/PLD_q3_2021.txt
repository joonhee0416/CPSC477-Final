Prologis' third quarter exceeded expectations, driven by record rent increases and valuations. Operating conditions are shaped by structural demand and unprecedented low vacancies, leading to a sense of urgency among customers. Despite sequential declines, lease signings remain above trend, with ecommerce representing a significant portion. The company raised its US net absorption forecast by 14% to a record 375 million square feet and projects a year-end vacancy rate of 4%. Global rent growth surpassed expectations, reaching 7.1% in the US and 70% globally. This has resulted in a 500 basis point jump in the in-place-to-market rent spread, representing over $925 million in organic NOI growth. Valuation increases have been substantial, with the logistics portfolio posting a 9.5% quarterly increase. The company anticipates demand tailwinds over the next decade due to network reconfigurations and expansions. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.04 per share, and cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%. Development margins remained elevated at 47%, and $1.4 billion in development starts are expected to create over $520 million in value. Prologis raised $500 million in strategic capital during the quarter and tightened its cash same-store NOI growth guidance to 5.75%-6%. The company increased its development starts, acquisition guidance, and net deployment uses. Core FFO per share is now expected to range from $4.11 to $4.13, with 14% year-over-year growth and deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. Prologis believes that disruptions in the supply chain will drive long-term growth and is committed to finding solutions to address issues such as space scarcity, transportation infrastructure, and labor shortages.
