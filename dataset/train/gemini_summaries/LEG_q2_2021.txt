In Q2, compname reported record quarterly sales of $1.27 billion, representing a significant increase compared to Q2 2020. This strong performance was driven by recovery from pandemic impacts, with sales growth of 5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% compared to pre-pandemic Q2 2019. Despite supply chain disruptions and raw material cost inflation, compname strengthened its position through strategic acquisitions in Work Furniture and International Bedding. To address material cost inflation and acquisition-related sales, the company increased its sales guidance to $4.9-$5.1 billion for 2021. Adjusted earnings per share guidance is now expected to range from $2.70 to $2.90, largely due to metal margin expansion in its Steel Rod business. Amidst supply chain challenges, compname's operating cash flow was $41 million in Q2, and it anticipates cash flow from operations to reach $450 million for the year. The company remains committed to dividend growth and has declared a yield of 3.5% based on its recently increased quarterly dividend.
