First Commonwealth reported strong Q3 performance with core EPS of $0.36, solid loan growth (8.2%), and improved credit metrics. Despite expense headwinds, revenue growth outpaced expenses, driven by a $2.4 million increase in net interest income and growth in non-interest income. Excluding PPP loan payoffs, loan growth was robust, with notable strength in indirect lending, home equity lending, and mortgage lending. Importantly, the company saw a significant improvement in credit quality, with the lowest loan charge-offs in nine quarters and a provision of just $330,000. Reserves now represent 1.3% of total loans and non-performing assets decreased to 41 basis points of total assets. Additionally, the company has taken steps to strengthen its interest rate risk sensitivity, believing the core NIM has bottomed out and should improve as excess cash is redeployed into loans. The company repurchased 997,517 shares of stock and has authorized an additional $25 million share repurchase program to redeploy excess capital generation.
