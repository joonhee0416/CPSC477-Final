Quanex reported solid Q1 results with revenue growth of 16% to $267 million, driven by volume gains and higher prices, leading to a 25.9% increase in adjusted net income per share to $0.34. However, increased raw material costs and time lags in pricing mechanisms led to margin compression. Despite inflationary pressures, Quanex expects continued demand and provides guidance for fiscal 2022, including net sales between $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $135 million to $140 million. The company emphasizes its strong balance sheet and cash flow focus, while acknowledging the impact of the war in Ukraine on the European economy and supply chains.
