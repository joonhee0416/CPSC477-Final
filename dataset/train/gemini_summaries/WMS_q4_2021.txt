ADS delivered another quarter of record-breaking performance with 20% year-over-year sales growth, driven by robust demand in both residential and non-residential markets. Residential sales surged by 21%, led by favorable dynamics in new home construction, repair/remodel, and on-site septic. Infiltrator, acquired in 2020, exceeded expectations with 23% sales growth in the quarter. International sales also soared by 49%, primarily due to growth in Canada. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 190 basis points due to strong sales growth and favorable pricing. ADS anticipates continued growth in fiscal 2022, with net sales projected to range from $2.220 billion to $2.300 billion, a 12-16% increase. Adjusted EBITDA is also forecasted to rise by 12-17%, despite inflationary pressures. ADS remains committed to strategic capital deployment, including organic investments, M&A opportunities, and dividend and share repurchase programs.
