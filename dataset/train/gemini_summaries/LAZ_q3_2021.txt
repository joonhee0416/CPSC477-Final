Lazard achieved record quarterly revenue of $702 million, a 23% year-over-year increase, due to strong advisory and asset management performance. Financial Advisory revenue surged 24% to $381 million, driven by M&A completions and private equity-related activities. Asset Management revenue grew 19% to $311 million, propelled by a larger base of assets under management. Average AUM reached a record $278 billion, with gross inflows remaining healthy. Despite net outflows and negative foreign exchange movement, recent market appreciation and positive foreign exchange movements led to an increase in AUM to $279 billion as of October 22. The company continues to invest in its businesses, including senior hires in Financial Advisory and platform expansions in Asset Management. Despite increased expenses, cost discipline remains a focus, with an adjusted non-compensation ratio of 16.6%. Lazard remains optimistic about the outlook, noting strong market conditions in both the US and Europe. The M&A environment remains favorable, and the company is well-positioned for continued growth through its investments in capabilities and expertise.
