Fluor reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25 in Q1, led by the Dos Bocas award in the Energy Solutions Group. The company anticipates increased awards in the second half of 2021. Despite ongoing softness in capital spending, Fluor is actively pursuing projects to build a healthy backlog. The Energy Solutions segment's profit, adjusted for an embedded derivative, improved compared to the prior year. Mission Solutions saw strong margins due to increased DOE project execution and improved project scores. Fluor secured a $40 million equity investment from JGC for NuScale. The company's cost savings initiative has identified savings above the previously targeted $100 million. Fluor's cash position remains strong, although its operating cash flow was impacted by COVID-related costs and increased G&A payments. The company is divesting its AMECO North America business and pursuing a sale of Stork. Fluor maintains its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $0.50 to $0.80, contingent upon timely project awards and revenue growth in the coming quarters.
