Q1 earnings surged, with adjusted EPS increasing to $1.83 from $1.13 last year. Net sales rose 12% due to increased volumes, favorable currency translation, and higher material costs. All segments reported growth, with Beverage units up 9% in the Americas and 6% in Europe. Asia-Pacific saw an 8% volume increase, benefiting from recoveries in Southeast Asia and China. Transit Packaging expects a 25% segment income growth in 2021, driven by strong industrial demand. The company maintains its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $6.60-$6.80 per share, offsetting the expected dilution from the sale of European tinplate businesses. Despite challenges like rising aluminum costs and the ongoing pandemic, the company's strong demand and operational efficiency have enabled it to convert growth into earnings expansion.
