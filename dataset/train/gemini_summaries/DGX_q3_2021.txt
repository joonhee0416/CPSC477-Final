Quest Diagnostics reported a solid Q3 with total revenue of $2.77 billion, a slight decrease from the previous year. The decline was attributed to lower COVID-19 testing revenue, offset by continued recovery in the base business. Despite the COVID-19 decline, base revenue grew 6% compared to Q3 2019, and volume increased 5.3% year-over-year. Notably, the base business rebounded in September following a slowdown in August. COVID-19 testing volumes increased in Q3 due to the Delta variant, averaging 83,000 molecular tests daily. Quest anticipates a decline in COVID-19 volumes but expects base business to continue growing. As a result, the company raised its full-year outlook, expecting revenue between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $13.50 and $13.90.
