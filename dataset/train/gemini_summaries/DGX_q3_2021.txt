Quest Diagnostics reported strong Q3 results, with COVID-19 molecular volumes increasing throughout the summer. Despite softness in the base business in late summer, it rebounded in September and continued to improve sequentially, indicating ongoing recovery. The company raised its full-year outlook due to higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes and base business growth. Key points include: total revenue between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share between $13.50 and $13.90, and reported earnings per share between $14.69 and $15.09. The company assumes continued decline in COVID-19 molecular volumes, stable reimbursement rates, and low single-digit base business revenue growth in Q4. Quest's momentum in its base business positions it to achieve its 2022 outlook.
