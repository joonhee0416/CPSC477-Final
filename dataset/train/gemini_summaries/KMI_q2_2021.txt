Kinder Morgan, characterized by strong cash flow generation, has announced two strategic acquisitions: Stagecoach, expanding its natural gas storage and pipeline network, and Kinetrex, marking its entry into the renewable natural gas (RNG) market. Both acquisitions meet the company's investment criteria and leverage internally generated cash. The Stagecoach acquisition is particularly promising due to the increasing value of storage and transportation assets in light of intermittent renewable energy sources. The Kinetrex acquisition provides a platform for exploring the rapidly growing RNG market, mitigating price volatility through potential partnerships and long-term contracts. Despite an impairment charge, Kinder Morgan's second-quarter financial performance was solid. Overall, the company experienced increased demand in its natural gas, refined products, terminals, and steel businesses. Higher commodity prices and better volumes contributed to its strong performance. Projected 2021 DCF reached $5.4 billion, exceeding previous estimates. Kinder Morgan remains committed to dividend growth and expects to end 2021 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0.
