Darden reported positive results for fiscal 2021 Q3, showcasing the effectiveness of its "Back to Basics" strategy and competitive advantages. Despite sales declines, Olive Garden's segment profit margin improved due to operational simplifications and reduced marketing expenses. While LongHorn faced margin pressure due to higher beef inflation and investments, Darden generated over $240 million in free cash flow, enabling them to restore their pre-COVID dividend level. The company also announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization and provided a Q4 outlook with total sales expected at approximately $2.1 billion and diluted net earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, Darden anticipates total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million, the opening of 35 net new restaurants, and an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13%.
