Brunswick Corporation's outstanding performance continued in Q2 2021, driven by strong retail demand and exceptional operational execution. All business segments posted robust growth, with Propulsion gaining market share in outboard engines and Parts & Accessories benefiting from a surge in boating activities. The Boat segment delivered another quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margins. Despite supply chain challenges, Brunswick has efficiently managed disruptions and maintained production schedules. The company has increased its 2021 guidance, projecting adjusted operating margin growth of 150-180 basis points, net sales between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $8. Brunswick's favorable demographic trends, including a younger and more diverse boat buyer base, position the company for future growth. The expansion of its product and brand portfolio through the acquisition of Navico further strengthens its ACES strategy. With robust retail demand and strong production plans in place, Brunswick anticipates a positive second half of 2021 and continued growth in the years to come.
