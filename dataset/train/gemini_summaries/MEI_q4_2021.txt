Methode Electronics reported a strong fourth quarter with $301 million in sales, representing a 37% organic growth against a pandemic-impacted prior year. Despite supply chain headwinds, the company met the high end of its sales guidance. EV sales continued to grow, reaching over 13% of consolidated sales. Strong awards across key areas, including EV, LED lighting, and cloud computing, fueled growth. Methode's solid balance sheet, with $31 million in free cash flow, $233.2 million in cash, and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio near zero, provides financial flexibility for continued investment and return to shareholders. The company announced a stock buyback program and a 27% dividend increase. Despite challenges, Methode anticipates continued cash flow generation and expects free cash flow in fiscal 2022. Fiscal year guidance includes revenue ranging from $1.175 billion to $1.235 billion and earnings per share ranging from $3.35 to $3.75.
