Agilent ended 2020 with strong results, posting revenue of $1.48 billion, up 8% reported and 6% core. All three business groups experienced growth, with the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) and the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) growing high-single digits, and the Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) growing 9% both reported and core. Despite the impact of COVID-19, which contributed over 2 points to core growth, the company remains resilient, resulting in a 10% increase in EPS to $0.98. For fiscal 2021, Agilent expects 5-7% reported growth and 4-6% core growth, with revenue between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion. DGG is expected to lead the growth with high-single-digit growth, while ACG is expected to return to its historical high-single-digit growth, and LSAG is forecast to grow low-to-mid single digits. The company anticipates operating margin expansion of 50-70 basis points, and double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth to between $3.57 and $3.67 per share.
