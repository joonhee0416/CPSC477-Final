In Q3, ICE reported record revenue of $1.8 billion, a 34% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $1.30, and the highest third quarter ever for the company. Net revenues increased 11% year-over-year, with growth in all segments. Total transaction revenues grew 13%, and recurring revenues, which now account for nearly half of the business, increased by 10%. Adjusted operating expenses were $755 million, or $720 million after adjusting for Bakkt expenses. ICE expects full-year results to be strong, despite increased expenses in Q4 related to Bakkt and performance-related compensation. The company's strong cash flow allowed it to reduce leverage to 3.25x at the end of September, enabling it to resume share repurchases with up to $250 million in Q4. ICE also agreed to sell its stake in Euroclear for $820 million, with plans to determine the use of proceeds closer to closing. Overall, ICE's strategic investments, innovative solutions, and capital allocation strategy position it for continued growth in the future.
