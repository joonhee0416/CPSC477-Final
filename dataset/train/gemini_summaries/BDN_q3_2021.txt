Brandywine Realty Trust reports a solid third quarter with FFO of $0.35 per share, $0.01 above consensus estimates. The portfolio occupancy rate increased to approximately 35%, with tenant return expanding beyond small employers. The company has reduced its forward rollover exposure to an average of 6.8% through 2024. Revenue and earnings growth remain a priority, with several key vacancies targeted for lease-up that could generate significant growth. The company has leased approximately 46% of its targeted vacancy, resulting in a cash mark-to-market of 12% and a GAAP mark-to-market of 19%. Same-store NOI was positive for both the quarter and year-to-date, with tenants scheduled to take occupancy later this year expected to accelerate growth. The company expects to achieve its year-end debt-to-EBITDA target of 6.3 to 6.5 times. Leasing velocity metrics are encouraging, with a growing pipeline and a conversion rate on par with previous quarters. The company continues to see favorable trends, such as demand for higher-quality space and tenants expanding their premises. Brandywine maintains excellent liquidity, with approximately $515 million expected to be available on its line of credit by year-end. The dividend remains well-covered, with a 54% FFO payout ratio and an 81% CAD payout ratio. The company's development pipeline continues to progress, with several projects underway, including 250 King of Prussia Road, Schuylkill Yards, 405 Colorado in Austin, 3000 Market Street in Philadelphia, and Cira Labs. Brandywine anticipates further compression of decision timelines and continued positive mark-to-markets driven by improving market conditions and the necessity of higher rents. The company is focused on building cash flow and revenue diversification through its life science platform and expects to have over a million square feet of life science space operating or under construction by next year.
