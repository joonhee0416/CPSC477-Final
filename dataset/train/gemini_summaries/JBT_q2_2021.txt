JBT delivered strong second-quarter results amid ongoing macro challenges, including rising costs and supply chain constraints. FoodTech revenue surged 19% year-over-year to $361 million, primarily driven by higher-than-expected shipments. AeroTech saw a 6% annual revenue increase to $115 million, exceeding expectations due to a favorable mix of recurring revenue. Diluted earnings per share reached $0.95, while adjusted earnings per share, excluding a non-cash deferred tax adjustment, was $1.19. JBT also recorded robust cash flow of $35 million and completed the strategic acquisition of Prevenio to strengthen its food safety portfolio. The company noted continued strength in retail automation solutions and an initial recovery in commercial airline orders within FoodTech and AeroTech, respectively. However, JBT remains cautious regarding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions and the resurgence of COVID-19.
