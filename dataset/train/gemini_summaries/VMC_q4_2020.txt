Vulcan Materials Company reported a solid financial performance in 2020, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by 4% and EBITDA margin expanding by 150 basis points. This growth was driven by higher average selling prices, effective cost control, and improvements in non-aggregates business segments. The company's cash generation remained strong, with operating cash flows increasing by 9%. Despite a 3% decline in annual aggregates volume, Vulcan's cash gross profit per ton increased by 5.5%. The company expects 2021 to be a year of solid earnings growth, supported by strength in residential construction and highway construction. Vulcan plans to invest between $450 million and $475 million in capital expenditures in 2021, including restarting and advancing previously delayed growth projects. The company's financial position remains strong, with a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.6 times. Vulcan returned $206 million to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases in 2020.
