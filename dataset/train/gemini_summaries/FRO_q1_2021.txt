Frontline achieved notable financial results in Q1 '21, posting a net income of $28.9 million or $0.15 per share despite market uncertainties. The company's strategic focus on spot exposure and its modern, fuel-efficient fleet allowed it to generate strong earnings in VLCC, Suezmax, and LR2/Aframax fleets. Frontline anticipates a 6% growth in global GDP and expects key shipping sectors to exhibit a cyclical recovery. The tanker order book remains low at 7% of the existing fleet, and asset prices have increased due to yard capacity constraints and rising steel prices. The company's cash breakeven rates are estimated at $21,500 per day for VLCCs, $17,700 per day for Suezmax tankers, and $15,900 per day for LR2 tankers. Frontline's vaccination efforts for its seafarers are well underway, and the company remains optimistic about capitalizing on the expected tanker market recovery.
