Despite bankruptcies and restructurings leading to higher vacancies, the company seized opportunities to diversify and upgrade its tenant mix. The financial strategy remains conservative, with ample liquidity exceeding $680 million and no significant debt maturities until December 2023. The dividend was reinstated in January. Core FFO guidance for 2021 is estimated between $1.47 and $1.57 per share, incorporating potential lease terminations and vacancies. Despite ongoing pandemic uncertainties, the company is actively exploring growth opportunities and managing capital allocation prudently. Rent collections remain strong, with 95% of Q4 rents collected. The company maintains a disciplined approach to operational performance and anticipates some variability in quarterly results due to the pandemic's impact and winter storms.
