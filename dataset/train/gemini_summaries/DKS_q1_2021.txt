DICK's Sporting Goods reported a remarkable quarter with record earnings and a 115% increase in same-store sales, driven by strong demand in golf, outdoor activities, and home fitness. eCommerce sales also surged by 14%, contributing to an overall 119% revenue growth. The company's strategic investments in omnichannel capabilities, including curbside pickup and enhanced in-store experiences, have proven successful. DICK's is also expanding its vertical brand portfolio and introducing new concepts like DICK's House of Sport to enhance customer engagement. In response to the increased interest in golf, the company is investing in its Golf Galaxy business with TrackMan technology, remodeled stores, and talent investments. The company has raised its full-year guidance, forecasting consolidated same-store sales growth of 8% to 11% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $8 to $8.70. Despite supply chain pressures, DICK's has maintained its strong financial position and plans to continue investing in its growth initiatives, including a minimum of $200 million in share repurchases in 2021.
