Watsco reported record-breaking financial results in its third quarter, driven by a 25% increase in EPS to $2.76. Sales, gross profit, operating profit, operating margins, and net income all reached record highs. Strong growth in the U.S. residential HVAC equipment business (19%) and operating efficiencies contributed to the results. The company attributes its success to increased adoption of its Watsco technologies, which have led to faster growth among users and minimal attrition. Investments in mobile apps (31% increase in weekly users), e-commerce transactions (19% growth), and dockside pickup services (12,000 orders fulfilled) have accelerated digital adoption. Innovative platforms like OnCall Air and CreditForComfort have also gained momentum, with OnCall Air generating $114 million in sales through digital proposals and CreditForComfort doubling its digital financing applications. Inventory management software improvements have boosted inventory turns by 25 basis points. The company's strong balance sheet, with no debt and record operating cash flow of $373 million, provides ample capacity for future growth in the $40 billion industry it operates in.
