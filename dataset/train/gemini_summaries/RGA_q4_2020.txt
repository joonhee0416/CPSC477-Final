RGA reported solid quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share, despite absorbing $300 million in COVID-19 claims. Underlying business strength in Asia, US health operations, and asset-intensive business contributed to profitability. Premium growth was robust, driven by EMEA and Asia, while US mortality experience remained favorable. The company deployed $100 million in capital during the quarter and maintained a strong balance sheet with excess capital of $1.3 billion. Full-year adjusted operating EPS was $7.54, including $720 million in estimated COVID-19 claims, and the impact of COVID-19 on adjusted operating EPS was approximately $6.80. Despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges, the company expects to see a manageable impact in the first half of 2021, with normalization of results expected later in the year. RGA remains optimistic about the benefits of global vaccination programs and believes it will emerge from the pandemic well-positioned for future growth and value creation.
