Prosperity Bancshares reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2020, with earnings increasing 59.1% to $130.9 million or $1.41 per share. The integration of Legacy provided significant growth, as loans increased by $10.4 billion (98.6%) to $21.025 billion. Net interest income before provision for credit losses surged 67.2% to $259 million, driven by the merger and loan discount accretion. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, nonperforming assets remained manageable at $77.9 million (28 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets), and net charge-offs were $13 million, primarily related to specific reserves acquired in the merger. The efficiency ratio was slightly elevated at 46.56% due to one-time merger expenses, but excluding these expenses, it would have been 43.97%. The company's loan portfolio is well-diversified, with 39% fixed-rate loans, 36% floating-rate loans, and 25% loans resetting at specific intervals, and further cost savings are expected in the third quarter.
