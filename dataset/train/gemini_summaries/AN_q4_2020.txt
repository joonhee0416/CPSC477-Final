AutoNation reported record quarterly earnings per share of $2.43, a 94% increase from the previous year. Same-store revenue increased by 5% due to growth in new and used vehicle sales, partially offset by a decline in customer care services. Gross profit per vehicle retailed increased significantly, driven by both new and used vehicles. Adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit improved by 820 basis points. The company announced an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available for share repurchases to $1.1 billion. AutoNation is on track to open five new AutoNation USA stores by year-end and plans to open 10 additional stores in 2022. The company aims to retail over 1 million combined new and used vehicles annually and has enhanced its AutoNation Express digital retailing platform. With strong demand exceeding supply, AutoNation expects industry sales to approach $16 million in 2021.
