Greenhill reported a second-quarter revenue of $43.2 million and a loss per share of $0.45. Revenue for the year-to-date was 2% lower than the previous year due to smaller deal sizes. However, the company has been winning a significant number of new assignments and has seen a record number of transaction announcements, indicating a strong M&A market. The company expects deal sizes and fee events to increase in the second half, leading to an improvement in full-year revenue. Greenhill is also expanding its services into financing advisory and primary fundraising, aiming to diversify revenue streams. The company has been making strategic hires and reducing costs, and despite a higher compensation ratio, it intends to bring the ratio within its target range by paying increased compensation in absolute terms. Additionally, with reduced debt and a lower share count, the company anticipates magnified benefits from increased revenue in terms of net income and shareholder value creation.
