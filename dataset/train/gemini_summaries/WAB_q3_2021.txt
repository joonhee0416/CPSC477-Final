Wabtec Corporation reported strong financial results in the third quarter of 2021, surpassing expectations. Despite challenges in the supply chain and rising costs, the company achieved adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, a 20% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 2.2% to $1.91 billion, driven by strong growth in freight services and components. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 17%, reflecting improved mix, productivity, and cost actions. Wabtec has also realized synergies of $50 million, a full year ahead of schedule. The company continues to forecast strong cash flow generation and expects approximately $1 billion for the full year. However, Wabtec faces headwinds in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions, increasing metal costs, and labor shortages. To mitigate these challenges, the company is triggering price escalations, implementing price surcharges, and aggressively managing costs. Despite these challenges, Wabtec remains optimistic about long-term profitable growth in the rail sector.
