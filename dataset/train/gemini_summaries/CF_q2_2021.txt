CF Industries reported strong financial results for the first half of 2021, driven by increased demand for nitrogen fertilizers and favorable energy spreads. Adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 25% to $997 million, supported by higher nitrogen prices. The company noted that unfair trade practices have negatively impacted the UAN industry in the United States, leading to the petitioning of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations. Looking ahead, CF expects continued strong demand for nitrogen over the next two years due to agricultural and industrial growth. Favorable energy curves and low global fertilizer inventory are expected to support elevated pricing and margins. The company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $500 million in 2021 and is committed to improving its financial position and executing its clean energy initiatives, including the production of blue and green ammonia.
