Cabot's exceptional Q1 financial performance highlights record earnings per share ($1.18) and segment EBIT ($140 million). Strong demand and unit margins drove results, particularly in automotive and infrastructure sectors. Despite some channel replenishment, favorable underlying market trends and global growth, especially in China's strong economy, inspire optimism. The company expects EBIT growth in all segments during Q2, with adjusted earnings per share ranging from $0.90 to $1.00. However, challenges persist, including uncertain vaccine distribution, global logistics constraints, and pricing movements. Cabot's strong execution and commitment to sustainability position it well for future success.
