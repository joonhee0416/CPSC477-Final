Despite a challenging operating environment, ITW delivered solid financial performance in Q4 2019, with a 9% increase in GAAP EPS to $1.99 and a 10 basis point increase in operating margin (excluding higher restructuring expenses). For the full year, ITW generated record GAAP EPS of $7.74, expanded its operating margin to 24.4%, and grew its free cash flow by 9%. In 2020, ITW anticipates GAAP EPS in the range of $7.65 to $8.05, with an organic growth forecast of 0% to 2% and an expected operating margin expansion to 24.5% to 25%. ITW's focus on executing its enterprise strategy and completing its "Finish the Job" agenda is expected to drive further growth and improvement in the year ahead. Key factors impacting 2020 include the COVID-19 situation in China (factored in with guidance assuming a resumption of work on February 10), divestiture impacts, and a 10 basis point EPS headwind due to a higher expected tax rate.
