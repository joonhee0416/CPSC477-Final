Alamo Group reported a 3.8% decline in fourth-quarter sales to $288.6 million. Despite the pandemic's impact on manufacturing and supply chains, full-year sales reached a record $1.16 billion, a 4% increase, largely due to acquisitions. Net income dropped 16% on a GAAP basis in Q4 but remained stable on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.6% for the full year, and operating cash flow surged by 108% to a record $184.3 million. The company's backlog remains robust, with a 35.6% increase to $354.1 million. While the Industrial Division faced challenges due to COVID-19, the Agricultural Division performed well, supported by increased government subsidies and low dealer inventories. Despite ongoing pandemic-related headwinds such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and weather-related closures, Alamo Group remains optimistic about 2021 due to positive market momentum and ongoing operational improvements.
