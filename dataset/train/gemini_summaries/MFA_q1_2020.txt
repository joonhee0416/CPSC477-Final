MFA Financial (MFA) reported a successful transition to remote operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company implemented forbearance plans to provide time for balance sheet and liquidity management. Asset sales during April generated over $150 million of realized gains, enabling MFA to reduce book value erosion. To secure more durable financing, MFA pursued third-party capital, resulting in $500 million raised from Apollo and Athene and a $1.65 billion committed term borrowing facility. The company expects to declare and pay accumulated dividends on preferred stock once these transactions close. Regarding common stock dividends, MFA has $0.05 per share of undistributed REIT taxable income from 2019 and an estimated $0.10 per share for Q1 2020. The Board will consider these factors in determining future dividend policy. Unrestricted cash was $242 million as of June 12, and both GAAP and economic book value increased slightly from March 31.
