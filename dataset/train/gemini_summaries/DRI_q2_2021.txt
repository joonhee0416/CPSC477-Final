Darden Restaurants, despite facing sales and capacity challenges, reported a decrease of 19.4% in total sales, and a decrease of 20.6% in same-restaurant sales in Q3. However, the company's emphasis on employee safety, operation execution, technology deployment, and business model transformation has allowed it to maintain strong profitability. In Q3, total sales reached $1.7 billion, and diluted net earnings per share were $0.74. Moving into Q3, the company faces uncertainty in sales trends due to dining room closures and capacity limitations. Based on these factors, Darden anticipates total sales to range between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million, and diluted net earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.75. Despite these headwinds, the company remains optimistic about its long-term potential, aiming to achieve 100% of pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales.
