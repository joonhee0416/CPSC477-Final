The company experienced a record start to fiscal year '22, driven by strong base business growth (5%) and a surge in travel-related sales ($25 million increase). This resulted in record sales, excluding the divested Household Cleaning business. Despite changes in consumer habits, the company's brand-building strategy and category rebounds boosted revenues by 17% over the previous year, with travel-related brands like Dramamine and Clear Eyes showing significant recovery. Gross margin increased to 59.1% due to higher sales and favorable product mix, while advertising and marketing expenses normalized. Diluted earnings per share grew 32.5% to $1.14, driven by higher sales and lower interest expense. The company raised its fiscal year '22 guidance, anticipating revenues of $1.045 billion or more and adjusted earnings per share of $3.90 or more, factoring in the acquisition of Akorn Consumer Health. The company also expects strong free cash flow of $245 million or more for the year, with a debt leverage ratio of approximately four times by year-end fiscal '22.
