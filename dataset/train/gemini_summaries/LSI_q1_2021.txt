Life Storage reported a successful first quarter with record occupancy reaching 94%, resulting in a 20% increase in net effective rates. The company's same-store revenue surged by 7.3% year-over-year, driven by strong move-in rates exceeding move-out rates. Same-store net operating income increased by an impressive 8.6%. Life Storage remains active in acquisitions, with 33 stores acquired or under contract. The company also saw growth in its third-party platform and its Warehouse Anywhere and Lightspeed products. Based on this performance, Life Storage has raised its guidance for the year, expecting adjusted funds from operations per share to be between $4.33 and $4.41, reflecting an increase of more than 3%. The company's strong financial position, with a net debt to recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times and $457 million in available credit, supports its continued growth and acquisition strategy.
