Despite operating in a volatile environment, Energizer exceeded $3 billion in net sales in 2021, with 7.3% organic sales growth and strong adjusted earnings per share and EBITDA growth due to elevated demand and distribution gains, as well as cost savings. The company expects flat organic revenue in 2022, with growth in auto care offsetting declines in battery sales. Despite pricing actions, rising input costs may lead to a 150 basis point gross margin headwind, resulting in adjusted earnings per share between $3.00 to $3.30 and adjusted EBITDA between $560 million to $590 million. Energizer's categories remain healthy with solid growth compared to pre-pandemic levels, and the company continues to invest in its brands, resulting in increased market share. The company also entered into a $75 million accelerated share repurchase program in Q4 2021.
