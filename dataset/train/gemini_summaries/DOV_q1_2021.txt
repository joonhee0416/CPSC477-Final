Dover Corporation reported a 13% increase in total revenue, driven by strong order backlogs and increased demand. The company's order rates outpaced revenue, resulting in a 27% increase in bookings, with growth across all five segments. This led to a seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion. Despite inflationary pressures, Dover maintained strong profitability with a consolidated adjusted segment margin of 19.1%, due to volume leverage, favorable product mix, and efficiency initiatives. Based on this performance, Dover revised its annual guidance to a revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting robust demand and operational execution. The company's key segments, such as Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, saw significant growth, and Dover expects continued demand improvement in Engineered Products and gradual recovery in Industrial Winches and Waste Hauling. Overall, Dover remains optimistic about the year, citing a solid order backlog and its ability to navigate supply chain challenges, contributing to double-digit earnings per share growth in line with its long-term targets.
