IDEX Corporation experienced challenges with material availability, labor, and logistics during Q3. Despite these obstacles, the company set records for orders, sales, and backlog. Demand for the Health Science and Technologies segment has increased, with recent acquisitions performing well. However, expenses were slightly higher than expected. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 are expected to range from $1.55 to $1.58, with organic revenue growth of 9-10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Full-year earnings per share guidance has been narrowed to $6.30 to $6.33, maintaining 11-12% organic growth and operating margins of approximately 24%. Due to working capital investments, free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income. The company is committed to transparency in reporting adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization beginning in 2022.
