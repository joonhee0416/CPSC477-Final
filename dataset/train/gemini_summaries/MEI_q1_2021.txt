During the first quarter, Methode experienced a 29.3% decline in sales and a 26.9% decrease in net income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, the company reported operational efficiency initiatives that helped mitigate the negative impact, resulting in a decremental net income margin of 10% (19% without a discrete tax benefit of $7.8 million). Notably, the automotive sector showed signs of recovery, with a strong quarter for awards in EV and hybrid applications. Additionally, Methode anticipates a high-single digit percentage of fiscal 2021 consolidated sales to come from EV and hybrid programs. The company incurred $3.4 million in restructuring expenses in the first quarter and expects an additional $2 million in expenses in the second quarter. Methode's EBITDA decreased to $29.3 million, reflecting headwinds from the pandemic and restructuring expenses. The company's $211 million in cash reserves and reduced gross debt of $108 million provide a strong financial position. For the second quarter, Methode projects revenue between $230 million and $250 million.
