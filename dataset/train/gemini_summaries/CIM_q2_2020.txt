Chimera Investment Corporation experienced a challenging first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the company took strategic actions to retain its high-yielding mortgage credit portfolio, which has enabled it to continue paying dividends. Chimera executed several transactions, including a $374 million convertible bond issuance, a $400 million revolving loan facility, and three mortgage securitizations totaling over $1 billion. These actions have strengthened the balance sheet, reduced mark-to-market risk, and improved risk metrics. The company's portfolio of legacy assets is expected to become more valuable as the Federal Reserve continues to buy assets, and returns in the market remain low. Financial highlights for the second quarter include a GAAP book value of $10.63 per share, a GAAP net loss of $73 million or $0.37 per share, and a core net income of $76 million or $0.32 per share. Chimera's economic net interest income for the quarter was $121 million, with a yield on interest-earning assets of 5.7% and an average cost of funds of 3.3%. The company has $850 million in cash and unencumbered assets, providing ample dry powder for new investment opportunities.
