Darden Restaurants delivered a strong first quarter with sales up 4.8% year-over-year despite the Delta variant impact in August. All segments reported record profits, driven by increased sales and operational efficiencies. Olive Garden remained flat compared to pre-COVID levels, while LongHorn and Fine Dining saw significant sales increases of 26% and 24%, respectively. The Other segment also performed well, with 5% sales growth and strong profit margin improvement. The company increased its fiscal 2022 guidance, now expecting total sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 27% to 30%, and diluted net earnings per share between $7.25 and $7.60. The company's competitive advantages, including scale, data insights, and operational focus, continue to drive profitability and growth amid inflationary pressures.
