Packaging Corporation of America reported strong second-quarter results, with $207 million in net income and $2.17 per share, driven by increased prices, higher volume, and lower pension expenses. The Packaging segment recorded record box shipments, supported by effective price increases. Despite inflationary pressures and freight challenges, the company's efficiency initiatives and strong demand resulted in a 24% EBITDA margin. In the Paper segment, volume growth offset lower prices, and management remains cautiously optimistic about paper demand. Looking ahead, third-quarter earnings per share are projected at $2.37, reflecting continued demand in the Packaging segment and inflationary impacts on costs. The company has sufficient liquidity and plans to implement previously announced price increases to mitigate escalating costs.
