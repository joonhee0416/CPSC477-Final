In Q3, SolarWinds reported a revenue beat of $181.3 million, exceeding the high end of their outlook. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded expectations at $75.3 million, representing a 42% margin. Maintenance revenue remained a challenge, declining 6% year-over-year due to lower license sales and a reduced renewal rate. However, the renewal rate is improving, currently standing at 88%. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year, driven by SentryOne products and on-premise subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA margin reached 42%, despite ongoing investments in Secure by Design initiatives and sales and marketing. The company expects a high single-digit increase in subscription revenue in Q4. For the full year, SolarWinds estimates total revenue between $712 million and $716 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $297 million and $299 million. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $1.14 to $1.15 for the full year.
