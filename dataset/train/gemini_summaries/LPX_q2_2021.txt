LP Building Solutions reported a strong Q2 with record sales and EBITDA in all segments. Siding Solutions revenue surged by 39%, driven by volume and price growth, including gains from innovative products like SmartSide Smooth and ExpertFinish. OSB prices remain volatile, pulling back recently, but the segment still saw growth in Structural Solutions. South America also had a stellar quarter, with doubling sales and tripling EBITDA. LP anticipates continued growth in Siding Solutions with Q3 revenue projected to be 10% higher than Q3 2020, although capacity constraints may hinder further growth. However, OSB revenue is expected to decline sequentially by 10% in Q3, and potential supply chain issues and inflationary pressures could impact results. Despite these challenges, LP expects Q3 EBITDA to exceed $530 million, driven by strong order backlog and cost-cutting measures. LP remains committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders, repurchasing $481 million in shares during Q2, and has increased its quarterly dividend by 13%.
