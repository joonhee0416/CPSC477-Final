Despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges, Vail Resorts reported strong results for the third fiscal quarter, with net income rising to $274.6 million from $152.5 million in the prior year. The company's focus on cost control contributed to a 52% resort-reported EBITDA margin, exceeding the prior-year period and fiscal 2019. Pass sales exceeded expectations, with a 10% price decrease resulting in higher renewal rates and increased trade up to higher-value passes. Future investments include a 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in Beaver Creek and a $15 per hour minimum wage increase in Colorado, Utah, Washington, and California. For fiscal 2021, net income is projected to be between $93 million and $139 million, with resort-reported EBITDA estimated at $530-$570 million. Despite potential COVID-19-related shutdowns, current demand trends remain positive for the company.
