Waste Connections witnessed remarkable growth in Q2, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA surging 17.5% and 23%, respectively, year-over-year. Strong pricing volume growth (11.4%) and recovered commodity values contributed to this success. Encouraged by these trends, the company has raised its full-year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow. Notably, in 2021, they have acquired 14 businesses with a combined annual revenue of approximately $115 million. Regarding Q3 expectations, revenue is projected to reach $1.56 billion, with solid waste price plus volume growth estimated at 7%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be $495 million (31.7% of revenue), reflecting continued margin expansion despite cost pressures. The company remains optimistic about acquisition activity and is well-positioned to return capital to shareholders, having already repurchased over $400 million in 2021. With the recent increase in its credit facility capacity, Waste Connections is poised for further growth and margin improvement in the second half of the year.
