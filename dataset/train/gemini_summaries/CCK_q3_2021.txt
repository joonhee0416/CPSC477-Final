Crown's Q3 earnings saw a decline in earnings per share to $0.79 compared to $1.59 in the same quarter of the previous year. Despite this, adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.03. Net sales rose by 17% due to higher material costs and increased beverage can and transit packaging volumes. Segment income also improved to $379 million, driven by higher sales volume. Crown's Q4 adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.50 and $1.55, while full-year adjusted earnings are estimated to be $7.50 to $7.55 per share. Demand remained strong across all product lines and geographies, with the exception of Vietnam due to COVID-related lockdowns. Crown continues to face inflationary pressures, but expects 2022 to be another strong year for earnings growth, with EBITDA estimated to be around $2 billion. The company has recently completed and is still building several capacity projects and plans to continue investing in growth.
