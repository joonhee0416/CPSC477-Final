In Q3, Manitowoc achieved $390 million in orders, a 10% increase driven by crawler crane demand in the Americas and mobile crane projects in the MEAP segment. Despite a 21% decline in net sales, excellent cost management resulted in a positive flow-through of 19%. Adjusted EPS reached $0.10, surpassing the loss per share of $0.01. With $397 million in total liquidity, the company is well-positioned for cyclical market fluctuations. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the industry, Manitowoc is experiencing a recovery in Europe, mixed sentiment in MEAP, and concerns in the Americas. To accelerate future growth, Manitowoc is developing new products, exploring rental fleet initiatives, and pursuing organic and inorganic growth opportunities in less volatile crane segments.
