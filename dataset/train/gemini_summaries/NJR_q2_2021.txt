NJR's earnings call revealed strong financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Notably, the standout performance of Energy Services, due to increased demand for natural gas during the February weather event, led to an upward revision in NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share, representing an increase of $0.20. Energy Services saw a $94 million improvement in NFE, primarily driven by higher financial margins. In addition, New Jersey Natural Gas filed a rate case to recover infrastructure investments and received approval for its SAVEGREEN 2020 energy efficiency program. Clean Energy Ventures has a strong project pipeline, aiming to double its installed capacity by the end of fiscal 2024. Adelphia Gateway is progressing, with all necessary permits secured and construction underway. Despite some project delays, capital allocation plans remain largely unaffected, with minimal impact on NFE guidance. The company's cash flow remains strong, and its investment-grade credit rating has been affirmed.
