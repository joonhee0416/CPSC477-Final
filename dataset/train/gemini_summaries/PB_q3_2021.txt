Prosperity Bancshares reported net income of $128.6 million for the third quarter of 2021, a modest decrease from the prior year's $130 million. Despite this slight decline, the company increased its dividend by 6.1% to $0.52. Prosperity's strong operating metrics include a return on tangible equity of 16.2% and a return on assets of 1.42%. The bank's loan portfolio experienced a decrease, primarily due to a reduction in nonperforming assets, but saw growth in areas excluding Dallas-Fort Worth. Deposits continued to rise, potentially driven by government benefits and increased savings. Nonperforming assets declined year-over-year by 47.4%. The company expects noninterest expense to remain in line with the current quarter or between $118 million and $120 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.
