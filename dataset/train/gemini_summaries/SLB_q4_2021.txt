Schlumberger concluded 2021 with strong Q4 financial performance, posting their sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth and delivering strong margins. Geographically, North American revenue surged over 20% while international revenues climbed 12% year-over-year. All four divisions recorded sequential and year-over-year growth, with Digital Integration leading the charge with double-digit growth. Despite seasonality effects, operating margins continued to expand. As a result, free cash flow surpassed $1.9 billion for the quarter. In 2021, the company fully implemented its return-focused strategy, resulting in significant margin expansion in both North America and internationally. Digital operations also saw substantial growth, with over 240 commercial DELFI customers by year-end. Looking ahead to 2022, Schlumberger anticipates double-digit returns on capital employed, sales, and free cash flow margins. The company plans to invest $1.9 to $2 billion in capital, allowing them to seize growth opportunities and maintain their double-digit free cash flow margin objective. However, the company emphasized that they are less capital-intensive compared to previous growth cycles, enabling them to benefit from enhanced margins and return on capital employed.
