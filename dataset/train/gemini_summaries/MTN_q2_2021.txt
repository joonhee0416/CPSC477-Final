Despite COVID-19 challenges, Vail Resorts saw strong visitation for the quarter, with a 5% decline from last year. Season pass unit sales increased by 20%, resulting in a solid demand baseline. However, ancillary services like food and beverage and ski school remain impacted by capacity constraints. Resort EBITDA margin stood at 40.3% compared to 40.9% last year. Net income reached $147.8 million, down from $206.4 million, due to a $240.1 million decrease in revenue. Season-to-date skier visits and lift revenue decreased by 8.2% and 8.9%, respectively. Ski school, dining, and retail/rental revenue suffered due to COVID-19 restrictions. Vail anticipates fiscal 2021 net income between $204 million and $247 million and resort reported EBITDA between $560 million and $600 million for the nine months ending April 30, 2021. The company remains committed to reinvesting in resorts, with a capital plan of $115 million to $120 million for calendar year 2021.
