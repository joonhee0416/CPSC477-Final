Raytheon Technologies reported strong financial results for Q2 2021, exceeding expectations for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. The company's sales reached $15.9 billion, up 10% organically, driven by the resurgence in commercial aerospace and continued growth in defense. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 benefited from commercial aftermarket surge, contract-related settlements, and better-than-expected performance in several segments. Raytheon raised its full-year sales outlook to $64.4-$65.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share range to $3.85-$4.00, reflecting improved commercial aftermarket volumes, cost reductions, and a favorable tax optimization. The company also increased its synergy target to $1.5 billion and reported strong bookings and backlogs across its defense segments. Despite strong demand in domestic markets, international air traffic recovery remains slower than anticipated, impacting commercial aftermarket growth expectations. However, Raytheon remains optimistic about its ability to grow its defense businesses, capitalize on its strong franchises, and achieve operational excellence through cost reduction initiatives.
