Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's and Maggiano's, reported strong third-quarter results and provided a positive outlook for the final quarter of fiscal 2021. Despite pandemic-related challenges, Chili's sales have rebounded, with three-quarters of restaurants generating positive results. Off-premise business remains strong, and the company expects both dine-in and takeout to exceed pre-pandemic levels. Maggiano's, while still impacted by a lack of banquets, is also seeing improvements in dining room sales. The company expects total revenues for the fourth quarter to range from $950 million to $1 billion, with adjusted earnings per diluted share estimated at $1.55 to $1.70. Brinker remains confident in its ability to navigate the current labor market challenges and continues to invest in its digital capabilities and restaurant development.
