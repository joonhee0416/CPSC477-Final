Herbalife's Q3 net sales recorded a 6% decline to $1.4 billion amid challenging comparisons, but two-year stacked growth remained positive at 15%. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted EPS surpassed guidance at $1.21, representing a 5% increase from the previous year. The decline in net sales was primarily attributed to fewer new distributors and preferred customers entering the business. However, the number of sales leaders actively selling experienced a 10% uptick. Regional performance varied, with Asia Pacific posting double-digit growth led by India's strength, while North America and EMEA faced year-over-year comparisons. SG&A expenses increased slightly due to price increases and transformation initiatives. The company reiterated its fiscal year 2021 guidance, which implies annual records for sales, adjusted EPS, and EBITDA. Additionally, Herbalife announced an accelerated share repurchase program, completing approximately $162 million in Q3. The company's financial position remains strong with $678 million in cash on hand.
