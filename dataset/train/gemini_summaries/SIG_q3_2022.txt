Signet delivered a record-breaking third quarter, with total sales of $1.5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.43. The company's strong performance was driven by increased connected commerce capabilities, improved advertising, and a more efficient operating model. Notably, the company saw a 19% increase in same-store sales compared to the previous year and anticipates continued growth in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales estimates ranging from 6% to 9%. Signet's financial strength has led to improved liquidity and working capital management, enabling it to invest in strategic initiatives and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company remains confident in the sustainability of its growth, citing fundamental changes in its operating model, including data analytics, banner portfolio differentiation, improved inventory management, and cost savings. Despite ongoing challenges, Signet believes it is well-positioned for a strong holiday season.
