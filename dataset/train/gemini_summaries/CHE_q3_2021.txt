Chemed Corporation reported solid performance for both its VITAS and Roto-Rooter subsidiaries in Q3 2021. While VITAS's revenue declined by 5.8% due to a decrease in days of care and a shift in acuity mix, Roto-Rooter's revenue increased by 15.7% driven by strong demand for residential services, particularly in plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, and water restoration. Despite challenges in managing labor costs and disruptions to senior housing referrals, VITAS's margins are expected to remain stable thanks to the natural hedge provided by Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement based on inflation. Roto-Rooter also anticipates passing on inflationary price increases in Q4. Both VITAS and Roto-Rooter remain well-positioned for continued growth in the post-pandemic environment. Chemed repurchased 350,000 shares of its stock in Q3 and updated its full-year 2021 guidance, with adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding non-cash expenses now estimated at $19.00 to $19.20, above the initial guidance of $17.00 to $17.50.
