Humana reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for Q3 2021, surpassing consensus estimates. Despite strong underlying fundamentals, the company adjusted its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind of 1% below baseline in Q4. This adjustment is attributed to higher-than-anticipated COVID costs driven by hospitalizations, partially offset by favorable non-COVID utilization. The company also updated its individual Medicare Advantage membership growth guidance to 450,000 members for 2021, representing 11.4% growth. Looking ahead to 2022, Humana anticipates a conservative initial earnings per share guidance within the low end of its long-term growth range (11%-15%) and expects COVID to be net neutral to the Medicare business. The company remains committed to its healthcare service platform, including the ongoing integration of Kindred at Home, and plans to provide additional disclosure on the performance of these businesses in future reporting periods.
