In Q2, the company reported strong financial performance with sales rising to $2.2 billion and diluted earnings per share surging to $3.20. The backlog reached $48 billion, including $24 billion in funded backlog. New contract awards totaled $1.2 billion, including $107 million for LHA 9 and $724 million for planning yard services for amphibious ships. The acquisition of Alion Science and Technology is expected to enhance the company's capabilities in defense and federal solutions, providing significant growth potential. Ingalls Shipbuilding experienced 7.7% revenue growth, primarily driven by the DDG program and amphibious assault ships. Newport News Shipbuilding revenues increased 21.5% due to higher revenues in submarine and aircraft carrier construction. Technical Solutions revenue decreased 25.9%, mainly due to the oil and gas business divestiture, but operating income increased due to higher equity income and improved performance in defense and federal solutions. Overall, the company is optimistic about its outlook for the remaining year, expecting a shipbuilding margin in the 7.5% to 8% range and the completion of the Alion acquisition in the coming weeks.
