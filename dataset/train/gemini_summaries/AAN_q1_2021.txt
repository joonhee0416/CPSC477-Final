In the first quarter of 2021, the company reported strong results with a 11.1% increase in consolidated revenue to $1.725 billion, driven by 14.8% same-store revenue growth. The revenue increase was supported by enhancements in operations and digital platforms, including centralized decisioning, enhanced payment platforms, and a transactional e-commerce site. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 15.4%, a 740-basis point increase, primarily due to reduced write-offs and strong revenue performance. Non-GAAP EPS increased by 313.3% to $1.24, while the lease portfolio size grew by 6.2%. The company revised its full-year 2021 outlook, increasing revenue expectations to between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion and adjusted EBITDA to between $190 million and $205 million. The revised outlook anticipates continued improvement in operations and consumer spending, but excludes potential impacts from extended child tax credit payments and ongoing economic conditions.
