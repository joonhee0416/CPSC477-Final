Havertys reported impressive Q2 results with record sales of $250 million, driven by strong gross and pre-tax operating margins. The company's focus on market share growth and double-digit operating margins remains a priority. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, Havertys expects favorable conditions in the home furnishing industry to continue. The company is investing significantly in its distribution capacity and IT infrastructure, including a partnership with Adobe to enhance its customer experience. In addition, Havertys plans to open new fill-in locations in its key markets and expand its distribution network, which includes buying back its Virginia warehouse for increased flexibility. Excluding a gain on sale-leaseback transaction in Q2 2020, adjusted EPS for Q2 2021 was $1.21 per diluted share, compared to a $0.52 loss in Q2 2020. The company expects gross margins for 2021 to be between 56.5% to 56.8%, and its fixed and discretionary SG&A expenses to be in the range of $275 million to $278 million. Havertys also anticipates an effective tax rate of 24% for 2021.
