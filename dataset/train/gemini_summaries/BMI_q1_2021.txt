Despite ongoing supply chain issues, Badger Meter witnessed robust growth in the first quarter, with sales climbing 9% to $117.8 million. Excluding recent acquisitions, core revenues remained steady due to electronic shortages. The acquisitions, s::can and ATi, contributed $10 million in sales but had muted profitability. Gross margin improved to 41.9%, driven by favorable pricing and higher SaaS revenues. Operating profit increased by 30 basis points to 15.1%, aided by positive acquisition mix. Earnings per share rose 15% to $0.47, and the company experienced record order rates for its smart water solutions. The supply chain constraints have resulted in a record order backlog, which bodes well for the future. Management remains optimistic about the company's long-term growth prospects, despite the potential impact of the recent infrastructure proposals and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of vaccinations. Badger Meter also emphasized its commitment to ESG, setting a 15% greenhouse gas intensity reduction target by 2030.
