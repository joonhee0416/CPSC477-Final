Barnes Group reported strong third-quarter results, with a 20% increase in organic sales, 180 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, and 80% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. However, they adjusted their full-year organic sales growth outlook to the low-teens due to semiconductor supply chain issues, which have led to expanded raw material lead times, inflation, and freight costs. Adjusted operating margin forecast is now approximately 12.5%, down slightly from the previous 13%, due to anticipated headwinds in Q4. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.93, reflecting a 12% to 18% increase year-over-year. Despite these challenges, the company's solid cash generation and strong balance sheet provide support for ongoing growth investments.
