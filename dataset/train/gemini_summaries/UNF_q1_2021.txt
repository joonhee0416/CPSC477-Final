UniFirst's Q1 financial performance met expectations, with revenues of $446.9 million and EPS of $2.20. The Core Laundry segment faced a 5.6% decline in revenue, while Specialty Garments exceeded expectations due to deferred revenue realization. First Aid's results were impacted by wholesale sales reduction. Despite margin pressure from investments, UniFirst remains financially strong with no long-term debt and investments totaling $473 million. The company faces ongoing uncertainty due to COVID-19, but has observed moderate reductions in wearers and strong new business installs. While providing no guidance, they anticipate lower margins in Q2 due to seasonal expenses. Weekly rental billings in Core Laundry continue to trend down by 3.5% to 4% compared to the prior year.
