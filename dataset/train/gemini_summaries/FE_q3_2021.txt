FirstEnergy reported a strong third quarter with diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 and operating earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding the upper end of its guidance range. The performance was driven by customer-focused strategies, favorable weather-adjusted load, operational efficiency, and financial discipline. The company has made progress on resolving legacy issues, including productive settlement discussions in Ohio. Furthermore, FirstEnergy has strengthened its compliance program through new policies, training, and an integrated risk management platform. The company secured a new Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs and submitted a proposal for transmission investments to enhance clean energy integration in New Jersey. Operating earnings for the first nine months of 2021 increased to $2.10 per share, driven by ongoing investments, higher usage, and lower expenses. The company updated its cash from operations guidance to approximately $2.8 billion for the year, including investigation costs. FirstEnergy restructured its revolving credit facilities and received a one-notch upgrade to investment-grade ratings for its distribution and transmission companies. It remains committed to improving its balance sheet and credit profile, targeting FFO to debt ratio of 13% and raising this target to mid-teens. The company is considering a minority asset sale to raise equity capital and optimizing its long-term financing plan, with details to be shared in the coming weeks.
