Terex reported strong second-quarter results, despite challenges in the supply chain. Revenue fell short of expectations due to limited production output, but the company saw significant improvements in operating margins and bookings. AWP and MP segments witnessed double-digit operating margins, driven by effective supply chain management. Terex's focus on cost competitiveness resulted in SG&A expenses being below the 12.5% target. The company raised its earnings and free cash flow outlook for the full year. Despite commodity cost increases, Terex expects incremental margins to meet or exceed 25%. Full-year earnings per share are estimated between $2.85 and $3.05, with free cash flow of approximately $200 million. Terex remains committed to capital allocation, investing in the Genie Mexico manufacturing facility while managing costs and generating positive free cash flow. Strong liquidity and no near-term debt maturities provide flexibility for growth.
