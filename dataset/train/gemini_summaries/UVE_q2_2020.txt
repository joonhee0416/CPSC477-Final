Universal Property & Casualty reported a solid second quarter despite elevated weather losses. Direct premiums written increased double digits, led by strong growth outside of Florida, and premium growth was supported by increased volume, rate increases, and improved retention. Total services revenue also increased, while net investment income decreased due to lower yields on cash and short-term investments. The combined ratio increased due to weather events, a higher core loss ratio, and higher reinsurance costs. The company repurchased approximately 572,000 shares during the quarter and updated its full-year guidance to reflect weather events, with GAAP earnings per share expected in a range of $2.31 to $2.61 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share in a range of $2.40 to $2.70. Clovered, the company's digital insurance agency, continues to be a growth opportunity, with approximately 40% premium growth in the year-ago quarter and over 200% growth in non-risk-bearing business during the same period.
