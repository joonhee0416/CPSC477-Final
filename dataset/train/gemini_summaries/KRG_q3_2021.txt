Following the transformative merger with RPAI, KRG has emerged as a top 5 open-air shopping center REIT with a balanced portfolio concentrated in high-growth, warmer, and cheaper markets. The merger has significantly increased KRG's assets, with nearly 60% of ABR now located in these desirable regions, including 40% in Texas and Florida alone. Additionally, the portfolio now includes a mix of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers complemented by mixed-use assets. Notably, the blended lease spreads improved to 20.7% (GAAP basis) and 13.4% (cash basis), and leasing volumes remain strong with a signed not-open NOI of approximately $33 million for the combined portfolio. The integration of the merger is progressing well, with $21 million of annualized GAAP savings already achieved. Stand-alone Q3 results were strong, with NAREIT FFO per share of $0.25 and FFO as adjusted of $0.33. KRG's solid balance sheet and liquidity position were further enhanced by a Fitch Ratings upgrade to triple B with a stable outlook. Despite the merger, KRG is confident that stand-alone 2021 results will outperform previous guidance, and the combined fourth-quarter results and 2022 guidance will be issued in February.
