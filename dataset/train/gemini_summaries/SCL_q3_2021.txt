In Q3 2021, Stepan Company's adjusted net income remained stable year-over-year at $36.4 million due to one-time tax benefits that offset supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. Year-to-date adjusted net income and earnings per share rose 22% compared to the first nine months of 2020. Despite a 16% decline in Surfactant operating income and a 12% decrease in Polymer operating income, Specialty Product experienced a 53% increase. The company remains optimistic about delivering full-year earnings growth despite ongoing raw material and supply chain challenges. Stepan has increased its quarterly cash dividend by 9.8% and authorized a $150 million common stock repurchase, reflecting its commitment to stockholder value. The company anticipates opportunities in 2022 due to low inventories across the value chain.
