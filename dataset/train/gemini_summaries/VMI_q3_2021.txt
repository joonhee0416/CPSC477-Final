During Q3 2021, Valmont Industries reported a strong performance with record sales of $868.8 million, an 18% increase year-over-year, driven by higher pricing and broad-based market demand. Notably, Irrigation sales grew substantially. Despite challenges from inflation, the Delta variant, and supply chain disruptions, the company's commercial and operations teams managed well, prioritizing employee safety and customer service. All segments reported sales growth, with Utility supported by increased planned utility investments in transmission and distribution projects, Engineered Support Structures driven by higher pricing and wireless products demand, and Irrigation benefiting from strong market fundamentals and increased farmer sentiment. Looking ahead to 2022, Valmont expects sales growth of 7% to 12% and earnings per share growth of 13% to 15%, supported by continued market demand, pricing strategies, and a strong global backlog. Despite ongoing monitoring of inflation, supply chain disruptions, and COVID, the company remains confident in its ability to execute its plan and deliver stakeholder value.
