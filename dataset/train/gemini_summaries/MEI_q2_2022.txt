Methode's second-quarter sales reached $296 million, driven by strong performance in the Industrial segment despite headwinds in the Automotive segment due to supply chain disruptions, particularly the chip shortage. Despite these challenges, the company recorded near-record sales in electric vehicle busbars, commercial vehicle lighting, and radio remote controls. However, ongoing supply chain issues, including the semiconductor shortage and pandemic-related disruptions, are increasing costs and impacting margins, leading to a revised full-year guidance of $3.00 to $3.20 per share in earnings and $1.14 to $1.16 billion in sales. While the truck center console program sales are expected to decline by $90-$100 million in fiscal 2023, business awards continue to expand in key segments like cloud computing and vehicle electrification. Methode remains committed to investing in organic growth, inorganic growth, and shareholder returns, with $45-$50 million earmarked for capital expenditure in fiscal 2022.
