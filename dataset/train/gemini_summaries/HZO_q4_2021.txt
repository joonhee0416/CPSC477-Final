MarineMax reported a record-breaking fiscal 2021, with revenue exceeding $2 billion, gross margin over 30%, and earnings per share of $6.78. Despite a challenging supply chain environment impacting same-store sales growth in Q4 (down 7%), customer demand remained strong, with deposits tripling to $100 million. The company's strategic acquisitions exceeded expectations, driving robust margins and earnings growth. For fiscal 2022, MarineMax expects flat unit growth due to supply chain challenges, but anticipates high single-digit to 10% total revenue growth. Earnings per share guidance is projected at $7.20 to $7.50, incorporating modest margin pressure from inflationary pressures. The company's strong balance sheet and industry-leading demand position it well for continued growth and strategic acquisitions.
