Agilent Technologies' Q3 revenue surged 21% to $1.59 billion, significantly surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Broad-based growth across all business groups, markets, and geographies contributed to this strong performance. LSAG, Agilent's largest group, recorded 18% core growth, driven by strength in pharma (up 22%) and chemical energy (up 31%). The CrossLab Group exhibited 15% core growth, with environmental and forensics posting 5% growth. Regionally, the Americas and Europe led growth, with the chemical and energy segment recovering faster than anticipated (23% growth). Agilent's gross and operating margins improved due to strong top-line performance and operating expense leverage. Earnings per share rose 41% to $1.10, exceeding expectations. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to $6.29-$6.32 billion, representing core growth of 14.5%-15%, and EPS to $4.28-$4.31, indicating continued strong operating leverage. Agilent's strategy of investing in its market-leading products and services while maintaining profitability remains the key driver of its success.
