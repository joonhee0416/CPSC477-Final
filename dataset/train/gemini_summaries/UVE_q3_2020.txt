Despite weather-related headwinds and increased prior-year companion claims due to Hurricane Irma's Statute of Limitations, the company reported a strong 19.4% growth in direct premiums written, driven by organic new business and rate increases. Adjusted operating income saw a loss of $1.43 per share, with the combined ratio increasing 36.9 points to 134.7% due to elevated weather events and increased reserves. Net investment income declined 40.1% due to lower yields, but the company realized $53.8 million in gains by monetizing its investment portfolio to strengthen surplus. The company continues to progress in resolving prior-year catastrophe claims, reporting new Irma claims and reserving $1.55 billion for outstanding ultimate gross. Despite elevated third-quarter losses, the company updated its full-year guidance, expecting GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $2.10 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.85, with a return on average equity of 11.1% to 14.1%.
