After a slow first half of the year, Standard Motor Products experienced a strong rebound in the third quarter, with overall sales increasing by 11.7% to $343.6 million. Engine Management sales rose by 5.6%, driven by strong consumer demand, while Temperature Control sales surged by 25% due to increased summer demand and delayed pre-season orders. The company also saw a temporary surge in its wire and cable business, which benefited from increased DIY sales. Gross margins improved due to higher sales volumes and favorable overhead absorption, reaching 31.4% overall. Despite cost-saving measures implemented during the pandemic, SG&A expenses remained flat with the prior year, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.59 for the quarter. The company has reinstated its quarterly dividend and expects to continue generating strong cash flow in the future.
