Despite economic challenges in 2021, Manitowoc pursued its long-term growth strategy. It invested $15 million in tower crane rentals, acquired two businesses to expand aftermarket presence, and accelerated all-terrain new product development. Notably, the company has made progress in ESG initiatives, doubled hazard observations, and lowered its recordable injury rate. With a focus on aftermarket growth, Manitowoc launched its "Cranes Plus 50" strategy, aiming to increase non-new machine sales by 50% over the next five years. The company's 2022 guidance forecasts net sales between $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $0.65 and $1.35. Manitowoc anticipates supply chain and logistic challenges in the first half of 2022, improving in the second half. Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to its strategic initiatives and opportunistic acquisitions.
