Chubb had an exceptional quarter with record operating earnings and underwriting results. Global P&C premium revenue surged by 15.5%, driven by robust commercial P&C growth, resulting in an 85.5% P&C combined ratio and a 27% increase in current accident year underwriting income. Adjusted net investment income also reached a record high, contributing to strong overall financial performance. In North America, commercial P&C net premiums grew over 16%, with rates increasing by 13.5% for the second consecutive year. Chubb's balance sheet remains strong with over $75 billion in capital and a $123 billion AA-rated investment portfolio.
