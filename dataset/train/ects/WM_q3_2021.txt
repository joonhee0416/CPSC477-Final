You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today.
Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update, John will cover an operating overview and Devina will cover the details of the financials.
John will discuss our results in areas of yield and volume, which unless stated otherwise, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume.
During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization.
Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2020.
Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA and margin, operating expenses and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations.
These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.

Our third-quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations.
Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we faced some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints.
Virtually no segment of the economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically acute inflationary and supply chain challenges.
This burst of inflation accelerated through the third quarter, and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation and about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories.
Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%.
So that's the tough news.
The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBIT raise, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges.
And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes.
John, Devina and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short term and the medium term.
Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation.
Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter.
Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with a yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%.
But keep in mind, the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look-back over the prior year, so there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when costs step up as quickly as they have.
And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs until their next price increase cycle.
A customer who has increased 4% in May won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May.
That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open market businesses, evidenced by our lowest level of rollbacks in more than a decade.
We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges.
John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately.
Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs.
We said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as b...

Combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year.
And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings.
As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top-line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter.
As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year.
Total company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5%, with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%.
This guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values.
We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint and almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.
Third-quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40-basis-point improvement over 2020.
Included in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term.
We remain focused on managing our controllable spending, making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business.
Third-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%.
Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs.
While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter, due in large part to the timing of cash from CNG credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020, overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we are putting in place to enhance our systems and processes.
In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first nine months of the year to $1.13 billion.
Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project work taking longer than planned.
As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong.
Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our MRFs are expected to be about $200 million for the year.
While we continue to target full-year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels, with some of our spending pushed into 2022, primarily due to supply chain constraints.
We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the third quarter.
And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, seeing us well on our way to our full-year targeted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71 times as the strength of our business performance and the successful integration of the acquired ADS business drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan.
As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice and capturing growing volumes.
We know our strategy sets us up for a solid finish to 2021.
With that, Erica, we'd be happy to address the team's questions.
