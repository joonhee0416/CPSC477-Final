To the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G. The required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investors Section of the CTS website.
I will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO.
In the fourth quarter, our sales increased to $123 million, up 8% sequentially and up 7% from last year.
For full-year 2020 sales were down 10% from 2019, driven lower by the impact of the pandemic.
The quarter's performance was solid.
However, we are operating cautiously as we enter 2021 and monitor for any new pandemic disruptions, semiconductor shortages for our OEM customers and the consistency of the recent robust recovery.
We continue to prioritize safety in our operations, our team's ability to effectively manage through the crisis, their resilience as well as the commitment and strength of the senior leadership team greatly helped us navigate these unprecedented market conditions this past year.
The restructuring plan we announced last year is progressing with small delays due to the impact of COVID-19.
We are still planning to deliver an annualized earnings per share improvement in excess of $0.22 by the second half of 2022.
More importantly, we're focused on returning to growth, building on our performance in the fourth quarter and leveraging the recent acquisition of Sensor Scientific.
Sensor Scientific is a manufacturer of high quality thermistors and temperature sensor assemblies, serving OEMs for applications that require precision and reliability in medical, industrial and defense markets.
Sensor Scientific's products are used in a variety of medical applications; including neonatal equipment, lab freezers, fluid warmers and analytical instruments.
SSI has locations in Turkey and New Jersey and in the Philippines.
The acquisition expands our temperature sensing portfolio has complementary capabilities with our existing platform and expand CTS's presence in medical.
The annualized revenue is in the range of $6 million, the purchase price was slightly less than 2 times revenue.
We remain focused on our strategic growth investments as part of our planning for 2025.
Growing our business and expanding our range of products that Sense, Connect, and Move is the priority.
New business awards were $104 million for the quarter, we added six new customers in the quarter; four in transportation; one in medical and one in telecom.
In Transportation, we were awarded passive safety sensor wins with three OEMs; one of the wins was with a North American customer for electric trucks, a new customer for CTS, this builds momentum on the large passive safety win we recorded last quarter with a Chinese electric vehicle application.
We have accelerated our module wins with several OEMs across China, Europe and North America.
A few of these wins were on plug-in hybrid electric platforms.
We also added the new customer for passive safe...
...h quarter of 2019, sequentially we were up 17% in sales to transportation customers.
Sales to other end markets were essentially flat year-over-year.
We saw solid growth in sales to both the industrial and defense end markets and softness continued in the medical end market.
Our gross margin was 37% for the fourth quarter, up 230 basis points, compared to last quarter, and up 110 basis points, compared to last year.
Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 21.4%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 110 basis points from last year.
Fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $0.46 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.43, compared to $0.37 last year and $0.34 last quarter.
For full-year 2020, sales were $424 million, down 10% from 2019.
Sales to transportation customers declined 19% and sales to other end markets increased by 7%.
Industrial and aerospace & defense end markets sales experienced double-digit growth.
Medical end market was soft, but sales down 7%.
Our gross margin was 32.8% for the year, down from 33.6% last year.
The major driver was lower volume attributable to COVID-19, which was partially offset by temporary and other cost reductions implemented throughout the year.
Our focus is to drive improvements and move toward the higher end of our target range of 34% to 37% gross margin.
In the second half of 2020, we generated $0.05 of earnings per share and savings from our restructuring program announced in July 2020.
Foreign currency rates impacted gross margin favorably in 2020 by approximately $3 million.
Based on recent exchange rates currency could impact our 2021 gross margin unfavorably by approximately 100 basis points.
SG&A and R&D expenses were $92.1 million or 21.7% of sales for the year.
Consistent with prior communication, we expect 2021 operating expenses to be higher as a result of the reinstatement of temporary cost measures.
Our 2020 tax rate was 23.7%, we anticipate our 2021 tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, excluding the discrete items.
This is subject to change, due to the impact of any changes that may be introduced by the new US administration.
2020 earnings were $1.06 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.12, compared to $1.45 last year.
Now I'll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow.
Our controllable working capital as a percentage of sales was 15.5% in the fourth quarter, improved slightly from the third quarter.
We have made progress over the last couple of quarters, but still have more work to do.
We are balancing improvements in working capital with having some safety stock to minimize risk of supply chain disruptions.
Capex was $14.9 million for the full-year, down from $21.7 million in 2019.
We continue to manage capex carefully given the current environment.
In 2021, we are expecting capex to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% of sales.
The primary focus being on growth-related projects.
We finished 2020 with a healthy balance sheet and a strong liquidity position.
Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $26 million, for the full-year operating cash flow was $77 million, compared to $64 million in 2019.
The end of the year with $92 million in cash, compared to $100 million in December 2019.
In the fourth quarter, we reduced our long-term debt balance to $55 million from $106 million at the end of the third quarter.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was at 11.4% at the end of 2020, compared to 19.7% at the end of 2019.
The combination of a strong balance sheet with a net cash position and access to over $240 million through our credit facility gives the flexibility to appropriately deploy capital toward our strategic objectives.
We are progressing on our SAP implementation as we communicated earlier, more than 80% of our revenue comes from sites that are running on SAP.
We expect to complete the implementation in the second half of 2021.
However, COVID-related restrictions could cause some delays.
This concludes our prepared comments.
