I'm joined today by Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer.
Let's begin on Slide 4 with the business highlights from the first quarter.
I'll start with the situation with COVID-19.
I continue to be proud of our employees' incredible commitment to Methode and to supporting our efforts to provide a safe work environment.
All of our facilities have remained open to some degree through this challenging period and most of our hourly employees have returned to a full work week.
Our offices have systematically begun to reopen, but we're also still making prudent use of work-from-home for our office staff.
We anticipate that we will see some level of headwind risk and uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the fiscal year.
However, as I stressed last quarter, we will continue to invest in our business for long-term growth.
Turning to the business performance.
While the quarter was clearly down due to the pandemic, we saw significant rebound in automotive demand in the latter half of the quarter.
As you recall, most of the auto OEMs were effectively shut down in the first half of the quarter.
And when we reported our fourth quarter results, we were concerned about the stability of OEM production schedules based on the pandemic circumstances.
Methode's first quarter sales decreased 29.3%.
Our net income decreased 26.9%.
And our diluted earnings per share decreased 28% for the fiscal quarter ended August 1st of 2020.
The resulting decremental net income margin of 10% was helped by cost reductions and operational efficiency initiatives.
The net income in the quarter was also aided by discrete tax benefit of $7.8 million.
Adding back the discrete tax benefit, the decremental net income margin would have been 19%.
Ron will provide more detail on these tax items later.
Returning to the automotive business on Slide 6.
It was a particularly strong quarter for awards in EV and hybrid applications.
We received award of a total annual expected sales of approximately $30 million.
Given our ongoing strategy to cross-sell our technologies into the space, we now expect a high-single digit percentage of our fiscal 2021 consolidated sales to come from EV and hybrid programs.
This is an area where we are globally well positioned and we anticipate co...
... current COVID-19 environment.
In addition to the $3.4 million incurred in the first quarter from actions taken in the first quarter, the company currently expects an additional expense of $2 million in the second quarter from those first quarter actions.
The company may take additional actions in future period based upon business conditions as required.
Moving to slide 11.
Net income was $20.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as opposed to $28.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20.
The main drivers between the fiscal years were lower sales due to COVID, a favorable change in discrete tax items of $9.1 million, an unfavorable change in restructuring expense of $3.4 million and the receipt of $2.9 million of foreign government assistance due to COVID.
Shifting to EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, fiscal first quarter '21 EBITDA was $29.3 million versus $50.3 million in the same period last year.
EBITDA was negatively impacted by the significant headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic and included $3.4 million of restructuring expense.
A few other financial items to review.
Year-over-year depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal '21 to $12.1 million from $11.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20.
In the first quarter of fiscal '21, we invested approximately $11.6 million of capex as compared to $13.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20.
The first quarter investment represents an approximate $45 million run rate for the current fiscal year, but it is too early to tell if the rate will be maintained throughout the remainder of the year.
However, we have a strong balance sheet and intend to utilize it during this COVID impacted year to make continued investment in our businesses to grow them organically in the future.
In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for inorganic growth.
Our intent is to come out of the COVID pandemic stronger than we were when we went into the crisis by judiciously using our strong balance sheet to our long-term advantage.
We had an income tax benefit of $5.1 million as compared to a tax expense of $7.3 million in the fiscal '20 first quarter.
The main driver of the benefit in fiscal '21 was $7.8 million of discrete tax items recorded during the quarter, mainly due to investment tax credits and other credits earned in foreign jurisdictions.
In the fiscal first quarter of '20 -- fiscal year '20, there was a discrete tax expense of $1.3 million.
Without the discrete tax items, the fiscal '21 first quarter effective tax rate would have been 17.2% as compared to 16.6% in the same period last year.
As shown on Slide 12, we did leverage gross debt by $2.3 million in the first quarter.
Since our acquisition of Grakon when adjusting for the $100 million precautionary credit facility draw in March of 2020, we have reduced gross debt by nearly $108 million.
Net debt increased by $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the fiscal '20 year end.
We ended the first quarter with $211 million in cash, which includes $100 million precautionary draw on the credit facility in March.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is used for our bank covenants, is approximately 1.9.
This figure includes the impact of the precautionary $100 million draw.
Without the draw, the ratio would have been approximately 1.3.
Let's move to Slide 13.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, which is now defined as cash provided from operating activities minus capex as opposed to prior to fiscal '21 where it was defined as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capex.
For the fiscal '21 first quarter, free cash flow was $4.8 million as compared to $5.9 million in fiscal '20.
As Don mentioned in his remarks, we are providing revenue guidance for the second quarter.
The revenue range for the second quarter will be between $230 million and $250 million.
Don, that concludes my comments.
Melinda, we're ready to take questions.
