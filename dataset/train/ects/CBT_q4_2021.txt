At this time last year.
I talked about being prepared to win as the recovery takes hold and I think 2021 is evidence that we were prepared.
Fiscal 2021 was a remarkable year for Cabot as the business recovered from the 2020 COVID lows to deliver record results.
We accomplished this through a combination of extraordinary execution and our commitment to driving growth through differentiated investments.
I would like to spend a little time now recapping the accomplishments of the year.
The Cabot operating model is built on the foundations of commercial and operational excellence and our strength in these disciplines drove our outstanding results in fiscal year 2021.
We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and total segment EBIT of $550 million.
And our focus on cash, resulted in a record discretionary free cash flow of $353 million.
The macro environment in 2021 required resilience and agility and I'm very proud of the Cabot team in how they work tirelessly to support our customers' evolving needs.
Serving our customers and innovating to grow with them is what motivates our team.
This was made more challenging in 2021 given the myriad global supply chain disruptions that companies face and the fact that necessary COVID safety protocols continue to evolve and adjust our normal ways of working.
Additionally, companies experienced sharply rising input costs, which required dynamic commercial management.
Our teams worked closely with our customers to manage through this environment and we were successful in our pricing efforts to ensure our margins remained robust and we could invest to support our customers long-term supply needs.
Fiscal year 2021 mark the sixth year of our advancing the core strategy and I'm very pleased with our record of execution and the growth prospects for our company.
Adjusted earnings per share has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% since the inception of our strategy, ahead of our 7% to 10% target.
A growth focus built around our core segments and disciplined execution have been the hallmarks of our approach.
As pleased as we are with the results since 2015, I'm even more excited about the growth opportunities that lie in front of us and the progress we made in 2021.
Our growth strategy is built on a philosophy of investing from positions of strength and where we have what we call a right to win.
A few highlights from 2021 are particularly noteworthy.
Our unmatched portfolio of conductive carbon additives in our strong customer focus model resulted in a doubling of revenue in our battery materials business year-over-year.
We are progressing with the specialty carbons conversion of our plants in Xuzhou, China and this investment will provide growth across our broad range of specialty carbon applications and will free up additional capacity to support battery materials.
Our inkjet business is well positioned to capitalize on the shift in the commercial and packaging segments from analog to digital printing and we achieved multiple OEM qualifications in 2021 that set us up well for growth as inkjet presses penetrate these markets.
And finally, we continue to the execution of a project to build a specialty compounds production line in Cilegon, Indonesia, which will allow us to meet customer demand for black masterbatch in this high growth region.
While growth and execution are highlights from 2021, these accomplishments have been achieved with sustainability at the core.
We...
... compliance projects.
We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $225 million and $250 million.
This estimate includes continued U.S. EPA related capital compliance spend and increased spending on growth projects related to high confidence, high return areas of the portfolio.
The growth related capital includes completing the conversion of upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty carbons, which is planned to come online in the second half of 2022.
In addition, we are executing on a new specialty compounds unit in Indonesia and have planned growth capital related to capacity expansions in battery materials and inkjet.
Additional uses of cash during the fiscal year included $80 million for dividends.
The operating tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 27% and we anticipate our operating tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of 27% to 29%.
As we look ahead to 2022, I'm excited about the growth opportunities in front of us.
Let me take a couple of minutes to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.
First, we will finalize our 2022 tire customer agreements and we remain positive about the outcome as security of supply remains the top priority for customers.
Demand continues to be strong and is projected to be robust in all regions.
Inventories levels are low across the value chain and global transportation flows remain challenging, all of which are placing a greater premium on local supply.
Second, we'll continue to advance a broad portfolio of strategic growth investments across the company.
In battery materials, we plan to expand capacity at our carbon nanotube facility in Zhuhai, China.
Additionally, the aforementioned specialty carbons conversion of our Suzhou plant will provide 50,000 metric tons of growth capacity across specialty carbons and will free up our network to support growth of battery materials.
We also expect to complete our new specialty compounds production unit in Indonesia later in the calendar year 2022, which will enable us to build on our strong position in the high growth ASEAN region.
And finally, we intend to build on our track record of execution by delivering earnings growth and strong cash flow, while maintaining our investment grade rating and industry-leading dividend.
I hope this gives you some color on our priorities for 2022.
I'll close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook for the year.
Clearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of fiscal 2021 and we feel very good about how the new year is shaping up.
We expect a step-up in Reinforcement Materials starting in the second quarter based on an expected positive outcome from our 2022 customer agreements.
We anticipate improved results across all product lines in the Performance Chemicals segment with above-market growth in our battery materials and inkjet product lines.
Based on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60.
The first quarter results are expected to be generally in line with the fourth quarter with results accelerating as we move through the year.
On the cash side, we anticipate strong free cash flow from year-over-year earnings growth, partially offset by an increase in working capital to support growth.
Cash flow will be used to fund advantage growth investments, dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
Overall, I'm very excited about where we are as a company and where we're going.
The growth opportunities we have in front of us are better than they have been at any point during my time as CEO.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are strong.
Our end markets remain robust and we continue to execute at a high level.
Looking ahead, we believe we have a winning formula, a talented team, an excellent portfolio of businesses that for growth and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on our strategic objectives and continue to grow and lead in our industry.
