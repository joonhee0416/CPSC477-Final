Cohen & Steers reported record earnings of $1.24 per share in Q4 2021, driven by higher revenue and operating margin. Revenue reached $159.7 million, primarily due to increased assets under management and performance fees. Assets under management reached a record $106.6 billion, driven by net inflows of $1.8 billion. The company expects its compensation-to-revenue ratio to increase to 33.75% in 2022 and G&A expenses to increase by 10-15%. Despite rising inflation, the company believes its real asset strategies are well-positioned to benefit from earnings sensitivity and replacement cost dynamics. Notably, the institutional channel saw a record $2.1 billion in awarded but unfunded mandates, while the wealth channel achieved a 22% organic growth rate. The company also plans to introduce new initiatives that will position it at the intersection of public and private real estate markets, including a new closed-end fund and vehicles tailored to institutional and wealth investors.
