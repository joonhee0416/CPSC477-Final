Extra Space Storage celebrated a strong quarter with the addition of its 2000th store, industry recognition, and record-breaking operating results. Same-store occupancy reached an all-time high of over 97%. Rental rates to new and existing customers soared by 43% and 41%, respectively, compared to 2020 and 2019 levels. Revenue growth of 18.4% and NOI growth of 27.8% were driven by increased late fees and lower bad debt. External growth initiatives through property acquisitions contributed to 41.2% FFO growth. Despite higher wage pressures, same-store expenses were reduced through savings in payroll, marketing, and property taxes. A second public bond offering and an ATM refinancing provided strong capital access. Revised guidance for 2021 reflects higher same-store revenue and lower expenses, raising the full-year core FFO range to $6.75-$6.85 per share. The company remains optimistic about continued growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.
