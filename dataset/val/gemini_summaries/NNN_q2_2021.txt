National Retail Properties continues to perform well in the second quarter of 2021, with an impressive 98.3% occupancy rate and strong rent collections at 99%. This led to a second guidance increase for core FFO per share, now estimated to be between $2.75 and $2.80 per share. Despite the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, the company's long-term strategy continues to generate consistent per-share growth. National Retail Properties invested $103 million in 29 new properties at an initial cash cap rate of 6.7% and an average lease duration of over 17 years. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with no material debt maturities until 2024, which positions it well to fund its 2021 acquisition guidance without tapping capital markets. The company is poised to continue enhancing shareholder value for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
