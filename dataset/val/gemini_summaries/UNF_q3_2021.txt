UniFirst's Q3 results surpassed expectations, with revenue climbing 4.2% to $464.3 million and diluted EPS rising to $2.21 from $1.12 a year prior. The Core Laundry segment benefited from customer reopenings and PPE sales, while the Specialty Garments segment exceeded forecasts with strong performance in cleanroom and European nuclear operations. Despite inflationary pressures on labor and business inputs, the company maintained a robust outlook for fiscal 2022, projecting revenues between $1.810 billion and $1.817 billion, and EPS between $7.80 and $8.00. The outlook anticipates a moderation of pandemic-driven cost benefits, gradual payroll increases, and continued investment in infrastructure and technology, including the CRM system's $6-$7 million annual depreciation expense.
