AutoNation reported record quarterly results, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, a 207% increase year-over-year. New, used, and customer financial services drove this growth, with demand continuing to exceed supply due to production disruptions and consumer preference for vehicle ownership. AutoNation's same-store new vehicle units increased by 22% year-over-year and 12% compared to 2019. The company also reported increases in same-store pre-owned units (up 28% year-over-year and 20% compared to 2019). AutoNation's digital capabilities, including Customer 360, helped improve efficiency and reduce costs, resulting in a 62.7% SG&A ratio as a percent of gross profit, a significant improvement over the prior year. The company remains committed to its business growth strategy, including opening new AutoNation USA stores and acquiring dealerships. Notably, AutoNation announced the acquisition of 11 stores and a collision center from Peacock Automotive Group, increasing its footprint to over 325 locations and representing $380 million in annual revenue. The company also targets to sell 1 million combined new and pre-owned vehicles annually and continues opportunistic share repurchases, having bought back 3.8 million shares during the quarter.
