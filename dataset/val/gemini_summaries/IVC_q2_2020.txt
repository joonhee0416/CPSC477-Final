Invacare achieved its 11th consecutive quarter of improved adjusted EBITDA, despite supply chain challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted EBITDA grew 84% due to stronger gross margins, cost savings, and reduced expenses. North America returned to profitability with $4.8 million in operating income, while the Asia-Pacific region saw an 8.1% increase in sales on a constant currency basis. The company extended the maturity of a significant portion of its convertible notes to November 2024. Despite lower net sales due to the pandemic, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be similar to 2019, with guidance for full-year sales ranging from $810 million to $840 million and free cash flow usage in line with the previous year.
