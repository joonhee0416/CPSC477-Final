Cabot Corporation's fiscal 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.75 sequentially, primarily driven by improved results in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Operating cash flow reached $99 million during the quarter, contributing to the company's strong liquidity position of $1.4 billion. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021's first quarter, Cabot expects a material step-up in Performance Chemicals EBIT and continued strengthening in Reinforcement Materials due to strong Asian spot pricing, volume strength, and inventory replenishments. The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 in Q1. While there is ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, Cabot remains optimistic based on the team's performance and progress made during the pandemic.
