CMC Metalworking experienced its most profitable third quarter in its history, with earnings from continuing operations reaching $130.4 million or $1.07 per diluted share. Excluding a non-recurring gain, adjusted earnings were $127.1 million or $1.04 per share. Strong demand in North America and Europe drove volume growth, while margin improvement was achieved in the Europe segment. The company's strategic growth initiatives, such as expanding its merchant bar market capabilities and optimizing its production network, continue to progress. CMC's third rolling line in Poland is nearing commercial production, and the Arizona 2 micro mill is anticipated to commence operations in early 2023. The company's financial strength with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0x and cash on hand of $443 million supports its expansion plans and positions it well to navigate market uncertainties. The company anticipates a strong finish to fiscal 2021, with robust demand and margins remaining consistent or improving.
