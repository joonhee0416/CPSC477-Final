Rogers reported strong Q1 performance with net sales growth of 9% to $229 million and record adjusted EPS of $1.92. Growth was driven by advanced mobility markets, defense, and industrial demand. EV/HEV and ADAS sales grew over 30% year-over-year. Sales in compression pads for EV batteries more than doubled. The company anticipates further top-line growth as it invests in additional capacity for advanced battery compression pad and ceramic substrate technologies. Although sales were largely unaffected by supply chain disruptions in Q1, Rogers expects some impact on growth and gross margin in Q2 due to raw material availability issues. Adjusted operating expenses increased due to performance-based compensation and benefit costs. Despite Q2 headwinds, the company guides Q2 revenues in the range of $230 million to $240 million, GAAP earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.73, and adjusted earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.95.
