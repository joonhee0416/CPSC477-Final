Westwood reported a first-quarter earnings per share of $0.13, a decline from the previous quarter's $0.30, primarily due to lower revenues and unrealized losses. Despite the reduction, non-GAAP earnings per share reached $0.50. The firm's U.S. Value Equity products performed well, with the flagship LargeCap Value strategy outperforming its benchmark by almost 400 basis points over the trailing quarter. Other strategies, including LargeCap Select, SMidCap, and SmallCap, also yielded strong returns, ranking favorably among institutional peers. The company has implemented cost-cutting measures, identifying $750,000 in reductions and outsourcing trading to save $1 million annually. Total revenues declined to $16.7 million from $23.9 million in the previous year's first quarter. While net income fell to $1.1 million, it increased compared to the $0.4 million reported in the same quarter last year. Westwood remains in a strong financial position with $82.4 million in cash and short-term investments, a debt-free balance sheet, and ongoing share repurchases.
