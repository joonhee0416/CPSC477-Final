In the fourth quarter, Lannett faced a challenging market environment, resulting in a loss per share of $0.19. However, the company made significant progress in its strategic initiatives. It launched new products, including Levothyroxine and Clarithromycin, diversifying its portfolio and reducing reliance on key products. Lannett also expanded its pipeline with the approval of Mycophenolate, achieved in just under 10 months. Through strategic partnerships, the company secured agreements for Insulin Aspart and generic Spiriva, representing multi-billion dollar markets. Additionally, Lannett implemented cost reduction measures, saving $15 million annually. The refinancing of its debt extended the maturity to 2026, provided additional cash flow, and eliminated leverage covenants. Lannett's cash position improved, with $93 million on hand, and it anticipates ending fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 million. For the full year, the company projects net sales between $400-$440 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40-$55 million, with a ramp-up in sales and profitability expected in the second half of the year as new products are launched.
