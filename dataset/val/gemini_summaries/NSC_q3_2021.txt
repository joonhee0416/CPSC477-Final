Norfolk Southern achieved record-breaking third-quarter results with a 14% increase in revenue to $2.9 billion despite flat volumes. Strong revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel drove growth. The operating ratio improved by 230 basis points to 60.2%, the second-best performance in company history. Key operational metrics included increased train weight, train length, and reduced workforce. Productivity improvements and technology investments, such as mobile track authority and train reporting apps, enhanced efficiency. The company anticipates continued revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by recovering economic activity, strong consumer demand, and high coal demand. However, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages remain challenges. Norfolk Southern remains optimistic about opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in its ability to generate value through innovative solutions and its sustainability advantage.
