Clean Harbors reported strong Q1 results, with a 10% revenue increase and a 130-basis-point rise in adjusted EBITDA margin to 14.3%, driven by a mix of high-value waste streams and high utilization. Environmental Services revenue grew 11%, aided by warmer weather and Field Services group contributions, while Adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% was boosted by business mix, disposal volumes, and emergency response revenue. Gross profit increased due to higher utilization, pricing, and a favorable comparison with the prior year. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with the addition of $150 million drawn from its revolving credit facility, resulting in $494.3 million in cash and short-term marketable securities at quarter-end. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clean Harbors has taken steps to align its cost structure with demand, including workforce furloughs and a hiring freeze. CapEx spending has been reduced by $50 million to preserve capital and support free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.28 in Q1. Despite the strong start to 2020, the company has withdrawn its guidance due to the uncertain market environment.
