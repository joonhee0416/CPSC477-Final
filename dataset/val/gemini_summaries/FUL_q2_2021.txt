H.B. Fuller reported strong financial results in Q2, with organic revenue growth of 19%, record revenue, and adjusted EPS up 38% to $0.94. Despite supply chain disruptions and rising raw material costs, the company successfully raised prices to offset costs. Volume growth was broad-based, with double-digit increases in Engineering and Construction Adhesives and strong growth in Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives. Total organic revenue increased by 9.5% from Q2 2019 levels. While gross margin is expected to face headwinds in Q3 due to seasonal factors and higher raw material costs, the company anticipates pricing and margin benefits in Q4. Annualized price adjustments of $150 million have been implemented, with an additional $75 million planned in Q3. The company remains focused on volume growth, strategic pricing, and operational excellence. Despite supply chain challenges, H.B. Fuller's global operations, culture of collaboration, and market-based innovation continue to drive results. The company expects full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits, with adjusted EBITDA in the range of $455-$475 million, unchanged from previous guidance. Raw material cost increases are expected to exceed 10% for the fiscal year.
