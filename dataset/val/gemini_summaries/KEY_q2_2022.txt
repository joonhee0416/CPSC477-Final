In Q2, the company reported an EPS of $0.72, an 18% increase from Q1 and significantly higher than the year-ago period. Noninterest income rose 8%, reaching a record high, partially driven by strong growth in the consumer business, which has seen record growth in new households and a surge in loan originations. Despite higher production-related expenses, the company remains on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year. Credit quality continues to improve, with net charge-offs falling to 9 basis points of average loans and nonperforming loans declining. The company has a strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, enabling it to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company has announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and expects to increase the common stock dividend in Q4 2021. The company reaffirmed its long-term targets and remains confident in its ability to deliver strong returns to shareholders.
