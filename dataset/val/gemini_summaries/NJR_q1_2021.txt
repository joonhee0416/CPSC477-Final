New Jersey Resources reported strong first-quarter performance with NFE of $0.46 per share, driven by core business performance. The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2021 NFE guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and increased its fiscal 2022 NFE guidance to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share. The company completed 90% of the Southern Reliability Link and is expected to place the project into service this year. It also received approval for a $150 million infrastructure investment program and filed for a new energy efficiency program, SAVEGREEN 2020. Despite positive news from the Supreme Court regarding PennEast, the company is still excluding it from long-term projections. Energy Services entered into asset management agreements with an investment-grade public utility, resulting in $501 million in contracted cash proceeds over ten years and allowing NJR to increase its fiscal 2022 guidance by $0.15 per share. The company's strong cash flows are expected to support dividend growth and improve credit metrics, resulting in the cash settlement of an equity forward. Overall, New Jersey Resources is on track to meet its NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 and is well-positioned for future growth.
