Teleflex reported strong third-quarter results despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Revenue growth reached 10.3% year-over-year, driven by all business segments except the divested respiratory assets and Urology, which saw lower growth due to elective surgery restrictions. The company's diversified portfolio, including high-growth areas like Vascular Access, Interventional, and Anesthesia, offset the headwinds from COVID-19. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year, driven by product mix, cost improvements, and disciplined expense management. Teleflex raised its 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $13.15 to $13.35, representing a 23% to 25% increase, due to better-than-expected margin performance and improved balance sheet strength. Despite ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19 and inflation, Teleflex remains optimistic about its ability to drive long-term growth and meet its commitments to stakeholders.
