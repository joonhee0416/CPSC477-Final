AutoNation's third quarter reported an all-time record adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.38, a 102% increase compared to last year. Strong demand and a tight inventory environment allowed for increased pricing, leading to improved margins and a 28% increase in same-store total variable gross profit per vehicle retailed. The company has also doubled the number of vehicles sourced through its "We Will Buy Your Car" initiative, acquiring over 12,000 units in the quarter. AutoNation plans to expand its AutoNation USA pre-owned store footprint by building over 100 stores, with over 50 completed by the end of 2025, aiming to sell over 1 million combined new and used retail units per year long-term. The company remains committed to maintaining expense discipline, targeting SG&A as a percentage of gross profit below 68%. With a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, AutoNation has increased its share repurchase authorization to $500 million.
