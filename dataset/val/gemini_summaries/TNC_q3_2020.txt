Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Tennant celebrated its 150th anniversary this year, highlighting its resilience and commitment to innovation. The company has executed on its Enterprise Strategy, resulting in improved operating performance, with third-quarter EBITDA growth despite a decline in organic sales. The full year guidance for 2020 has been reinstated, reflecting continued investment in innovation and the expectation of sequential revenue increases quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $2.80 and $3.00, while GAAP earnings per share are estimated at $2.00 to $2.20. The company's aftermarket business saw a 6% increase in revenue, while equipment sales decreased by 12%. Adjusted gross margin decreased slightly due to strategic investments and lower volume, but cost-saving initiatives partially offset this decline. EBITDA increased as a percentage of sales driven by adjustments to management incentives and discretionary spending reductions. Tennant generated $48.9 million in cash flow from operations and repaid $17 million of debt, resulting in a strong balance sheet position. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million, reflecting the company's commitment to continued innovation and growth.
