Fabrinet recorded a robust Q4, exceeding estimates with revenue reaching $509.6 million, driven by strong demand across all business lines. Non-GAAP operating margins hit a record high of 9.9%, resulting in earnings per share of $1.31. For the fiscal year, revenue surged 14% to $1.88 billion, and non-GAAP net income per share grew 25% to $4.67. Despite supply constraints impacting revenue by $25-30 million in Q4 and an estimated similar impact in Q1, Fabrinet expects revenue to increase sequentially to a record high in Q1. Non-recurring headwinds, including COVID-19 measures in Thailand and expenses related to employee safety and vaccination initiatives, are anticipated to impact Q1 net income. However, the company remains optimistic about demand trends and its ability to expand capacity with the completion of a new 1 million square foot building in Thailand and additional manufacturing space at its Pinehurst campus. Fabrinet's cash and investments stand at $548.1 million, and it has repurchased $10.5 million worth of shares in Q4. Q1 guidance forecasts revenue between $510-530 million, with non-GAAP net income per diluted share expected to range from $1.29 to $1.36, reflecting non-recurring expenses.
