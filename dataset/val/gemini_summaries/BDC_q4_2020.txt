In Q4 2020, Belden's revenue surpassed initial expectations with a 5% sequential increase to $498.5 million, driven by both the Industrial Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments. Demand trends improved, resulting in a solid 13% sequential increase in incoming order rates and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10 times. EPS grew 25% to $0.90, and free cash flow reached $101 million, outperforming expectations. The company attributes these positive results to cost streamlining efforts, which yielded $40 million in SG&A savings for the full year 2020. Belden continues to make strategic investments in R&D, aiming to enhance its product offerings and strengthen its competitive edge in Industrial Automation, cybersecurity, and other key markets. Despite temporary margin pressures due to R&D investments, the company anticipates strong growth in 2021, with revenue projected between $1.99 billion and $2.05 billion and EPS between $2.90 and $3.30.
