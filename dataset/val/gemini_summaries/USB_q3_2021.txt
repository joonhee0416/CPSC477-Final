Linked quarter pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased by 2.7%, driven by fee income and average loan balances. The company's allowance for credit losses decreased by $310 million due to positive economic outlook and credit trends. Business Banking relationships, currently at 1.1 million, present an opportunity for growth of 15-20%, with revenue potential of 25-30%. Average loans grew by 0.8%, led by retail and credit card loans. Non-performing assets declined, resulting in a record-low net charge-off ratio of 20 basis points. Non-interest expense increased by 1.2% due to incentive compensations. The CET1 capital ratio was 10.2% at quarter-end. Excluding PPP fees, the company anticipates a stable net interest income in Q4. Total payments revenue growth is expected to continue in Q4, driven by improving sales volumes. Credit quality is forecasted to remain strong, resulting in a lower-than-normal net charge-off ratio. Overall, the company is well-positioned heading into 2022, with numerous organic growth opportunities and the recently announced acquisition of Union Bank to drive revenue and earnings growth.
