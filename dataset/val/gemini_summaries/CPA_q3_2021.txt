Copa Holdings reported a strong recovery in Q3, as increased vaccinations and relaxed travel restrictions led to a surge in air travel demand. Capacity increased to 70% of pre-pandemic levels, driving a surge in revenues by 46% over the previous quarter to $445 million. Ex-fuel CASM decreased to 2019 unit cost levels at $0.62 per ASM, resulting in an operating profit of $59 million and an operating margin of 13.3%. Copa expects further capacity deployment in Q4 and 2022, forecasting 83% capacity recovery in Q4 with an operating margin of 4%. As demand continues to grow, the company expects capacity to reach 92% of 2019 levels in the first half of 2022. To support this growth, Copa has accelerated the delivery of 12 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, with two being received in 2022 and the remaining 10 being added between 2023 and 2025.
