ITW delivered Q4 results that met year-ago levels despite a 17% decline in food equipment sales. Net operating income, operating margin, and after-tax ROIC reached Q4 records for the company, indicating momentum heading into 2021. Amidst pandemic challenges, ITW prioritized employee safety and customer service, which strengthened customer relationships. The company leveraged its financial strength to support employees and implement its "Win the Recovery" strategy, focusing on long-term growth rather than a recession-style response. For FY2021, ITW projects a 7% to 10% organic growth rate, with 9% to 12% revenue growth including foreign currency impacts. GAAP earnings per share are estimated between $7.60 and $8.00, up 18% year-over-year, driven by operating margin expansion and Enterprise Initiatives. The company expects strong free cash flow and will prioritize internal investments, dividends, and selective acquisitions. Share repurchases of approximately $1 billion are planned, and portfolio management activity, including divestitures, has been deferred to 2022.
