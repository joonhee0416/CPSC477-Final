Rollins reported strong Q1 results with a 9.8% revenue increase to $535.6 million, driven by growth in residential (14.9%), termite (12.2%), and commercial (2.9%) pest control services. Earnings per share surged from $0.09 to $0.19. Continued strength in termite and mosquito businesses, as well as acquisitions, contributed to growth. The company's technology investments, including the deployment of a new branch operating system in several brands, have improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. Rollins' commitment to cost containment and improved customer retention rates have also boosted margins. Despite inflation concerns, the company does not anticipate material margin impacts due to favorable trends in payroll, fleet, and materials costs. Rollins' strong balance sheet, with $117.3 million in cash, supports its plan for continued acquisitions and capital expenditures.
