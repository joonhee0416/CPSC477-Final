The company highlighted its financial resilience during the pandemic, with rent collections improving to 91% in Q4 and a first-time investment-grade credit rating from Fitch. Liquidity has been strengthened with over $100 million in cash, a fully undrawn $350 million revolver, and the repayment of the $100 million revolving credit balance. The company has a strong acquisition pipeline and sees opportunities in Austin and other markets with expanding value gaps. Notable leasing progress includes agreements with a healthcare provider and the leasing of one of the former Stein Mart boxes. The leasing strategy emphasizes annual contractual rent increases, contributing to a long-term growth profile. The company is targeting a leverage ratio in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 times and has set 2021 operating FFO per share guidance of $0.77 to $0.87, with potential upside from bad debt reserves and acquisitions. Management remains cautiously optimistic about the future and expects to focus on traditional REIT operating performance metrics as conditions normalize.
