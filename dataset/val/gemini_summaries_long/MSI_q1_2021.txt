The company had an exceptional Q1 with record sales, operating earnings, and cash flow. Sales increased by 7% to $1.8 billion, with all segments contributing to growth, particularly Software and Services, which grew by 15%. Non-GAAP operating margins also improved significantly, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Due to increased demand and a strong backlog of $11.3 billion, the company raised its full-year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. Additionally, video security experienced strong demand, leading the company to raise its full-year growth expectations to 20% plus. The company also continues to leverage its LMR installed base to expand into command center software and LMR services, which now account for almost half of its revenue.
