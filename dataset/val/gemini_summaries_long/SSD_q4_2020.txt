Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Simpson Strong-Tie exceeded its 2020 plan objectives by achieving strong organic growth, rationalizing its cost structure for increased profitability, and improving working capital management. Notably, net sales rose by 11.6% to a record $1.28 billion, leading to record earnings of $4.27 per diluted share, marking a 43.3% increase. This robust financial performance was supported by factors such as favorable steel prices, reduced travel expenses, and a surge in repair and remodel activity. Moreover, the company's gross margin improved significantly, driven by lower material costs and limited expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020. Furthermore, Simpson Strong-Tie surpassed its return on invested capital target with an impressive 20% return and returned $116.2 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales grew by 12% year-over-year to $293.9 million, with increased sales volume due to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel and solid US housing starts. Despite the economic challenges, Simpson Strong-Tie remains optimistic about its future prospects, emphasizing its strong liquidity position and commitment to growth and diversification. The company is also initiating guidance for the full year 2021, with an estimated operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18.5% and capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million.
