Federal Signal delivered a strong first quarter, exceeding expectations with record orders and operating results. Order intake surged to $384 million, a 26% increase year-over-year, with all end markets showing strength and optimism for a post-pandemic recovery. Consolidated net sales reached $279 million, but consolidated gross margin declined to 24.7% due to the drop in sales. Adjusted EBITDA stood at $41.2 million, resulting in a margin of 14.8%. Despite challenges, including disruptions from the February ice storms and semiconductor shortages affecting chassis availability, the company maintained its adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year at $1.73 to $1.85. The acquisition of OSW in the quarter adds to Federal Signal's growth trajectory, while investments in new product development, capacity expansion, and operational efficiency are expected to further bolster performance in the long term.
