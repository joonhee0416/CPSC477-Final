UPS reported better-than-expected Q3 results, with consolidated revenue rising 9.2% to $23.2 billion. The company experienced double-digit operating margin growth in all three segments and saw a 23.4% increase to $3 billion in consolidated operating profit. UPS's strategic focus on enhancing revenue quality and implementing cost-cutting measures led to this strong performance. Notably, SMB volume growth remained robust in the U.S. and internationally, contributing to improved revenue per piece. Productivity initiatives and the elimination of daily trailer loads also significantly reduced UPS's cost to serve. To maintain this momentum, UPS implemented expanded weekend delivery services, which increased coverage to 90% of the U.S. population and unlocked additional network capacity without capital expenditure. Looking ahead, the company anticipates a strong peak season, supported by increased capacity, collaboration with major customers, and a 5.9% general rate increase in the U.S. UPS's positive outlook and progress in implementing its strategy position it well to achieve its long-term financial targets and drive profitable growth in the future.
