Last night we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.
Any non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.
Erica McLaughlin will review the business segment and corporate financial details.
I want to begin by recognizing our employees around the world for their continued commitment to the Company, to our customers, and to their community.
Managing through this pandemic has challenged us on every front, and I have never been more proud of our team.
As we manage through this pandemic, we established a set of guiding principles here at Cabot to protect the house first and prepare ourselves to be ready to win as the recovery takes hold.
I believe our performance to date reflects that balance.
For the quarter, total segment EBIT was $84 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.75 on a sequential basis.
This result was driven principally by improved results in Reinforcement Materials, which recovered nicely as demand in our key end markets increased sharply as compared to the third quarter.
Performance Chemicals results also improved in the quarter, as automotive-related demand began a recovery and our self-help initiatives took hold.
In Purification Solutions, we took another step forward in our transformation plan with the sale of our mine and the structuring of a long-term supply agreement for activated carbon with ADES, which better positions us to serve the mercury removal market.
We continued our intense focus on cash generation, delivering $99 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and $248 million for the second half, well ahead of our previously communicated expectation of $200 million of operating cash flow in the back half of the year.
Erica will go into more detail on the segment results a bit later in the call.
I would first like to share my perspective on the full fiscal year 2020 results.
There is no doubt this fiscal 2020 was the year unlike any other we've experienced, as we battle the global public health crisis and the associated economic fallout.
The global pandemic severely affected demand from our key tire and automotive customers, especially in the third fiscal quarter and that impact was reflected in our full-year results.
On the performance front, we delivered adjusted earnings per share $2.08.
While this result was well below prior levels and the earnings potential of the Company, I am very pleased with how we managed through the crisis and I believe the strength of Cabot was revealed.
Our strong balance sheet and cash generation power and our experienced management team allowed us to navigate the pandemic, while remaining focused on our advancing the core strategy.
As you know, our strategy is built on three pillars: first, investing for growth in our core businesses; second, driving application innovation with our customers; and finally, generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization.
In the Reinforcement Materials segment, the team did a great job delivering necessary price increases in our calendar year 2020 customer agreements, implementing new commercial terms to manage feedstock volatility and delivering cost reductions to partially offset the pandemic-driven demand reduction.
In the Performance Chemicals segment, the team was focused on self-help measures and laying the groundwork to restore profitability to historical levels.
In the year, we successfully implemented price increases in specialty carbons to offset the impact of higher MARPOL-related feedstock costs.
The segment also executed on a number of strategic priorities during the year.
We closed on the acquisition of Shenzhen Sanshun Nano, a leading producer of carbo...
...-19, we remain focused on executing our strategy and I would like to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.
First, we will stay close with our customers to support their evolving needs and continue to differentiate Cabot through our product quality, service reliability and commitment to sustainability.
Second, we will continue to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, particularly energy materials, E2C and inkjet for packaging.
We are excited about the growth potential of these businesses and we have sustained our investment throughout this downturn so that we can capitalize on their full potential in the coming years.
Third, we'll continue to drive efficiency and optimization across our operation.
During fiscal year '20, we established a global business services organization to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of those processes that power our way of doing business.
We will further leverage this investment through the deployment of digital tools to simplify and automate our ways of working and I'm excited about the potential here to complement our strategic growth efforts.
Fourth, the role of bolt-on M&A in our existing businesses remains an important part of our growth story.
Over the past few years, we have made very important strategic acquisitions in our core spaces, including extending our geographic presence in our specialty compounds business through acquisitions in Canada and Southeast Asia, and by expanding our product offering in energy materials to include CNTs through our acquisition of Sanshun.
We will continue to look for opportunities to build out our pipeline and execute on opportunities of these types.
Finally, in an uncertain and dynamic environment, it will be critical that we keep tight control of costs and working capital in 2021.
We feel good about the momentum into fiscal year '21, but we must remain vigilant on cost and working capital.
I hope this gives you some color on our 2021 priorities and how they will help Cabot to extend our leadership position.
I will close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook as we start fiscal year '21.
Clearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter of 2020 and we feel very good about how the first quarter is shaping up.
As Erica discussed, we expect a material step up in the Performance Chemicals segment and further strengthening in Reinforcement Materials, where performance is being driven by strong Asian spot pricing, the feedstock costs rise there and volume strength driven by stronger underlying demand and some level of inventory replenishments.
Based on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90.
On the cash side, we anticipate that operating cash flow will be strong as year-over-year earnings levels improve in fiscal '21, even though absolute net working capital levels will increase aligned with higher volumes.
Looking to the full-year of fiscal '21, there is still uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic that impacts our longer-term visibility.
Our results will be influenced by the sustainability of the economic recovery, the outcome of our tire customer agreements, the pace of costs returning to the business to support the recovery and how we manage pricing in this dynamic environment.
As the year unfolds, we will be managing these factors carefully to match the dynamic environment.
Overall, I feel very good about the way the team has performed and the progress we have made in this unprecedented environment.
I'm optimistic about the first quarter and remain confident that the team will respond to any challenges we may face throughout the year.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are robust, our market positions in global presence is unmatched, and our balance sheet and liquidity provide strength and flexibility.
I am confident in our growth opportunities ahead and our ability to deliver on our strategic objectives.
