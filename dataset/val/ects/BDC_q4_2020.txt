My name is Kevin Maczka, I'm Belden's vice president of investor relations and treasurer.
Roel will provide a strategic overview of our business and then Henk will provide a detailed review of our financial and operating results, followed by Q&A.
Additionally, during today's call, management will reference adjusted or non-GAAP financial information.
As a reminder, I'll be referring to adjusted results today.
Demand trends improved in the fourth quarter, and I'm pleased to report that revenues, earnings and cash flow exceeded our initial expectations.
Fourth quarter revenues increased 5% sequentially to $498.5 million compared to our initial guidance range of $460 million to $485 million, and our revised guidance range of $494 million to $499 million.
The upside relative to our expectations was broad based, with contributions from both the Industrial Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments.
During the fourth quarter, our channel partners further reduced the inventory levels by approximately $22 million as expected, resulting in a reduction of approximately $70 million for the full year 2020.
Importantly, this is not expected to recur in 2021.
Incoming order rates were solid during the quarter, increasing 13% sequentially.
This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10 times, including a robust 1.16 times in the Industrial Solutions segment.
EPS increased 25% sequentially to $0.90, compared to our initial guidance range of $0.63 to $0.78, and our revised guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90.
Free cash flow generation was $101 million in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations by approximately $11 million.
As a result, we exited the fourth quarter with cash on hand of $502 million, which provides ample flexibility as we pursue our strategic initiatives.
2020 was a truly unprecedented year, with each of us facing significant challenges related to the global pandemic both personally and professionally.
I'm extremely proud of the way our global workforce responded to these challenges and maintained a sharp focus on supporting our customers, then executing our strategic plans, while maintaining the safest possible working conditions.
For the full year 2020, we delivered revenues of $1.863 billion and earnings per share of $2.75.
Free cash flow generation was $86 million compared to our expectation of approximately $75 million.
Beyond the initial response to the pandemic, the year was highlighted by the bold steps we took to position the company for substantially improved organic growth and margins.
This includes streamlining our cost structure, funding our compelling growth initiatives, and significantly improving our portfolio of businesses.
On the cost side, we delivered on our commitments by successfully reducing SG&A costs by $40 million for the full year 2020.
We exited the year with a quarterly run rate savings of $15 million in the fourth quarter, so we are prepared to deliver the full $60 million in savings in 2021 as planned.
This represents approximately 300 basis points of incremental EBITDA margin expansion on an annual basis.
These are permanent cost reductions that will not return as conditions normalize.
As we executed these cost reduction plans, we continue to make strategic investments to accelerate growth and capitalize on the opportunities in our key markets.
To that end, R&D spending increased 14% to $107 million in 2020, with approximately 65% of this investment dedicated to software development.
This includes stand-alone software and embedded software within various hardware products.
We are making targeted investments to support growth and innovation in Industrial Automation and enhance our best-in-class cybersecurity cloud platform.
These innovations are important to our customers and our shareholders, as they will further strengthen our product offering and enhance our competitive advantage.
We also maintained capex spending of approximately $70 million for the year, to ensure that we have the capabilitie...
...e debts, so are not a risk of a default in the unlikely event of significantly worsening economic conditions.
As I mentioned previously, we're comfortable with our liquidity position and the quality of our balance sheet.
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $134.7 million compared to $187.4 million in the prior year period.
Net capital expenditures were $33.3 million for the quarter compared to $35.9 million in the prior period.
For the full year 2020, we generated cash flow from operations of $173.4 million compared to $276.9 million in 2019.
The decline primarily reflects lower EBITDA during the year that resulted from the global pandemic.
The full year net capital expenditures were $87.1 million compared to $110 million in 2019.
The difference is primarily related to the timing of the Grass Valley divestiture, which we completed in July of 2020.
As a result, we generated free cash flow of $86.3 million in 2020 compared to $166.9 million in 2019.
2021 will be a year of recovery in most of our key markets.
During the year, we expect to complete our transformative portfolio actions and turn the focus to accelerating organic growth.
Our recent order rates are encouraging and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our financial goals and drive superior returns for our shareholders.
We anticipate first quarter 2021 revenues to be between $490 million and $505 million, and earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.70.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenues to be between $1.99 billion and $2.050 billion, and earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.30.
For financial modeling purposes, we recommend using interest expense of approximately $61 million for 2021, and then effective tax rate of 20% for each quarter and the full year.
This guidance includes the expected accretion from the OTN Systems acquisition.
It continues to include the contribution of our copper cable product lines that we are in the process of divesting, which contributed approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.20 in 0PS in 2020.
We will update our guidance accordingly as we complete these divestitures.
We expect current copper prices and foreign exchange rates to have a favorable impact on revenues of approximately $80 million in 2021, but a negligible impact on earnings.
We expect consolidated organic growth in the range of 1% to 4% or up to $70 million, with solid growth in our Industrial Solutions segment, partially offset by declines in the Smart Buildings markets within our Enterprise Solutions segment.
We anticipate an incremental $36 million in revenue and $0.11 in earnings per share from the OTN Systems acquisition.
Consistent with our commitment, we expect to realize the incremental $20 million in savings under our SG&A cost reduction program.
These savings represent $0.36 in EPS.
R&D investments are an important strategic initiative designed to drive growth in future periods.
But these investments will temporary pressure margins and earnings per share in 2021.
Finally, a normalized effective tax rate of 20% along with modestly higher interest expense and share count represent an earnings per share headwind of approximately $0.20 for the year.
For the full year 2021, the high-end of our guidance implies total revenue and earnings per share growth of 10% and 20% respectively.
Before we conclude, I would like to reiterate our investment thesis.
We view Belden as a very compelling investment opportunity, as we are taking bold steps to drive substantially improved business performance.
We are significantly improving our portfolio and aligning them on favorable secular trends in our key strategic markets, including Industrial Automation, Cybersecurity, Broadband and 5G, and Smart Buildings.
We continue to invest in our business to position the company for accelerating organic growth and robust margin expansion.
As we successfully execute our strategic plans and deliver on our goals, we would expect this to drive superior returns for our shareholders.
