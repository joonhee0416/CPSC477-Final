I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen.
During today's call, we'll discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2021.
The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance.
From my perspective, the highlights are the Q4 revenues got back to year-ago levels despite food equipment being down 17% and net operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 records for the Company.
It was a pretty solid finish to the year that needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges, and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021.
While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built and honed over the past eight years to the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did.
Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we refocused the entire company on only two core imperatives.
A, to protect the health, safety and well-being of our people, and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence.
And in my view, we executed extremely well on both.
Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in support of these two key pandemic priorities.
Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring and there is no question that we differentiate ourselves with many of our key customers, as a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts.
We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we've thought through, how we should manage the Company through the pandemic.
Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress-tested the Company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past eight years have resulted in a very strong and very resilient company.
And as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down.
And for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long-term.
This conclusion led to two key decisions that we made regarding how we're going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis.
First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last eight years to reinforce our commitment to our people.
First, by providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe.
And by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprisewide employment reduction mandated programs at any point in 2020.
These were not obvious reason decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances but we believe that they were the right decisions for our Company.
And I know that our people will remember them.
These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3.
Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our Win the Recovery agenda in mindset across the Company.
Win the Recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy.
What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic.
Win the Recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic.
As across the Company, we had to read and react to th...
...lways do on the current levels of demand in our businesses.
Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality.
The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level.
Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and has 2 percentage points revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%.
At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint.
We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint.
Enterprise Initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021, as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points.
Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year.
We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment and embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals.
Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the Company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis.
We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income.
I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021.
Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses.
Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model.
Third priority, our selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential.
I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only.
After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021.
In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021.
We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%.
Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year.
And instead, focus on our time and efforts on the recovery in 2021.
While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given their expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022.
With the caveat again and the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment and based on current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021.
At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%.
To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong, as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we've built over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy.
Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper-tier performance in any environment.
Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year and our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.
