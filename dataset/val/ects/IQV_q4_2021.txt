It was great to see many of you in person at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November.
And as you will recall, we shared our expectations that we would meet or exceed our three-year Vision '22 targets.
We also laid out our plans to make 2022 yet another inflection point in our growth trajectory and further accelerate the company's growth rate in the next three phase -- three-year phase of our journey to 2025.
The team highlighted the power of connected intelligence, which brings together IQVIA differentiated capabilities and drive our leadership position in the clinical and commercial markets.
This underpins our new 20 by '25 strategy, which alludes to our plans to achieve at least $20 billion of revenue by 2025.
We're excited about this next phase of growth for IQVIA, and we are busy refining our strategies and action plans, and you will hear more about it as the year progresses.
Two years -- two weeks ago, IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year.
Importantly, we earned a first-place ranking within the healthcare, pharmacy, and other services category for the first time.
1 in the categories of innovation, capital deployment, global competitiveness, quality of product and services, and long-term investment value.
Turning now to our results.
We ended 2021 on a high note despite COVID-19's continued impact on many parts of the world.
We delivered robust top and bottom-line growth in the quarter, which, as you know, was against a much tougher year-over-year comparison than earlier in the year.
These results reinforce our confidence that we will achieve our 2022 guidance.
And of course, it sets us up well to meet our ambitious 20 by '25 targets.
Let's review the fourth quarter.
Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency.
The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all three segments, as well as higher pass-throughs partially offset by FX headwinds.
Compared to prior year and excluding COVID-related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis.
Ron will provide a lot more detail in his remarks, including additional COVID-adjusted numbers for each segment.
Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 12.7%, reflecting our revenue growth, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives.
The $27 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to our operational performance.
Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.55 grew 20.9%.
That was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the majority of the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.
Let me now provide an update on the business.
On the commercial side of the business, it was a strong year for new molecules and launches as the industry continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption.
This year, 50 new molecules were approved by the FDA and 72 new commercial launches took place.
IQVIA supported nearly 80% of launches by top 20 pharma and approximately 60% of all launches.
This highlights our scale globally and across all customer segments in applying advanced technology and analytics capabilities to enhance launch planning, engagement, and measurement.
Overall, we've seen significant momentum and continued demand for our technology solutions.
There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage, and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE.
In fact, the footprint of our OCE platform itself has continued to grow, with over 350 clients having adopted one or more modules on the platform since launch.
Early in 2021, we launched IQVIA Next Best Action, which is an AI-driven omni-channel customer engagement decision engine.

...ind from FX since we initially guided in November.
Now additionally, we're raising our full year 2022 profit guidance versus what we provided you in November.
So, to summarize the overall guidance for the full year, we expect revenue to be between $14.700 billion and $15 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.1% to 9.2% at constant currency and 6% to 8.1% on a reported basis compared to 2021.
Now we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%.
And we also now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $9.95 and $10.25, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%.
Now our full year 2022 guidance assumes at December 31, 2021, foreign currency exchange rates remain, in fact, for the balance of the year.
Now compared to the prior year, I should mention FX is now a headwind of 110 basis points to our full-year revenue growth, and our projected revenue growth includes a little bit over 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity.
Now with our analyst and investor conference in November, we told you to anticipate that our COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $1 billion in 2022 but will more than compensate for that headwind with strong growth in our base business.
And let me give you some additional detail around this that I think will be helpful.
Excluding COVID-related revenue, the FX headwind, and the contribution of acquisitions, our total company revenue guidance implies organic growth at constant currency in the low to mid-teens.
At the segment level, we anticipate full-year Technology and Analytics Solutions revenue growth of between 5% and 7%.
Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in TAS to be in the high single digits.
Research and Development Solutions revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%.
Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in R&DS to be in the upper teens.
And finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions revenue was anticipated to be down about 2%.
But excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in CSMS to be in the low single digits.
Let's move to the first quarter now.
As you all know, the first quarter of last year marked a continued rebound in our base business after the 2020 pandemic-related decline.
In addition, Q1 and Q2 of last year represented our peak COVID-related revenues.
As a result of this, the first half of the year will have the most challenging year-over-year compares.
For the first quarter, our revenue is expected to be between $3.515 billion and $3.575 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6% on a constant-currency basis and 3.1% to 4.9% on a reported basis.
Now excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the mid-teens.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $800 million and $815 million, up 7.5% to 9.5%.
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $2.40 and $2.46, growing 10.1% to 12.8%.
So, to summarize, we delivered very strong fourth-quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what was also a very strong fourth quarter of 2020.
R&DS recorded its largest-ever quarter of service bookings and for the first time, had over $10 billion of total net new bookings in a year.
Our contracted backlog improved to a record of nearly $25 billion, up over 10% year over year.
We delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, bringing the full year to a record $2.3 billion.
We closed 2021 with net leverage of 3.6 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
Our board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.
And finally, we're reaffirming the full year of 2022 guidance that we provided in November for revenue, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance.
