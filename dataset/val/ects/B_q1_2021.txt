Barnes Group delivered a very good quarter to begin 2021, with the recovery we had anticipated to occur later in the year starting a little earlier than expected.
Strong order intake continuing sequential revenue growth now for the third consecutive quarter and better than expected earnings performance add confidence to our view that the second half of the year will show meaningful recovery progress.
For the first quarter, organic sales were down 10% compared to a year ago as a result of lower volumes at Aerospace.
However, our Industrial segment generated high single-digit organic growth, which was better than our February expectation given solid orders and sales in March.
While we previously envision business improving as the year progressed, now with the stronger momentum exiting the first quarter, we have increased our outlook for the year.
Earnings per share were $0.38, down 46% from last year's adjusted $0.71, so firmly exceeding the high end of our February expectation.
Moving now to a discussion of end market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.
Our Industrial segment had a strong first quarter, with each of our SBUs generating year-over-year organic sales and revenue growth.
For the segment, orders were up 25% organically, with a book to bill of approximately 1.1 times.
Sequential orders were up 7% further exemplifying the momentum we're seeing.
On a macro level, manufacturing PMIs in the US and eurozone remain particularly robust.
China, while a bit softer, remains an expansion territory.
And despite the semiconductor issue that's impacting automotive bills, IHS still predicts 2021 global production to be up 12% over last year.
Within the segment, our Molding Solutions business had strong orders across all brands, up 35% organically.
Our larger end markets, automotive, medical, packaging and personal care, each saw in excess of 25% orders growth, some well above that.
Sequentially, orders improved high single digits, marking the fourth quarter in a row of sequential growth.
Organic sales were up mid-single digits, while sequential sales were up low single digits.
Book-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times.
Backlog, which is predominantly our longer cycle mold systems, grew by approximately 25% year-over-year and low double digits from the fourth quarter of 2020.
There is definitely a lot to like about the activity of Molding Solutions and the business has been recently adding more talent to the sales and marketing team with a clear focus on driving long-term growth and margin expansion.
While near-term investments in such talent coupled with our innovation and digital initiatives, that I discussed last quarter, will hinder short-term margins.
We expect long-term performance to benefit [Phonetic].
Our 2021 expectation for Molding Solutions has improved, as we now forecast organic sales growth to be in the low teens.
Moving to Force & Motion Control.
Organic orders were up low double digits with organic sales up high single digits.
FMC via sheet metal forming end market is seeing the benefit of its automotive customers push to electric and hybrid vehicles.
Year-over-year orders are up across each of our primary geographic markets, North America, Europe and China.

...lity of supply and acknowledging the longer lead times required for some materials.
In the first quarter, we experienced approximately $1 million of combined freight and material inflation in the Industrial segment.
For the full year, we expect an impact of about $6 million, which is built into our outlook.
Our teams are working on [Phonetic] these issues, looking to decrease the risk exposure and to take actions to offset the inflation where appropriate.
Moving to Aerospace, sales were $82 million for the first quarter, down 38% from last year.
Operating profit of $11.1 million was down 65%, primarily driven by the lower sales volume.
Operating margin was 13.6%, versus a strong 23.9% a year ago.
You may recall, last year's margin was a high watermark, driven by the contributions of the aftermarket.
Aerospace OEM backlog ended the quarter at $600 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter and we expect to ship 45% of this backlog over the next 12 months.
First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $36 million, a decrease of $12 million versus a year ago, free cash flow was $28 million, versus $35 million last year, and capital expenditures of $8 million were down about $4 million from a year ago.
Regarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was 3.1 times at quarter end, essentially flat to the prior quarter result.
The Company is in full compliance with all covenants of our credit agreements and maintains adequate liquidity to fund operations.
While we anticipated the leverage ratio to peak with our first quarter 2021 results, we performed better than expected with the stronger financial results of the first quarter.
We see leverage further declining from this point absent any acquisition activity.
Our first quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 51 million shares.
We now expect to resume some share repurchase activity to offset equity compensation dilution, with respect to incremental share repurchases that will depend on a number of factors related to capital deployment and growth opportunities that are available to us.
Turning to Slide 5 of our supplement, let's discuss our updated financial outlook for 2021.
We now expect organic sales to be up 10% to 12% for the year, an increase from our prior view of up 6% to 8%, driven by stronger industrial growth.
FX is expected to have a 2% favorable impact on sales, while divested revenue -- divested Seeger revenues will have a small negative impact.
Operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 13%.
At this point, we're not anticipating significant residual restructuring charges to come through, so no forecasted adjustments to 2021 net income.
EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.98, up 9% to 21% from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64, that expectation is an increase from our prior view of $1.65 to $1.90, and we expect the first half of the year to contribute approximately 43% of 2021's earnings.
A few other outlook items.
Interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $16 million, while other expense is forecasted at [Phonetic] $8 million, both a bit better than our prior view.
We now expect capex to be approximately $50 million, down $5 million, average diluted shares of 51 million and cash conversion of over 100% are consistent with our prior outlook.
And lastly, we forecast a full year tax rate of approximately 30%.
However, we continue to analyze potential tax planning strategies to manage and reduce our overall tax cost.
To close, a very good start to 2021, supported by healthy orders for both segments.
With our focus on driving growth across the organization, we'll continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures and the funding of key strategic initiatives.
We believe that these investments will help us accelerate the recovery in our financial performance.
Leverage remains very manageable and should improve from this point, so the balance sheet can accommodate our approach.
