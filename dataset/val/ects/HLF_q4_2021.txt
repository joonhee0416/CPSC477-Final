2021 was another record year for Herbalife Nutrition.
Even during this period of continued global uncertainty due to the pandemic, our entrepreneurial direct sales channel helped consumers around the world pursue their nutrition and wellness goals by giving them access to our high-quality nutrition products.
For the full year, demand for our nutrition products resulted in net sales of $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year and an annual record for the company.
Our three largest regions, Asia Pacific, North America, and EMEA, along with 37 individual markets, set annual net sales records.
Full-year 2021 reported diluted earnings per share of $4.13 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.79 was an increase of 49% and 29%, respectively, compared to the full year 2020.
Full-year 2021 reported net income of $447 million and adjusted EBITDA of $874 million were both annual records for the company.
For the full year, we averaged over 500,000 active sales leaders per month, a record for the company and an increase of 9% compared to 2020.
We brought in 2.9 million new distributors and preferred customers, which was down just 1% compared to 2020 and actually up 31% compared to the more normalized 2019 year.
We continue to broaden our reach and attract new audiences in 2021, with two-thirds of our new distributor and preferred customers identifying as millennials or Gen Z. This younger demographic drives a high level of business activity by engaging with the business in new ways, including innovative nutrition club models and increased utilization of social media and digital tools.
Today, we also announced sales leader retention results for the last 12-month requalification period ending in January of 2022.
This year, a record 68.9% of our sales leaders were retained, up from last year's prior record of 67.9%.
We believe this result reflects the ongoing sustainability of our business and the attractive opportunity that we offer to our distributors.
Turning to the fourth quarter, our net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Q4 year-over-year trend was impacted by a challenging comparison period.
On a two-year stack basis, we saw growth of 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
The Asia Pacific region had another quarter of growth, up 5% compared to the prior year.
The region was led by continued strength in India, which grew 33%.
India is supported by strong underlying metrics, including 35% year-over-year growth in new distributors and in preferred members, as well as a 32% increase in active sales leaders.
We're making investments in India to further support the market with a newly opened 150,000-plus square foot state-of-the-art center in a suburb of Bangalore.
The new facility will allow us to accommodate planned growth in India as we go from the current level of 900 jobs to approximately 1,500 employees over the next five years.
The space will be home to a new local product research and development facility designed to accelerate new product launches.
It will also contain a state-of-the-art quality control lab, a distributor meeting facility, and a global business services center.
Looking at North America, we saw a decline in net sales of 3% in the quarter.
This decline is up against a challenging prior-year comparison period.
However, the two-year stacked growth rate in the region increased by approximately 29% compared to Q4 of 2019.
One area of continued strength in North America is our U.S. nutrition club business.
We ended the year with over 12,000 nutrition club locations, an increase of more than 30% compared to the end of 2020.
We are excited to see our sales force is energized by the...
...going cost of the shift to home delivery experienced at the onset of the pandemic.
Further, we have seen significant increases in input costs consistent with the news headlines related to raw materials, labor, and freight costs.
To partially offset these margin pressures in the near term, we will continue to leverage our pricing power.
We are also actively engaged in productivity improvement programs for both our front and back-office operations through the transformation program John referenced earlier.
This program involves the realignment of infrastructure to more effectively leverage our global shared service centers, investment in new technologies to increase efficiencies internally, as well as better support distributors and customers, and repositioning of certain strategic functions closer to the regions and markets they serve to better affect local initiatives.
We expect the first phase of this initiative will incur total pre-tax charges in SG&A in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
We carved out approximately $13 million of these charges in 2021, with most remaining expenses to be incurred throughout 2022.
We expect this first phase will result in annual incremental savings in the range of $10 million to $15 million with some savings beginning in 2022 increasing through 2023, with the full impact of the savings expected to begin in 2024.
We are also assessing a second phase of the program to begin in 2023 with expected ongoing annualized savings of the same magnitude as Phase 1.
As a result, for the full year, we are projecting our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.75.
This includes an approximate $0.17 currency headwind.
We are also providing full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $785 million to $845 million, which includes an approximate $21 million headwind due to currency.
Our 2022 guidance includes the assumption of $50 million in share repurchase per quarter, which reflects the minimum buyback amount we anticipate completing on a quarterly basis.
We continue to project reliable cash flow from our business model.
We believe there is value in guiding for a base level of consistent share repurchase while leaving room for potential incremental opportunistic share repurchases to take place over the course of the year.
We have demonstrated this pattern of consistency during 2021 by repurchasing approximately $100 million, $160 million, and $100 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively.
We anticipate this pattern of consistency to continue in 2022.
For the first quarter, we estimate net sales to decline in the range of down 10% to down 4%, which includes an approximate 240-basis-points currency headwind versus the prior year.
We expect the progression of the year-over-year comparisons will lead to a decline in net sales for the first half of the year, followed by growth in the back half.
First-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $1, which includes a projected currency headwind of $0.03 compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million.
Turning to cash flow, capital structure, and our share repurchase activity.
Our business continues to generate substantial cash flow.
Operating cash flow of $460 million for full-year 2021 was down from 2020, primarily due to the impact of several unfavorable accounts related to year-over-year net sales declines.
For 2022, we expect this to turn around in the second half of the year when the business returns to growth.
After completing just under $1 billion in share repurchases during the year, at the end of 2021, we had just over $600 million of cash on hand.
As I mentioned earlier, we have included a minimum of $50 million in share repurchases per quarter in our guidance for the year, which will cut into the approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our three-year share repurchase authorization.
