These statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those discussed or anticipated.
Also, during the call certain financial numbers may be discussed that differ from comparable numbers obtained in our financial statements.
We believe these non-GAAP financial numbers assist in comparing period-to-period results in a more consistent manner.
And with that, I'll turn the time over to Ryan.
We really appreciate you joining the call today.
This is my first earnings call as Nu Skin's CEO, so I'd like to take a few minutes to share my perspectives on our business both historically and for the future.
As we work to further transform our business toward our vision of becoming the world's leading innovative beauty and wellness company powered by our dynamic affiliate opportunity platform.
Nu Skin has a rich heritage of building innovative beauty and wellness products for nearly four decades including billion dollar brands like Nu Skin, personal care, Pharmanex and ageLOC.
However, the value of our business has often been defined through the narrow lens of our historic direct selling distribution channel.
But when you examine our business for what it is becoming, we are better described as a beauty and wellness company that connects consumers to innovative products that help them look feel and live better through our trusted brand affiliates, via our socially enabled digital platform, affiliate powered direct to customer social commerce.
Nu Skin is fundamentally a beauty and wellness company, based on our global reputation for high quality, innovative products and deep consumer connections.
We provide a holistic inside outside approach backed by robust R&D and scientific rigor, which very few companies provide.
And we are a category leader for beauty device systems, according to Euro monitor for four years running, which provides a very unique opportunity for us as we expand our device ecosystem moving forward.
We're now engaged in transforming our business from a traditional direct selling company to becoming the world's leading beauty and wellness company powered by our dynamic affiliate opportunity platform.
There are three key strategic imperatives that will enable our next era of growth.
First, we will launch Empower Me, our personalized beauty and wellness strategy as we begin to connect our beauty device systems to our expanding digital ecosystem beginning in 2022.
Second, we'll continue to evolve our go-to-market approach from a traditional direct selling business model to an emerging affiliate powered social commerce business model around the globe.
And third, we'll expand our digital platform with an enhanced.com experience, as well as two new apps, Vera for our customers and Stella for our affiliates.
Let me give a bit more context on our work in each of these three strategic areas.
Building upon our leadership position as the world's number one beauty device systems brand, we will expand our device systems by introducing next generation connected devices beginning in 2022.
The beauty device category continues to be the highest growth sector in beauty and personal care, and we believe that our connected device strategy will further expand our share of that category.
Our products are loved by well more than a million registered customers today and many more unregistered customers around the globe, and through Empower Me personalized beauty and wellness.
We will be able to connect even more customers, nurture deeper engagement and build stronger community of brand lovers, which will result in greater lifestyle value.
We aspire to achieve what other great device companies like Apple, Amazon and Peloton have done making us the leader in connected beauty and wellness.
Next, social commerce is disrupting traditional e-commerce just as e-commerce disrupted retail more than 20 years ago.
Global research estimates the social commerce will expand from approximately $500 billion in 2020 to $3.4 t...
...ly encouraged with our Q3 results as we continue to improve in this important market.
The 10% revenue and 18% growth in sales leaders was driven by successful product promotions around our TR90 body shaping system.
Our focus for the balance of the year will be previewing ageLOC META and expanding leader training around social commerce.
And finally, Southeast Asian Pacific.
This segment has been perhaps the most impacted by COVID with deepening lockdowns in various markets and local market distribution challenges hindering our ability to fulfill orders in some markets.
For the balance of the year we are looking forward to the introduction of ageLOC META in the fourth quarter.
I look forward to further participating on these calls, and hopefully meeting some of you in person soon.
I'll provide a financial overview and then give Q4 and full year 2021 guidance.
For additional detail, please visit our Investor Relations website.
For the third quarter, our revenue was $641.2 million and benefited 2% due to foreign currency.
While this represents an 8.8% decline versus Q3 2020, it is growth of 8.7% on a two-year look back versus Q3 2019.
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.97 down 10% year-over-year, but up 22.8% versus the same period in 2019.
Gross margin for the quarter improved 130 basis points to 75.2%.
Gross margin for the core Nu Skin business was 78.6% compared to 76.3% driven by product mix, product cost reductions and supply chain efficiencies.
Selling expense as a percent of revenue remained consistent with the prior year at 39.9%.
For the Nu Skin core business selling expense was 42.7% compared to 42.4%.
General and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 25.1% compared to 23.5% in the prior year.
For the quarter G&A declined $3.9 million year-over-year, as we remain focused on carefully managing expenses.
Operating margin for the quarter was 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the prior year period, largely impacted by revenue.
We still anticipate an approximate 50 basis points year-over-year improvement in operating margin for 2021.
On our way to our stated midterm goal of 13%.
The other income expense line reflects a $2.8 million gain, compared to a $0.5 million gain in the prior year.
The benefit this quarter largely stems from unrealized gains and our rise investment holdings.
As our investments and rise increase, you can expect more variability in our other income expense line item.
Cash from operations was $30.2 million for the quarter, and was impacted by our continued strategic investment in inventory to meet customer demand for new products and build some protection from global supply chain construction.
We anticipate this elevated inventory level will decrease over the next few quarters.
We paid $19 million in dividends and repurchased $10 million of our stock with $255.4 million remaining in authorization.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 27% compared to 24.8% in the prior year period.
Our rise segment, which includes our manufacturing partners, grew 4% in the quarter.
These manufacturing entities continue to benefit our core business by helping shore up our supply chain and generate US profit that lowers our overall tax rate.
As Ryan mentioned, we also acquired an emerging social commerce technology company Mabelle.
And we continue to carefully seek investment opportunities.
Given our Q3 results, we are adjusting our annual guidance and now expect revenue of $2.67 billion to $2.70 billion, which is annual growth of 3% to 5% or growth of 10% to 11% versus 2019.
We anticipate earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.03, year-over-year improvement of 8% to 11% or 27% to 30% on a two-year look back.
This guidance assumes a positive foreign currency impact of 2% to 3% and a tax rate of 26% to 28%.
We are projecting fourth quarter revenue of $645 million to $675 million.
Assuming a foreign currency headwind of approximately 1%.
Q4 earnings per share guidance is $0.90 to $1 and assumed a tax rate of 25% to 29%.
