Joining me are our chief executive officer, Bob Steers; our president, Joe Harvey; and our chief financial officer, Matt Stadler.
Further, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
My remarks will focus on our as-adjusted results.
Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $1.24 per share compared with $0.76 in the prior year's quarter and $1.06 sequentially.
The fourth quarter of 2021 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation-to-revenue ratio and effective tax rate, respectively.
Revenue was a record $159.7 million for the quarter compared with $116.6 million in the prior year's quarter and $154.3 million sequentially.
The increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management and open-end funds and higher performance fees from certain institutional accounts when compared with the third quarter.
Our implied effective fee rate was 58.1 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 57.5 basis points in the third quarter.
Excluding performance fees, our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points, and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57.3 basis points.
Operating income was a record $82.6 million in the quarter compared with $49.4 million in the prior year's quarter and $70.4 million sequentially.
Our operating margin increased to a record 51.7% from 45.6% last quarter, primarily due to the cumulative adjustment mentioned a moment ago, which reduced compensation and benefits to reflect actual amounts to be paid.
Expenses decreased 8.1% when compared with the third quarter as lower compensation and benefits was partially offset by higher G&A.
The compensation-to-revenue ratio, which included the cumulative adjustment was 26.16% for the quarter.
For the year, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 32.22%.
The increase in G&A was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment, increased hosted and sponsored conferences, and higher recruitment fees.
And the increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds.
Our effective tax rate, which was 25.36% for the quarter, included a cumulative adjustment to bring the rate to 26.15% for the year.
The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in a nondeductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre-tax base.
Our firm liquidity totaled $248.2 million at quarter-end, compared with $241 million last quarter.
Firm liquidity as of December 31 reflected the payment of a special cash dividend in December of $60.3 million or $1.25 per share.
Over the past 12 years, we have paid a total of $15.25 per share in special dividends, and we continue to be debt-free.
Assets under management totaled a record $106.6 billion at December 31, an increase of $9.4 billion or 10% from September 30.
The increase was due to net inflows of $1.8 billion and market appreciation of $9.1 billion, partially offset by distributions of $1.6 billion.
This marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we have recorded net inflows.
Bob Steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates.
And now, I'd like to briefly discuss a few items as we begin the new year.
First, regarding our expected compensation-to-revenue ratio.
We intend to balance anticipated revenue growth from year-end assets under management that exceeded our full-year assets under management by about 13%.
With a disciplined approach toward adding human capital, in addition to the full-year impact from the new hires we made last year, we plan on making controlled investments in order to broaden our product offerings, expand our public a...
...ly, net flows in the quarter were not just strong but also diverse, with meaningful contributions from each of the wirehouse, regional brokerage, and RIA segments.
In addition, DCIO open-end fund net inflows were a record $476 million and marked the 14th consecutive quarter of net inflows.
DCIO assets in our open-end funds ended the year at a record $6 billion.
Our non-U.S. open-end funds registered net inflows of $45 million in the quarter and a record $202 million for the full year.
We will continue to invest to support growth in this important channel, and we expect that flows will continue on an upward trajectory.
For the year, the powerful combination of strong absolute and relative performance derived from our unique and diversifying asset classes resulted in 25% organic growth in wealth and industry-leading market share as well.
Our U.S. global real estate and preferred securities funds achieved market share records of 33%, 12%, and 46%, respectively, against other comparable actively managed funds.
2021 was a record year for the institutional advisory channel as well with $1.9 billion of net inflows.
However, 2021 was also a year in which we reorganized our sales leadership and converted to a regional approach to our institutional sales coverage.
We enter 2022 fully staffed and prepared to go higher and deeper into the global institutional marketplace.
In the quarter, the advisory channel had net outflows of $456 million.
These outflows were driven by a single and unexpected client termination of $400 million.
However, not included in the headline advisory flow results was $564 million of net new mandates from institutional clients, which were invested into our open-end funds.
Other full-year achievements for the advisory channel include positive net flows from each of the U.S., EMEA, and Asian markets.
Additionally, all of our core strategies, U.S. real estate, global real estate, global listed infrastructure, and preferred securities registered net inflows.
The pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandates has increased dramatically $900 million in September to $2.1 billion, another new record.
New awards in the quarter totaled $1.3 billion and included our first relationship in Africa, a $300 million global listed infrastructure mandate.
Sub-advisory flows in the quarter were subdued.
Net outflows in Japan were $242 million and distributions totaled $276 million.
Sub-advisory net outflows ex Japan in the quarter were a modest $56 million.
At the risk of sounding overly optimistic, we believe our current momentum and growth prospects have never been brighter, driven as always, by our industry-leading investment results.
It bears repeating that virtually 100% of our AUMs are outperforming their benchmarks for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year time periods, a truly remarkable accomplishment.
Looking ahead, the combination of industry-leading investment performance, rising demand for real asset strategies and our plans for new product introductions designed to meet this demand has us poised for continued organic growth.
In addition to our open-end fund organic growth, next month, we plan to market the first new listed real estate securities closed-end fund in over nine years, supported by an exceptionally strong and deep syndicate.
And as I've discussed, the institutional advisory channel entered this year with a record pipeline, fully staffed, and the reorganization behind them.
Also under new leadership, our EMEA wholesale business is also poised to deliver meaningful organic growth.
To capitalize on all of this momentum, this year, we plan to launch multiple new initiatives which will seek to position Cohen & Steers at the intersection of public and private real estate markets through the introduction of vehicles tailored to the unique requirements of both the institutional and wealth marketplaces.
These initiatives are designed to take us higher and deeper into real assets and position us for continued future growth.
