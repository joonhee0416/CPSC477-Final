We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial.
With us on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer.
Calling your attention to slide two.
These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions, including our proposed acquisitions of Charles Stanley PLC and TriState Capital Holdings, and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or general economic conditions.
We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
During today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance.
I want to first, by apologizing, I'll sound like a broken record, using the word record over and over again.
It really was an outstanding year and quarter.
I wish management could take credit, but it is really the work of our advisors and associates that delivered these results.
Their dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing.
We've proven once again that focusing on our time-tested client-first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisors and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions, in this case, in record-setting fashion.
The record results we generated would not have been possible without everyone's contribution.
Starting on slide four with our quarterly results.
The fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts.
The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and record quarterly net income of $429 million, or earnings per diluted share of $2.02, which reflects the impact of the three for two stock split in September.
Excluding the $10 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $437 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equaled $2.06.
The increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees, primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee-based accounts.
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, a very impressive result, especially in the near zero-rate environment and given our strong capital position.
Moving to slide five.
We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially.
We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $627 billion and record financial assets under management of $192 billion.
We continue to focus on supporting advisors and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client-focused culture.
As a result, we had a fantastic year in terms of advisor retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisors to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options.
We ended the quarter with records of 8482 financial advisors, net increases of 243 over the prior period and 69% over the preceding quarter, representing a new record during the fiscal year we recruited financial advisors with approximately $330 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $54 billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels.
Also in the Private Client Group, advisors generated domestic net new assets of approximately $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the fiscal year, a very strong result reflecting our excellent reten...
... an 8% sequential increase, reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet.
Liquidity and capital remained very strong.
The total capital ratio of 26.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6% are both over double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, giving us significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.
You can see that RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, decreasing 26% during the quarter, as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the Charles Stanley acquisition, which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022, for as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions, over the past five quarters.
During the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares, split adjusted for $118 million.
As of October 27th, $632 million remained under the current share repurchase authorization.
Due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank.
The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve.
Criticized loans declined and non-performing assets remain low at just 20 basis points.
The bank loan loss provision of $5 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter.
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held for investment, declined from 1.34% in the preceding quarter to 1.27% at quarter end.
For the corporate portfolios these allowances are higher at around 2.25%.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year, which exceeded many records.
As for our outlook, we are well positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios, quarter-end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial advisor recruiting and investment banking.
In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first quarter with a 2% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts.
Additionally, based on our robust recruiting pipeline, we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platforms.
In the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong and we expect a solid fixed income brokerage results, driven by demand from the depository client segment.
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management.
And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow, as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet.
We will continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through our securities-based loans and mortgages and we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on the long-term and our long-term growth.
And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core businesses continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A.
Our recent announcements to acquire TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time.
We believe these acquisitions stay true to our long-standing criteria, which is a good cultural fit, a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders.
These results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family.
