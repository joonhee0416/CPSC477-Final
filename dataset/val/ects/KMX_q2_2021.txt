I'm here today with Bill Nash, our president and CEO; Tom Reedy, our executive vice president of finance; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our senior vice president and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our senior vice president, CAF operations.
Celeste has been an integral part of our IR program for almost 20 years, and I'm sure you will all agree, she'll be deeply missed.
Celeste, we wish you all the joy and happiness retirement can bring.
Net earnings up 27% to $297 million and earnings per share up 27.9% to $1.79.
This performance was the result of strength across all aspects of our business: retail, wholesale and CAF.
We are proud to be the nation's largest and most profitable retailer of used car.
I'm also proud to say that this quarter, we completed the rollout of our omnichannel offerings.
This has been years in the making and has required a remarkable level of focus and change across our entire organization.
During this time, we have evolved nearly every aspect of our business.
From how we support and interact with our customers to how we structure our staffing to how we buy, sell and deliver cars.
Our omnichannel experience is built to provide a personalized multichannel experience that empowers customers to buy a car on their terms.
It is designed as a world-class in-store experience, a world-class online experience and a seamless integration of the two, giving us the largest addressable market within the used car industry.
No other used car retailer is in the position to deliver this iconic customer experience the way we can.
Now turning to our results.
For the second quarter, we achieved a 3.9% increase in total used units sold and the used unit comp growth of 1.2%.
In June, we experienced a high single-digit negative used unit comp which was more than offset by positive comps in both July and August.
The improvement in sales was the result of a variety of factors, including solid execution in operations, finance and marketing in addition to a strengthening used car sales environment.
In the quarter, we saw solid growth in web traffic, averaging approximately 29 million visits per month to carmax.com.
During the second quarter, our saleable inventory was below our targeted level as we saw a rapid increase in demand from the first quarter.
For the past three months, our teams have done a phenomenal job buying and producing vehicles at record levels, increasing salable inventory by more than 50% in the quarter.
Today, I'm pleased to report that we've successfully ramped inventory to targeted levels, providing customers with more than 55,000 vehicles nationwide, the largest of any used car retailer.
We offer a broad selection of inventory with a focus on zero to 10-year-old vehicles.
This quarter, we saw five to 10-year-old vehicles increased to 27% compared with 22% last year as a percentage of our sales mix, reflecting customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles.
Gross profit per used unit for the quarter was $2,214 up $31 per unit from a year ago.
For wholesale, performance was supported by strong appreciation in the market and excellent execution by our teams.
Volume was up 5.1%, driven by one more auction date in the quarter and a record buy rate.
We also achieved record gross profit per wholesale unit of $1,086 in the quarter, the result of strong appreciation and operational execution.
By the end of the quarter, we saw depreciation return to the marketplace.
As a reminder, all auctions continue to run virtually throughout the quarter.
As our results show, we have achieved a substantial recovery in our business.
Over the past several months, our talented workforce has demonstrated incredible agility and ability to drive change in one of the most challenging environments that we've ever faced.
We are proud to say that by the end of July, our team was back together again, and we no longer had associates on furlough.
We are now actively hiring across the country as we continue to grow our core business, enhance our omnichannel o...
...combine them with the information in our customers' data mark, and provide a truly personalized experience that is much more effective in meeting the customer needs and improving our conversion rates.
We believe that we have an unmatched opportunity to create a superior customer experience by leveraging our data and technology advantages, both online and in-store.
Digital merchandising is another area of continuous improvement.
By the end of this year, we will have rolled out approximately 95% of our photo studios, which provide a more immersive experience with high-quality photos, 360-degree interior and exterior views, feature scoring hotspots and reconditioning with new part call outs.
We also continue to upgrade content on our website to help customers fully research a vehicle without ever having to leave carmax.com.
All this provides our customers more confidence as they progress online.
The other omni area of focus that I will highlight is our customer hub, which provides customers a means to track the progress they have made, both online and in-person.
It is here that customers can manage certain aspects of their car-buying journey.
They can book mark and save vehicles they've selected online.
They can submit financing pre-approval and compare their financing options.
They can also get an estimate or an actual offer for their trade-in.
And finally, they can complete the checkout process in the hub for the car they selected online or in-store and choose if they want a home delivery or a curbside pickup.
Our omnichannel experience has been well received.
Approximately 70% of our customers interacted with our CECs this quarter.
Additionally, approximately 50% of our customers progressed their sale remotely, up from about 42% pre-COVID.
Most of these customers still chose to come to the store to complete their transaction, and approximately 30% of our customers still opted for an in-store experience only.
Again, the advantage of our business model is that customers have the choice as to how they progress their experience.
This is what gives us the largest addressable market.
We are focused on driving customer engagement strategies to ensure we continue to remain top of mind and the first choice for car buyers and sellers.
We launched a national marketing campaign last year, which has reinforced the strength of our brand and established a solid platform for future campaigns.
We've now introduced our omnichannel offering nationwide.
Accordingly, as we go forward, our messaging will focus on clearly differentiating our brand from digital-only and traditional dealer brands by demonstrating the benefits of our omnichannel offering.
Additionally, we will be increasing our year-over-year marketing spend in the back half of the year to expand our teams and investments in areas such as SEO, SEM, messaging, content and social.
Our goal is to drive high ROI customers to our digital properties, while empowering us to create multichannel personalized campaigns.
We have a unique retail customer experience that we are continuing to evolve to exceed our customers' expectations.
At the same time, we are identifying and investing in new initiatives that we believe will also be solid contributors to our earnings growth.
All of this leads to a very exciting future, but none of this would be possible without our great associates.
I want to recognize all of them and the high-performance culture they maintain here at CarMax, a culture that values all individuals and perspectives.
Over the past several years, we have taken on the largest transformation in our company history, evolving nearly every aspect of our business.
We also accomplished all these great results in one of the most challenging environments we've ever faced.
And through it all, our associates have continued to live our values every day by putting people first and taking care of each other.
I am very proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead.
