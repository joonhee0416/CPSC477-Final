These materials will be referenced during portions of today's call.
A detailed description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in AFG's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also available on our website.
We may include references to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure in our remarks or responses to questions.
This was an outstanding quarter.
We're extremely pleased with the company's performance and continued strong market conditions.
Third quarter pre-tax core operating earnings and AFG's Property and Casualty Insurance segment were 60% higher than the comparable prior year period, and each of our Specialty Property and Casualty groups reported healthy growth and excellent underwriting margins.
Results in our portfolio of alternative investments continue to exceed our expectations and produced strong investment returns in the quarter.
This year, market conditions in the Property and Casualty business remain among the best I've seen in my 40 plus year career.
We believe that our disciplined, yet opportunistic operating philosophy, a lower net catastrophe exposure than our peers and a continued economic recovery contributed to these outstanding results.
I'll now turn the discussion over to Craig to walk us through AFG's third quarter results, investment performance and our overall financial position at September 30th.
As you'll see on Slide 3, AFG reported core net operating earnings of $2.71 per share, an impressive 96% increase year-over-year.
The increase was primarily the result of substantially higher underwriting profit in our Specialty P&C insurance operations and significantly higher P&C net investment income due to the continued strong performance of AFG's $1.7 billion and alternative investments.
Annualized core operating return on equity in the third quarter was nearly 18%.
Turning to Slide 4, you'll see the third quarter 2021 net earnings per share of $2.56 included non-core after-tax realized losses on securities of $0.15 per share, most of which pertain to fair value adjustments on securities that we continue to hold at the end of the quarter.
Now I'd like to turn to an overview of AFG's investment performance, financial position and share a few comments about AFG's capital and liquidity.
The details surrounding our $16.4 billion investment portfolio are presented on Slides 5 and 6.
Pre-tax unrealized gains on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio were $225 million at the end of the third quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, P&C net investment income was approximately 66% higher than the comparable 2020 period and included significantly higher earnings from alternative investments.
We're especially pleased with the performance of our alternative investments during the quarter.
Earnings from these investments may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on reported results and valuation of the underlying investments and generally are reported on a quarter lag.
The annualized return on alternative investments reported in core operating earnings in the third quarter of 2021 was a very strong 20.3%.
The average annual return on these investments over the past five calendar years was approximately 10%.
Alternative investments with underlying real estate exposures have been a key contributor to the performance of this portfolio.
We view our investments in real estate and real estate related entities is a core competency.
In addition to our portfolio of directly owned properties and mortgage loans, our real estate related investments include real estate funds and real estate partnerships accounted for by the equity method.
We found great success in investing in multifamily properties and desirable communities where we continue to achieve very strong occupancy and collection rates and steady rate increases.
These multifamily properties represented over half of our alternative investment portfolio on September 30, 2021.
Due to the significant portion of our alt...
...tinue to enjoy robust survival ratios, which are well above industry averages in which our one measure of the strength of our A&E reserves.
Based on a relatively moderate payment patterns and the pace of new filings, we'll most likely continue to assess our reserves utilizing in-house resources next year.
We have also assessed the adequacy of our asbestos and environmental reserves for historic railroad and manufacturing operations.
Asbestos liabilities continue to be adequate, though we are making a small adjustment to our environmental liabilities based on slightly revised projections at three environmental sites.
Based on results for the first nine months of the year, we now expect AFG's core net operating earnings in 2021 to be in the range of $10.10 to $10.70, up significantly from our previous range of $8.40 to $9.20 per share.
We're obviously pleased once again to increase our 2021 core earnings per share guidance in a meaningful way.
This guidance reflects an assumed annualized return of approximately 10% on alternative investments in the fourth quarter of 2021, which would produce a return of approximately 20% on our $1.7 billion of alternative investments for the full year in 2021.
As we consider the outlook for our Specialty Property and Casualty operations based on results to the first nine months, we strengthened our guidance across the board, indicating higher expected 2021 net repayments and stronger underwriting profit.
We now expect the 2021 combined ratio for the Specialty Property and Casualty Group overall between 86% and 88%, an improvement of 2 points at the midpoint of the range of our previous estimate.
Net written premiums are now expected to be 11% to 14% higher than the $5 billion reported last year.
Growth in net written premiums excluding workers' comp is now expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, an increase from the range of 12% to 16% estimated previously.
And then looking at each sub segment.
We now expect the Property and Transportation group combined ratio to be in a range of 86% to 88%.
Our guidance assumes above average crop earnings for the year and we continue to expect growth in net written premiums for this group to be in the range of 15% to 19%.
Our Specialty Casualty Group is now expected to produce a combined ratio in the range of 85% to 87%.
Our guidance assumes continued strong renewal pricing in our E&S excess liability and several of our other longer-tail liability businesses.
We have raised our projection for growth in net written premiums to a range of 8% to 12% higher than 2020 results.
Premium growth will be tempered by rate decreases in our workers' compensation book, which are result of favorable loss experience in this line of business.
Excluding workers' comp, we now expect 2021 premiums in the Specialty and Casualty Group to grow in a range of 15% to 19%, an increase of 5 percentage points from the midpoint of our previous guidance.
And we now expect the Specialty Financial Group combined ratio to be in a range of 84% to 86%, reflecting strong underwriting results for the first nine months of the year.
We continue to expect growth in net written premiums for this group to be between 10% and 14% based on projected premium growth in our fidelity and crime and surety businesses.
And our expectations for overall renewal pricing are unchanged from last quarter, remaining in the range of 9% to 11% overall.
And excluding workers' comp, we expect renewal rate increases to be in the range of 11% to 13%.
Craig and are very pleased to report these exceptionally strong results and a significant increase in our earnings expectations for the full year.
We believe that our entrepreneurial opportunistic culture, combined with our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility position us very well as we close out the year and we look forward to the opportunities in 2022.
We'll now open the lines for the Q&A portion of today's call, and we'd all be happy to respond to any questions.
