Despite the extraordinary challenges 2020 presented on a global scale, we are extremely pleased with the strong execution of our team -- that our team has shown, not only in the field, but by all of the employees within the family of companies, who demonstrated the true resiliency of the Reliance business model.
I applaud each and every one of you for your tremendous efforts to quickly and nimbly adapt to the changing environments, ensure our customers were always taken care of, and most importantly, maintain your unwavering commitment to health and safety, our most important core value.
Since 2017, our SMART Safety program has been focused on embedding our culture of safety across our entire family of companies.
Working together as one company, we focused on this initiative in 2020 like never before in response to the new and unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to developing new policies and procedures to prevent the spread of the virus, we improved our safety performance in 2020 with an approximately 23% reduction in our incident rate compared to 2019.
While this is a significant milestone, as I've stated in the past, we will not be satisfied until this rate reaches 0.
I'd like to take a moment to congratulate both Karla Lewis and Arthur Ajemyan for the recently announced well-deserved promotions.
Consistent with our Board's strategic executive leadership succession plan, Karla was promoted from CFO to President and was simultaneously appointed to our Board of Directors effective January 15.
Karla has demonstrated excellent judgment and leadership in each role she has held since joining Reliance in 1992, and her unique abilities and talents have earned the respect of our employees and shareholders.
Karla's promotion recognizes her significant contributions to Reliance.
It will allow her to broaden her knowledge of Reliance's field operations and increase the diversity of her experience.
In addition, Arthur Ajemyan was promoted to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 15.
Arthur has held various positions in Reliance's finance and accounting department for over 15 years and has done a phenomenal job.
I congratulate both Karla and Arthur on their promotions and look forward to continuing to work closely with them in their new roles.
Now let's turn to our 2020 results.
We delivered a solid financial performance in 2020, driven by consistently strong operational execution despite considerable turbulence in the market.
Our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our people and unique business model as well as our ability to execute through both good times and bad given the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies.
Our decentralized structure allowed us to respond rapidly to fluid market conditions and demand trends.
These factors, combined with pricing discipline and continuous improvements to our value-added processing capabilities, enabled us to achieve our second consecutive year of record annual gross profit margins at 31.5%, up 120 basis points from 2019 and exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%.
We also maintained healthy profitability levels despite the extraordinarily volatile and challenging market conditions.
For the full year, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.71 as a result of the combination of strong margin discipline and effective expense control, which helped mitigate our decline in profitability.
On the heels of a record year in 2019, we maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion in 2020 driven by our profitability and focus on working capital management.
Fueled by our ongoing focus on rightsizing our inventory to reflect current demand levels and our differentiating advantage of cross-selling inventory among our family of companies, we achieved our companywide inventory turn goal of 4.7 times based on tons for 2020.
In line with historical trends and the cornerstone of our business model...
...s you've heard us say before, approximately 60% to 65% of our SG&A expenses are people related.
When looking at the 11.5% year-over-year decline in same-store SG&A expenses, approximately half of the decrease was people-related as our headcount declined 14% compared to the prior year.
In addition, lower incentive pay due to lower gross profit and pre-tax income levels also contributed to the decline in our compensation costs.
Although we are entering the first quarter of 2021 with a more efficient expense structure because of strong volume and pricing trends, we expect our expenses will increase in the first quarter of 2021 from the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with seasonal trends.
I will address our Q1 2021 outlook for demand and pricing shortly.
For the full year of 2020, our effective income tax rate declined to 22.1% from 24% in 2019 mainly due to our lower pre-tax income level in 2020.
We currently anticipate our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be 24%.
Our strong gross profit margin and effective expense management resulted in $2.01 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020, well above our outlook of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share but down 17.6% from $2.44 in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to reduced demand levels related to the pandemic, with commercial aerospace and energy end market sales being significant contributors to the decline in our sales.
In comparison to the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 was up 7.5% from $1.87 due to improved pricing, strong gross profit margin and recovering demand in most end markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $230.2 million during the fourth quarter due to our profitable operations and effective working capital management, including our focus on rightsizing our inventory levels.
At the end of the year, our total debt outstanding was $1.66 billion, resulting in net debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 1.1 times.
Also at the end of the year, no borrowings were outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
As mentioned last quarter, we significantly strengthened our liquidity position through the successful completion of both our $900 million senior notes offering and amended/restated $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility.
The facility amendment, combined with the proceeds from the notes offering, provides us with ample liquidity and an improved debt maturity profile.
I'll now turn to our outlook.
While macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, favorable market conditions have persisted so far into the first quarter of 2021, with improving demand and additional mill price increases on many carbon and stainless steel products.
This environment allows us to maintain higher gross profit margin levels as we increase our selling price prior to receiving the higher-cost metal in our inventory.
We expect these favorable conditions to continue for the remainder of the first quarter.
As a result of these favorable conditions and the normal seasonal improvement, we estimate our tons sold will be up 10% to 12% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2021 will be up 12% to 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for the first quarter of 2021.
In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter 2020 financial and operational results.
Outstanding execution by all of our employees greatly contributed to our success in 2020.
Their efforts, coupled with our resilient business model and disciplined execution of our strategy, resulted in yet another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow, enabling us to continue supporting our growth and stockholder return priorities.
