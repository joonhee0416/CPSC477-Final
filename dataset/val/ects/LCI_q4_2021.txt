On the call today are Tim Crew, Chief Executive Officer; John Kozlowski, the company's Chief Financial Officer, Maureen Cavanaugh, our Chief Commercial Operations Officer; and Steve Lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives.
A playback will be available for at least three months on Lannett's website.
In a moment, Tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and initiatives.
Then John will discuss the financial results in more detail.
We hope you remain safe and well as we all manage through the persistency of the pandemic.
I'll start today reviewing some of the highlights of the past year that are relevant to our future before turning to the key elements we see in that future.
First and foremost, in 2021, we continued to launch products and build our future portfolio.
We launched about a dozen new products, highlighted by a few significant contributors, including Levothyroxine tablets, Levothyroxine capsules and Clarithromycin.
The products we launched last year added new revenue streams and further diversified offerings, reducing our exposure and reliance on key products.
We also grew our base product pipeline with continued investment in a robust internal product development program.
For example, our recent Mycophenolate approval was achieved in just under 10 months, the third such product we developed to achieve so called first cycle approval in the past few years.
We have made great strides in our internal efforts including significant changes to our portfolio selection.
Such changes take time to be fully reflected in our financials, but we believe meaningful value is being built.
Further, we are working on our existing strategic alliance partners to expand our agreements to include new products.
For example, this past year Insulin Aspart was added to our HEC agreement, and more recently, generic Spiriva, Handihaler was added to our Respirent agreements.
Together these products represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few competitors expected.
We also formed a new strategic alliance partnership to launch Sevoflurane, a product with relatively few competitors and a market size of about $190 million based on IQVIA data.
We look to launch Sevoflurane in the back half of the fiscal year.
The second key accomplishment last year was even while we launched new products and grew our pipeline, we also maintained firm control over expenses and exhibited operating discipline.
We implemented and completed the cost reduction plan that included consolidating our R&D functions to a single location and lowered operating costs by approximately $15 million annually.
The third key accomplishment was that we significantly improved our capital structure.
This last year, we paid off our Term A loans with cash on hand and later successfully completed a full refinancing transaction of the Term B loans.
The refinancing transaction as we have often highlighted was significant for several reasons.
First, we extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more meaningful pipeline assets are expected to launch and contributed to a reduction in our debt.
Second, we upsize our credit facility and substantially freed up cash flow, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity.
Third, the new debt does not have any leverage covenants.
Fourth, as a result of this refinancing, in combination with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position.
Thus, we now have more ready resources to invest in growth opportunities.
Of course, another accomplishment to note was in our teams, particularly in our plants and labs, showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic and maintained a reliable supply of our affordable medicines.
This, of course, despite all the extra challenges we have been doing so this past year.
We are quite proud of all of these accomplishments.
Of course, there are ...
... a high quality and reliable manufacturer.
We point out these characteristics that make Lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers think of Lannett when they consider Made in America in various ESG related initiatives.
To sum-up today's remarks, our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 were significant.
We faced head on a highly competitive market environment.
We launched new products and made important advances in the development of key products in our pipeline.
We expanded existing agreements that added three large durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises.
We refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extended our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our large pipeline assets.
We continue to believe that the exciting products in our advancing and expanding pipeline still have the potential to transform our firm into $1 billion company by 2025.
I'll begin with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
For the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared with $137.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year.
Gross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared with $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year fourth quarter.
R&D expenses declined to $6.0 million from $6.6 million.
SG&A expenses declined to $15.5 million from $15.6 million.
Operating income was $4.9 million, compared with $26.7 million.
Interest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter.
Net loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share versus net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million.
Turning to our balance sheet.
At June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million at March 31.
Cash increased during the fourth quarter due to a few factors.
First, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt.
Second, relates to working capital improvements that continued from the third quarter.
And the third, was the receipt of income tax refunds.
Looking ahead, we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity.
Accordingly, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position throughout the year and end fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 plus million.
As for our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which today we have not drawn upon.
Turning to our guidance, which as Tim mentioned earlier, does not include sales of generic ADVAIR DISKUS or zolmitriptan.
For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $400 million to $440 million, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 23% to 25%, adjusted R&D expense in the range of $26 million to $29 million, adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $58 million to $61 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $55 million, and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $12 million to $18 million.
Regarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA in Q1 to be lower than Q4, ramping up slightly in Q2 and continue to ramp-up more in the second half of fiscal 2022.
The increase is related to expected new product launches.
Gross margin in the first half of the fiscal year to be in the lower range of our outlook, ramping up to the upper end of the range in the second half of fiscal 2022 and operating expenses to remain relatively consistent throughout the year, though, we expect Q1 to be slightly higher than the other quarters, as they include certain compensation related expenses that are only recorded at the beginning of our fiscal year.
With that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have.
