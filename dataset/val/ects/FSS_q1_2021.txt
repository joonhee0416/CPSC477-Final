I'm Ian Hudson, the Company's Chief Financial Officer.
Also with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
These documents are available on our website.
In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.
I'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our first quarter results, before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide her perspective on current market conditions, our progress against strategic initiatives, and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter with record orders and operating results, exceeding our expectations despite ongoing pandemic related disruptions.
We also had to navigate through the February ice storms in the south, which caused us to temporarily close our facilities in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.
Fortunately, we did not experience any significant damage, but we did lose several days of production.
Despite these challenges, the teams recovered well with both groups delivering adjusted EBITDA margins at or above levels achieved in the first quarter of last year.
That feed is even more impressive, given the strength of the prior year quarter, which included record production at our largest facility and minimal impact from the pandemic.
Turning now to the numbers where consolidated net sales for the quarter were $279 million compared to $286 million last year.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $27.8 million compared to $32.3 million last year.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $41.2 million compared to $43.9 million last year.
That translates to a margin of 14.8% in Q1 this year compared to 15.3% last year.
Net income for the quarter was $22.2 million compared to $23.4 million last year.
That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.36 per share compared to $0.38 per share last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38 per share, compared to $0.39 per share last year.
Order intake for the quarter was outstanding with orders of $384 million represent -- representing our highest quarterly orders on record and an increase of $80 million or 26% compared to Q1 last year.
Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter also set a new company record at $410 million that represents an increase of $9 million compared to Q1 last year and an increase of $106 million or 35% from the end of 2020.
In terms of our group results, ESG net sales for the quarter were $228 million compared to $233 million last year.
ESG's operating income for the quarter was $27.1 million compared to $29.4 million last year.
ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.3 million compared to $40 million in the prior year.
That translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% in line with last year.
EFC reported orders of $324 million in Q1 this year, an improvement of $87 million or 37% compared to last year.
SSG's net sales for the quarter were $51 million this year compared to $53 million last year.
Operating income for the quarter was $7.2 million dollars compared to $7.4 million last year.
SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was consistent with the prior year at around $8.2 million while its adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved to 16.2% of 80 basis points from Q1 last year.
SSG's orders for the quarter was $60 million compared to $66 million last year.
Corporate operating expenses for the quarter was $6.5 million, up from $4.5 million last year.
The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable year-over-year variance of $2.6 million associated with changes in mark-to-market adjustments of post-retirement reserves.
These market based adjustments benefited our earnings in Q1 last year by approximately $0.02 per share but were unfavorable in Q1 this year.
Turning now to the consolidated income statement where the decrease in sales contributed to a $6 million reduction in gross profit.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.7% compared to ...
...under way, and while it is still early days, OSW was off to a solid start in the first quarter.
Our M&A pipeline has been active to say the least.
And it's been exciting to be back on the road visiting potential targets.
As Ian noted in his comments, our financial position and liquidity are strong, enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions and there are a number of M&A opportunities our teams are currently reviewing.
We have also continued to make significant investments in our existing plans to add capacity to support our long-term growth and to gain operational efficiencies through automation.
As we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint, we are evaluating our long-term strategy with respect to our Elgin and University Park production facilities in Illinois.
Both properties are currently leased at above market rates with lease terms ending in 2023.
We are currently looking at opportunities and alternative facilities in the surrounding areas as we proactively plan for a potential move.
The American rescue plan, COVID release package, includes approximately 1.9 trillion of economic stimulus with approximately $350 billion going to state, local and territorial governments with the goal of keeping frontline workers employed, distributing the vaccine, increasing testing, reopening schools, and maintaining essential services.
We are actively educating our dealer channel about the stimulus program and have distributed the latest estimate allocation of the $350 billion of state and local government support by jurisdiction to our dealer channel to share with its customer base.
As a provider of equipment for -- used for essential services like sewer kitting and street sweeping, Federal Signal stands to benefit meaningfully from additional aid that may be provided to state local sources for these purposes.
As was evident with our first-quarter order intake, our dealer partners remain optimistic about market conditions in 2021, noting that both corporate and sales tax collections appear to have held up better than originally anticipated, which should add stability to their revenue sources.
We expect that our long-term infrastructure bill will provide visibility for project planning and could see capital equipment demand increases in areas such as roads, bridges, broadband, Clean Energy and public transportation buildup.
We anticipate that this will provide benefits for the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, Safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners and street sweepers.
We have positioned Federal Signal in a manner in which we fully participate in the post-pandemic recovery by increasing capacity within our facilities, reducing lead times to a level where we can better respond to customer needs, investing in new product development and gaining market share.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year.
Orders thus far this year have exceeded our expectations, fueled by a combination of new product launches ongoing execution against our strategic initiatives and strong recovery in our end markets.
With certain chassis manufacturers temporarily impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, we are currently encountering some short-term production challenges at our largest facility.
Our teams are working diligently to navigate through this disruption as they have in the past when faced with similar situation.
After factoring in the impact expected over the next couple of months, at this time, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year of $1.73 to $1.85.
With our recently completed capacity expansion at several facilities, we are well positioned once the current chassis uncertainty eases.
Demand for our products is at an all-time high, with the recent federal stimulus, and the possibility of infrastructure investment offering potential for further momentum, which we have not factored into our current outlook.
