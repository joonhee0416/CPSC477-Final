Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.

We completed the separation of our Industrial Technologies segment through the spin-off of Vontier Corporation on October 9, 2020, and have accordingly included the results of the Industrial Technologies segment as discontinued operations.
All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.
Starting on slide three.
Our first quarter performance continued to highlight the benefits of our efforts to enhance the growth and resilience of our portfolio, significantly expanding our positions in software and healthcare and adding substantial sources of higher growth recurring revenue.
As a result, our portfolio has been well positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement over the past few quarters as markets have begun to reopen.
In Q1, we continue to see significant improvement, not only across our short-cycle businesses, primarily Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also at many of the businesses that have faced COVID-related headwinds, such as Advanced Sterilization Products.
Turning to the results in the quarter.
We generated total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, above the high-end of our guidance.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year.
The combined outperformance on core growth and earnings helped drive another strong quarter of free cash flow.
Our SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint and Gordian continue to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with the current Gordian seeing better top line momentum overall.
These software offerings are an important part of our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions to address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities.
Despite the challenges of a COVID environment, we continue to leverage FBS tools to drive performance improvements across the portfolio.
ASP is advancing the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns as well as progress accelerating commercial efforts, as it delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base.
Intelex also continues to see success from the application of FBS tools to improve its sales process, driving better lead generation, improved customer win rates and stronger sales pipeline creation.
While these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses, in order to deliver accelerated growth, innovation and market share gains.
Relative to organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies as well as build additional capacity to drive future innovation.
With the FORT, we are continuing to scale our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications.
In 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting more than $250 million of potential revenue opportunity.
Our acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows as well as generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive.
We've also made a number of additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, with three start-up opportunities currently in different phases of incubation.
With these investments, we are enhancing our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition.
In terms of performance ac...
...ity, we are well positioned to pursue our key capital allocation priorities and are maintaining an active pipeline of deal cultivation efforts.
We continue to see a broad range of opportunities to deploy capital to build on our core hardware and instrumentation positions as we also leverage deep domain and workflow expertise into adjacent high value software data-driven opportunities.
Turning now to the guide on slide 11.
As a result of the strong first quarter performance and given some improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance.
For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.50 to $2.60, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 24% on a continuing operations basis.
This assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%.
It also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021.
We also continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year.
We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%.
This assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%.
For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income.
The full year guidance incorporates $35 million of additional investments that we are making to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities to support higher growth in the years ahead with $15 million in the second quarter.
This includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base as well as to accelerate the development of AI machine learning offerings for our customers.
It also includes funding for investments in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, where we have seen good early progress thus far.
With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks.
Before we move to questions on slide 13, I wanted to highlight the continued progress we're making with respect to our key sustainability goals.
In Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, yielding valuable insights that we use to define the new pillars of our sustainability strategy, which will guide our efforts going forward.
We've also made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to complete the collection of 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets.
We look forward to discussing our progress and our evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day.
The results that we announced today are a testament to the depth and dedication of our teams and the relentless focus on the continuous improvement principles that power our culture.
As we look forward, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of the market opportunities we address and the significant organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us.
As macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus will remain on driving strong core growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying our capital to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase the value we bring to customers.
We are also excited to share more details with you about our road ahead when we speak on May 19 at our Investor Day.
In the almost five years since our spin, we have positioned the portfolio to be higher growth, more profitable and a more powerful generator of free cash flow.
This sets us up well for accelerated compounding across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you.
That concludes our formal comments.
