The slides for today's call can be found on the Investors section of our website, along with the news release that was issued today.
These uncertainties include economic conditions, market demands and competitive factors.
Also, the discussions during this conference call may include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the slide deck for today's call, which is posted on the Investors section of our website.
Turning to slide three.
Also joining us on the call is Ram Mayampurath, who was announced earlier today has been appointed Rogers' Chief Financial Officer, effective May 1.
Rogers delivered another strong financial performance in Q1 driven by growth in advanced mobility markets, a strengthening market recovery and continued operational excellence.
First quarter net sales increased 9% to $229 million and exceeded the top end of our guidance.
Gross margin improved to 39% as a result of our strong operational performance.
EPS also exceeded the high end of our guidance, and we reported earnings of $1.66 per share on a GAAP basis and record adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share.
The increase in Q1 sales was broad-based, and nearly all of our markets increased at double-digit rate.
The impressive growth was enabled by both our strategic focus on fast-growing markets and the ongoing economic recovery.
We continue to realize the benefits of our multiyear investments in innovative technologies to capitalize on the accelerating opportunities in advanced mobility markets.
EV/HEV and ADAS sales increased at double-digit rates sequentially and grew more than 30% compared to Q1 of 2020.
Sales of compression pads and related solutions for EV batteries were especially strong and more than doubled year-over-year.
Sales of our power semiconductor substrate solutions were also higher.
We anticipate further top line growth as these markets continue to accelerate.
As announced last quarter, we are investing aggressively in additional capacity for our advanced battery compression pad and ceramic substrate technologies to take advantage of this opportunity.
We are also investing in additional resources and capabilities to support this growth.
We are at a growth inflection point, and these investments will position Rogers to capitalize on the significant momentum in these markets and add to our strong market positions in the near term and longer term.
Sales in the defense market increased at an impressive rate in Q1, similar to the EV/HEV and ADAS markets.
Our focused strategy and new product introductions continue to drive design wins and growth.
We saw a resurgence in industrial demand in Q1 as sales grew sharply versus the prior quarter and returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Our sales in the industrial market are closely tied to levels of capital investment, which continues to improve.
Demand was strongest for applications used in semiconductor equipment.
Other markets, such as clean energy and wireless infrastructure, also showed strong improvements in Q1 with sales growing at double-digit rates.
In the portable electronics market, sales were seasonally lower in the first quarter and consistent with our expectations.
The impact to sales from the disruption to our UTIS facility was minimal as a result of selling our undamaged finished goods inventory.
We continue to work closely with our customers during this time, and we remain on track to resume production in the fourth quarter of this year.
Q1 sales were largely unaffected by global supply chain disruptions, but we began seeing more impacts as we exited the quarter.
In the second quarter, the lack of availability of certain raw materials, primarily due to weather interruptions along the U.S. Gulf Coast, will somewhat temper our sales growth and gross margin.
However, we expect this headwind to modera...
...r than Q4 expenses.
The higher adjusted operating expenses were due to higher performance-based compensation costs as well as higher benefit costs.
Other income expense was $1.2 million favorable compared to Q4.
Included in other income expense in Q1 are the realized gains on our copper hedging contracts, which offset the impact of higher copper costs included in the gross margin in the first quarter.
As discussed earlier, Rogers' effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25.2%, higher than our forecasted rate of 22% to 23%.
We now expect our effective tax rate for 2021 will be 23% to 24% due to the geographic mix of pre-tax income.
Turning to slide 12.
The first -- in the first quarter, the company generated strong free cash flow of $33 million and ended the quarter with a cash position of $199.1 million.
In the quarter, we generated $36.5 million from operating activities, net of an increase of $10.8 million in working capital and repaid $21 million on our credit facility.
We ended the first quarter with an outstanding balance on our credit facility of $4 million and a net cash position of $195.1 million.
In Q1, the company spent $3.6 million on capital expenditures.
Despite the low level of expenditures in the first quarter, we continue to guide capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million in 2021, with over 50% of the expenditures to capture the accelerating advanced mobility market opportunities in both AES and EMS business segments.
The guided expenditures exclude the capital necessary to restore the UTIS operation, a significant portion which we expect to be reimbursed by insurance proceeds.
I've had the pleasure of working closely with Ram during my time at Rogers.
He is an excellent choice to continue driving the company's growth and profitability forward.
It is a privilege to be named as Chief Financial Officer at Rogers, and I'm extremely excited about the opportunity to serve in this capacity at such a pivotal time for the company.
Lastly, I look forward to becoming better acquainted with the members of our investment community.
Turning now to second quarter guidance on slide 13.
As Bruce discussed earlier, we see continued strength in many of our markets, particularly in advanced mobility, general industrial, defense and wireless infrastructure.
Based on the strong outlook, we are guiding our second quarter revenues to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million.
The effect of our UTIS factory being off-line and the lack of availability of certain raw materials will impact our second quarter growth.
Following several quarters of significant gross margin improvements, we expect Q2 to be flat sequentially before improving further in the second half of 2021.
To prepare for our strong second half, we will be stepping up our resources across the business in the second quarter.
Also in the quarter, we will continue to see challenges from mix, raw material cost increases and supply constraints related to the Gulf Coast interruptions mentioned earlier.
We have taken commercial actions to mitigate the increase in raw material costs.
These actions will have a positive impact on our gross margins in the second quarter, with full impacts benefiting the second half of 2021.
We expect to overcome the supply constraints by the end of the second quarter and see favorable impact from higher volume and better mix in the second half.
We guide our gross margins to be in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%, consistent with our first quarter.
The company will recognize higher operating expenses in the second quarter from timing of certain expenses, including performance-based compensation.
Costs incurred to support anticipated growth in the second half and to restore UTIS operations will also increase operating expenses in the quarter.
We are guiding GAAP Q2 earnings in the range of $1.58 to $1.73 per fully diluted share, and we guide fully diluted adjusted earnings in the range of $1.80 to $1.95 per share for the second quarter.
