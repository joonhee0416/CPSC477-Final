I will begin the call with brief remarks regarding our third-quarter performance before offering some perspective on the current market environment.
I will also provide an update on CMC's key strategic growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that CMC's third-quarter fiscal 2021 financial results were the best in our company's 106-year history.
Earnings from continuing operations were $130.4 million or $1.07 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion.
Excluding the impact of a gain on the sale of a small rail reclamation business, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $127.1 million or $1.04 per diluted share.
CMC reported a core EBITDA of $230.5 million, generating an annualized return on invested capital of 18%.
This level of performance underscores CMC's enhanced earnings capability following our multi-year strategic repositioning.
Third-quarter volumes were exceptionally strong in North America and Europe, and the ability of our commercial operational logistics and support teams to respond to the rise in customer demand generated our strong financial performance.
and Poland set monthly shipment production records during the quarter, enabling us to capitalize on market conditions.
During the quarter, we also continued to execute on our previously discussed in-flight strategic initiatives and growth projects.
We are expanding our capability to serve the merchant bar market.
Customers appreciate CMC's expanded product range and service capabilities, and we're seeing our recent investments in handling and storage capacity pay off in increased volumes.
We expect more growth in the future, especially once our state-of-the-art Arizona 2 micro mill starts up in early 2023.
We continue to execute on our network optimization efforts.
And with recent actions firmly entrenched in our financial performance, CMC is roughly halfway to our longer-term goal of $50 million in annual cost efficiencies.
You can see the benefit of these efforts in our controllable cost performance on a per-ton basis.
Despite well-publicized inflationary pressures across the global economy, we were able to reduce this metric modestly on a year-over-year basis.
In April, we received the required air permit for Arizona 2, CMC's planned state-of-the-art micro mill at our Mesa, Arizona site.
This was an important milestone, enabling us to begin construction and we continue to anticipate an early 2023 start-up.
As a reminder, this plant will be the first micro mill in the world capable of producing merchant bar as well as rebar.
It will also be the first in North America with the capability to connect directly to an onsite renewable energy source.
These capabilities, combined with a micro mill's inherent low-cost and low-carbon footprint will define a new level of operational and environmental excellence in long products steelmaking.
In May, our team in Europe began hot commissioning their plant's third rolling line.
The start-up process is going very well, and we expect to begin commercial production late in the fourth quarter.
This project was delivered on time and under budget, a testament to our Polish team's ability to execute.
We will be ramping operations within a very strong market environment, which will help shorten the time to achieve our targeted annual run rate incremental EBITDA of $20 million.
I'd now like to provide an update on market conditions.
The encouraging trends we discussed during our second-quarter call continued and strengthened in the third quarter.
As I will detail, project owners have grown more confident as the economy has recovered and states have reopened, and they are now more willing to contract new work.
This view is supported by the strong level of new awards booked in the quarter.
The strength and new project opportunities is occurring in both the private and public sectors.
On the private side, CMC is seeing work related to the hardening of supply chains, as well as the trend toward investments in e-commerce in...
...lable costs per ton of finished steel shipped compared to a year ago despite inflationary pressures in freight and certain other costs.
A quick glance at recent producer price index or manufacturing ISM reports should underscore the strength of this accomplishment.
The most significant benefit came from volume-driven efficiencies at our steel mills and recycling yards, as well as the impact of closing the former Steel California rolling operations.
Turning to Slide 9.
Our Europe segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $50 million in -- for the third quarter of 2021, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $14.3 million in the same period of the prior year.
The improvement was driven by expanded margins over scrap and strong volumes across all ranges of products.
Margins over scrap increased $90 per ton on a year-over-year basis and were up $84 per ton from the prior quarter.
Tight market conditions provided the backdrop to achieve the segment's higher -- highest average selling price in nine years, reaching $664 per ton during the third quarter.
This level represented an increase of $227 per ton compared to a year ago and $132 per ton sequentially.
Europe volumes increased 8% compared to the prior year and reached their highest third-quarter total in a decade.
The strength was driven primarily from the market for rebar.
Volumes of merchant and other products also grew on a year-over-year basis, supported by goods demand from industrial customers in Central Europe, as well as some opportunistic billet sales.
As Barbara mentioned, the demand environment during the quarter was robust, with indications that conditions should remain favorable in the near term.
Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity.
As of May 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $443 million.
In addition, we had approximately $639 million of availability under our credit and accounts receivable programs.
In March, we upsized our revolving credit facility to $400 million from $350 million and extended the maturity till 2026.
During the quarter, we generated $94 million of cash from operating activities despite a $79 million increase in working capital.
The rise in working capital was driven by the significant increase in both scrap input costs and average selling prices.
We expect working capital balances to increase modestly heading into the end of the fiscal year.
Our leverage metrics remain attractive, and we have improved significantly over the last two fiscal years.
As can be seen on Slide 12, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at 1.0 times, while our net debt to capitalization is just 20%.
We believe our robust balance sheet and overall financial strength provides us the flexibility to fund our strategic growth projects, navigate economic uncertainties, and pursue an opportunistic M&A.
CMC's effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, which was both below our full-year effective rate forecast to be around 25%.
Lastly, I would like to provide that our current outlook for capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 remains between 200 million and 225 million of which roughly 100 million will be used for the new micro mill.
For comparison purposes, we have previously stated that our typical capital spend averages around 150 million annually.
We expect a strong finish to fiscal 2021.
The summer construction season is under way, and demand is robust across each of our major product lines in both North America and Europe.
We anticipate margins over scrap on steel products in both segments to be consistent or up modestly compared to the third quarter.
Our internal indicators such as bidding activity and backlog level support continued strength.
The recent recovery of leading national construction indicators such as the Architectural Billing Index dodged momentum index and the Portland Cement Association forecast each mirror our view.
These external measures also point to good conditions in the calendar year 2022.
And at this time, we will now open the call to questions.
