This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.
Actual results could differ materially from these statements.
I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full-year performance as well as our 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021.
We will then open it up for Q&A.
As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.
We finished 2020 in very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis.
Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance.
For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth, organic growth in all four of our categories: oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well.
Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement.
We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange.
Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter.
Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in prices.
The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind.
In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 100 basis points year over year and a base business basis where we were up 90 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin while raw materials were a 320 basis-point headwind driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 280 basis-point benefit.
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year.
On the base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis.
This was primarily driven by a 210 basis-point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation, and e-commerce.
Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S., and investments behind growth and innovation.
For the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points driven primarily by a 100 basis-point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics cost.
For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year over year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis.
Our earnings per share was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis.
For the full year, our earnings per share growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.
We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year.
As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Filorga transaction with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.
A few comments on our divisional performance.
North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic.
We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our skin health businesses in the quarter.
Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales.
N...
...evenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment.
For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management.
As I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products.
Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems, and innovation for new channels, all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently.
And given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth.
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth.
We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line.
We need to deliver profitable growth.
You can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings-per-share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization.
We're doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focus on all cost elements throughout the income statement.
Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in the transformation capabilities that we're deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.
The third reason is that we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people.
As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched.
In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth.
To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation, like the Optic White pen, the Miracle Repair serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities.
And all this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales.
And lastly, it's building out the right team.
You need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization.
We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation.
Like our transition SAP S/4HANA that's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions.
We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed, and capability building our ability now to develop applications must faster and realize the value of those applications much faster; and with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead.
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process.
You will remember that was called CBP that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management.
So to sum it up, when I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future.
