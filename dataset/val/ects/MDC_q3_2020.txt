These and other factors that could impact the Company's actual performance are set forth in the Company's third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today.
It should also be noted that SEC Regulation G requires that certain information accompany the use of non-GAAP financial measures.
M.D.C. Holdings posted another quarter of strong operating results, highlighted by year-over-year home sales revenue growth of 33%, homebuilding operating margin expansion of 370 basis points and net income growth of 96%.
Net new order growth for the quarter increased 73% as compared to last year on a sales pace of 6.1 homes per community per month.
These results underscore the excellent homebuilding fundamentals we are currently experiencing across our markets and demonstrate our ability to grow our operations while continuing to improve our profit margins.
Homes increasingly serve as offices, classrooms and places of entertainment for the family, and as a result, people have gravitated to a living environment then can be accommodated in this new reality.
While this trend has been a positive development for the overall housing market, it has been particularly beneficial to the new home market for several reasons.
First, there is a limited existing inventory for consumers to choose from.
According to the National Association of Realtors, total housing inventory at the end of September totaled 1.4 million units, which was down 19% from a year ago and represents less than a three-month supply of homes.
Second, a newly constructed home gives consumers the peace of mind that they will be living in a home that no one else has lived in, which is a real selling point for many families during these uncertain times.
Supplementing the demand we've experienced as the pandemic, is the demographic shift toward home buying that we believe will serve as the tailwind for industry moving forward.
Millennials are increasingly aging into their prime home buying years, while baby boomers and empty nesters are looking to downsize into homes that fit their new lifestyles.
MDC is well positioned to take advantage of these demographic shifts due to our strategic focus on opening communities with affordable products.
Homebuyers of all ages are looking for value when it comes to buying a home, and we have found ways to accommodate the desires through more efficient floor plans, while the combination of lower rates and pandemic-related buying has spurred demand across all product types, we believe the more affordable segments of the market will be the most resilient over time.
We have been fortunate in having a deep bench at MDC.
And to that end, I am pleased that Rebecca Givens has agreed to step into Michael's role as Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
On the operations side, David Viger has moved into the important role as Chief Operating Officer of our homebuilding operations.
Anthony Berris has been promoted to President of our Financial Service operations.
And Dawn Huth has taken on additional responsibilities as Senior Vice President of National Finance.
All of these individuals have proven themselves to be highly capable leaders during their time at MDC, and I look forward to them contributing to our continued success in the future.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate David Mandarich, who has been elected as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
David has been associated with the Company since 1977, most recently as our President and Chief Operating Officer.
And he is widely regarded as one of the most skilled leaders within the homebuilding industry.
His move into the CEO role is a key step in the evolution of our Company.
And I look forward to continued collaboration with him on strategic directions of the Company.
David will be participati...
...ed the quarter with 194 active subdivisions, which is slightly higher than a year ago.
With the strong sales activity we've experienced during the third quarter, we have a number of subdivisions that are approaching closeout earlier than expected.
As a result, we anticipate roughly 185 active subdivisions at year-end.
Although this would be a decrease from the end of the third quarter, it would be unchanged from where we started the year.
On Slide 10, we provided further net new order detail by month since April.
You can see that sales activity ramped up significantly after the initial slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We saw order activity peak during the month of August, but September remained strong and well above the prior year, even after we increased prices in most of our subdivisions.
We also saw the rate of cancellations continue to decrease as the months progressed.
We expect some seasonality to kick in during the fourth quarter.
However, October has remained very strong relative to the prior year.
Based on the activity we've seen to date, we expect our October 2020 net orders to exceed our October 2019 orders by at least 50%.
As a result of our strong sales, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.1 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year.
The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 4% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives, and a shift in mix to California.
These factors were slightly offset by a shift in mix to lower-priced communities consistent with our ongoing strategy of offering more affordable home plans.
I will now turn to land activity on Slide 12.
The number of lots we acquired this quarter increased 63% year-over-year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on continuing to grow our business.
While the number of lots we approved earlier this year were down due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we approved over 3,800 lots for purchase during the third quarter of 2020.
In the end, in spite of immense volatility, the number of lots approved over the last 12 months has increased by 34% compared to the prior year period.
As a result, our total lot supply to end the quarter was 8% higher than at the same point in 2019, supporting our growth potential for future periods.
We expect to see strong lot approval and acquisition activity continue into the fourth quarter given the robust demand that we have seen in recent months and our conviction about growth prospects for housing in future years.
In summary, clearly, we are encouraged by the resilience the housing market has shown in the third quarter given the immense challenges our country has faced in 2020, and we believe that we have executed our operating strategy well in this volatile environment.
More importantly, we see an opportunity to sustain growth well into the future, supported by solid demographics and changing customer preferences.
Our current backlog, not only puts us in position for a strong end to 2020, but also provides us with the opportunity for significant year-over-year increases in home sale revenues and pre-tax income to start 2021.
With our strong balance sheet and current land pipeline, we are well positioned to grow community count significantly in 2021 and have a preliminary target of at least 10,000 home deliveries for the coming fiscal year.
We are mindful that there are many risks to achieving this target, especially with COVID-19 still impacting our daily lives.
These risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our Company and the safety of our employees, subcontractors and customers will remain top priority.
Following our strong third quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.33 to $0.40 per share.
This represents a 33% increase from the prior year and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their continued support.
