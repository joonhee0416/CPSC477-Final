We appreciate you joining us.
First, I'm going to discuss the details behind our third quarter 2020 financial results.
Paul will then comment on the key drivers behind our Q3 results, our outlook for the remainder of 2020 and some general comments on 2021.
I will return to provide our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and an update to the full year 2020 guidance.
We'll then end the call with a question-and-answer session.
In addition, some of our discussion may include non-GAAP financial measures.
Now, let's discuss our third quarter results in which we achieved $0.91 in adjusted earnings per share, a 21% increase over Q3 of 2019 and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase.
These results reflect outperformance in worksite employee growth and pricing relative to our expectations in this uncertain and challenging business environment and upside in our direct cost programs brought about by the dynamics of the pandemic and the structure and ongoing management of these programs.
As for our growth metric, the average number of paid worksite employees in Q3 of 2020 increased by 1.7% sequentially over the Q2 period to 231,750, which was above the high-end of our expected range.
Now you may recall that employee layoffs in our client base drove a 6% reduction in paid worksite employees from the outset of the pandemic in March through the low point in May of this year.
Since then, worksite employees have grown sequentially as employees returning to work and being hired by our clients have outpaced any further layoffs.
Additionally, client retention for both Q2 and Q3 has remained at our historical level of 99% and worksite employees continue to be added from new client sales.
Given these recent positive trends, we now expect paid worksite employees to return to near pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year.
Now let's move on to gross profit, which increased by 8% over Q3 of 2019.
Worksite employee volume and pricing above target levels, combined with upside in our benefit and workers' compensation programs, resulted in significantly higher-than-expected gross profit.
This quarter's benefit costs included some favorable development from Q2, a period of highly unusual claim activity due to the impact of the shutdown orders.
In addition, healthcare utilization began trending toward more normalized levels in the third quarter, although not to the degree of our expectations.
Going forward, we expect further normalization along with the resumption of some deferred care in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, the extent and timing of which is still uncertain.
Our workers' compensation program continues to perform well due to ongoing management of safety practices and claims.
Recent favorable claims development has been associated primarily with periods prior to the pandemic.
And any favorable impact from the reduction in severity of workers' compensation claims associated with the work-from-home status of many of our clients' employees would likely favorably impact our costs in future periods as this claim experience develops over time.
As for our pricing, we charge our clients a comprehensive service fee, inclusive of our HR services and direct cost programs.
We entered 2020 with certain pricing targets set prior to the offset of the pandemic.
And we continued to manage toward these budgeted targets.
As you may recall, certain savings resulting from the disruption caused by the pandemic were negotiated with our vendors and were passed along to our clients in the form of a comprehensive service fee credit as reflected in our Q2 financials.
Now turning to operating expenses, Q3 operating expenses included continued investment in our growth, including costs associated with a 10% increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors.
Other corporate employee head count has remained level over the past three quarters due to the effort and effectiveness of our staff in the face of increased HR service demands fro...
...a better understanding of the factors driving our business model during a pandemic, what does that mean as we look ahead to 2021?
Well, first, it means planning will be dependent on these factors and drivers that are likely to ebb and flow based upon the state of the pandemic.
We will be monitoring these new inputs very closely and we'll finalize a budget later than usual to include the most recent information.
Making estimates at an early stage makes little sense in view of the number and range of possibilities, especially when considering the timing and degree of severity of the pandemic or the actions that may occur to mitigate its effects.
For example, COVID cases are on the rise now, but one or more vaccines may be available by 2021 or an anticipated economic downturn from additional lockdowns may occur.
Additionally, small businesses may be bolstered by additional fiscal stimulus.
What we have learned is there are many moving parts and offsets in our business model in this environment.
If the pandemic intensifies, our direct costs may be below our historical trends as we experienced this year, but growth may suffer.
Conversely, if the pandemic is mitigated or under control, direct costs may be elevated, but growth may accelerate as an offset.
What I do know with the degree of certainty today is, we have an amazing organization with the necessary curiosity and brainpower to provide the agility and capability to manage through a crisis and come out with impressive results for shareholders clients and other stakeholders.
This year we have demonstrated the depth and breadth of our competence and level of care for our clients to execute on matters within our control, along with inspiring ingenuity and resourcefulness to respond to unexpected events.
We are certainly pleased with our 2020 results today and our outlook for the balance of the year and we look ahead with confidence in the future whatever we face next year.
At this time, I'd like to pass the call back to Doug.
Now let me provide our guidance for the fourth quarter and an update for the full year of 2020.
As you're aware, there continues to be uncertainty as to duration and the conditions of the pandemic and the trajectory of the economy.
The current political environment and the timing and details of any further government stimulus add to this uncertainty.
We have taken this into account when providing our financial guidance over the remainder of 2020 and we will be considering these factors in our budgeting process for the upcoming year.
We typically do not provide formal guidance for the upcoming year at this time and, therefore, we'll consider any further developments in these areas and the outcome of our year-end selling and renewal season [Phonetic] when providing 2021 guidance in our next earnings call.
Now based upon the details that Paul just shared, we continue to expect sequential worksite employee growth over the remainder of 2020.
For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting average paid worksite employees in a range of 236,500 to 238,500, a sequential increase of 2% to 3% over Q3 of 2020.
This equates to an expected decrease in average paid worksite employees of only 1% for the full year 2020 in the face of significant challenges for the small business community caused by the pandemic and its impact on the economy.
With an improved outlook for Q4 worksite employee growth, our current pricing strength and a range around expectations in our direct cost programs, particularly our benefits program, we're now forecasting Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $30 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.38.
When combined with our Q3 outperformance, we're raising our full year 2020 earnings guidance and now forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $271 million to $281 million, an increase of 8% to 12% when compared to 2019.
As for full year 2020 adjusted EPS, we are now forecasting a range of $4.35 to $4.53, up from our previous guidance of $3.67 to $4.04.
