These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC.
For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP results included after-tax transformation and other charges of $54 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges.
In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver.
But through it all, UPSers leverage the flexibility of our integrated network and the technology that powers it to deliver what matters.
A little over one year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework under a customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy.
Inside that strategic framework is a focus on three main areas.
First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume.
Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost takeout initiatives.
And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers, and higher returns on the capital we deploy.
While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results.
Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated.
Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion, driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all three of our operating segments.
Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion, driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control.
Each of our segments delivered year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit operating margins.
And for the first nine months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history.
Brian will share the details of our performance shortly.
As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMBs.
These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network.
Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities.
This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week.
We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial pickups and deliveries.
In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery.
The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital.
And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis.
As we look at our third-quarter results, we see that SMBs value the new capabilities we are providing.
In the U.S., SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9% year over year.
In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past six quarters.
volume, up 380 basis points from one year ago.
And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%.
We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our Digital Access Program, to customers outside of the U.S. Let me also touch on SMBs and healthcare.
When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology, and expertise.
Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB healthcare customers and significantly driving profit growth in this sector.
And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year with 99.9% on-time delivery.
We are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress.
While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights.
In the U.S. we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH, or pieces per hour, increased by 2.5%.
Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Da...
...logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our healthcare portfolio.
In the third quarter, supply chain solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million, and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%.
As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS freight results, given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30th of this year.
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense.
Other pension income was $285 million.
And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items.
Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet.
We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income.
So far, in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash from operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow.
And in the first nine months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends.
In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan.
with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter.
We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years.
Now I'll make a few comments regarding the full-year outlook.
We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and inventory and labor shortages.
Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter.
Due to our third-quarter outperformance, combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives, and our increased fourth-quarter plan, we are raising our full-year guidance.
On a consolidated basis, we expect full-year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year over year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS freight.
Additionally, consolidated operating margin should be around 13%.
In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume.
We anticipate the full-year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%.
As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter.
First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year.
And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives.
As a result, we expect the sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Moving to the international segment.
We expect full-year revenue growth of around 20.7%, with an operating margin of about 23.9%.
And in the supply chain solutions segment, we anticipate full-year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%.
Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion, and return on invested capital will be around 29%.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion.
And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%.
As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June.
We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework, and delivering on our commitments despite a very dynamic environment.
We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers and our people and the financial performance of our company.
And operator, please open the lines.
