These statements do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them.
After I've provided some updates on our business performance, Jim will review the Q4 financial results in more detail.
We closed the year on a strong note, with accelerating top line growth over the third quarter.
Revenue increased 55.3% to $264.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, and we continue to execute strongly across all areas of the business.
Earnings per diluted share were $2.36, a 42.2% increase over the prior year period.
However, due to significant differences in tax rates between the periods, we believe income from operations is a better gauge of how we perform from a profitability standpoint.
Jim will discuss our tax rates in more detail when he covers our financial results.
For the fourth quarter, income from operations was $38 million, an increase of 103% versus the same period last year.
Growth was driven by significant year-over-year and sequential improvements in the number of active earning OPTAVIA Coaches, which grew to 44,200 in the fourth quarter, another new record.
Additionally, productivity per active earning coach increased 13.4% to $5,932 during the quarter compared to the prior year period.
Our client community remains strong, and we finished 2020 even better than expected, with successful incentive coach programs in Q4 that position us well for 2021.
The initiatives we've implemented over the past one to two years are delivering consistent, meaningful progress as evidenced by the results we announced today.
The company's focus continues to be supporting our growing community of independent OPTAVIA Coaches as they develop and focus on the four competencies that drive our business success, namely, attracting new clients, supporting clients on the Optimal Weight 5&1 Plan and supporting new coaches and developing coach leaders.
There's an ever-growing number of individuals seeking greater health and wellness, and we remain resolutely focused on targeting those for whom diets have filled and who desire a holistic approach to optimizing their overall health and well-being.
The key insights supporting our sustained growth is that clients do better on their health and wellness journey when they have the support of a coach.
Coach-led model has been clinically proven to be more effective in this regard.
As such, we have combined the most powerful aspects of the direct selling model and direct-to-consumer offerings and created a model that puts the OPTAVIA Coach at the center of helping clients on their health transformation journey with the company providing the distribution infrastructure to supply products directly to the end consumer.
We reach our target audience through the community of OPTAVIA Coaches, who leverage social media channels to relate their success with our proprietary habits of health transformation system and products.
Our vision is to achieve long-term sustainable growth in the mid-teens by penetrating the large and growing addressable market in the United States, continuing our expansion into Asia Pacific markets and developing other large markets throughout the world.
As we continue to grow at scale in both coaches and clients, it's essential that we place sharp focus on building an operational foundation through investments related to organization, technology, digital products, manufacturing and distribution.
This will allow us to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunity.
Consistent with the business and brand strategy that we communicated last quarter, we are moving forward with the sunset of our Medifast Direct channel and Medifast branded products and anticipate this being complete by the end of the second quarter.
By focusing on building capabilities in the areas that matter most to our OPTAVIA Coaches and client-cente...

SG&A for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $51.9 million to $161.3 million compared to $109.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.
The increase was primarily due to higher OPTAVIA commissions expense as a result of growth of OPTAVIA sales as well as increased salaries and benefits related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses.

There was -- there are approximately 2,323,000 shares of common stock remaining under our stock repurchase program.
Consistent with last quarter and due to the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not providing guidance at this time.
We would, however, like to provide you with some insight into the first month of the first quarter and that January's top line year-over-year growth trends are performing consistent with or better than the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter.
If you are attempting to develop a financial model for 2021, I will remind you that Q2 through Q4 2020 have much harder comparables than Q1 2020 from a top line basis.
As Dan discussed, in 2021, we intend to sunset our Medifast Direct channel and Medifast branded products and further invest in our supply chain and technology.
We've also budgeted for a return for in-person convention if safety measures permit.
These decisions and investments will have an impact on our operating margins during 2021 but will enable long-term growth and operating income objectives.
Again, if you are developing a financial model for 2021, these initiatives will increase costs.
In closing, 2020 has been a very robust growth in the face of a very challenging and uncertain environment.
We remain confident in our business model and are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that lie ahead.
