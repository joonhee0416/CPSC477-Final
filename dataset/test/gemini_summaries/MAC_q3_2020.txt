Macerich's Q3 performance reflects the significant impact of COVID-19, with funds from operations (FFO) per share declining to $0.52 excluding certain items. However, there has been progress in reopening centers, with all now operational, and rent collections improving to an average of 80% in Q3 and over 80% in October. Occupancy remains at 90.8%, a slight decrease from the previous quarter, primarily due to bankruptcies and local tenant closures. Leasing activity has improved, with 3x the number of leases and square footage signed compared to Q2, including deals with Gucci and Lucid Motors. Despite lower traffic levels, retailers are reporting strong sales, suggesting higher conversion rates and consumer demand. The company's liquidity has increased to $675 million, and it has secured several loan extensions. Macerich anticipates that 2020 will be a trough year for operating results, but expects improved performance in 2021 due to reduced bankruptcy filings, increased lease termination income, and higher ancillary revenue.
