NHI reported a strong Q1 2020, with diluted EPS of $1.37, a 3.1% increase in NAREIT FFO to $1.35, a 3.8% increase in normalized FFO to $1.36, and a 5.7% increase in AFFO to $1.29. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company withdrew its 2020 guidance, as the full financial impact of the pandemic remains uncertain. As of May 5th, there were 192 active resident cases of COVID-19 in 37 of NHI's buildings, which is less than 1% of the over 20,000 residents being cared for. Occupancy has been negatively impacted, with Bickford, SLC, and Holiday experiencing a 150 basis point decline in combined average occupancy from March to April. The skilled nursing portfolio has also seen a decline in occupancy, but has received more government financial support. NHI's management team and Board have significant experience in crisis management and the company has a strong balance sheet and liquidity, which provides a stable foundation during this challenging time.
