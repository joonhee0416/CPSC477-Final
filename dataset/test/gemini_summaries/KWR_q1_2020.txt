Quaker Chemical reported a 10% growth in pro forma adjusted EBITDA to $60 million for Q1, primarily driven by integration savings and cost control measures implemented amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The company experienced a 4% sales decline from COVID-19 and a 1% decline due to Boeing's 737 MAX production halt, offset by a 2% organic volume growth due to gained market share. Despite a $38 million non-cash impairment charge, the company increased its estimated synergy achievement for 2020 to $53 million and for 2022 to $75 million. Quaker Chemical also reduced non-essential expenses, paused hiring, implemented pay cuts, and furloughed some positions to combat lower volumes. Additionally, the company reported a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38, impacted by additional shares issued in the combination, but up sequentially from $1.34 in Q4 2019. Despite the pandemic, Quaker Chemical's pro forma trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA increased to $239 million, and its net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio improved. The company remains optimistic about its ability to navigate the crisis due to realized cost synergies and a history of generating strong cash flow during downturns.
