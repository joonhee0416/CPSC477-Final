In Q3, Booz Allen Hamilton faced revenue growth challenges due to COVID-19 impacts, funding delays, and lower staff availability. However, despite a 6.6% revenue increase to $2 billion, the growth was slower than anticipated. Nevertheless, the company delivered strong bottom line results, maintaining its commitment to invest in its workforce and business growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose 8% to $222 million, driven by contract performance, cost management, and a return to billing for fee within Intel. Despite cash flow challenges, Booz Allen's balance sheet remains strong, and the company announced a quarterly dividend increase to $0.43 per share. Looking forward, the company updated its fiscal year 2022 guidance, with expected revenue growth of 5.7% to 7.2% and reaffirmed adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance within a range of $4.10 to $4.30. The company remains confident in its long-term investment thesis, aiming to increase adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025.
