The company's unique investment strategy continues to generate solid earnings, with Q2 FFO per share of $0.58 exceeding guidance and driven by same-property results. NOI from real estate operations and AFFO both increased significantly year-over-year, driven by strong leasing activity. Development leasing remains on track to meet the company's 1 million square foot growth goal for the year. Despite the loss of a tenant at Redstone Gateway, there is significant interest from potential new tenants, highlighting the demand for space at the park. The company's portfolio is performing well, with occupancy expected to remain at 90-92% for the year. The company has also recently formed a joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate, selling two data center shells and generating $107 million in proceeds, reflecting the value created through its development efforts. The company has raised its full-year FFO guidance range to $2.24-$2.28, implying growth of 6.6% at the midpoint, driven by accelerated development completions. The company's strong operating portfolio, balance sheet, and reliable development program continue to drive growth and create value for shareholders.
