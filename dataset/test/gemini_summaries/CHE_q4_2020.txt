Chemed's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings were impacted by the pandemic, particularly for its VITAS Healthcare segment. Despite an increase in total admissions, VITAS' average daily census declined due to disruptions in senior housing occupancy, affecting nursing home referrals. As a result, VITAS' revenue is estimated to decline by approximately 4% in 2021, while its adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to be 19.4%. Roto-Rooter, however, is forecasted to achieve revenue growth of approximately 5-6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26%. Overall, Chemed estimates its adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2021 to be in the range of $17.00 to $17.50, excluding certain non-cash expenses and discrete items, representing a decline from the reported adjusted earnings per share of $18.08 in 2020.
