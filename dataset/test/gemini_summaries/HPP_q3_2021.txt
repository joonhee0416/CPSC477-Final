Hudson Pacific Properties' strong third-quarter performance reflects the advantages of its focus on top-tier markets and investment in its portfolio. Same-property NOI grew robustly, driven by rent payments and deferred rent repayment from office and studio tenants. Positive leasing activity continues, with a shift towards new and expansion deals rather than short-term renewals. The company executed major acquisitions in London and Los Angeles, expanding its studio platform. Notably, Hudson Pacific maintained excellent rent collections (99% overall, 100% for office and studio tenants) and earned a 5-star GRESB Green Star rating for its ESG efforts. The company's liquidity remains strong, with no material maturities until 2023. Guidance for the full year was narrowed to $1.95 to $1.99 per diluted share, excluding specified items, with a fourth-quarter guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50 per diluted share, also excluding specified items.
