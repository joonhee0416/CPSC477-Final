Lazard reported record Q2 and first-half revenue, driven by strong advisory and asset management performance. Advisory revenue increased 61% to $471 million, with M&A transactions and private equity activity remaining high. Asset Management revenue reached an all-time high of $343 million, primarily due to higher management fees and incentive fees. As of June 30th, AUM reached $277 billion, a 29% increase from the same period last year. Despite investing for growth, Lazard maintained cost discipline, with an adjusted non-compensation ratio of 14.5%. The company expects strong cash flow to support ongoing share repurchases. The macroeconomic environment remains favorable, with governments and businesses remaining confident in the long-term outlook. Lazard believes its advisory business is well-positioned to capitalize on this demand, while its Asset Management business benefits from low interest rates and investor demand for alternative investments. The company continues to invest in people, capabilities, and technology to enhance its competitive edge.
