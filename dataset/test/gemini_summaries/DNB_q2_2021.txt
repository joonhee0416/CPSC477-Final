Dun & Bradstreet reported strong second-quarter results, with adjusted revenues growing 24.4% to $521 million. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, driven by international growth and low single-digit growth in North America. International revenues surged 147% due to the Bisnode acquisition and organic growth across markets. Earnings per share came in at $0.25 on an adjusted basis, and the company has raised its capital expenditure guidance due to the purchase of its new headquarters. Dun & Bradstreet has witnessed strong sales for its new solutions, a rise in the New Product Vitality Index to 6%, and increased demand for its sales and marketing solutions due to its digital asset focus. The company remains optimistic about its prospects, expecting organic revenue growth to continue accelerating and adjusted EBITDA to increase by 18% to 20% for the full year.
