Packaging Corporation of America reported a fourth-quarter 2020 net income of $124 million, or $1.30 per share. Excluding special items, the company's net income reached $127 million, or $1.33 per share. The Packaging segment remained strong, with all-time record sales volumes and a 20% margin. However, higher freight expenses, lower prices, and mix impacted the Paper segment. Despite these challenges, lower operating and other costs contributed to a $0.01 reduction. Looking ahead, the company anticipates continued strong demand in its Packaging segment, coupled with price increases and higher export prices. However, offsetting factors include rising labor costs, energy expenses, and recycled fiber prices. The company emphasizes the uncertain impact of the pandemic and ongoing market conditions on its first-quarter guidance.
