Teledyne recorded remarkable financial performance in 2020, achieving record earnings, operating margin, and cash flow. Despite COVID-19 challenges, free cash flow increased 39.1% to $547.5 million. Heading into 2021, demand has improved with record orders and backlog, driving an expected organic growth of 5-6%. The pending acquisition of FLIR is seen as a strategic move, complementing Teledyne's infrared imaging technologies and expanding market segments. In the Instrumentation segment, electronic test and measurement systems saw a quarterly record, while the Digital Imaging segment recorded a 407 basis point increase in operating margin. Aerospace and Defense faced challenges in commercial aerospace sales, while Engineered Systems exhibited growth. Management projects earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.60 for Q1 2021 and $11.25 to $11.45 for the full year, excluding the impact of the FLIR acquisition.
