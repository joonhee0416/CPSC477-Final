In 2020, FR delivered strong portfolio performance with high occupancy levels and 13.5% cash rental rate growth, the second-highest in company history. They capped off the year with a 95.7% year-end occupancy, driven by leasing at developments and early tenant occupancy in Southern California. FR signed leases for 54% of their 2021 rollovers at a 13% cash rental rate increase, aligned with the 10-14% increase expected for the year. Despite COVID-related concerns, FR has taken care of their last material accounts receivable exposure related to their watchlist. Notably, they signed a long-term lease for 100% of their First Cypress Creek Commerce Center in South Florida for a 6.6% stabilized cash yield. FR's net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 4.8 times, and their NAREIT FFO guidance for 2021 is $1.85 to $1.95 per share, assuming 95.5-96.5% year-end average in-service occupancy and 3-4% cash same-store NOI growth before termination fees.
