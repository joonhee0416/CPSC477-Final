Pinnacle West Capital Corporation's 2020 earnings expectations remain within the $4.75 to $4.95 per share range. The company's long-term rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7%, with an expected weather-normalized consolidated earned return on average common equity of over 9.5%. Pinnacle West's focus areas include clean energy, affordability, reliability, and customer focus. By 2050, the company aims to deliver 100% clean carbon-free energy, with a near-term target of 65% clean energy by 2030. To support affordability, the company plans to issue $300-$400 million in equity sometime after 2020. Economic development in Arizona, cost reduction, and access to low-cost capital will further contribute to affordability. The company anticipates strong customer base growth, driven by commercial data centers, manufacturing plants, and residential population growth.
