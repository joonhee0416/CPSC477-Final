The company's proven business model has led to solid earnings performance and stable revenue year-to-date, resulting in raised full-year revenue and earnings targets. Despite COVID-19's impact, the company's diverse portfolio and broad channel diversity offset impacted categories and drove triple-digit growth in e-commerce. Gross margin remained stable at approximately 58%, and advertising and marketing are expected to be below 15% of sales for the full year. Diluted EPS increased by 15% over the first nine months due to lower operating costs, interest expense, and share count. The company generated $159.2 million in free cash flow for the first nine months and expects to meet or exceed prior-year levels for the full year. With $1.5 billion in net debt, the company is prioritizing debt paydown but has opportunistically paused to capitalize on low interest rates for a potential bond refinancing. Revised guidance estimates include revenue of approximately $935 million and adjusted EPS of $3.22 for Fiscal 2021. The company remains optimistic about its long-term strategy and expects to continue mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth driven by its solid financial profile and disciplined capital allocation.
