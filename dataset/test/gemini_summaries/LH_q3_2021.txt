Drug Development had a strong recovery with 85% of sites reopened and a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34.

Full-year guidance has been raised, with revenue expected to grow 13%-14%, adjusted earnings per share estimated between $26-$28, and free cash flow projected at $2.45-$2.6 billion. The company remains committed to supporting the pandemic response, driving profitable Base Business growth, and returning capital to shareholders through acquisitions and share repurchases.
