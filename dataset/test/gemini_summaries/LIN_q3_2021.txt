Linde's third quarter marked another strong performance, despite market challenges. Operating cash flow and return on capital reached record highs, while the project backlog nearly doubled to $13.4 billion, solidifying the company's foundation for long-term growth. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, underlying sales grew 11% year-over-year, driven by broad-based volume growth. The operating margin of 23.6% remained above 2020 levels, supported by continued pricing adjustments and disciplined cost management. EPS increased by 27% to $2.73, reflecting higher volumes and prices. Linde's strong cash generation of $2.6 billion and access to low-cost debt enable it to maintain its shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies, including significant dividends and stock repurchases. Despite seasonal declines, the company raised its full-year guidance to $10.52-$10.62, representing a growth rate of 28%-29% over 2020 and 43%-45% over 2019. The leadership transition from Steve Angel to Sanjiv Lamba will ensure a seamless execution of Linde's strategy for continued industry-leading performance.
