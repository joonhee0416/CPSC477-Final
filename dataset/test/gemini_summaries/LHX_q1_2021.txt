L3Harris Technologies reported strong Q1 results with 2% organic revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit growth in core government businesses. Despite COVID-19 impacts on commercial businesses, the company anticipates stability in affected businesses going forward. Margins expanded significantly, leading to a 14% increase in earnings per share to $3.18, exceeding internal targets. Free cash flow of $630 million supported shareholder returns of over $900 million, including $700 million in share repurchases. Despite COVID-related impacts in the commercial aviation and military training businesses, the company is confident in a return to growth in its Aviation Systems segment. Management expects strong program execution and cost performance to contribute to margin expansion and a likely shift towards the upper end of the previously announced 18% to 18.5% margin range. The company remains committed to its goal of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, with plans for significant capital returns, including $2.3 billion in share repurchases and the use of over $1 billion in divestiture proceeds.
