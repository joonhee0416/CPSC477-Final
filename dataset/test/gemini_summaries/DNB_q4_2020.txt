Dun & Bradstreet's strong 2020 performance was capped by a solid Q4, with 1.8% revenue growth (3.5% on a constant-currency basis), excluding lower deferred revenue. Adjusted revenue increased 11% (10.5% on a constant-currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA rose 32%. Total company revenue retention was 96%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, with 36% of business now under multi-year contracts. Strategic account revenue retention remained high at 99.8%, and revenues with these customers grew 3%. Dun & Bradstreet also made progress in the government, field sales, small and medium business, and international channels. Significant investments in technology, including Project Ascent, and enhanced global solutions have prepared the company for future growth. The acquisition of Bisnode is expected to significantly expand Dun & Bradstreet's European footprint and generate annualized run-rate savings of $40 million by the end of 2022. Financial flexibility has improved due to lowered leverage and increased cash flow, resulting in more than $175 million in annualized dividend and interest expense savings. Dun & Bradstreet expects continued momentum in 2021, with adjusted revenue growth of 23.5% to 25% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.5% to 19.5%. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06.
