Centene reported Q3 revenue of $32.4 billion, HBR of 88.1%, and adjusted EPS of $1.26, driven by a stable Medicaid membership and strong Medicare growth. Despite COVID-related expenses, the company's performance remains strong, supporting its value creation plan. Organizational changes include Sarah London's appointment as Vice Chairman and Brent Layton as President and COO. The portfolio is performing well, with continued growth in Medicaid and Medicare. Advanced premium tax credits are expected to mitigate costs for members transitioning from Medicaid to the marketplace. For 2022, Centene projects modest adjusted EPS growth, citing factors such as the RFP pipeline, Medicare expansion, marketplace opportunities, and the COVID landscape. The company is committed to achieving an investment-grade rating and disciplined capital allocation, prioritizing business investments, debt management, and share repurchases. Centene emphasizes the importance of vaccine mandates for mitigating COVID transmission and protecting vulnerable populations.
