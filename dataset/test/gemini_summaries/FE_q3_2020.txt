FirstEnergy reported a strong third quarter with favorable weather driving earnings above guidance, and reaffirmed its earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2020. The company's distribution revenues increased due to higher residential usage and capital investment rider revenue, offsetting declines in commercial and industrial load. However, recent leadership changes following a DOJ investigation and board review may introduce uncertainty to future financial results. In response, FirstEnergy is taking tactical financial measures such as holding its dividend at current levels, targeting flat operating expenses in 2021, and reassessing capital programs. Despite the investigation, the company remains committed to its regulated growth strategy and its long-term CAGR of 5% to 7% through 2023.
