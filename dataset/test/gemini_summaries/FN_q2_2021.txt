In Q2, the company achieved record revenue of $453.8 million, exceeding guidance and sequential growth. Automotive programs, particularly LIDAR, were the key growth drivers, with revenue doubling from a year ago. Industrial laser revenue remained steady, while optical communications experienced modest growth due to ongoing telecom strength offsetting datacom softness. Gross and operating margins improved, leading to record earnings per share of $1.10. Looking ahead to Q3, the company anticipates continued growth across all key areas, with total revenue estimated between $455 million and $475 million and non-GAAP earnings per share expected to range from $1.10 to $1.17. This optimism stems from momentum in automotive programs, increased telecom demand, and a faster-than-expected Cisco optical transport systems program transfer, leading to a substantial expansion in manufacturing capacity to meet future growth.
