With sales slightly exceeding 2020 levels at $2.3 billion, the company reported increased earnings per share in Q1. Diluted EPS reached $3.68, while adjusted EPS came in at $3.56. New contract awards totaled $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of $49 billion, of which $25 billion is funded. The company recently completed the sale of its oil and gas business and contributed its San Diego shipyard to Titan Acquisition Holdings, focusing its Technical Solutions operations on areas of strength. Despite a decline in Technical Solutions revenue due to divestitures, the segment improved operating income through enhanced performance. While overall net earnings decreased slightly compared to 2020, the company remains confident in its long-term outlook and expects to maintain shipbuilding operating margins within the 7-8% range for the remainder of 2021.
