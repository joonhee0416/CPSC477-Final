Greenhill reported its best quarterly revenue ever at $140.7 million in Q4, resulting in net income of $2.71 per share, which exceeded analyst estimates for the next five quarters combined. For the year, revenue was $311.7 million with a significant 202% increase in earnings per share to $1.36. The strong results were driven by increased M&A and restructuring completion fees, as well as favorable accounting rules. Notably, the company's restructuring business and a broader range of financing advisory services also contributed to growth. Looking ahead, Greenhill anticipates meaningful revenue growth in 2021 due to a favorable economic outlook, coupled with disciplined cost management. The company's strategic focus remains on expanding its revenue sources, with plans to enhance its advisory role for financial sponsors, broaden its private capital advisory services, and further develop its restructuring team.
