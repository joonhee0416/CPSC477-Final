Prologis reported a strong fourth quarter and full-year 2021, driven by record-high rent and occupancy levels. Core FFO grew 14% year-over-year, excluding promotes, with cash same-store NOI growth remaining strong at 7.5%. The company's strategic capital business continues to drive significant value, with third-party equity raised totaling $4.4 billion in 2021. Prologis has a large development runway of $26 billion, supported by a strong operating environment, and expects to continue its exceptional growth trajectory in the future. For 2022, the company forecasts core FFO to range between $5.00 and $5.10 per share, including $0.55 of net promote income. The company expects to benefit from continued strong demand, with rent growth forecast at 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally. Prologis's low cost of capital, unmatched scale, and focus on organic growth position the company well for sector-leading growth in the years to come.
