Watsco reported a record-breaking second quarter, with earnings per share soaring 64% to $3.71, and sales surging 36% to $1.85 billion. Gross profits jumped 50%, and operating margins expanded a remarkable 220 basis points to 11.7%. The company's advanced technologies continue to drive growth, with active users experiencing higher growth rates and lower attrition compared to non-users. Watsco's acquisition of TEC and Acme has been a success, and the company is actively seeking further acquisitions in the fragmented $50 billion North American market. Despite its growth, Watsco maintains a strong financial position with minimal debt, ensuring ample capacity for continued expansion.
