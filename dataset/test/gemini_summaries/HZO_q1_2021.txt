MarineMax reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding last year's record-breaking figures. Same-store sales surged over 20%, driven by a 35% increase in new unit growth. Notably, growth was seen across all brands, categories, and regions. The acquisition of SkipperBud's contributed to the solid gross margin performance, which also benefited from increases in product margins and growth in storage, service, and charter operations. Despite additional borrowings for Skipper's inventory, short-term borrowings declined significantly, reflecting reduced inventories and increased cash generation. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with impressive metrics like a current ratio of 1.74 and a tangible net worth of $339 million. Guided by industry estimates and its own outperformance, MarineMax raised its annual same-store sales growth guidance to the high single digits. Consequently, earnings per share guidance was increased to $4.00-$4.20, excluding potential future acquisitions. The positive momentum from the first quarter continues into January, with positive same-store sales and a higher backlog. MarineMax remains optimistic as it enters the peak selling season, leveraging its strong team culture, growth strategy, and focus on long-term shareholder value creation.
