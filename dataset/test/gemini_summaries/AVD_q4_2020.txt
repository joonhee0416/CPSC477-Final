American Vanguard Corporation experienced a strong fourth quarter in 2020, with net sales increasing by 8% to $141 million from $131 million the previous year. The company's US crop sales increased by 19% due to strong demand for products sold into the Midwest row crop market. International sales also grew by 15%, partially attributed to new sales from recently acquired businesses. Overall gross margin remained steady at 36%. Despite pandemic-related challenges, the company managed to maintain manufacturing activity at relatively normal levels, with factory costs amounting to approximately 2.8% of sales. Operating expenses increased slightly due to the addition of new businesses and increased spending on marketing and legal expenses. Despite these increases, the company reported a significant increase in net income for the three-month period, more than twice the level reported in the same period of 2019. For the full year 2020, American Vanguard's business revenues remained relatively stable compared to 2019. The company generated $89 million from operations, which is approximately nine times the average of the prior two years. This cash was used to invest in two businesses, make a strategic equity investment, and pay down debt. The company's balance sheet and liquidity have improved, with an increase in availability at December 31, 2020 to $85 million. American Vanguard is optimistic about 2021, expecting a low double-digit year-over-year revenue increase and a significant percentage increase in net income.
