For Q1 2020, Warrior Met Coal reported a GAAP net income of $22 million, or $0.42 per share, down from $110 million, or $2.14 per share, in Q1 2019. Adjusted net income was $20 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to $2.30 per share last year. These declines were primarily attributed to a 31% decrease in net selling prices and a 13% reduction in sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA also dropped significantly, from $181 million in Q1 2019 to $62 million in Q1 2020. Despite these challenges, the company's low and variable cost structure still resulted in high margins. Due to the uncertainties brought by COVID-19, Warrior Met Coal has withdrawn its 2020 guidance and implemented cost-saving measures such as delaying the Blue Creek project and suspending stock repurchases. Nevertheless, the company maintains a strong balance sheet and liquidity and is confident in its long-term growth potential.
