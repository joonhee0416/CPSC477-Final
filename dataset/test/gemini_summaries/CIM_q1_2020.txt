Chimera Investment experienced market instability in Q1 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a $2.08 GAAP loss per share and a decline in book value to $12.45 per share. Despite this, core earnings remained positive at $0.57 per share. To mitigate risks, the company sold residential agency pass-throughs and reduced leverage to 2.2 times, a significant decrease from 3.4 times at year-end. Liquidity remains strong with approximately $650 million in cash and unencumbered assets, supplemented by a $374 million convertible bond offering. Chimera remains cautiously optimistic, anticipating opportunities for investment as the economic crisis subsides.
