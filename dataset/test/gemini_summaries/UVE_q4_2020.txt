Despite facing record-setting weather events in 2020, the company experienced 14.2% growth in total revenue, driven by a 21.9% increase in direct premiums written. Rate increases in Florida and other states, as well as strong premium growth outside of Florida, contributed to this growth. However, weather-related claims and increased reinsurance costs impacted results, leading to a GAAP loss per share of $0.57 and a non-GAAP adjusted loss per share of $0.84 for the fourth quarter. Despite these challenges, the company maintained a resilient balance sheet and secured approximately 75% of its first-event reinsurance capacity for June 1, 2021. For 2021, the company's guidance projects a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share range between $2.75 and $3.00, assuming no extraordinary weather events. The guidance also assumes a flat equity market.
