Maximus, a government services provider, announced financial results for fiscal 2021 and guidance for fiscal 2022. Revenue increased primarily due to COVID response work and acquisitions. The company expects fiscal 2022 revenue between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion, driven by full-year contributions from recent acquisitions and normalized organic growth. Excluding amortization expenses, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be $5.07 to $5.37, with a slower start in the first half due to delayed core program recoveries and start-up contracts. Despite this, the company anticipates a strong second half and solid earnings exit rate. The company has a robust pipeline of opportunities, with a total contract value of $33.9 billion. Ongoing ESG commitments continue to be a priority, as evidenced by the company's MSCI BBB rating and progress on its ESG materiality assessment. Maximus remains optimistic about the future, with a refreshed strategy initiative underway to drive organic growth, accelerate digital transformation, and expand into adjacent markets.
