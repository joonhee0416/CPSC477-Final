Clorox reported a strong start to fiscal year 2021, with a 27% increase in sales driven by double-digit organic growth across most business segments. Notably, the Health and Wellness segment saw a 28% increase due to continued high demand for disinfecting products. The Household segment also performed well, with 39% growth driven by grilling sales and increased sales of Glad products, including the successful launch of Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags. Internationally, sales grew 18% due to ongoing demand for disinfecting products and other household essentials. Gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 48%, driven by cost savings and favorable mix. The company raised its fiscal year 2021 sales growth outlook to 5-9% and now expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.70 to $7.95, reflecting continued momentum and investments in long-term growth initiatives. However, the company continues to face ongoing challenges in meeting unprecedented demand for certain products, which remains a focus area for management.
