Revenue increased 7.3% in Q1 compared to the same period last year, driven by gains in both defense and aerospace segments. Notably, aerospace revenue surpassed expectations by $200 million due to increased deliveries of G500 and G600 aircraft. However, the operating margin for aerospace declined due to lower margins and higher corporate expenses. The company experienced a strong order quarter, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3:1 for aerospace, driven by accelerated sales activity. Despite challenges in some service areas, the G500 and G600 aircraft continue to perform well, and the G700 is on track for entry into service in Q4 2022. The company expects the second quarter to be challenging from a delivery perspective but anticipates rapid improvement in the third and fourth quarters. Cash flow improved in Q1, resulting in a net debt reduction of $1.3 billion year-over-year. The company also announced a dividend increase and share repurchase activity. Backlog increased by 4.5% to $89.6 billion, while total estimated contract value reached $131.4 billion. Overall, the company had a solid first quarter, with revenue and order activity exceeding expectations.
