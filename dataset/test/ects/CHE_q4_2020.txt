Before we begin, let me remind you that the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
In addition, management may also discuss non-GAAP operating performance results during today's call, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter and David, Nick will follow up with additional operating detail.
Operating during a pandemic has been exceptionally challenging for both of our business segments.
Fortunately, VITAS and Roto-Rooter have shown incredible speed, flexibility, and focus to remain completely open and operate safely for the benefit of our patients, customers and employees.
I believe Chemed's operational and financial performance this past year is a testament to the success of these efforts.
Our VITAS Healthcare segment continues to be directly impacted by the pandemic.
Fortunately, the federal government, specifically HHS and CMS have been very supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our entire patient census.
The most complex issue facing VITAS over the past nine months has been the disruptive impact the pandemic has had on traditional hospice referral sources, which in turn has impacted our patient census patterns.
Fortunately, the portions of the healthcare continuum have not -- certain portions have normalized and hospital referral admissions have significantly improved from low-admission rates experienced early in the pandemic.
This is reflected in our second half of 2020 admission and census activity.
Our third and fourth quarter 2020 admissions increased 4.7% and 2.8% respectively.
Normally, two sequential quarters of solid admissions growth would result in an increase in average daily census.
However, despite the admissions growth, our average daily census declined 2.8% in the fourth quarter.
This decline in census is a direct result of disruption in senior housing, which includes nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.
Senior housing is an important referral network for the hospice industry, given the fact that over 90% of all half of those patients are over the age of 65.
Senior housing has seen a severe reduction in occupancy levels and continues to struggle even as hospitals and other key hospice referral sources have significantly recovered.
Hospice referred admissions typically account for 50% of VITAS' total admissions and a significant portion of these referrals have very short length of stays.
VITAS hospital referrals are returning to pre-pandemic levels.
This is reflected in hospital generated admissions increasing 6.2% and 7.4% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.
Nursing home hospice patients represented 14.7% of our fourth quarter 2020 census, a decline of 310 basis points when compared to the prior year.
VITAS nursing home admissions decreased 22.6% in the third quarter of 2020 and declined 19.3% in the fourth quarter when compared to the equivalent prior year quarter.
Nursing home base patients are -- referred to hospice earlier into a terminal prognosis and statistically have a much greater probability of being in hospice more than 90 days.
This decline in nursing home admissions is a direct result of continued disruption in the senior housing occupancy.
According to data provided by the National Investment Center for Senior Housing & Care, COVID-19 continues to adversely affect senior housing occupancy, which reached another record low in October of 2020.
Median length of stay in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 14 days, two days less than the prior year.
This unusual decline in median length of stay is a result of a 7.4% increase in hospital referred admissions and a 19.3% decrease in nursing home admissions.
The combination of which has had a material impact on our median length of stay.
We anticipate improv...
...ecord low in October of 2020.
This reduced occupancy in senior housing has had a corresponding reduction in VITAS nursing home admissions.
Nursing home patients represented 14.7% of the VITAS fourth quarter 2020 patient census, which is our 310 basis point reduction when compared to the prior-year quarter.
VITAS anticipates continued weak occupancy and corresponding weak referrals from senior housing for the first half of 2021.
This guidance anticipates senior housing will begin to normalize to pre-pandemic occupancy starting in the second half of the calendar year 2021.
Based upon the above discussion, VITAS' 2021 revenue prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to decline approximately 4% when compared to the prior year.
VITAS' average daily census in 2021 is estimated to decline approximately 5% and full-year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 19.4%.
And we are currently estimating $10 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations in calendar year 2021.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5% to 6% and Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 is estimated to be 26%.
Based upon this discussion, the full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock option exercises, cost related to litigation and other discrete items is estimated to be in the range of $17 to $17.50.
This 2021 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate and adjusted earnings of 24.7%.
And this compares to Chemed's 2020 reported adjusted earnings per diluted shares of $18.08.
In the fourth quarter, our average daily census was 18,718 patients, a decline of 2.8% over the prior year.
As Kevin discussed earlier, this decline in average daily census is a direct result of the disruptions across the entire healthcare system that impacted traditional admission patterns in the hospice since March.
While certain healthcare sectors have shown improvement in the admission patterns, referrals from senior housing, specifically nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, continue to be negatively impacted.
It is important to note, in the fourth quarter, we saw the sequential decline of senior housing segments, specifically nursing homes and ALFs moderate to actually show a slight improvement as compared to the 2020 third quarter total admissions for the senior housing segment.
ADC growth is expected to normalize in the second half of 2021 as we return to pre-pandemic referral patterns across all sectors of the healthcare industry.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, total admissions were 17,960, this is a 2.8% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter, our home-based pre-admit admissions increased 9.2%.
Hospital-directed admissions expanded 7.4%.
Nursing home admins declined 19.3% and assisted-living facility admissions declined 14.7% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Average length of stay in the quarter was 97.2 days, this compares to 95.2 days in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 97.1 days in the third quarter of 2020.
Our median length of stay was 14 days in the quarter, which is two days less than the 16-day median in the fourth quarter of 2019 and equal to the third quarter of 2020.
Needless to say, 2020 was an unprecedented year where our organizational flexibility, leadership and commitment to our patients, their families, our referring healthcare partners, and one another was tested unlike anything we've ever experienced.
I couldn't be more proud of every VITAS team member who stepped up to these challenges to help provide access and incredible care, while producing these results for our shareholders.
Our entire team will continue to be out in the communities we serve, collaborating safely with our local healthcare partners to successfully identify and navigate patients and their families onto the hospice benefit during this unprecedented time.
I will now open this teleconference to questions.
