I am Patrick Suehnholz, Greenhill's Head of Investor Relations.
Joining me on the call today is Scott Bok, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
These statements are based on our current expectations regarding future events that, by their nature, are outside of the firm's control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
We reported fourth quarter revenue of $140.7 million, which was our best quarterly performance ever, an operating margin of 57% and net income of $2.71 per share.
For the year, we had revenue of $311.7 million, an operating margin of 18% and net income of $1.36 per share.
Our quarterly revenue was up 32% and earnings per share was up 158% from the same period last year.
For the full year, our revenue was up 4% and earnings per share was up 202% from the prior year.
In sum, we had a very strong finish to the year, resulting in very respectable pandemic year results on the top and bottom line, all consistent with our commentary on the past couple of quarterly investor calls.
Clearly, quarterly revenue, of the scale we achieved requires a lot of things to go right.
We generated multiple, very significant M&A completion fees, multiple very significant restructuring completion fees and a long list of smaller fees to go with them.
We also benefited more than usual from accounting rules in relation to revenue recognition that came into effect a few years ago and sometimes require revenue from completion fees to be booked before the transaction triggering that fee is fully completed.
But just to make clear that our very strong quarter was not simply a matter of transaction timing, our earnings per share for the quarter was greater than the analyst consensus forecast for the fourth quarter and the next four quarters ahead combined.
In other words, our profit in one quarter exceeded what was expected for five quarters.
Looking at our full year results.
We benefited from particularly strong results from our European M&A business and our U.S. restructuring business.
We also benefited from an expanding array of financing advisory roles that are neither traditional M&A nor traditional restructuring.
Our private capital advisory business made a meaningful contribution as well, albeit considerably less so than in the prior year.
Our revenue for the year was highly concentrated in a few busy areas, as many regions and sectors were heavily impacted by the pandemic and related constraints in economic activity and thus produced only modest revenue.
Importantly, we see nearly all of those areas has poised for significant improvement in 2021, given current market conditions and what we can see in our pipeline of assignments.
Turning to our costs.
Our compensation ratio for the year was 62%, moderately above our target level as we invested much of our non-compensation savings in rewarding our strong performers in what was the challenging year for all.
For the quarter, the compensation ratio was unusually low, as we work to achieve a reasonable full-year cost level.
We did similarly in last year's fourth quarter.
As noted in the past, we will have some quarterly volatility, but aim to manage annual compensation cost to a target level.
Our non-compensation costs were down 18% from the prior year, despite the fact that we incurred rent expense on two New York headquarters locations for much of the year as we built out new space.
Some of those cost savings flowed from reduced travel due to pandemic-related restrictions, and we believe those cost savings will continue for much of this year.
Even after that, we expect to have considerably lower travel expense than we had historically.
Separate from travel, our cost savings resulted from a...
...2021 in what feels like a favorable environment for our business.
With respect to M&A, a positive economic outlook, driven by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, combined with high stock prices, low borrowing costs, very substantial dry powder of private equity funds, a plethora of special-purpose acquisition companies looking for deals, and a variety of other factors should drive increased deal activity.
In particular, we expect increased M&A revenue in most of our international offices as well as in the certain sectors like industrials, where activity was low in 2020.
At the same time, while restructuring activity has cooled considerably from 2020's frenetic pace, more debt restructuring should be needed for the many industries and companies adversely affected by the continuing pandemic.
In addition, we are seeing significant opportunity to advise on various kinds of debt and equity financings and expect those assignments to provide a meaningful part of our near-term revenue.
In sum, we would be very disappointed if we fail to generate meaningful revenue growth in 2021.
And given our expectations of lower cost, higher revenue should result in margin expansion and increased earnings.
I will now make a few comments on our strategy.
Our overarching objective is to increase the scale, diversity and consistency of our revenue sources, while maintaining appropriate discipline on expenses.
As always, we will look to recruit M&A bankers who bring us incremental industry sector expertise or regional capabilities.
We have an active pipeline of good prospects in that regard.
With respect to restructuring advice, we see our strategic initiative of the past few years to significantly expand our team as a major success but we believe, there remains the potential to expand even further.
In particular, we want to play more advisory roles on debt and equity financing transactions.
We've had increasing success in broadening the range of transactions on which we advice and we see this as an opportunity that will continue even in periods where there's much less bankruptcy-related activity than we have seen off-late.
In our private capital advisory business, we have strong teams in Europe and Asia, and are in the process of rebuilding in the U.S., with an increased focus on higher value-added transactions.
In terms of strategic initiatives, we are aiming to enhance our focus on advising financial sponsors on a wide variety of transactions.
Historically, we focused heavily on serving public companies and we've enjoyed great success with that constituency, However, over time, we came to realize though we've had increasing interaction with financial sponsors across our M&A, restructuring and private capital advisory businesses.
We are now aiming to organize those efforts in a more systematic way designed to generate more revenue and we have already put significant resources into this initiative.
We are hopeful that it will be at least as successful as the restructuring advisory team expansion, that was our primary strategic focus over the last couple of years.
In closing, I want to mention two landmark events in the life of our firm.
First, this week, we are opening our new headquarters in the newly renovated Rockefeller Center building on Sixth Avenue, that is known to many as the old Time Life Building.
We look forward to welcoming clients there once the pandemic is subsided.
Second, a couple of weeks ago, we passed the 25-year mark in the life of our firm.
It is obviously not the time for celebrations of any kind, but it is worth noting the fact that our firm has proven resilient through numerous challenges over that quarter of a century, the dot com bubble bursting, the September 11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis of 2008 and now a major pandemic.
Our strong culture is the source of our resilience and both our global team and our brand will emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.
With that, I'm happy to take any questions.
