Joining me virtually today, as we are all working from home, are Mary Hall, our CFO; Robert Traub, our General Counsel; and Shane Hostetter, our Head of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer.
We have slides for our conference call.
You can find them in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.
A great deal has changed in the world with the COVID-19 pandemic since our last quarter's conference call.
For us, our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers' needs.
All of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are meeting our customers' needs.
I am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continuing servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration, which has not missed a beat.
In our last conference call, we knew China was being impacted by COVID-19, which really started impacting us in February.
But in the second half of March, we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world.
And toward the end of March, many of our customers had significantly reduced production or shut down altogether, especially in the automotive sector.
Overall, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted our sales by about 4% in the first quarter.
We were also impacted by Boeing temporary halting the 737 MAX production, which impacted sales by approximately 1%.
These were the two main drivers of our volume decline in our pro forma comparisons.
We have gone through a customer-by-customer analysis to see what our gains and losses and market share were at the customer and product levels.
This analysis continues to show that we took share in the marketplace as we estimate total organic volume growth due to net share gains was approximately 2% in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year.
Concerning gross margins, you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker.
In the first quarter comparison, you can see this difference is only 0.5 percentage point.
This is indicative of our raw material savings from our integration starting to come through.
While crude was also decreasing during this period, we do not see any material benefits from this as of yet, as our raw material costs were relatively stable.
So overall, the first quarter results were somewhat better than expected when considering the COVID-19 impact.
Our first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to our integration savings, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition last quarter, and the additional cost control measures we put in place to combat the global effect of COVID-19 on our volumes.
This event has been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008.
Just like then, we took fast action to save cost in numerous ways.
Essentially, all discretionary expenses have been eliminated.
We stopped new hires, executive pay cuts were implemented, some positions were furloughed, and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30%.
And very importantly, we reviewed our integration's synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible.
We have now increased our guidance on synergy achievement.
For 2020, our new estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our previous estimate of $35 million.
And the total synergies that we estimate will be achieved by 2022 have been raised from $60 million to $75 million.
One question we have been asked about is if this pandemic has impacted our integration.
And the answer is that it really hasn't negatively impacted our integration in any way, especially in the timing.
I give our people a tremendous amount of credit for being able to do plant shutdowns, product manufacturing site transfers, and ERP implementations during these challenging work conditions that we...
...restructuring charges totaling about $10 million and a $38 million non-cash impairment charge in Q1 to reflect the writedown of our Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value.
These were recorded at fair value at close of the Combination on August 1, 2019 and tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019.
However, given the recent changes in business conditions as a result of COVID-19, we determined that these assets needed to be tested again and confirm their carrying value exceeded their current estimated fair value by approximately $38 million.
As we noted in our 10-Q, as business conditions evolve, we will continue to reevaluate all our long-lived assets as necessary.
In non-operating items, we reported a non-cash charge of $22.7 million for final settlement and termination of legacy Quaker's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, a process we previously disclosed.
The offset is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss account in the equity section of the balance sheet.
Concurrent with this termination, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million, subject to final adjustment.
Our reported effective tax rate was a benefit of 31.1% in Q1 2020 versus an expense of 26.8% in Q1 of last year.
Adjusting for all one-time charges and benefits, we estimate our ETR would have been 22% this Q1 and 24% in Q1 last year.
We currently expect our full-year ETR, excluding all one-time charges and benefits, to be between 22% and 24%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, due primarily to the additional shares issued in the Combination, partially offset by the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.
Sequentially, non-GAAP earnings per share is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019, which included Houghton and Norman Hay and the additional shares.
On Slide 9, we show the trend in pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which reached $239 million as of Q1, up from $234 million at the end of 2019.
This increase reflects the strong adjusted EBITDA performance in Q1 of $60 million, up 10% from pro forma Q1 last year of $55 million due to the inclusion of Norman Hay and the benefits of cost savings realized in the quarter from the Combination.
On Slide 10, we provide an update on our leverage and liquidity.
Please note that we drew down most of the available liquidity on our revolving credit facility in March in an abundance of caution as COVID-19 went global and created significant uncertainty and volatility in all global markets.
This drop was leverage neutral as the additional cash in our balance sheet is a direct offset to our debt.
In fact, our reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 3.40 times from our year-end level of 3.47 times as a result of good cash flow and the cost savings mentioned earlier.
Our bank covenant ratio also improved from about 2.94 at year-end to 2.76 at the end of this quarter per the definitions in our borrowing agreement.
We expect to continue to be in compliance with our bank covenants and we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times.
Our capital allocation decisions reflect these priorities, including an approximately 30% reduction in previously planned capex.
As you know, we have a very asset-light business model and we also expect a release of working capital at sales decline to generate good cash flow similar to the global crisis in 2008/2009.
Our cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates and was estimated at approximately 2.4% at March 31 versus about 3% at year-end.
As Mike mentioned, we're encouraged by the additional cost synergies realized to date and expected to be achieved overall.
The increase in expected realized synergies this year from $35 million to $53 million in addition to the cost reduction actions we have taken to address the global crisis and our history of generating good cash flow in downturn all give us confidence in our ability to weather this storm.
