Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC.
At Labcorp, we continue to leverage innovation, science and technology to accelerate our strategy as we work to improve health and improve lives around the world.
We serve as a trusted source of health information that helps customers advance healthcare and guide medical decisions.
At the same time, we've remained focused on helping the world through the pandemic.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong results.
Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.82, and free cash flow was $650 million.
As a result of our strong performance and our improved outlook, we're raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.
Glenn will cover those in more detail in a few minutes.
The Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well with 10% and 22% growth, respectively.
We saw consistent recovery across both businesses.
In Diagnostics, we experienced broad geographic recovery in our Base Business and across our testing portfolio.
Esoteric and routine testing demonstrated solid year-over-year growth for the quarter.
The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill for Drug Development remains strong at 1.34.
Drug Development continues to recover with nearly 85% of sites now open.
The business also saw decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year.
Now I'd like to turn to our ongoing role in the pandemic response.
Labcorp continues to support the fight against the pandemic in every way possible through both our diagnostic and our drug development capabilities.
We experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year.
Time to results for COVID test remains an average of one to two days, with results typically available within one day.
PCR testing volume averaged 85,000 per day in the quarter, up from 54,000 per day in the second quarter.
We averaged 114,000 tests per day in September, with volumes declining week-over-week since that time.
We will continue to break out COVID testing from Base Business revenue and volume as it remains difficult to forecast.
We will also continue to maintain high capacity levels to be prepared for potential future scenarios.
We also had another successful quarter of bringing new innovations to market.
Notably, we recently received Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit.
With flu season upon us, the kit offers a convenient way to test for both viruses.
This new offering will be available for adults and children ages two and over and no upfront cost for those who meet clinical guidelines.
In addition, we collaborated with AstraZeneca on both a COVID prevention and treatment trial of its new long-acting antibody combination.
In the trial, the investigational antibody combination demonstrated statistically significant benefit in preventing symptomatic COVID and in reducing severe COVID or death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID, promising milestones in the development of new treatments.
Also earlier this month, Merck filed for FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID in at-risk adults, a treatment that we supported through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials.
I'll now discuss progress on our strategy, and I'll start with oncology.
The OmniSeq integration is going as planned, and their leading pan-cancer diagnostic capabilities extend our portfolio of solutions in this area.
Additionally, we launched clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer.
As part of our efforts to address healthy equity -- health equity issues, we recently partnered with the Community Clinical Oncology Research...
... 19.9%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points.
This was partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its central lab business of 3.5% and divestitures of 0.3%.
Drug Development's Base Business benefited from broad-based growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic work.
Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 11.4% primarily driven by organic growth.
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $226 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $210 million or 16.9% last year.
The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings partially offset by lower COVID testing and higher personnel costs.
The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to lower COVID testing.
Excluding the impact from COVID testing, operating margins would have been up compared to last year.
For comparability to peers, Drug Development earnings exclude $36 million of expense related to the enterprise component of its bonus, which is included in unallocated corporate expense.
We expect full year margins to be up over 2020, which were up over 2019.
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.8 billion and 1.34, respectively.
During the quarter, orders were negatively impacted by approximately $150 million due to a significant scope change, which decreased the book-to-bill.
Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.4 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to last year.
We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2021, for the remainder of the year.
We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong third quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year.
We expect enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14% from prior guidance of 6.5% to 9%.
This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points.
This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 18.5% to 19.5%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 11% to down 6%.
We are raising our expectations for revenue to grow in Diagnostics by 8% to 10% from prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 2%.
This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 16% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is expected to be down 11% to down 6%.
We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 19.5% to 20.5% from prior guidance of 17% to 19%.
Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 170 basis points.
This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 21.5% to 22.5%.
Given the improved top line growth expectations, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $26 to $28, up from prior guidance of $21.5 to $25.
Free cash flow is now expected to be between $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion.
For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 third quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results.
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance.
We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our Base Business.
We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the remainder of the year.
We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs.
Operator, we will now take questions.
