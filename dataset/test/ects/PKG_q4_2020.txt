I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America.
And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief -- Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share.
Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share.
Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019.
Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.
Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs.
In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share.
Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019.
Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019.
Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020.
These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.
Looking at the Packaging business.
EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin.
For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.
Demand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all-time records.
Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder mill and utilizing the Jackson mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand.
As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end.
The machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December.
Although as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost, we were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality.
In order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard...
...ges at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020.
The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020.
The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.
As they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company, not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction.
Without question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year.
However, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed.
Our manufacturing and sales organizations continued to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes.
Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company.
I'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years.
Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter.
This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.
As Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and we expect average export prices to move higher as well.
However, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year.
Seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs.
And we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber.
Finally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower although inflation-related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit.
Shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country.
And with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve.
There continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments.
This is true not only for the operation of our facilities but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers.
As a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter.
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions.
These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.
And with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please.
