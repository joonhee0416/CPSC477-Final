Earlier today, we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics.
Organic revenue is up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about three points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations.
This should be the last quarter of tough compares due to the pandemic, which our team has managed incredibly well, and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead.
Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9%, resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets.
Free cash flow was $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program, with a balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March.
Before handing over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and L3Harris as CEO.
It's been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees.
Harris grew from a small, niche, defense company to a leading mission solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion.
I'm especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders.
The performance culture and the work environment we created is really special, and we recently were recognized for it by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021 and earlier this year as a world's most admired company.
As you know, I'll continue as exec Chair of the Board for another year, working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO.
Last week, the independent directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement, indicating their confidence and mind in Chris' ability to lead this company going forward.
The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future.
And I'm excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris' leadership.
As you heard at our investor briefing last month, we're excited about the potential for the company and the value creation opportunities in front of us.
The strategic priorities we develop together, as shown on Slide three, are the foundations on which we'll deliver sustainable top line growth, steady margin expansion and robust free cash flow with industry-leading capital returns.
All areas where we showed great progress in the first quarter.
In terms of the top line, our Q1 results, coupled with the Biden administration's announcement that the defense budget will continue to grow in FY '22, about 1.5 points versus FY '21, reinforces our optimism for growth.
We are encouraged by the continued focus on National Security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments.
This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains.
We're watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies and international expansion, which stem from our R&D investment.
In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double digits, driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and Tactical radios.
Turning to revenue synergies.
We received eight new awards, maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million.
We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards ...
...nd Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.1%.
From responsive programs, including SDA tracking in HBTSS, driving high single-digit growth in space, as well as growth from the F-35 platform in mission avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel and cyber.
The strength was partially offset by program timing and electronic warfare.
Operating income was up 8.6%, and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management including R&D timing, operational excellence and higher pension income.
Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our Space and Electronic Warfare businesses.
Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single-digit growth in Tactical Communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization.
That also drove integrated vision solutions and global communication solutions up double digits.
Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments.
And within public safety, due to anticipated COVID-related impacts, they are now showing signs of stabilization.
Operating income was up 12%, and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost of management and integration benefits.
Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter.
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID-related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training.
High single-digit growth in mission networks from higher FAA volume paired with fusing and ordinates growth in defense aviation helped to offset these effects.
As we move past the first quarter, we're anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow.
Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses.
Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% is operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing and integration benefits more than offset COVID-related headwinds.
Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter.
Let's shift over to 2021 guidance.
We're off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance, and we're confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our top line growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter.
This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full year earnings per share guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts.
We'll provide a more comprehensive update later in the year.
In the interim, I'll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping and capital returns.
On margins, this strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%.
We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D, and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins.
Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance, and will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength.
On portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures net of buybacks from proceeds.
And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divestiture process, which could have a modest incremental earnings per share impact for the year.
Lastly, as highlighted at our investor briefing.
We have another significant year planned for capital returns.
Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion in net divestiture proceeds.
So overall, for 2021, we're confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.
