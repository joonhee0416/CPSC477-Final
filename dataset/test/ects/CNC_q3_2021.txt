Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change.
Additionally, please mark your calendars for our upcoming 2022 guidance meeting to be held on December 10.
We will invite sell-side analysts to participate in person in New York, and ask others to participate virtually.
Brent Layton has a conflict that could not be avoided, but you can expect him to join us on future calls.
First, on the quarter, we were pleased with the results and the fact that the matrix was straightforward with minimum noise.
In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion and HBR of 88.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26.
Drew, provide additional context.
Overall, the numbers reflect a return to a normal utilization while still covering reasonable amounts of COVID costs which seem to have peaked in August.
Importantly, our performance provides a strong foundation for our value creation plan and we remain committed to our margin goals.
Further supporting our strategic progress during the quarter, we announced a series of organizational changes including a point Sarah London as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Brent Layton as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer.
We do not plan to replace his position, as we continue to work on refreshing and streamline the Board to a size of 9 to 13 members.
Turning to the current landscape.
Overall, the portfolio is performing well.
We delivered a strong membership increase in Medicaid are positioned for continued growth in Medicare and we continue to stay the course in marketplace.
Sarah, will provide further detail.
We are working closely with states and the timing redetermination, which has so far been extended until January with the opportunity for additional extensions three months at a time.
In addition, we look forward to offer members who will no longer qualify for Medicaid, the opportunity to enroll in our marketplace for us.
We expect that advanced premium tax credits will keep costs in line for these members, and we value the opportunity support continuity of care and preserve, provide relationships which in the long-term leads to higher quality care, which is much more cost effective.
Looking ahead of 2022, there are several additional factors we continue to monitor and evaluate.
These include the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in marketplace license, as well as the COVID landscape overall.
We will provide full details on these factors and their potential impacts, as headwinds and tailwinds at our Investor Day in December.
In addition, we are committed to achieving an investment grade rating and a disciplined capital allocation framework that takes into consideration our priorities including investing in our business debt management and share repurchases.
Before I close, I would like to highlight the importance of vaccine mandates in stopping the transmission of COVID and protecting those who cannot yet safely receive inoculations, particularly the immunologically compromised, and young children for whom vaccine access is getting closer, but still pending.
Centene has been a leader on this critical issue mandating vaccinations, as an additional employment.
We also continue to support our members in assessing the vaccine to a national outreach and campaigns and creative participation such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame NESCO.
In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results and has the same momentum across the enterprise.
We remain focused on executing across the value creation playbook, we have in place.
As always, we intend and continue to provide transparent updates, as we progress through our initiatives and I look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day.
I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan.
During the quarter we continue to build o...
...ak, as measured in authorizations compared to January 2021, it peaked and fell rather quickly.
With our diversified enterprise we were able to manage through this given our steady performance in Medicaid and Medicare.
Accordingly, we are maintaining the midpoint of our consolidated HBR range for 2021 just shrinking the width of the range since we're three quarters through the year.
Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter with higher short term variable incentive compensation costs compared to Q2 given the positive trajectory of the business.
While we are getting some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there is a lot more to come over the next few years, as we execute on the value creation plan.
One item to point out from a mix standpoint circle, a well positioned ASC like hospital enterprise and England has an SG&A rate in the '30s on service fee revenue of approximately $1.4 billion.
This has an approximate 30 basis point mathematical impact on our consolidated SG&A rate for Q3 2021 and going forward.
Continuing on the highlights of the quarter, cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $1.8 billion.
With respect to unregulated cash we had $2.7 billion at quarter end, which includes the $1.8 billion we borrowed to partially fund the Magellan transaction.
We expect to need approximately $2.3 billion of unregulated cash to close Magellan in the fourth quarter.
Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion, our debt to cap ratio was 41.2% inclusive of Magellan financing and excluding our non-recourse debt.
Our medical claims liability totaled $14.1 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 48 in Q2.
This three-day increase was driven by the timing of state-directed payments, claims payments and state fee schedule changes.
You will see a couple of items in our GAAP to adjusted earnings per share reconciliation, a $309 million one-time gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 60% of circle in early July 2021 and a write-down of our investment in RxAdvance of $229 million in the quarter, as we are simplifying our pharmacy operations, both of these are non-cash items.
Before we get to updated 2021 guidance I wanted to comment on the recently announced rating year 2022 star scores.
This will drive 2023 Medicare revenue.
We are certainly pleased with over 50% of membership in 4-star contracts and our first 5-star contract, rating year 2022 benefited from the continuation of disaster provisions due to COVID with an expectation of those provisions sunsetting and upon reviewing the in-process results of our quality program we expect rating year 2023 scores to drop, followed by a subsequent jump in rating year 2024 scores.
This essentially has the effect of providing some fungible investment dollars for calendar year 2023.
We've updated our full-year 2021 outlook including a narrowed adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.15.
This outlook incorporates revenues within a range of $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion increased by the inclusion of Circle and expected state-related pass through payments of $500 million.
It includes an expected HBR of 87.6% to 88% and then SG&A ratio of 8.2% to 8.6% 20 basis points higher than the prior guidance with the largest driver being the mix math on Circle as we just discussed.
While we still have a quarter to go to finish 2021, the strength of our diversified enterprise has enabled us to manage through the volatility of COVID, pent-up demand and resulting 2021 marketplace pressure.
This enterprise strength will only improve, as we execute on the value creation plan over the next few years.
With regards to 2022, consistent with our public comments in September, we continue to expect modest adjusted earnings per share growth next year.
We look forward to providing more details around 2022 expectations and going more in-depth into the long-term value creation drivers during our December 10 Investor Day.
