We have Scott Lauber, who's now our president and chief executive; Xia Liu, our chief financial officer; and Beth Straka, senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations.
This exceeded the upper end of our most recent guidance, which was $4.07 a share.
Our positive results were driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery in our region and our continued focus on operating efficiency.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong.
And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity.
I would also note that the earnings we're reporting today are quality earnings with no adjustments.
As you know, we've been very active in shaping the future of clean energy.
Looking back on 2021, we set some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions.
Across our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, all from a 2005 baseline.
In fact, by the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial and our plan calls for a complete exit from coal by the year 2035.
Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on achieving net-zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050.
Now we all recognize that advances in technology will be needed to decarbonize the economy by 2050.
And hydrogen, of course, could be a key player, a key part of the solution in the decades ahead.
To that end, we announced last week one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States.
We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our newer natural gas-powered units located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The project will be carried out this year, and the results will be shared across the industry to demonstrate how the use of hydrogen could materially reduce carbon emissions.
Switching gears now, we're driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest five-year plan in the company's history.
The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth.
One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2,400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next five years.
These renewable projects will serve the customers of our regulated utilities here in Wisconsin.
Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.
In summary, we believe we're poised to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer.
And now, let's take a brief look at the regional economy.
We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021 despite the prolonged pandemic.
The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate down at 2.8%; folks, that's a record low and more than a full percentage point below the national average.
Importantly, jobs in the manufacturing sectors across Wisconsin have returned to pre-pandemic levels.
And major economic development projects are moving full steam ahead.
HARIBO, the gummy bear company is now recruiting workers at its brand new campus in Pleasant Prairie.
Komatsu has begun relocating employees to its new state-of-the-art Milwaukee campus.
Milwaukee Tool's downtown office tower is set to begin operations this month, and we see more growth ahead.
For example, ABB, a global industrial and technology company; and Saputo, a leading dairy products company have announced plans for major expansions in our region.
And finally, you've heard the phrase: a rising tide lift all boats.
Well, I'm pleased to report that one of the most celebrated luxury boat makers in the world, Grand Craft Boats, is relocating its operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region.
You know, J. Lo, George Clooney, Robert Redford, they're among the high-profile clients of Grand Craft.
So it will be interesting t...
...0.10 compared to 2020.
First, weather added $0.04, mostly driven by colder winter weather conditions compared to 2020.
Second, continued economic recovery drove a $0.09 increase in earnings.
This reflected stronger weather-normalized electric sales, as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges.
Let me give you some highlights on our weather-normalized retail sales.
Overall, retail delivery of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% compared to 2020.
We saw a continued economic rebound in 2021 in our service territories.
Small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 4.4% from 2020, and large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 5.1%.
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat excluding gas used for power generation.
Lastly, rate relief and additional capital investment contributed $0.14 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M drove a $0.03 improvement.
These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.17 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a net $0.03 reduction from fuel costs and other items.
Overall, we added $0.10 year over year from utility operations.
Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company decreased $0.02 per share year over year.
The positive impact of additional capital investment was more than offset by two factors: a 2020 fourth quarter that benefited 2020 earnings and an impairment that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 on an investment outside of the ATC service territory.
This substantially wrote off all of the goodwill on the project.
Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in 2021.
This was mostly related to production tax credit from the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge wind farms.
Finally, we saw an $0.18 improvement in the corporate and other segment.
Lower interest expense contributed $0.07 year over year.
Also, we recognized a $0.04 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development.
The remaining positive variance related to improved rabbi trust performance and some favorable tax and other items.
In summary, we improved on our 2020 earnings by $0.32 per share.
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163 million.
The increase in cash earnings was more than offset by working capital requirements, mostly related to higher natural gas prices.
As we resume normal collection practices in the spring, we expect working capital to improve throughout the year.
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.4 billion in 2021.
This represents a $471 million decrease compared to 2020, due primarily to the timing of the in-service date of Thunderhead Wind Farm.
Turning now to financing activities.
We opportunistically refinanced over $450 million of holding company debt during the fourth quarter.
This reduced the average interest rate of these notes from 4.5% to 2.2%.
We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality.
Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contribution and the year-over-year increase in working capital, our FFO to debt was 15.7% in 2021.
Finally, let's look at our guidance for sales and earnings.
For weather-normalized sales in Wisconsin, we're expecting 0.5% growth this year in both our electric and natural gas businesses, continued growth after a very strong year.
In terms of 2022 earnings guidance, last year, we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter.
We project first quarter 2022 earnings to be in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.70 per share.
This forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
And as Gale stated, for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.29 to $4.33 per share.
Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.
Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.
