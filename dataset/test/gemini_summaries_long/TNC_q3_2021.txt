Tennant's Q3 earnings reflected a 4.7% increase in organic sales to $272 million, driven by strong demand and a return to pre-pandemic levels. However, supply chain disruptions and labor constraints, particularly in North America, impacted revenue growth. Despite these challenges, the company's adjusted gross margin remained stable at 40.1%. Adjusted S&A expenses improved as a percentage of sales due to cost-saving measures. Net income and earnings per share rose year-over-year, reaching $21.5 million and $1.14, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS increased to $1.33 per share. The company continued implementing its enterprise strategy, focusing on platform design, supplier flexibility, and talent acquisition. Tennant revised its full-year guidance, projecting net sales between $1.09 billion and $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.40. The ongoing supply chain and labor headwinds are expected to continue, but the company remains optimistic about meeting customer needs and executing its long-term strategy.
