Quanex Building Products reported strong first-quarter results with revenue increasing by 17.1% to $230.1 million, driven by robust demand across product lines. Net income improved significantly, reaching $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share, despite increased SG&A expenses. Adjusted net income grew to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA surged by 55.4% to $24.3 million, reflecting volume growth and operating leverage. Management raised its full-year guidance, anticipating 12% sales growth in North America and Europe and adjusted EBITDA of $112-$122 million. However, the company faces headwinds from inflationary pressures on raw materials and freight, as well as labor shortages. Strong macroeconomic conditions and continued execution of operational improvements remain key drivers of success.
