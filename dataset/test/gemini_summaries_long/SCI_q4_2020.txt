In Q4 2020, Service Corporation International (SCI) reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, surpassing estimates due to a surge in COVID-19-related deaths. Funeral volumes grew 31% in December, driving an increase in funeral revenue despite a decline in funeral sale average. Cemetery revenue also increased significantly, boosted by both at-need and preneed sales. For 2021, SCI anticipates a decline in funeral volume but mid-single-digit growth in preneed funeral sales production. Cemetery at-need revenues are expected to decrease compared to 2020's elevated levels but remain strong. Preneed cemetery sales production is projected to grow in the first half of the year but face challenges later on. Overall, SCI expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.90 in 2021, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 pull-forward and a more efficient operating platform.
