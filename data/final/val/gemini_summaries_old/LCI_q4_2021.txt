In fiscal 2021, Lannett made significant strides by launching new products, expanding partnerships, and refining its portfolio. Despite facing competition and pandemic-related impacts, the company launched key products like Levothyroxine tablets and Clarithromycin, diversifying its revenue streams and reducing its reliance on specific products.

Lannett also implemented cost-cutting measures and achieved a meaningful capital structure improvement through debt refinancing, which extended its maturity beyond key pipeline assets' launch dates and provided financial flexibility. The company's strategic alliances with HEC and Respirent have yielded promising respiratory assets, including generic ADVAIR DISKUS, Flovent Diskus, and Spiriva Handihaler, which represent multi-billion dollar markets with limited competition.

Lannett's pipeline includes 13 ANDAs pending FDA approval and several products in development. Noteworthy pipeline products include Insulin Glargine and Insulin Aspart, which are expected to launch in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and have the potential to transform the company into a $1 billion entity by 2025. The company is also exploring additional opportunities in the inhalation respiratory space and leveraging its insulin assets internationally through strategic alliances.

For fiscal 2022, Lannett anticipates a downturn in sales and profits, but maintains an optimistic outlook as it expects new product launches and pipeline advancements to mitigate competitive pressures and pandemic-related disruptions. The company forecasts adjusted EBITDA between $40 million and $55 million and plans to maintain a healthy cash position.
