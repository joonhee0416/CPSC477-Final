In 2021, Northwest Natural experienced a successful year with net income of $2.56 per share, an increase of 11% compared to 2020. This growth was driven by new rates in Oregon, solid customer growth, and higher revenues at the interstate storage business. The company's gas facility also saw positive momentum, with the average cost of natural gas remaining 30% lower than 15 years ago due to a decline in commodity costs and energy efficiency efforts. Northwest Natural also ranked second-best among large natural gas utilities in the J.D. Power Residential Customer Satisfaction Study.

Despite the increase in overall revenues, the gas utility posted a $0.15 per share decline in earnings, primarily due to higher expenses. However, the other businesses contributed an additional $0.10 per share earnings. For 2022, the company anticipates earnings per share in the range of $2.45 to $2.65, supported by continued customer growth, average weather conditions, and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies.

Looking ahead, Northwest Natural plans to invest in its gas utility with capital expenditures expected to be in the $310 million to $350 million range for system reinforcement and technology upgrades. The company also initiated a rate case in Oregon with rates effective in November of this year to recover these costs and higher forecasted expenses.

Long-term, Northwest Natural is focused on maximizing returns from its regulated gas utility and positioning for incremental long-term growth by investing in water utilities and the competitive renewable natural gas (RNG) business. The company has set a long-term earnings-per-share growth rate target of 4% to 6% from 2022 to 2027.

In terms of RNG, Northwest Natural has formed a new non-regulated subsidiary, Northwest Natural Renewables, and is committed to leading the energy transition. The company has already signed a 20-year RNG supply agreement and a total $50 million investment and expects to pursue additional RNG investments to support the energy transition and provide additional earnings and cash flow growth.

Additionally, Northwest Natural's water utility business continues to grow through acquisitions, with recent agreements signed to more than double the total number of connections. The company is excited about the investment potential for this business and expects to make more announcements soon.
