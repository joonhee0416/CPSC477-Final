Carlisle's Q4 2020 earnings report highlighted the exceptional performance of its Construction Materials (CCM) business, which accounted for over 70% of revenues and 90% of earnings. CCM's core roofing business remains strong, driven by deferred demand and growing share in new energy-efficient solutions. The addition of Polyurethane and Architectural Metals platforms provides growth opportunities in insulation and sloped roofing markets, respectively.

While revenue declined 7% in Q4 due to COVID-19 headwinds, CCM's operating margin reached a record 20.4% on solid cost management and COS. Other businesses, including Commercial Technologies (CIT), Fluid Technologies (CFT), and Brake & Friction Technologies (CBF), experienced declines due to the pandemic but are expected to recover in 2021.

Despite the challenges, Carlisle remains confident in its Vision 2025 strategy, which prioritizes investment in high-return businesses like CCM. The company's strong balance sheet, with $902 million in cash and $1 billion in credit availability, supports its capital allocation plans, including strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.

For 2021, Carlisle anticipates revenue growth of high-single digits for CCM, while CIT, CFT, and CBF are expected to experience recovery. The company remains committed to its financial targets, including an ROIC of over 15% and EPS of $15.
